Abstract: Earth observation involves collecting, analyzing, and processing an
ever-growing mass of data. Automatically harvesting information is crucial for
addressing significant societal, economic, and environmental challenges,
ranging from environmental monitoring to urban planning and disaster
management. However, the high dimensionality of these data poses challenges in
terms of sparsity, inefficiency, and the curse of dimensionality, which limits
the effectiveness of machine learning models. Dimensionality reduction (DR)
techniques, specifically feature extraction, address these challenges by
preserving essential data properties while reducing complexity and enhancing
tasks such as data compression, cleaning, fusion, visualization, anomaly
detection, and prediction. This review provides a handbook for leveraging DR
across the RS data value chain and identifies opportunities for under-explored
DR algorithms and their application in future research.

### [2] [Ninja Codes: Neurally Generated Fiducial Markers for Stealthy 6-DoF Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18976)
*Yuichiro Takeuchi,Yusuke Imoto,Shunya Kato*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Ninja Codes是神经生成的基准标记，能自然地融入真实环境，通过细微视觉修改实现隐蔽的6自由度位置追踪。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基准标记外观显眼，在美学和其他原因下不受欢迎，需要开发能隐蔽融入环境的追踪标记。

Method: 使用端到端深度学习流程，包括编码器网络将任意图像转换为Ninja Codes，通过神经隐写术方法联合训练创建和检测模块。

Result: 实验证明Ninja Codes在常见室内光照条件下能提供可靠位置追踪，同时成功隐藏在多样环境纹理中。

Conclusion: Ninja Codes在传统基准标记因外观显眼而不适用的场景中具有重要价值，支持增强现实、机器人等多种应用。

Abstract: In this paper we describe Ninja Codes, neurally-generated fiducial markers
that can be made to naturally blend into various real-world environments. An
encoder network converts arbitrary images into Ninja Codes by applying visually
modest alterations; the resulting codes, printed and pasted onto surfaces, can
provide stealthy 6-DoF location tracking for a wide range of applications
including augmented reality, robotics, motion-based user interfaces, etc. Ninja
Codes can be printed using off-the-shelf color printers on regular printing
paper, and can be detected using any device equipped with a modern RGB camera
and capable of running inference. Using an end-to-end process inspired by prior
work on deep steganography, we jointly train a series of network modules that
perform the creation and detection of Ninja Codes. Through experiments, we
demonstrate Ninja Codes' ability to provide reliable location tracking under
common indoor lighting conditions, while successfully concealing themselves
within diverse environmental textures. We expect Ninja Codes to offer
particular value in scenarios where the conspicuous appearances of conventional
fiducial markers make them undesirable for aesthetic and other reasons.

### [3] [Robust Driving QA through Metadata-Grounded Context and Task-Specific Prompts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19001)
*Seungjun Yu,Junsung Park,Youngsun Lim,Hyunjung Shim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个两阶段的自动驾驶视觉语言问答系统，通过精心设计的提示词和上下文增强，显著提升了高级感知、预测和规划问题的回答准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在解决自动驾驶场景中高级感知、预测和规划问题的视觉语言问答挑战，探索如何通过提示工程和上下文增强来提升预训练视觉语言模型在驾驶任务中的表现。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：第一阶段使用大型多模态LLM（Qwen2.5-VL-32B），输入六摄像头数据、历史时间窗口和思维链提示；第二阶段增加场景元数据和任务特定指令。使用自一致性集成提高答案可靠性。

Result: 在驾驶QA基准测试中显著优于基线模型：第一阶段使用5个历史帧和10-shot提示达到65.1%准确率（零样本为62.61%），自一致性提升至66.85%；第二阶段达到67.37%总体准确率，在严重视觉损坏下仍保持96%准确率。

Conclusion: 精心设计的提示词和上下文基础可以大幅提升预训练视觉语言模型在高级驾驶问答任务中的表现，证明了提示工程在自动驾驶应用中的重要性。

Abstract: We present a two-phase vision-language QA system for autonomous driving that
answers high-level perception, prediction, and planning questions. In Phase-1,
a large multimodal LLM (Qwen2.5-VL-32B) is conditioned on six-camera inputs, a
short temporal window of history, and a chain-of-thought prompt with few-shot
exemplars. A self-consistency ensemble (multiple sampled reasoning chains)
further improves answer reliability. In Phase-2, we augment the prompt with
nuScenes scene metadata (object annotations, ego-vehicle state, etc.) and
category-specific question instructions (separate prompts for perception,
prediction, planning tasks). In experiments on a driving QA benchmark, our
approach significantly outperforms the baseline Qwen2.5 models. For example,
using 5 history frames and 10-shot prompting in Phase-1 yields 65.1% overall
accuracy (vs.62.61% with zero-shot); applying self-consistency raises this to
66.85%. Phase-2 achieves 67.37% overall. Notably, the system maintains 96%
accuracy under severe visual corruption. These results demonstrate that
carefully engineered prompts and contextual grounding can greatly enhance
high-level driving QA with pretrained vision-language models.

### [4] [$Δ$t-Mamba3D: A Time-Aware Spatio-Temporal State-Space Model for Breast Cancer Risk Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19003)
*Zhengbo Zhou,Dooman Arefan,Margarita Zuley,Shandong Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Time-Aware Δt-Mamba3D模型，一种用于纵向医学影像分析的新型状态空间架构，能够有效处理不规则时间间隔的高分辨率图像序列，在乳腺癌风险预测任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决纵向医学影像分析中的核心数据挑战：如何有效建模不规则时间间隔的高分辨率图像序列，充分利用其中的空间和时间信息。现有方法要么压缩空间信息，要么使用计算效率低且不兼容非均匀时间步长的时空模型。

Method: 开发了Time-Aware Δt-Mamba3D模型，包含连续时间选择性扫描机制（显式整合检查之间的真实时间差）和多尺度3D邻域融合模块（稳健捕捉时空关系）。

Result: 在乳腺癌风险预测基准测试中，模型表现出色，验证c-index提高了2-5个百分点，1-5年AUC得分均高于现有的循环、transformer和状态空间模型变体。

Conclusion: 该模型凭借线性复杂度能够高效处理长而复杂的患者筛查历史，为纵向图像分析提供了新框架。

Abstract: Longitudinal analysis of sequential radiological images is hampered by a
fundamental data challenge: how to effectively model a sequence of
high-resolution images captured at irregular time intervals. This data
structure contains indispensable spatial and temporal cues that current methods
fail to fully exploit. Models often compromise by either collapsing spatial
information into vectors or applying spatio-temporal models that are
computationally inefficient and incompatible with non-uniform time steps. We
address this challenge with Time-Aware $\Delta$t-Mamba3D, a novel state-space
architecture adapted for longitudinal medical imaging. Our model simultaneously
encodes irregular inter-visit intervals and rich spatio-temporal context while
remaining computationally efficient. Its core innovation is a continuous-time
selective scanning mechanism that explicitly integrates the true time
difference between exams into its state transitions. This is complemented by a
multi-scale 3D neighborhood fusion module that robustly captures
spatio-temporal relationships. In a comprehensive breast cancer risk prediction
benchmark using sequential screening mammogram exams, our model shows superior
performance, improving the validation c-index by 2-5 percentage points and
achieving higher 1-5 year AUC scores compared to established variants of
recurrent, transformer, and state-space models. Thanks to its linear
complexity, the model can efficiently process long and complex patient
screening histories of mammograms, forming a new framework for longitudinal
image analysis.

*Aritra Bhowmik,Denis Korzhenkov,Cees G. M. Snoek,Amirhossein Habibian,Mohsen Ghafoorian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种运动中心对齐框架，通过从预训练视频编码器中学习解耦的运动子空间来改进文本到视频扩散模型的时间一致性和物理合理性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到视频扩散模型在生成时间一致且物理合理的运动方面存在不足，主要原因是模型对复杂运动的理解不够充分。现有方法通过将扩散模型特征与预训练视频编码器特征对齐，但这些编码器的特征混合了视频外观和动态信息，限制了对齐效果。

Method: 提出运动中心对齐框架：1）从预训练视频编码器中学习解耦的运动子空间，该子空间通过预测真实光流进行优化以确保捕获真实运动动态；2）将文本到视频扩散模型的潜在特征与该新子空间对齐，使生成模型能够内化运动知识。

Result: 该方法在VideoPhy、VideoPhy2、VBench和VBench-2.0等基准测试上改进了最先进视频扩散模型的物理常识，同时保持了对文本提示的遵循，用户研究也证实了改进效果。

Conclusion: 通过解耦运动子空间的对齐方法，有效提升了文本到视频扩散模型生成视频的时间一致性和物理合理性，同时不损害文本遵循能力。

Abstract: Text-to-video diffusion models have enabled high-quality video synthesis, yet
often fail to generate temporally coherent and physically plausible motion. A
key reason is the models' insufficient understanding of complex motions that
natural videos often entail. Recent works tackle this problem by aligning
diffusion model features with those from pretrained video encoders. However,
these encoders mix video appearance and dynamics into entangled features,
limiting the benefit of such alignment. In this paper, we propose a
motion-centric alignment framework that learns a disentangled motion subspace
from a pretrained video encoder. This subspace is optimized to predict
ground-truth optical flow, ensuring it captures true motion dynamics. We then
align the latent features of a text-to-video diffusion model to this new
subspace, enabling the generative model to internalize motion knowledge and
generate more plausible videos. Our method improves the physical commonsense in
a state-of-the-art video diffusion model, while preserving adherence to textual
prompts, as evidenced by empirical evaluations on VideoPhy, VideoPhy2, VBench,
and VBench-2.0, along with a user study.

### [6] [PoSh: Using Scene Graphs To Guide LLMs-as-a-Judge For Detailed Image Descriptions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19060)
*Amith Ananthram,Elias Stengel-Eskin,Lorena A. Bradford,Julia Demarest,Adam Purvis,Keith Krut,Robert Stein,Rina Elster Pantalony,Mohit Bansal,Kathleen McKeown*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PoSh是一个用于详细图像描述评估的新指标，使用场景图作为结构化标准来指导LLM作为评判者，能够产生基于细粒度错误的聚合分数。同时提出了DOCENT数据集来验证该指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的标准评估指标（如CIDEr、SPICE）是为短文本设计的，无法有效评估长文本描述中的属性、关系错误，需要能够定位特定文本错误的评分方法。

Method: PoSh使用场景图作为结构化标准，指导LLM作为评判者进行细粒度错误分析。同时创建了DOCENT数据集，包含艺术品图像、专家撰写的参考描述以及艺术史学生的质量评估。

Result: PoSh在DOCENT数据集上与人类评估的相关性比最佳替代方法提高了0.05 Spearman ρ，对不同类型的图像具有鲁棒性，并且能够作为有效的奖励函数。

Conclusion: PoSh是一个可复制、可解释且优于现有指标的评估方法，通过PoSh和DOCENT，能够推动辅助文本生成等重要领域的发展。

Abstract: While vision-language models (VLMs) have advanced into detailed image
description, evaluation remains a challenge. Standard metrics (e.g. CIDEr,
SPICE) were designed for short texts and tuned to recognize errors that are now
uncommon, such as object misidentification. In contrast, long texts require
sensitivity to attribute and relation attachments and scores that localize
errors to particular text spans. In this work, we introduce PoSh, a metric for
detailed image description that uses scene graphs as structured rubrics to
guide LLMs-as-a-Judge, producing aggregate scores grounded in fine-grained
errors (e.g. mistakes in compositional understanding). PoSh is replicable,
interpretable and a better proxy for human raters than existing metrics
(including GPT4o-as-a-Judge). To validate PoSh, we introduce a challenging new
dataset, DOCENT. This novel benchmark contains artwork, paired with
expert-written references, and model-generated descriptions, augmented with
granular and coarse judgments of their quality from art history students. Thus,
DOCENT enables evaluating both detailed image description metrics and detailed
image description itself in a challenging new domain. We show that PoSh
achieves stronger correlations (+0.05 Spearman $\rho$) with the human judgments
in DOCENT than the best open-weight alternatives, is robust to image type
(using CapArena, an existing dataset of web imagery) and is a capable reward
function, outperforming standard supervised fine-tuning. Then, using PoSh, we
characterize the performance of open and closed models in describing the
paintings, sketches and statues in DOCENT and find that foundation models
struggle to achieve full, error-free coverage of images with rich scene
dynamics, establishing a demanding new task to gauge VLM progress. Through both
PoSh and DOCENT, we hope to enable advances in important areas such as
assistive text generation.

Method: 提出UniHPR统一人体姿态表示学习框架，使用基于奇异值的对比学习损失来同时对齐多种数据表示，包括图像、2D和3D人体姿态。

Result: 在Human3.6M数据集上MPJPE达到49.9mm，在3DPW数据集上PA-MPJPE达到51.6mm；在Human3.6M数据集上姿态检索误差为9.24mm MPJPE。

Conclusion: UniHPR能够有效对齐多种人体姿态表示，在2D和3D人体姿态估计及检索任务中表现出色，证明了统一表示学习的有效性。

Abstract: In recent years, there has been a growing interest in developing effective
alignment pipelines to generate unified representations from different
modalities for multi-modal fusion and generation. As an important component of
Human-Centric applications, Human Pose representations are critical in many
downstream tasks, such as Human Pose Estimation, Action Recognition,
Human-Computer Interaction, Object tracking, etc. Human Pose representations or
embeddings can be extracted from images, 2D keypoints, 3D skeletons, mesh
models, and lots of other modalities. Yet, there are limited instances where
the correlation among all of those representations has been clearly researched
using a contrastive paradigm. In this paper, we propose UniHPR, a unified Human
Pose Representation learning pipeline, which aligns Human Pose embeddings from
images, 2D and 3D human poses. To align more than two data representations at
the same time, we propose a novel singular value-based contrastive learning
loss, which better aligns different modalities and further boosts performance.
To evaluate the effectiveness of the aligned representation, we choose 2D and
3D Human Pose Estimation (HPE) as our evaluation tasks. In our evaluation, with
a simple 3D human pose decoder, UniHPR achieves remarkable performance metrics:
MPJPE 49.9mm on the Human3.6M dataset and PA-MPJPE 51.6mm on the 3DPW dataset
with cross-domain evaluation. Meanwhile, we are able to achieve 2D and 3D pose
retrieval with our unified human pose representations in Human3.6M dataset,
where the retrieval error is 9.24mm in MPJPE.

TL;DR: 该研究提出将注意力机制集成到3D U-Net模型中，以改进脑肿瘤分割性能，特别是在处理不规则形状和模糊边界时。同时采用基于数字图像处理的肿瘤检测算法来解决训练数据不平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准的U-Net模型在准确描绘脑肿瘤区域方面存在挑战，特别是在处理不规则形状和模糊边界时。此外，在高分辨率MRI数据上训练稳健的分割模型需要大量计算资源，并面临类别不平衡问题。

Method: 将注意力机制集成到3D U-Net模型中，使模型能够捕捉复杂细节并在分割过程中优先处理信息丰富的区域。同时使用基于数字图像处理的肿瘤检测算法来解决训练数据不平衡问题。

Result: 在BraTS 2020数据集上的评估结果显示，模型表现优于相关研究，获得dice系数0.975、特异性0.988和敏感性0.995的优异性能。

Conclusion: 提出的模型有效改善了脑肿瘤分割性能，为临床环境中的可靠诊断提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: In the realm of medical diagnostics, rapid advancements in Artificial
Intelligence (AI) have significantly yielded remarkable improvements in brain
tumor segmentation. Encoder-Decoder architectures, such as U-Net, have played a
transformative role by effectively extracting meaningful representations in 3D
brain tumor segmentation from Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. However,
standard U-Net models encounter challenges in accurately delineating tumor
regions, especially when dealing with irregular shapes and ambiguous
boundaries. Additionally, training robust segmentation models on
high-resolution MRI data, such as the BraTS datasets, necessitates high
computational resources and often faces challenges associated with class
imbalance. This study proposes the integration of the attention mechanism into
the 3D U-Net model, enabling the model to capture intricate details and
prioritize informative regions during the segmentation process. Additionally, a
tumor detection algorithm based on digital image processing techniques is
utilized to address the issue of imbalanced training data and mitigate bias.
This study aims to enhance the performance of brain tumor segmentation,
ultimately improving the reliability of diagnosis. The proposed model is
thoroughly evaluated and assessed on the BraTS 2020 dataset using various
performance metrics to accomplish this goal. The obtained results indicate that
the model outperformed related studies, exhibiting dice of 0.975, specificity
of 0.988, and sensitivity of 0.995, indicating the efficacy of the proposed
model in improving brain tumor segmentation, offering valuable insights for
reliable diagnosis in clinical settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究应用联邦近端(FedProx)方法处理非独立同分布超声乳腺癌图像数据集，结合改进的U-Net模型和注意力机制，在保护患者隐私的同时提高了肿瘤分割准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乳腺癌是全球女性主要死因，需要早期检测和准确诊断。医疗数据敏感性使得开发准确且保护隐私的AI模型具有挑战性，联邦学习是解决方案，但非独立同分布数据会影响模型准确性和泛化能力。

Method: 采用联邦近端(FedProx)方法处理非独立同分布超声乳腺癌图像数据集，并结合改进的U-Net模型与注意力机制来增强肿瘤分割准确性。

Result: 最终获得的全局模型达到96%的准确率，证明了该方法在保护患者隐私的同时有效提高了肿瘤分割准确性。

Conclusion: FedProx方法在非独立同分布的本地医疗数据集上训练精确机器学习模型方面具有潜力，是解决医疗数据隐私和准确性平衡问题的有前景方法。

Abstract: Breast cancer is a leading cause of death among women worldwide, emphasizing
the need for early detection and accurate diagnosis. As such Ultrasound
Imaging, a reliable and cost-effective tool, is used for this purpose, however
the sensitive nature of medical data makes it challenging to develop accurate
and private artificial intelligence models. A solution is Federated Learning as
it is a promising technique for distributed machine learning on sensitive
medical data while preserving patient privacy. However, training on
non-Independent and non-Identically Distributed (non-IID) local datasets can
impact the accuracy and generalization of the trained model, which is crucial
for accurate tumour boundary delineation in BC segmentation. This study aims to
tackle this challenge by applying the Federated Proximal (FedProx) method to
non-IID Ultrasonic Breast Cancer Imaging datasets. Moreover, we focus on
enhancing tumour segmentation accuracy by incorporating a modified U-Net model
with attention mechanisms. Our approach resulted in a global model with 96%
accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method in enhancing tumour
segmentation accuracy while preserving patient privacy. Our findings suggest
that FedProx has the potential to be a promising approach for training precise
machine learning models on non-IID local medical datasets.

*Yunzhe Wang,Soham Hans,Volkan Ustun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了X-Ego-CS数据集和CECL方法，用于研究复杂3D环境中的多智能体决策，通过同步的第一人称视角视频流促进团队战术意识的学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要依赖第三人称视角，忽视了多智能体学习的同步自我中心特性，需要从个体视角建模团队战术互动。

Method: 构建X-Ego-CS数据集（124小时专业级CS2比赛录像），提出跨自我中心对比学习（CECL）方法，对齐队友的自我中心视觉流以培养团队战术意识。

Result: 在队友-对手位置预测任务中，CECL有效提升了智能体从单第一人称视角推断队友和对手位置的能力。

Conclusion: X-Ego-CS和CECL为电子竞技中的跨自我中心多智能体基准测试奠定了基础，将游戏理解定位为多智能体建模和战术学习的测试平台。

Abstract: Human team tactics emerge from each player's individual perspective and their
ability to anticipate, interpret, and adapt to teammates' intentions. While
advances in video understanding have improved the modeling of team interactions
in sports, most existing work relies on third-person broadcast views and
overlooks the synchronous, egocentric nature of multi-agent learning. We
introduce X-Ego-CS, a benchmark dataset consisting of 124 hours of gameplay
footage from 45 professional-level matches of the popular e-sports game
Counter-Strike 2, designed to facilitate research on multi-agent
decision-making in complex 3D environments. X-Ego-CS provides cross-egocentric
video streams that synchronously capture all players' first-person perspectives
along with state-action trajectories. Building on this resource, we propose
Cross-Ego Contrastive Learning (CECL), which aligns teammates' egocentric
visual streams to foster team-level tactical situational awareness from an
individual's perspective. We evaluate CECL on a teammate-opponent location
prediction task, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing an agent's
ability to infer both teammate and opponent positions from a single
first-person view using state-of-the-art video encoders. Together, X-Ego-CS and
CECL establish a foundation for cross-egocentric multi-agent benchmarking in
esports. More broadly, our work positions gameplay understanding as a testbed
for multi-agent modeling and tactical learning, with implications for
spatiotemporal reasoning and human-AI teaming in both virtual and real-world
domains. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/HATS-ICT/x-ego.

pressure distributions, foot contact maps, and center of mass (CoM), as
compared with existing methods that generate one or two of those measures.
Furthermore, FootFormer achieves SOTA performance in estimating
stability-predictive components (CoP, CoM, BoS) used in classic kinesiology
metrics. Code and data are available at

### [12] [Malaria Detection from Blood Cell Images Using XceptionNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19182)
*Warisa Nusrat,Mostafijur Rahman,Ayatullah Faruk Mollah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文应用六种深度卷积网络（AlexNet、XceptionNet、VGG-19、残差注意力网络、DenseNet-121和自定义CNN）对疟疾血细胞图像进行分类，其中残差注意力网络和XceptionNet表现最佳，准确率分别达到97.28%和97.55%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 疟疾主要通过雌性按蚊传播，常导致0-5岁儿童死亡。传统显微镜观察血涂片图像的方法依赖专家经验，存在误诊风险，因此需要计算机辅助自动诊断系统。

Method: 使用六种深度卷积网络从血细胞图像中提取深层特征，并将其分类为疟疾感染细胞或健康细胞。

Result: 残差注意力网络和XceptionNet在公开疟疾细胞图像数据集上表现最好，平均准确率分别为97.28%和97.55%，优于其他相关方法。

Conclusion: 深度学习驱动的方法能够实现自动可靠的疟疾检测，同时最大限度地减少直接人工参与，具有现实应用前景。

Abstract: Malaria, which primarily spreads with the bite of female anopheles mosquitos,
often leads to death of people - specifically children in the age-group of 0-5
years. Clinical experts identify malaria by observing RBCs in blood smeared
images with a microscope. Lack of adequate professional knowledge and skills,
and most importantly manual involvement may cause incorrect diagnosis.
Therefore, computer aided automatic diagnosis stands as a preferred substitute.
In this paper, well-demonstrated deep networks have been applied to extract
deep intrinsic features from blood cell images and thereafter classify them as
malaria infected or healthy cells. Among the six deep convolutional networks
employed in this work viz. AlexNet, XceptionNet, VGG-19, Residual Attention
Network, DenseNet-121 and Custom-CNN. Residual Attention Network and
XceptionNet perform relatively better than the rest on a publicly available
malaria cell image dataset. They yield an average accuracy of 97.28% and 97.55%
respectively, that surpasses other related methods on the same dataset. These
findings highly encourage the reality of deep learning driven method for
automatic and reliable detection of malaria while minimizing direct manual
involvement.

TL;DR: PruneHal是一种无需训练的方法，通过自适应KV缓存修剪来增强多模态大语言模型对关键视觉信息的关注，从而减少幻觉现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型存在幻觉问题，现有解决方案要么需要额外训练数据，要么在推理时引入额外信息，都会带来额外计算成本。研究发现幻觉与模型对视觉token关注不足有关，冗余视觉token分散了模型注意力。

Conclusion: PruneHal是首个将token修剪应用于MLLMs幻觉缓解的方法，具有训练免费、计算成本低、模型无关等优势，能有效缓解多模态大语言模型的幻觉问题。

Abstract: While multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant
progress in recent years, the issue of hallucinations remains a major
challenge. To mitigate this phenomenon, existing solutions either introduce
additional data for further training or incorporate external or internal
information during inference. However, these approaches inevitably introduce
extra computational costs. In this paper, we observe that hallucinations in
MLLMs are strongly associated with insufficient attention allocated to visual
tokens. In particular, the presence of redundant visual tokens disperses the
model's attention, preventing it from focusing on the most informative ones. As
a result, critical visual cues are often under-attended, which in turn
exacerbates the occurrence of hallucinations. Building on this observation, we
propose \textbf{PruneHal}, a training-free, simple yet effective method that
leverages adaptive KV cache pruning to enhance the model's focus on critical
visual information, thereby mitigating hallucinations. To the best of our
knowledge, we are the first to apply token pruning for hallucination mitigation
in MLLMs. Notably, our method don't require additional training and incurs
nearly no extra inference cost. Moreover, PruneHal is model-agnostic and can be
seamlessly integrated with different decoding strategies, including those
specifically designed for hallucination mitigation. We evaluate PruneHal on
several widely used hallucination evaluation benchmarks using four mainstream
MLLMs, achieving robust and outstanding results that highlight the
effectiveness and superiority of our method. Our code will be publicly
available.

*Takehiro Aoshima,Yusuke Shinohara,Park Byeongseon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Video Consistency Distance (VCD)指标，通过基于奖励的微调框架增强视频扩散模型的时间一致性，特别针对图像到视频生成任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的奖励函数主要关注整个生成视频序列的质量，但在图像到视频生成任务中时间一致性往往受到影响，需要专门针对时间一致性的优化方法。

Method: 在视频帧特征频率空间中定义VCD指标，通过频域分析有效捕捉帧信息，并使用基于奖励的微调框架对模型进行优化。

Result: 在多个I2V数据集上的实验表明，使用VCD微调的视频生成模型显著提升了时间一致性，且不降低其他性能指标。

Conclusion: VCD是一种有效的度量标准，能够专门改善视频生成模型的时间一致性，为图像到视频生成任务提供了更好的解决方案。

Abstract: Reward-based fine-tuning of video diffusion models is an effective approach
to improve the quality of generated videos, as it can fine-tune models without
requiring real-world video datasets. However, it can sometimes be limited to
specific performances because conventional reward functions are mainly aimed at
enhancing the quality across the whole generated video sequence, such as
aesthetic appeal and overall consistency. Notably, the temporal consistency of
the generated video often suffers when applying previous approaches to
image-to-video (I2V) generation tasks. To address this limitation, we propose
Video Consistency Distance (VCD), a novel metric designed to enhance temporal
consistency, and fine-tune a model with the reward-based fine-tuning framework.
To achieve coherent temporal consistency relative to a conditioning image, VCD
is defined in the frequency space of video frame features to capture frame
information effectively through frequency-domain analysis. Experimental results
across multiple I2V datasets demonstrate that fine-tuning a video generation
model with VCD significantly enhances temporal consistency without degrading
other performance compared to the previous method.

TL;DR: Dream4Drive是一个用于增强下游感知任务的合成数据生成框架，通过3D感知引导图和3D资产渲染生成多视角逼真视频，显著提升自动驾驶中的边缘案例感知能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有驾驶世界模型主要关注生成质量和可控性指标，但忽视了对下游感知任务的评估，而这对自动驾驶性能至关重要。现有方法需要先在合成数据上预训练再在真实数据上微调，导致训练周期加倍，当基线方法也加倍训练周期时，合成数据的优势变得微不足道。

Method: Dream4Drive首先将输入视频分解为多个3D感知引导图，然后将3D资产渲染到这些引导图上，最后微调驾驶世界模型以生成编辑后的多视角逼真视频，用于训练下游感知模型。

Result: 该框架能够大规模生成多视角边缘案例，显著提升自动驾驶中的边缘案例感知能力。实验表明Dream4Drive在不同训练周期下都能有效提升下游感知模型的性能。

Conclusion: Dream4Drive通过灵活的3D感知视频编辑，为自动驾驶感知任务提供了有效的合成数据增强方案，并贡献了大规模3D资产数据集DriveObj3D，推动未来研究发展。

Abstract: Recent advancements in driving world models enable controllable generation of
high-quality RGB videos or multimodal videos. Existing methods primarily focus
on metrics related to generation quality and controllability. However, they
often overlook the evaluation of downstream perception tasks, which are
$\mathbf{really\ crucial}$ for the performance of autonomous driving. Existing
methods usually leverage a training strategy that first pretrains on synthetic
data and finetunes on real data, resulting in twice the epochs compared to the
baseline (real data only). When we double the epochs in the baseline, the
benefit of synthetic data becomes negligible. To thoroughly demonstrate the
benefit of synthetic data, we introduce Dream4Drive, a novel synthetic data
generation framework designed for enhancing the downstream perception tasks.
Dream4Drive first decomposes the input video into several 3D-aware guidance
maps and subsequently renders the 3D assets onto these guidance maps. Finally,
the driving world model is fine-tuned to produce the edited, multi-view
photorealistic videos, which can be used to train the downstream perception
models. Dream4Drive enables unprecedented flexibility in generating multi-view
corner cases at scale, significantly boosting corner case perception in
autonomous driving. To facilitate future research, we also contribute a
large-scale 3D asset dataset named DriveObj3D, covering the typical categories
in driving scenarios and enabling diverse 3D-aware video editing. We conduct
comprehensive experiments to show that Dream4Drive can effectively boost the
performance of downstream perception models under various training epochs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有动态场景重建方法在不同场景下表现不一致，缺乏统一处理所有动态挑战的有效方法。

Method: 提出MoE-GS框架，使用体积感知像素路由器将多个专家输出自适应融合，通过可微分权重泼溅实现时空一致性。采用单次多专家渲染、门感知高斯剪枝和蒸馏策略优化效率。

Result: 在N3V和Technicolor数据集上的实验表明，MoE-GS在保持效率的同时，持续优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: MoE-GS是首个将混合专家技术引入动态高斯泼溅的方法，通过专家融合和效率优化，实现了更好的渲染质量和实用性。

Abstract: Recent advances in dynamic scene reconstruction have significantly benefited
from 3D Gaussian Splatting, yet existing methods show inconsistent performance
across diverse scenes, indicating no single approach effectively handles all
dynamic challenges. To overcome these limitations, we propose Mixture of
Experts for Dynamic Gaussian Splatting (MoE-GS), a unified framework
integrating multiple specialized experts via a novel Volume-aware Pixel Router.
Our router adaptively blends expert outputs by projecting volumetric
Gaussian-level weights into pixel space through differentiable weight
splatting, ensuring spatially and temporally coherent results. Although MoE-GS
improves rendering quality, the increased model capacity and reduced FPS are
inherent to the MoE architecture. To mitigate this, we explore two
complementary directions: (1) single-pass multi-expert rendering and gate-aware
Gaussian pruning, which improve efficiency within the MoE framework, and (2) a
distillation strategy that transfers MoE performance to individual experts,
enabling lightweight deployment without architectural changes. To the best of
our knowledge, MoE-GS is the first approach incorporating Mixture-of-Experts
techniques into dynamic Gaussian splatting. Extensive experiments on the N3V
and Technicolor datasets demonstrate that MoE-GS consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods with improved efficiency. Video demonstrations are

TL;DR: SFGFusion是一种基于表面拟合的相机-4D成像雷达检测网络，通过估计物体的二次曲面参数来增强空间表示和跨模态交互，生成密集伪点云以缓解雷达点稀疏问题，并在BEV空间进行多模态融合，在TJ4DRadSet和VoD基准测试中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 4D成像雷达具有低成本、远距离检测和精确速度测量等优势，但其稀疏点云和低分辨率限制了物体几何表示并阻碍多模态融合。

Method: 通过从图像和雷达数据估计物体的二次曲面参数，构建显式表面拟合模型来增强空间表示和跨模态交互；生成密集伪点云缓解雷达点稀疏问题；使用基于pillar的方法处理点云特征，并将其转换到BEV空间；最后使用标准2D骨干网络和检测头从BEV特征预测物体标签和边界框。

Result: 在TJ4DRadSet和view-of-delft (VoD)物体检测基准测试中实现了优越性能。

Conclusion: SFGFusion能够有效融合相机和4D雷达特征，解决了4D成像雷达点云稀疏和分辨率低的问题，提升了3D物体检测性能。

Abstract: 3D object detection is essential for autonomous driving. As an emerging
sensor, 4D imaging radar offers advantages as low cost, long-range detection,
and accurate velocity measurement, making it highly suitable for object
detection. However, its sparse point clouds and low resolution limit object
geometric representation and hinder multi-modal fusion. In this study, we
introduce SFGFusion, a novel camera-4D imaging radar detection network guided
by surface fitting. By estimating quadratic surface parameters of objects from
image and radar data, the explicit surface fitting model enhances spatial
representation and cross-modal interaction, enabling more reliable prediction
of fine-grained dense depth. The predicted depth serves two purposes: 1) in an
image branch to guide the transformation of image features from perspective
view (PV) to a unified bird's-eye view (BEV) for multi-modal fusion, improving
spatial mapping accuracy; and 2) in a surface pseudo-point branch to generate
dense pseudo-point cloud, mitigating the radar point sparsity. The original
radar point cloud is also encoded in a separate radar branch. These two point
cloud branches adopt a pillar-based method and subsequently transform the
features into the BEV space. Finally, a standard 2D backbone and detection head
are used to predict object labels and bounding boxes from BEV features.
Experimental results show that SFGFusion effectively fuses camera and 4D radar
features, achieving superior performance on the TJ4DRadSet and view-of-delft
(VoD) object detection benchmarks.

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合小波变换特征增强和基于匈牙利算法的多帧轨迹补全，成功解决了GEO空间目标检测中的关键问题，具有较好的实用价值。

Abstract: Space objects in Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) present significant
detection challenges in optical imaging due to weak signals, complex stellar
backgrounds, and environmental interference. In this paper, we enhance
high-frequency features of GEO targets while suppressing background noise at
the single-frame level through wavelet transform. Building on this, we propose
a multi-frame temporal trajectory completion scheme centered on the Hungarian
algorithm for globally optimal cross-frame matching. To effectively mitigate
missing and false detections, a series of key steps including temporal matching
and interpolation completion, temporal-consistency-based noise filtering, and
progressive trajectory refinement are designed in the post-processing pipeline.
Experimental results on the public SpotGEO dataset demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving an F_1 score of 90.14%.

TL;DR: FadeLead是一个协作感知框架，通过将背景上下文信息封装到紧凑的前景特征中，在带宽受限的车联网环境下实现高效信息共享。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有协作感知方法只传输前景区域特征而丢弃背景，但背景包含重要的上下文信息。车联网带宽限制使得传输完整特征图不现实。

Method: 采用课程学习策略，早期利用背景线索但逐步剪除，迫使模型将上下文信息内化到前景表示中，而不实际传输背景本身。

Result: 在模拟和真实世界基准测试上的广泛实验表明，FadeLead在不同带宽设置下均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 上下文增强的前景共享方法在协作感知中具有显著效果，FadeLead框架成功克服了背景信息丢失的问题。

Abstract: Collaborative perception enhances the reliability and spatial coverage of
autonomous vehicles by sharing complementary information across vehicles,
offering a promising solution to long-tail scenarios that challenge
single-vehicle perception. However, the bandwidth constraints of vehicular
networks make transmitting the entire feature map impractical. Recent methods,
therefore, adopt a foreground-centric paradigm, transmitting only predicted
foreground-region features while discarding the background, which encodes
essential context. We propose FadeLead, a foreground-centric framework that
overcomes this limitation by learning to encapsulate background context into
compact foreground features during training. At the core of our design is a
curricular learning strategy that leverages background cues early on but
progressively prunes them away, forcing the model to internalize context into
foreground representations without transmitting background itself. Extensive
experiments on both simulated and real-world benchmarks show that FadeLead
outperforms prior methods under different bandwidth settings, underscoring the
effectiveness of context-enriched foreground sharing.

Abstract: We present a survey on 4D generation and reconstruction, a fast-evolving
subfield of computer graphics whose developments have been propelled by recent
advances in neural fields, geometric and motion deep learning, as well 3D
generative artificial intelligence (GenAI). While our survey is not the first
of its kind, we build our coverage of the domain from a unique and distinctive
perspective of 4D representations\/}, to model 3D geometry evolving over time
while exhibiting motion and interaction. Specifically, instead of offering an
exhaustive enumeration of many works, we take a more selective approach by
focusing on representative works to highlight both the desirable properties and
ensuing challenges of each representation under different computation,
application, and data scenarios. The main take-away message we aim to convey to
the readers is on how to select and then customize the appropriate 4D
representations for their tasks. Organizationally, we separate the 4D
representations based on three key pillars: geometry, motion, and interaction.
Our discourse will not only encompass the most popular representations of
today, such as neural radiance fields (NeRFs) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS),
but also bring attention to relatively under-explored representations in the 4D
context, such as structured models and long-range motions. Throughout our
survey, we will reprise the role of large language models (LLMs) and video
foundational models (VFMs) in a variety of 4D applications, while steering our
discussion towards their current limitations and how they can be addressed. We
also provide a dedicated coverage on what 4D datasets are currently available,
as well as what is lacking, in driving the subfield forward. Project

Conclusion: 提出的框架成功解决了单步扩散模型在实时图像超分辨率中的结构准确性问题，实现了效率与质量的良好平衡。

Abstract: Real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) must handle complex degradations
and inherent reconstruction ambiguities. While generative models have improved
perceptual quality, a key trade-off remains with computational cost. One-step
diffusion models offer speed but often produce structural inaccuracies due to
distillation artifacts. To address this, we propose a novel SR framework that
enhances a one-step diffusion model using a ControlNet mechanism for semantic
edge guidance. This integrates edge information to provide dynamic structural
control during single-pass inference. We also introduce a hybrid loss combining
L2, LPIPS, and an edge-aware AME loss to optimize for pixel accuracy,
perceptual quality, and geometric precision. Experiments show our method
effectively improves structural integrity and realism while maintaining the
efficiency of one-step generation, achieving a superior balance between output
quality and inference speed. The results of test datasets will be published at

Motivation: 现有MAV动作识别方法依赖计算密集型模型，不适合资源受限的MAV平台，需要在识别精度和推理速度之间权衡。

Method: 使用MobileNetV4作为骨干网络，引入阶段正交知识蒸馏策略从教师网络(ResNet18)向学生网络传递特征，集成参数无关注意力机制，采用混合损失训练策略。

Result: 在三个自采集数据集上平均识别精度达92.12%，仅消耗136.16 pJ能量，处理速度为8.84动作/秒，解码速度比领先方法快2倍。

Conclusion: MobiAct实现了低能耗、低计算的MAV动作识别，在保持高精度的同时具有最快的动作解码速度，展现了在MAV动作识别中的优越效率。

Abstract: Accurate and efficient recognition of Micro Air Vehicle (MAV) motion is
essential for enabling real-time perception and coordination in autonomous
aerial swarm. However, most existing approaches rely on large, computationally
intensive models that are unsuitable for resource-limited MAV platforms, which
results in a trade-off between recognition accuracy and inference speed. To
address these challenges, this paper proposes a lightweight MAV action
recognition framework, MobiAct, designed to achieve high accuracy with low
computational cost. Specifically, MobiAct adopts MobileNetV4 as the backbone
network and introduces a Stage-wise Orthogonal Knowledge Distillation (SOKD)
strategy to effectively transfer MAV motion features from a teacher network
(ResNet18) to a student network, thereby enhancing knowledge transfer
efficiency. Furthermore, a parameter-free attention mechanism is integrated
into the architecture to improve recognition accuracy without increasing model
complexity. In addition, a hybrid loss training strategy is developed to
combine multiple loss objectives, which ensures stable and robust optimization
during training. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed MobiAct
achieves low-energy and low-computation MAV action recognition, while
maintaining the fastest action decoding speed among compared methods. Across
all three self-collected datasets, MobiAct achieves an average recognition
accuracy of 92.12%, while consuming only 136.16 pJ of energy and processing
recognition at a rate of 8.84 actions per second. Notably, MobiAct decodes
actions up to 2 times faster than the leading method, with highly comparable
recognition accuracy, highlighting its superior efficiency in MAV action
recognition.

Motivation: 现有方法只能使用可微的回归模型作为计数网络，无法利用性能更好的检测器模型，因为检测器的枚举计数本质是不可微的。

Method: 设计自定义激活函数将检测器logits转换为软二元指示器，在推理时优化预训练T2I模型的噪声先验。

Result: 在多个基准测试中显著提高了对象计数准确率（如D2D-Small上提升13.7%），同时图像质量和计算开销几乎没有下降。

Conclusion: D2D框架成功地将检测器的强大计数能力引入到T2I生成过程中，解决了现有方法在对象数量控制方面的局限性。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have achieved strong performance in
semantic alignment, yet they still struggle with generating the correct number
of objects specified in prompts. Existing approaches typically incorporate
auxiliary counting networks as external critics to enhance numeracy. However,
since these critics must provide gradient guidance during generation, they are
restricted to regression-based models that are inherently differentiable, thus
excluding detector-based models with superior counting ability, whose
count-via-enumeration nature is non-differentiable. To overcome this
limitation, we propose Detector-to-Differentiable (D2D), a novel framework that
transforms non-differentiable detection models into differentiable critics,
thereby leveraging their superior counting ability to guide numeracy
generation. Specifically, we design custom activation functions to convert
detector logits into soft binary indicators, which are then used to optimize
the noise prior at inference time with pre-trained T2I models. Our extensive
experiments on SDXL-Turbo, SD-Turbo, and Pixart-DMD across four benchmarks of
varying complexity (low-density, high-density, and multi-object scenarios)
demonstrate consistent and substantial improvements in object counting accuracy
(e.g., boosting up to 13.7% on D2D-Small, a 400-prompt, low-density benchmark),
with minimal degradation in overall image quality and computational overhead.

Abstract: Alzheimer disease is a severe brain disorder that causes harm in various
brain areas and leads to memory damage. The limited availability of labeled
medical data poses a significant challenge for accurate Alzheimer disease
detection. There is a critical need for effective methods to improve the
accuracy of Alzheimer disease detection, considering the scarcity of labeled

privacy. To address this challenge, our study leverages the power of big data
in the form of pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) within the
framework of Few-Shot Learning (FSL) and ensemble learning. We propose an
ensemble approach based on a Prototypical Network (ProtoNet), a powerful method
in FSL, integrating various pre-trained CNNs as encoders. This integration
enhances the richness of features extracted from medical images. Our approach
also includes a combination of class-aware loss and entropy loss to ensure a
more precise classification of Alzheimer disease progression levels. The
effectiveness of our method was evaluated using two datasets, the Kaggle
Alzheimer dataset and the ADNI dataset, achieving an accuracy of 99.72% and
99.86%, respectively. The comparison of our results with relevant
state-of-the-art studies demonstrated that our approach achieved superior
accuracy and highlighted its validity and potential for real-world applications
in early Alzheimer disease detection.

Motivation: 视觉语言模型(VLMs)虽然取得显著进展，但规模过大导致在资源受限环境中不实用，需要开发高效的训练算法来创建轻量级但强大的VLMs。

Method: RIL算法结合强化学习和对抗模仿学习，使用基于LLM的判别器区分学生和教师模型输出，并利用多个大型教师VLM提供多样化指导。

Result: 在多个视觉语言基准测试中，RIL显著缩小了与最先进开源和闭源VLMs的性能差距，并在多个实例中超越了它们。

Conclusion: 统一强化与模仿学习策略能够有效提升学生模型的生成能力，使其在保持轻量级的同时达到与领先闭源VLMs竞争的性能水平。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress, yet their
large scale often renders them impractical for resource-constrained
environments. This paper introduces Unified Reinforcement and Imitation
Learning (RIL), a novel and efficient training algorithm designed to create
powerful, lightweight VLMs. RIL distinctively combines the strengths of
reinforcement learning with adversarial imitation learning. This enables
smaller student VLMs not only to mimic the sophisticated text generation of
large teacher models but also to systematically improve their generative
capabilities through reinforcement signals. Key to our imitation framework is
an LLM-based discriminator that adeptly distinguishes between student and
teacher outputs, complemented by guidance from multiple large teacher VLMs to
ensure diverse learning. This unified learning strategy, leveraging both
reinforcement and imitation, empowers student models to achieve significant
performance gains, making them competitive with leading closed-source VLMs.
Extensive experiments on diverse vision-language benchmarks demonstrate that
RIL significantly narrows the performance gap with state-of-the-art open- and

Abstract: Handwritten signature verification is a crucial aspect of identity
authentication, with applications in various domains such as finance and
e-commerce. However, achieving high accuracy in signature verification remains
challenging due to intra-user variability and the risk of forgery. This paper
introduces a novel approach for dynamic signature verification: the
Temporal-Spatial Graph Attention Transformer (TS-GATR). TS-GATR combines the
Graph Attention Network (GAT) and the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to model both
spatial and temporal dependencies in signature data. TS-GATR enhances
verification performance by representing signatures as graphs, where each node
captures dynamic features (e.g. position, velocity, pressure), and by using
attention mechanisms to model their complex relationships. The proposed method
further employs a Dual-Graph Attention Transformer (DGATR) module, which
utilizes k-step and k-nearest neighbor adjacency graphs to model local and
global spatial features, respectively. To capture long-term temporal
dependencies, the model integrates GRU, thereby enhancing its ability to learn
dynamic features during signature verification. Comprehensive experiments
conducted on benchmark datasets such as MSDS and DeepSignDB show that TS-GATR
surpasses current state-of-the-art approaches, consistently achieving lower
Equal Error Rates (EER) across various scenarios.

*Panagiotis Agrafiotis,Begüm Demir*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Seabed-Net是一个统一的多任务框架，通过同时预测水深和海底分类来解决浅水环境测绘问题，相比传统方法显著提升了精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的遥感图像处理方法将水深估计和海底分类作为独立任务处理，忽视了它们之间的相互作用，限制了深度学习方法的广泛应用。

Method: 采用双分支编码器分别处理水深估计和像素级海底分类，通过注意力特征融合模块和窗口Swin-Transformer融合块整合跨任务特征，并使用动态任务不确定性加权平衡目标。

Result: 在两个异质性沿海站点的广泛评估中，比传统经验模型和机器学习回归方法降低高达75%的RMSE，相比最先进的单任务和多任务基线降低10-30%的水深RMSE，海底分类精度提升达8%。

Conclusion: 联合建模水深与海底底质和栖息地能够产生协同增益，为集成浅水测绘提供了稳健的开放解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate, detailed, and regularly updated bathymetry, coupled with complex
semantic content, is essential for under-mapped shallow-water environments
facing increasing climatological and anthropogenic pressures. However, existing
approaches that derive either depth or seabed classes from remote sensing
imagery treat these tasks in isolation, forfeiting the mutual benefits of their
interaction and hindering the broader adoption of deep learning methods. To
address these limitations, we introduce Seabed-Net, a unified multi-task
framework that simultaneously predicts bathymetry and pixel-based seabed
classification from remote sensing imagery of various resolutions. Seabed-Net
employs dual-branch encoders for bathymetry estimation and pixel-based seabed
classification, integrates cross-task features via an Attention Feature Fusion
module and a windowed Swin-Transformer fusion block, and balances objectives
through dynamic task uncertainty weighting. In extensive evaluations at two
heterogeneous coastal sites, it consistently outperforms traditional empirical
models and traditional machine learning regression methods, achieving up to
75\% lower RMSE. It also reduces bathymetric RMSE by 10-30\% compared to
state-of-the-art single-task and multi-task baselines and improves seabed
classification accuracy up to 8\%. Qualitative analyses further demonstrate
enhanced spatial consistency, sharper habitat boundaries, and corrected depth
biases in low-contrast regions. These results confirm that jointly modeling
depth with both substrate and seabed habitats yields synergistic gains,
offering a robust, open solution for integrated shallow-water mapping. Code and
pretrained weights are available at https://github.com/pagraf/Seabed-Net.

Abstract: Crowd localization plays a crucial role in visual scene understanding towards
predicting each pedestrian location in a crowd, thus being applicable to
various downstream tasks. However, existing approaches suffer from significant
performance degradation due to discrepancies in head scale distributions (scale
shift) between training and testing data, a challenge known as domain
generalization (DG). This paper aims to comprehend the nature of scale shift
within the context of domain generalization for crowd localization models. To
this end, we address four critical questions: (i) How does scale shift
influence crowd localization in a DG scenario? (ii) How can we quantify this
influence? (iii) What causes this influence? (iv) How to mitigate the
influence? Initially, we conduct a systematic examination of how crowd
localization performance varies with different levels of scale shift. Then, we
establish a benchmark, ScaleBench, and reproduce 20 advanced DG algorithms to
quantify the influence. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the
limitations of existing algorithms and underscore the importance and complexity
of scale shift, a topic that remains insufficiently explored. To deepen our
understanding, we provide a rigorous theoretical analysis on scale shift.
Building on these insights, we further propose an effective algorithm called
Causal Feature Decomposition and Anisotropic Processing (Catto) to mitigate the
influence of scale shift in DG settings. Later, we also provide extensive
analytical experiments, revealing four significant insights for future
research. Our results emphasize the importance of this novel and applicable
research direction, which we term Scale Shift Domain Generalization.

*Tian Xia,Zihan Ma,Xinlong Wang,Qing Liu,Xiaowei He,Tianming Liu,Yudan Ren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BrainMCLIP提出了一种参数高效的多层融合方法，通过将fMRI信号与CLIP中间层和最终层对齐，无需额外的VAE管道即可实现高质量的图像解码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常将fMRI映射到CLIP的最终语义层，忽略了CLIP中间层的丰富物体信息，且与大脑功能层次结构不符。需要参数密集的VAE管道来捕捉视觉细节。

Method: 基于人类视觉系统的功能层次结构，将不同功能视觉区域（低/高级）的fMRI信号与相应的CLIP中间层和最终层对齐，引入交叉重建策略和新的多粒度损失函数。

Result: 在高级语义指标上达到或超越最先进方法（包括使用VAE管道的方法），参数数量减少71.7%，在语义准确性和细节保真度之间取得良好平衡。

Conclusion: BrainMCLIP通过利用CLIP中间特征有效捕捉视觉细节，无需单独的VAE管道，在参数效率和性能之间实现了有竞争力的平衡。

Abstract: Decoding images from fMRI often involves mapping brain activity to CLIP's
final semantic layer. To capture finer visual details, many approaches add a
parameter-intensive VAE-based pipeline. However, these approaches overlook rich
object information within CLIP's intermediate layers and contradicts the
brain's functionally hierarchical. We introduce BrainMCLIP, which pioneers a
parameter-efficient, multi-layer fusion approach guided by human visual
system's functional hierarchy, eliminating the need for such a separate VAE
pathway. BrainMCLIP aligns fMRI signals from functionally distinct visual areas
(low-/high-level) to corresponding intermediate and final CLIP layers,
respecting functional hierarchy. We further introduce a Cross-Reconstruction
strategy and a novel multi-granularity loss. Results show BrainMCLIP achieves
highly competitive performance, particularly excelling on high-level semantic
metrics where it matches or surpasses SOTA(state-of-the-art) methods, including
those using VAE pipelines. Crucially, it achieves this with substantially fewer
parameters, demonstrating a reduction of
71.7\%(Table.\ref{tab:compare_clip_vae}) compared to top VAE-based SOTA
methods, by avoiding the VAE pathway. By leveraging intermediate CLIP features,
it effectively captures visual details often missed by CLIP-only approaches,
striking a compelling balance between semantic accuracy and detail fidelity
without requiring a separate VAE pipeline.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的开集词汇图像分割与识别框架，结合EfficientNetB0进行无监督分割和CLIP进行开集词汇识别，在多个基准数据集上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统方法需要大量标注数据和固定类别限制的问题，开发无需训练即可处理任意类别对象的开集词汇分割识别系统。

Method: 采用两阶段流程：1) 使用EfficientNetB0提取特征，通过SVD分解和层次聚类进行无监督分割；2) 利用CLIP的视觉和文本编码器进行跨模态对齐，通过相似度计算实现开集识别。

Result: 在COCO、ADE20K和PASCAL VOC等标准基准测试中，在匈牙利mIoU、精确率、召回率和F1分数等指标上均达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 该框架展示了无需训练即可实现有效、灵活和通用的开集词汇图像分割与识别的能力。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel training-free framework for open-vocabulary image
segmentation and object recognition (OVSR), which leverages EfficientNetB0, a
convolutional neural network, for unsupervised segmentation and CLIP, a
vision-language model, for open-vocabulary object recognition. The proposed
framework adopts a two stage pipeline: unsupervised image segmentation followed
by segment-level recognition via vision-language alignment. In the first stage,
pixel-wise features extracted from EfficientNetB0 are decomposed using singular
value decomposition to obtain latent representations, which are then clustered
using hierarchical clustering to segment semantically meaningful regions. The
number of clusters is adaptively determined by the distribution of singular
values. In the second stage, the segmented regions are localized and encoded
into image embeddings using the Vision Transformer backbone of CLIP. Text
embeddings are precomputed using CLIP's text encoder from category-specific
prompts, including a generic something else prompt to support open set
recognition. The image and text embeddings are concatenated and projected into
a shared latent feature space via SVD to enhance cross-modal alignment.
Recognition is performed by computing the softmax over the similarities between
the projected image and text embeddings. The proposed method is evaluated on
standard benchmarks, including COCO, ADE20K, and PASCAL VOC, achieving
state-of-the-art performance in terms of Hungarian mIoU, precision, recall, and
F1-score. These results demonstrate the effectiveness, flexibility, and
generalizability of the proposed framework.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型作为移动手机代理的基础，但在同时处理多个移动任务时效果有限。现有多任务监督微调方法难以确定最优训练数据组合以获得最佳性能。

Method: 使用可训练网络预测下游任务性能，从而确定最优数据混合比例。引入PhoneAgentBench基准（包含1235个QA对）进行综合评估。

Result: DaMo在PhoneAgentBench上相比其他方法提升3.38%，在其他基准测试（BFCL-v3、MME-Reasoning等）上平均提升2.57%。在BFCL-v3任务上单独优化MLLM时，指标提升12.47%。

Conclusion: DaMo能有效预测最优数据混合配置，具有强大的预测能力和良好的泛化性，且在其他模型架构上仍保持有效性。

Abstract: Mobile Phone Agents (MPAs) have emerged as a promising research direction due
to their broad applicability across diverse scenarios. While Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) serve as the foundation for MPAs, their effectiveness
in handling multiple mobile phone tasks simultaneously remains limited.
Although multitask supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is widely adopted for multitask
learning, existing approaches struggle to determine optimal training data
compositions for peak performance. To address this challenge, we propose DaMo
(Data Mixture Optimizer) - a novel solution employing a trainable network that
predicts optimal data mixtures by forecasting downstream task performance for
any given dataset ratio. To support comprehensive evaluation, we introduce
PhoneAgentBench, the first specialized benchmark to evaluate MLLMs on
multimodal mobile phone tasks, comprising 1235 QA pairs spanning diverse
real-world industrial mobile application scenarios. Demonstrating strong
predictive capability (R^2=0.81) in small-scale pilot experiments, DaMo
efficiently extrapolates optimal data mixing configurations. Our results show
DaMo achieves a 3.38% performance improvement on PhoneAgentBench compared to
alternative methods. Furthermore, extensive experiments across established
benchmarks including BFCL-v3, MME-Reasoning, MME-Perception, and OCRBench
reveal DaMo's superior generalization, outperforming other approaches by 2.57%
in terms of average score. When used solely for MLLM optimization on the
BFCL-v3 task, DaMo improves the metrics by 12.47% than other methods. Notably,
DaMo maintains robust scalability, preserving its effectiveness when applied to
other model architectures. The code and dataset are available at

TL;DR: DARE是一个可变形医学图像配准框架，通过动态调整弹性正则化来平衡配准的稳定性和灵活性，同时防止变形场折叠。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的深度学习方法在医学图像配准中往往忽视正则化的重要性，导致配准结果缺乏鲁棒性和解剖学合理性。

Method: 提出DARE框架，基于变形场梯度范数动态调整弹性正则化，集成应变和剪切能量项，并包含防止折叠的机制来惩罚负雅可比变形区域。

Result: 该方法减轻了非物理伪影（如折叠），避免了过度平滑，提高了配准精度和解剖学合理性。

Conclusion: DARE框架通过自适应正则化策略，在医学图像配准中实现了更好的稳定性和解剖学合理性平衡。

Abstract: Deformable medical image registration is a fundamental task in medical image
analysis. While deep learning-based methods have demonstrated superior accuracy
and computational efficiency compared to traditional techniques, they often
overlook the critical role of regularization in ensuring robustness and
anatomical plausibility. We propose DARE (Deformable Adaptive Regularization
Estimator), a novel registration framework that dynamically adjusts elastic
regularization based on the gradient norm of the deformation field. Our
approach integrates strain and shear energy terms, which are adaptively
modulated to balance stability and flexibility. To ensure physically realistic
transformations, DARE includes a folding-prevention mechanism that penalizes
regions with negative deformation Jacobian. This strategy mitigates
non-physical artifacts such as folding, avoids over-smoothing, and improves
both registration accuracy and anatomical plausibility

TL;DR: AegisRF是一个保护NeRF模型知识产权的框架，通过注入对抗性扰动来破坏未经授权的下游应用，同时使用敏感性场来保持渲染质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着NeRF成为3D场景表示和视图合成的强大工具，保护其知识产权免受未经授权使用变得至关重要。现有方法避免几何扰动或限制在显式空间中，因为这会严重降低渲染质量。

Method: 提出AegisRF框架，包含扰动场（在NeRF预渲染输出中注入对抗性扰动）和敏感性场（学习空间变化的敏感性来自适应约束几何扰动）。

Result: 实验评估显示AegisRF在多种下游任务和模态中具有通用适用性，包括多视图图像分类和基于体素的3D定位，同时保持高视觉保真度。

Conclusion: AegisRF能有效保护NeRF模型的知识产权，在保持渲染质量的同时破坏未经授权的使用。

Abstract: As Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have emerged as a powerful tool for 3D
scene representation and novel view synthesis, protecting their intellectual
property (IP) from unauthorized use is becoming increasingly crucial. In this
work, we aim to protect the IP of NeRFs by injecting adversarial perturbations
that disrupt their unauthorized applications. However, perturbing the 3D
geometry of NeRFs can easily deform the underlying scene structure and thus
substantially degrade the rendering quality, which has led existing attempts to
avoid geometric perturbations or restrict them to explicit spaces like meshes.
To overcome this limitation, we introduce a learnable sensitivity to quantify
the spatially varying impact of geometric perturbations on rendering quality.
Building upon this, we propose AegisRF, a novel framework that consists of a
Perturbation Field, which injects adversarial perturbations into the
pre-rendering outputs (color and volume density) of NeRF models to fool an
unauthorized downstream target model, and a Sensitivity Field, which learns the
sensitivity to adaptively constrain geometric perturbations, preserving
rendering quality while disrupting unauthorized use. Our experimental
evaluations demonstrate the generalized applicability of AegisRF across diverse
downstream tasks and modalities, including multi-view image classification and
voxel-based 3D localization, while maintaining high visual fidelity. Codes are
available at https://github.com/wkim97/AegisRF.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大多数VLM评估集中在单视角设置，而多摄像头设置已成为机器人平台标准配置，但VLM能否有效利用多视角输入进行机器人推理仍是一个未解决的问题。

Method: 开发MV-RoboBench基准，包含8个子任务的1.7k个QA项目，评估包括开源和闭源模型在内的多样化VLM，以及结合CoT技术的增强版本。

Result: 最先进模型的性能远低于人类水平，揭示了VLM在多视角机器人感知中面临的重大挑战。空间智能与机器人任务执行在多视角场景中呈正相关，但现有通用单视角空间理解基准的强性能并不能可靠转化为机器人空间任务的成功。

Conclusion: MV-RoboBench作为开放资源发布，旨在促进空间基础VLM和VLA的进步，提供数据和标准化评估协议。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) are essential to Embodied AI, enabling robots
to perceive, reason, and act in complex environments. They also serve as the
foundation for the recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. Yet most
evaluations of VLMs focus on single-view settings, leaving their ability to
integrate multi-view information underexplored. At the same time, multi-camera
setups are increasingly standard in robotic platforms, as they provide
complementary perspectives to mitigate occlusion and depth ambiguity. Whether
VLMs can effectively leverage such multi-view inputs for robotic reasoning
therefore remains an open question. To bridge this gap, we introduce
MV-RoboBench, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the multi-view
spatial reasoning capabilities of VLMs in robotic manipulation. MV-RoboBench
consists of 1.7k manually curated QA items across eight subtasks, divided into
two primary categories: spatial understanding and robotic execution. We
evaluate a diverse set of existing VLMs, including both open-source and
closed-source models, along with enhanced versions incorporating CoT-inspired
techniques. The results show that state-of-the-art models remain far below
human performance, underscoring the substantial challenges VLMs face in
multi-view robotic perception. Additionally, our analysis uncovers two key
findings: (i) spatial intelligence and robotic task execution are positively
correlated in multi-view robotic scenarios; and (ii) strong performance on
existing general-purpose single-view spatial understanding benchmarks does not
reliably translate to success in the robotic spatial tasks assessed by our
benchmark. We release MV-RoboBench as an open resource to foster progress in
spatially grounded VLMs and VLAs, providing not only data but also a
standardized evaluation protocol for multi-view embodied reasoning.

Abstract: With the spread of e-commerce, the logistics market is growing around the
world. Therefore, improving the efficiency of warehouse operations is
essential. To achieve this, various approaches have been explored, and among
them, the use of digital twins is gaining attention. To make this approach
possible, it is necessary to accurately collect the positions of workers in a
warehouse and reflect them in a virtual space. However, a single camera has
limitations in its field of view, therefore sensing with multiple cameras is
necessary. In this study, we explored a method to track workers using 19
wide-angle cameras installed on the ceiling, looking down at the floor of the
logistics warehouse. To understand the relationship between the camera
coordinates and the actual positions in the warehouse, we performed alignment
based on the floor surface. However, due to the characteristics of wide-angle
cameras, significant distortion occurs at the edges of the image, particularly
in the vertical direction. To address this, the detected worker positions from
each camera were aligned based on foot positions, reducing the effects of image
distortion, and enabling accurate position alignment across cameras. As a
result, we confirmed an improvement of over 20% in tracking accuracy.
Furthermore, we compared multiple methods for utilizing appearance features and
validated the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Conclusion: PICK弥合了MLLMs与专业专家领域之间的差距，为通过视觉表达理解人类心理状态提供了一个结构化和可解释的框架。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated exceptional
performance across various objective multimodal perception tasks, yet their
application to subjective, emotionally nuanced domains, such as psychological
analysis, remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce PICK, a
multi-step framework designed for Psychoanalytical Image Comprehension through
hierarchical analysis and Knowledge injection with MLLMs, specifically focusing
on the House-Tree-Person (HTP) Test, a widely used psychological assessment in
clinical practice. First, we decompose drawings containing multiple instances
into semantically meaningful sub-drawings, constructing a hierarchical
representation that captures spatial structure and content across three levels:
single-object level, multi-object level, and whole level. Next, we analyze
these sub-drawings at each level with a targeted focus, extracting
psychological or emotional insights from their visual cues. We also introduce
an HTP knowledge base and design a feature extraction module, trained with
reinforcement learning, to generate a psychological profile for single-object
level analysis. This profile captures both holistic stylistic features and
dynamic object-specific features (such as those of the house, tree, or person),
correlating them with psychological states. Finally, we integrate these
multi-faceted information to produce a well-informed assessment that aligns
with expert-level reasoning. Our approach bridges the gap between MLLMs and
specialized expert domains, offering a structured and interpretable framework
for understanding human mental states through visual expression. Experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed PICK significantly enhances the
capability of MLLMs in psychological analysis. It is further validated as a
general framework through extensions to emotion understanding tasks.

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in deep classification techniques and in-lab
automatic optical inspection models for long-tailed or highly imbalanced data,
applying these approaches to real-world IC defect classification tasks remains
challenging. This difficulty stems from two primary factors. First, real-world
conditions, such as the high yield-rate requirements in the IC industry, result
in data distributions that are far more skewed than those found in general
public imbalanced datasets. Consequently, classifiers designed for open
imbalanced datasets often fail to perform effectively in real-world scenarios.
Second, real-world samples exhibit a mix of class-specific attributes and
class-agnostic, domain-related features. This complexity adds significant
difficulty to the classification process, particularly for highly imbalanced
datasets. To address these challenges, this paper introduces the IC-Defect-14
dataset, a large, highly imbalanced IC defect image dataset sourced from AOI
systems deployed in real-world IC production lines. This dataset is
characterized by its unique "intra-class clusters" property, which presents two
major challenges: large intra-class diversity and high inter-class similarity.
These characteristics, rarely found simultaneously in existing public datasets,
significantly degrade the performance of current state-of-the-art classifiers
for highly imbalanced data. To tackle this challenge, we propose ReCAME-Net,
which follows a multi-expert classifier framework and integrates a regional
channel attention module, metric learning losses, a hard category mining
strategy, and a knowledge distillation procedure. Extensive experimental
evaluations demonstrate that ReCAME-Net outperforms previous state-of-the-art
models on the IC-Defect-14 dataset while maintaining comparable performance and
competitiveness on general public datasets.

Conclusion: 该能力为地下表征提供了变革性工具，特别适用于碳封存、地热能源和地下水管理应用，其中了解孔隙空间的代表性形态对于实施数字岩石物理学至关重要。

Abstract: Obtaining truly representative pore-scale images that match bulk formation
properties remains a fundamental challenge in subsurface characterization, as
natural spatial heterogeneity causes extracted sub-images to deviate
significantly from core-measured values. This challenge is compounded by data
scarcity, where physical samples are only available at sparse well locations.
This study presents a multi-conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN)
framework that generates representative pore-scale images with precisely
controlled properties, addressing both the representativeness challenge and
data availability constraints. The framework was trained on thin section
samples from four depths (1879.50-1943.50 m) of a carbonate formation,
simultaneously conditioning on porosity values and depth parameters within a
single unified model. This approach captures both universal pore network
principles and depth-specific geological characteristics, from grainstone
fabrics with interparticle-intercrystalline porosity to crystalline textures
with anhydrite inclusions. The model achieved exceptional porosity control
(R^2=0.95) across all formations with mean absolute errors of 0.0099-0.0197.
Morphological validation confirmed preservation of critical pore network
characteristics including average pore radius, specific surface area, and
tortuosity, with statistical differences remaining within acceptable geological
tolerances. Most significantly, generated images demonstrated superior
representativeness with dual-constraint errors of 1.9-11.3% compared to
36.4-578% for randomly extracted real sub-images. This capability provides
transformative tools for subsurface characterization, particularly valuable for
carbon storage, geothermal energy, and groundwater management applications
where knowing the representative morphology of the pore space is critical for
implementing digital rock physics.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的MRI加速范式，从图像重建转向预测性成像，通过生成模型预测目标对比度图像作为数据驱动先验，显著提升高加速因子下的重建性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MRI采集时间过长限制了临床吞吐量，需要新的方法来加速MRI扫描过程。

Method: 使用生成模型预测目标对比度图像作为数据驱动先验，然后重建高度欠采样的数据。模型可以基于多种数据源进行条件预测，包括其他对比度图像、先前扫描图像、采集参数和患者信息。

Result: 在内部和多个公共数据集（总计14,921次扫描；1,051,904个切片）上评估，包括多通道k空间数据，在x4、x8和x12高加速因子下，该方法显著优于其他方法。

Conclusion: 该框架引入了从图像重建向预测性成像新范式的根本转变，为MRI加速提供了创新解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in artificial intelligence have created transformative
capabilities in image synthesis and generation, enabling diverse research
fields to innovate at revolutionary speed and spectrum. In this study, we
leverage this generative power to introduce a new paradigm for accelerating
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), introducing a shift from image reconstruction
to proactive predictive imaging. Despite being a cornerstone of modern patient
care, MRI's lengthy acquisition times limit clinical throughput. Our novel
framework addresses this challenge by first predicting a target contrast image,
which then serves as a data-driven prior for reconstructing highly
under-sampled data. This informative prior is predicted by a generative model
conditioned on diverse data sources, such as other contrast images, previously
scanned images, acquisition parameters, patient information. We demonstrate
this approach with two key applications: (1) reconstructing FLAIR images using
predictions from T1w and/or T2w scans, and (2) reconstructing T1w images using
predictions from previously acquired T1w scans. The framework was evaluated on
internal and multiple public datasets (total 14,921 scans; 1,051,904 slices),
including multi-channel k-space data, for a range of high acceleration factors
(x4, x8 and x12). The results demonstrate that our prediction-prior
reconstruction method significantly outperforms other approaches, including
those with alternative or no prior information. Through this framework we
introduce a fundamental shift from image reconstruction towards a new paradigm
of predictive imaging.

TL;DR: 提出了PRGCN框架，通过跨序列模式重用解决单目3D人体姿态估计问题，利用图记忆库存储姿态原型，结合Mamba和自注意力实现时空特征提取，在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频方法仅处理单个序列，未能利用人体运动中普遍存在的结构规律性和重复运动模式，限制了3D姿态估计的性能提升。

Method: PRGCN框架包含图记忆库存储姿态原型，通过注意力机制动态检索，结合记忆驱动的图卷积融合解剖约束，采用双流混合架构整合Mamba状态空间模型和自注意力。

Result: 在Human3.6M和MPI-INF-3DHP基准测试中分别达到37.1mm和13.4mm的MPJPE，表现出增强的跨域泛化能力。

Conclusion: 跨序列模式重用机制对推动该领域发展至关重要，将范式从单序列优化转向累积知识学习。

Abstract: Monocular 3D human pose estimation remains a fundamentally ill-posed inverse
problem due to the inherent depth ambiguity in 2D-to-3D lifting. While
contemporary video-based methods leverage temporal context to enhance spatial
reasoning, they operate under a critical paradigm limitation: processing each
sequence in isolation, thereby failing to exploit the strong structural
regularities and repetitive motion patterns that pervade human movement across
sequences. This work introduces the Pattern Reuse Graph Convolutional Network
(PRGCN), a novel framework that formalizes pose estimation as a problem of
pattern retrieval and adaptation. At its core, PRGCN features a graph memory
bank that learns and stores a compact set of pose prototypes, encoded as
relational graphs, which are dynamically retrieved via an attention mechanism
to provide structured priors. These priors are adaptively fused with hard-coded
anatomical constraints through a memory-driven graph convolution, ensuring
geometrical plausibility. To underpin this retrieval process with robust
spatiotemporal features, we design a dual-stream hybrid architecture that
synergistically combines the linear-complexity, local temporal modeling of
Mamba-based state-space models with the global relational capacity of
self-attention. Extensive evaluations on Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP benchmarks
demonstrate that PRGCN establishes a new state-of-the-art, achieving an MPJPE
of 37.1mm and 13.4mm, respectively, while exhibiting enhanced cross-domain
generalization capability. Our work posits that the long-overlooked mechanism
of cross-sequence pattern reuse is pivotal to advancing the field, shifting the
paradigm from per-sequence optimization towards cumulative knowledge learning.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了卫星图像中系统性缺失像素导致的表示偏差问题，提出通过重采样和插补方法来消除甲烷羽流检测中标签与覆盖率之间的虚假关联。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 卫星图像由于云层等因素存在系统性缺失像素，如果不处理这些缺失数据，会导致自动特征提取模型出现表示偏差，特别是在甲烷羽流检测中，模型可能错误地将图像覆盖率与标签关联起来。

Method: 评估了多种插补方法，并提出在训练期间使用加权重采样方案，通过在每个覆盖率区间强制类别平衡来消除标签与覆盖率之间的关联。

Result: 结果显示重采样和插补都能显著减少表示偏差，同时不会损害平衡准确率、精确率或召回率。在操作场景中，去偏模型在低覆盖率图像中检测羽流的几率更高。

Conclusion: 通过重采样和插补技术可以有效解决卫星图像中缺失像素导致的表示偏差问题，提高模型在低覆盖率图像中的检测性能。

Abstract: Most satellite images have systematically missing pixels (i.e., missing data
not at random (MNAR)) due to factors such as clouds. If not addressed, these
missing pixels can lead to representation bias in automated feature extraction
models. In this work, we show that spurious association between the label and
the number of missing values in methane plume detection can cause the model to
associate the coverage (i.e., the percentage of valid pixels in an image) with
the label, subsequently under-detecting plumes in low-coverage images. We
evaluate multiple imputation approaches to remove the dependence between the
coverage and a label. Additionally, we propose a weighted resampling scheme
during training that removes the association between the label and the coverage
by enforcing class balance in each coverage bin. Our results show that both
resampling and imputation can significantly reduce the representation bias
without hurting balanced accuracy, precision, or recall. Finally, we evaluate
the capability of the debiased models using these techniques in an operational
scenario and demonstrate that the debiased models have a higher chance of
detecting plumes in low-coverage images.

Motivation: 当前主流方法通过数据增强缓解域差异，但由于域偏移和有限域知识，模型容易陷入伪相关性陷阱，过度依赖简单分类特征而非本质的域不变表示。

Method: 提出Cauvis方法：1) 交叉注意力提示模块，通过视觉提示与交叉注意力结合缓解伪特征偏差；2) 双分支适配器，通过高频特征提取实现域适应，同时分离因果-伪特征。

Result: 在SDGOD数据集上，Cauvis相比现有域泛化方法实现了15.9-31.4%的性能提升，在复杂干扰环境中表现出显著的鲁棒性优势。

Conclusion: Cauvis方法有效解决了单源域泛化目标检测中的伪相关性问题，通过因果视觉提示实现了更好的域泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Single-source Domain Generalized Object Detection (SDGOD), as a cutting-edge
research topic in computer vision, aims to enhance model generalization
capability in unseen target domains through single-source domain training.
Current mainstream approaches attempt to mitigate domain discrepancies via data
augmentation techniques. However, due to domain shift and limited
domain-specific knowledge, models tend to fall into the pitfall of spurious
correlations. This manifests as the model's over-reliance on simplistic
classification features (e.g., color) rather than essential domain-invariant
representations like object contours. To address this critical challenge, we
propose the Cauvis (Causal Visual Prompts) method. First, we introduce a
Cross-Attention Prompts module that mitigates bias from spurious features by
integrating visual prompts with cross-attention. To address the inadequate
domain knowledge coverage and spurious feature entanglement in visual prompts
for single-domain generalization, we propose a dual-branch adapter that
disentangles causal-spurious features while achieving domain adaptation via
high-frequency feature extraction. Cauvis achieves state-of-the-art performance
with 15.9-31.4% gains over existing domain generalization methods on SDGOD
datasets, while exhibiting significant robustness advantages in complex
interference environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型通常以原生或高分辨率处理图像，导致视觉token占总token的97-99%，造成高计算成本和延迟，即使低分辨率图像已足够完成任务。

Method: 使用紧凑VLM（350M参数）提取特征并预测目标预训练VLM响应收敛到峰值能力的时刻，训练为离散分类器但推理时可插值连续分辨率进行细粒度控制。

Result: 在五个多模态基准测试中，CARES在保持任务性能的同时，将计算量减少高达80%。

Conclusion: CARES通过智能分辨率选择有效解决了VLM计算效率问题，为实际部署提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) commonly process images at native or high
resolution to remain effective across tasks. This inflates visual tokens ofter
to 97-99% of total tokens, resulting in high compute and latency, even when
low-resolution images would suffice. We introduce \emph{CARES}-a
\textbf{C}ontext-\textbf{A}ware \textbf{R}esolution \textbf{S}elector, a
lightweight preprocessing module that, given an image-query pair, predicts the
\emph{minimal} sufficient input resolution. CARES uses a compact VLM (350M) to
extract features and predict when a target pretrained VLM's response converges
to its peak ability to answer correctly. Though trained as a discrete
classifier over a set of optional resolutions, CARES interpolates continuous
resolutions at inference for fine-grained control. Across five multimodal
benchmarks spanning documents and natural images, as well as diverse target
VLMs, CARES preserves task performance while reducing compute by up to 80%.

Motivation: 现有方法在处理重叠度小或无重叠的图像对时表现不佳，视频插值生成的中间帧模糊且选择策略效率低

Method: 使用混合视频生成(HVG)结合视频插值和姿态条件新视角合成模型生成清晰中间帧，并通过特征匹配选择器(FMS)选择适合姿态估计的帧

Result: 在多个数据集上实验表明，相比现有SOTA方法，PoseCrafter显著提升了姿态估计性能，特别是在重叠度小或无重叠的情况下

Conclusion: PoseCrafter通过改进中间帧生成和选择策略，有效解决了稀疏重叠图像对的相机姿态估计难题

Abstract: Pairwise camera pose estimation from sparsely overlapping image pairs remains
a critical and unsolved challenge in 3D vision. Most existing methods struggle
with image pairs that have small or no overlap. Recent approaches attempt to
address this by synthesizing intermediate frames using video interpolation and
selecting key frames via a self-consistency score. However, the generated
frames are often blurry due to small overlap inputs, and the selection
strategies are slow and not explicitly aligned with pose estimation. To solve
these cases, we propose Hybrid Video Generation (HVG) to synthesize clearer
intermediate frames by coupling a video interpolation model with a
pose-conditioned novel view synthesis model, where we also propose a Feature
Matching Selector (FMS) based on feature correspondence to select intermediate
frames appropriate for pose estimation from the synthesized results. Extensive
experiments on Cambridge Landmarks, ScanNet, DL3DV-10K, and NAVI demonstrate
that, compared to existing SOTA methods, PoseCrafter can obviously enhance the
pose estimation performances, especially on examples with small or no overlap.

Motivation: 尽管视觉语言模型在下游任务中表现良好，但在视觉推理方面仍存在诸多限制，特别是在识别关系、理解时间序列和计数物体方面。本文旨在深入分析这些失败的根本原因。

Method: 在受控实验条件下研究了7个最先进视觉语言模型的计数能力，进行了层级分析，并针对性地仅微调输出层进行训练。

Result: 实验表明视觉语言模型对物体数量、类型、空间排列和干扰物高度敏感，层级分析显示错误主要源于最后一层表示到输出空间的映射问题。仅微调输出层可将准确率提升高达21%。

Conclusion: 视觉语言模型的推理能力可以通过针对性的输出层微调得到显著改善，这一发现在真实世界数据集上得到了验证。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have recently gained attention due to their
competitive performance on multiple downstream tasks, achieved by following
user-input instructions. However, VLMs still exhibit several limitations in
visual reasoning, such as difficulties in identifying relations (e.g., spatial,
temporal, and among objects), understanding temporal sequences (e.g., frames),
and counting objects. In this work, we go beyond score-level benchmark
evaluations of VLMs by investigating the underlying causes of their failures
and proposing a targeted approach to improve their reasoning capabilities. We
study the reasoning skills of seven state-of-the-art VLMs in the counting task
under controlled experimental conditions. Our experiments show that VLMs are
highly sensitive to the number and type of objects, their spatial arrangement,
and the co-occurrence of distractors. A layer-wise analysis reveals that errors
are due to incorrect mapping of the last-layer representation into the output
space. Our targeted training shows that fine-tuning just the output layer
improves accuracy by up to 21%. We corroborate these findings by achieving
consistent improvements on real-world datasets.

Motivation: 虽然T2I模型能生成大量合成数据，但提示词复杂度对数据效用的系统性影响尚未充分探索，需要研究提示复杂度如何影响合成数据的质量、多样性和一致性。

Method: 首先进行合成实验验证泛化难度，然后引入新的评估框架比较真实与合成数据效用，在CC12M、ImageNet-1k和DCI等数据集上分析不同T2I模型和推理时干预方法。

Result: 增加提示复杂度导致条件多样性和提示一致性下降，但减少分布偏移；推理时干预方法如提示扩展能提高生成多样性，但可能超出真实数据支持范围。

Conclusion: 提示扩展方法通过使用预训练语言模型作为似然估计器，在图像多样性和美学质量上表现最佳，甚至超过真实数据。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models offer great potential for creating virtually
limitless synthetic data, a valuable resource compared to fixed and finite real
datasets. Previous works evaluate the utility of synthetic data from T2I models
on three key desiderata: quality, diversity, and consistency. While prompt
engineering is the primary means of interacting with T2I models, the systematic
impact of prompt complexity on these critical utility axes remains
underexplored. In this paper, we first conduct synthetic experiments to
motivate the difficulty of generalization w.r.t. prompt complexity and explain
the observed difficulty with theoretical derivations. Then, we introduce a new
evaluation framework that can compare the utility of real data and synthetic
data, and present a comprehensive analysis of how prompt complexity influences
the utility of synthetic data generated by commonly used T2I models. We conduct
our study across diverse datasets, including CC12M, ImageNet-1k, and DCI, and
evaluate different inference-time intervention methods. Our synthetic
experiments show that generalizing to more general conditions is harder than
the other way round, since the former needs an estimated likelihood that is not
learned by diffusion models. Our large-scale empirical experiments reveal that
increasing prompt complexity results in lower conditional diversity and prompt
consistency, while reducing the synthetic-to-real distribution shift, which
aligns with the synthetic experiments. Moreover, current inference-time
interventions can augment the diversity of the generations at the expense of
moving outside the support of real data. Among those interventions, prompt
expansion, by deliberately using a pre-trained language model as a likelihood
estimator, consistently achieves the highest performance in both image
diversity and aesthetics, even higher than that of real data.

Conclusion: 视觉语言模型具有内在的时间感知能力，可以通过嵌入空间中的时间流形结构实现有效的时间推理，为模型的时间理解能力提供了新的视角和方法。

Abstract: Large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP have gained popularity
for their generalizable and expressive multimodal representations. By
leveraging large-scale training data with diverse textual metadata, VLMs
acquire open-vocabulary capabilities, solving tasks beyond their training
scope. This paper investigates the temporal awareness of VLMs, assessing their
ability to position visual content in time. We introduce TIME10k, a benchmark
dataset of over 10,000 images with temporal ground truth, and evaluate the
time-awareness of 37 VLMs by a novel methodology. Our investigation reveals
that temporal information is structured along a low-dimensional, non-linear
manifold in the VLM embedding space. Based on this insight, we propose methods
to derive an explicit ``timeline'' representation from the embedding space.
These representations model time and its chronological progression and thereby
facilitate temporal reasoning tasks. Our timeline approaches achieve
competitive to superior accuracy compared to a prompt-based baseline while
being computationally efficient. All code and data are available at

TL;DR: 提出HAD框架解决RGB相机和事件相机之间的时空不对称问题，通过分层对齐策略实现多模态知识蒸馏，提升目标跟踪性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RGB相机和事件相机具有互补优势（RGB提供高空间分辨率和纹理细节，事件相机提供高时间分辨率和动态范围），但两者成像机制不同导致显著的时空不对称，阻碍了有效的多模态融合。

Method: 提出分层不对称蒸馏（HAD）框架，通过分层对齐策略显式建模和缓解时空不对称，在保持学生网络计算效率和参数紧凑性的同时最小化信息损失。

Result: 大量实验表明HAD持续优于最先进方法，全面的消融研究验证了每个设计组件的有效性和必要性。

Conclusion: HAD框架成功解决了RGB和事件相机之间的时空不对称问题，为多模态目标跟踪提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: RGB cameras excel at capturing rich texture details with high spatial
resolution, whereas event cameras offer exceptional temporal resolution and a
high dynamic range (HDR). Leveraging their complementary strengths can
substantially enhance object tracking under challenging conditions, such as
high-speed motion, HDR environments, and dynamic background interference.
However, a significant spatio-temporal asymmetry exists between these two
modalities due to their fundamentally different imaging mechanisms, hindering
effective multi-modal integration. To address this issue, we propose
{Hierarchical Asymmetric Distillation} (HAD), a multi-modal knowledge
distillation framework that explicitly models and mitigates spatio-temporal
asymmetries. Specifically, HAD proposes a hierarchical alignment strategy that
minimizes information loss while maintaining the student network's
computational efficiency and parameter compactness. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that HAD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, and
comprehensive ablation studies further validate the effectiveness and necessity
of each designed component. The code will be released soon.

Motivation: 随着物体检测模型在自动驾驶等网络物理系统中的广泛应用，确保其对抗攻击安全性至关重要。现有研究主要关注图像域攻击，视频域特别是无盒设置下的攻击研究较少。

Method: 利用RGBA视频的alpha通道将恶意目标视频与良性视频融合，设计融合算法确保视觉隐蔽性和兼容性，无需访问模型架构、参数或输出。

Conclusion: 揭示了视频感知系统中先前未被探索的漏洞，强调了在对抗环境中考虑alpha通道防御的紧迫性。

Abstract: As object detection models are increasingly deployed in cyber-physical
systems such as autonomous vehicles (AVs) and surveillance platforms, ensuring
their security against adversarial threats is essential. While prior work has
explored adversarial attacks in the image domain, those attacks in the video
domain remain largely unexamined, especially in the no-box setting. In this
paper, we present {\alpha}-Cloak, the first no-box adversarial attack on object
detectors that operates entirely through the alpha channel of RGBA videos.
{\alpha}-Cloak exploits the alpha channel to fuse a malicious target video with
a benign video, resulting in a fused video that appears innocuous to human
viewers but consistently fools object detectors. Our attack requires no access
to model architecture, parameters, or outputs, and introduces no perceptible
artifacts. We systematically study the support for alpha channels across common
video formats and playback applications, and design a fusion algorithm that
ensures visual stealth and compatibility. We evaluate {\alpha}-Cloak on five
state-of-the-art object detectors, a vision-language model, and a multi-modal
large language model (Gemini-2.0-Flash), demonstrating a 100% attack success
rate across all scenarios. Our findings reveal a previously unexplored
vulnerability in video-based perception systems, highlighting the urgent need
for defenses that account for the alpha channel in adversarial settings.

Abstract: Feed-forward surround-view autonomous driving scene reconstruction offers
fast, generalizable inference ability, which faces the core challenge of
ensuring generalization while elevating novel view quality. Due to the
surround-view with minimal overlap regions, existing methods typically fail to
ensure geometric consistency and reconstruction quality for novel views. To
tackle this tension, we claim that geometric information must be learned
explicitly, and the resulting features should be leveraged to guide the
elevating of semantic quality in novel views. In this paper, we introduce
\textbf{Visual Gaussian Driving (VGD)}, a novel feed-forward end-to-end
learning framework designed to address this challenge. To achieve generalizable
geometric estimation, we design a lightweight variant of the VGGT architecture
to efficiently distill its geometric priors from the pre-trained VGGT to the
geometry branch. Furthermore, we design a Gaussian Head that fuses multi-scale
geometry tokens to predict Gaussian parameters for novel view rendering, which
shares the same patch backbone as the geometry branch. Finally, we integrate
multi-scale features from both geometry and Gaussian head branches to jointly
supervise a semantic refinement model, optimizing rendering quality through
feature-consistent learning. Experiments on nuScenes demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both objective
metrics and subjective quality under various settings, which validates VGD's
scalability and high-fidelity surround-view reconstruction.

Abstract: Multi-modal co-learning is emerging as an effective paradigm in machine
learning, enabling models to collaboratively learn from different modalities to
enhance single-modality predictions. Earth Observation (EO) represents a
quintessential domain for multi-modal data analysis, wherein diverse remote
sensors collect data to sense our planet. This unprecedented volume of data
introduces novel challenges. Specifically, the access to the same sensor
modalities at both training and inference stages becomes increasingly complex
based on real-world constraints affecting remote sensing platforms. In this
context, multi-modal co-learning presents a promising strategy to leverage the
vast amount of sensor-derived data available at the training stage to improve
single-modality models for inference-time deployment. Most current research
efforts focus on designing customized solutions for either particular
downstream tasks or specific modalities available at the inference stage. To
address this, we propose a novel multi-modal co-learning framework capable of
generalizing across various tasks without targeting a specific modality for
inference. Our approach combines contrastive and modality discriminative
learning together to guide single-modality models to structure the internal
model manifold into modality-shared and modality-specific information. We
evaluate our framework on four EO benchmarks spanning classification and
regression tasks across different sensor modalities, where only one of the
modalities available during training is accessible at inference time. Our
results demonstrate consistent predictive improvements over state-of-the-art
approaches from the recent machine learning and computer vision literature, as
well as EO-specific methods. The obtained findings validate our framework in
the single-modality inference scenarios across a diverse range of EO
applications.

Abstract: Multi-focus image fusion (MFIF) addresses the depth-of-field (DOF)
limitations of optical lenses, where only objects within a specific range
appear sharp. Although traditional and deep learning methods have advanced the
field, challenges persist, including limited training data, domain gaps from
synthetic datasets, and difficulties with regions lacking information. We
propose VAEEDOF, a novel MFIF method that uses a distilled variational
autoencoder for high-fidelity, efficient image reconstruction. Our fusion
module processes up to seven images simultaneously, enabling robust fusion
across diverse focus points. To address data scarcity, we introduce
MattingMFIF, a new syntetic 4K dataset, simulating realistic DOF effects from
real photographs. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results, generating
seamless artifact-free fused images and bridging the gap between synthetic and
real-world scenarios, offering a significant step forward in addressing complex
MFIF challenges. The code, and weights are available here:

Abstract: This paper investigates methods for estimating uncertainty in semantic
segmentation predictions derived from satellite imagery. Estimating uncertainty
for segmentation presents unique challenges compared to standard image
classification, requiring scalable methods producing per-pixel estimates. While
most research on this topic has focused on scene understanding or medical
imaging, this work benchmarks existing methods specifically for remote sensing
and Earth observation applications. Our evaluation focuses on the practical
utility of uncertainty measures, testing their ability to identify prediction
errors and noise-corrupted input image regions. Experiments are conducted on
two remote sensing datasets, PASTIS and ForTy, selected for their differences
in scale, geographic coverage, and label confidence. We perform an extensive
evaluation featuring several models, such as Stochastic Segmentation Networks
and ensembles, in combination with a number of neural architectures and
uncertainty metrics. We make a number of practical recommendations based on our

TL;DR: 提出DecAF方法，通过分解注意力融合机制将MLLM的注意力图直接转换为分割掩码，无需训练即可在视频理解分割任务中达到与训练方法相当的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在视频理解方面表现强大，但其原始注意力图存在噪声且与目标区域对齐不佳，需要一种无需训练的方法来精炼这些注意力图以实现视频分割。

Method: 提出分解注意力融合(DecAF)方法，包含对比性目标-背景融合和互补视频-帧融合两种机制，结合注意力引导的SAM2提示来获得细粒度分割掩码。

Result: DecAF在参考和推理视频目标分割基准测试中优于其他无需训练的方法，性能与基于训练的方法相当。

Conclusion: DecAF提供了一种有效的训练免费方法，能够将MLLM的注意力图直接转换为高质量的分割结果，在视频理解分割任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) demonstrate strong video
understanding by attending to visual tokens relevant to textual queries. To
directly adapt this for localization in a training-free manner, we cast video
reasoning segmentation as a video QA task and extract attention maps via
rollout mechanism. However, raw attention maps are noisy and poorly aligned
with object regions. We propose Decomposed Attention Fusion (DecAF), which
refines these maps through two mechanisms: (1) contrastive object-background
fusion and (2) complementary video-frame fusion. This method suppresses
irrelevant activations and enhances object-focused cues, enabling direct
conversion of attention maps into coarse segmentation masks. In addition, we
introduce attention-guided SAM2 prompting for obtaining fine-grained masks.
Unlike existing methods that jointly train MLLMs with SAM, our method operates
entirely without retraining. DecAF outperforms training-free methods and
achieves performance comparable to training-based methods on both referring and
reasoning VOS benchmarks. The code will be available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像伪造定位方法生成单一确定性定位图，缺乏高精度和可靠性，难以满足法医分析和安全监控等高要求应用场景的需求。

Method: 使用条件伯努利扩散模型(CBDiff)，在扩散过程中引入伯努利噪声以更好反映伪造掩码的二元稀疏特性，并提出时间步交叉注意力机制(TSCAttention)利用语义特征和时间步信息提升检测效果。

Result: 在8个公开基准数据集上的大量实验表明，CBDiff显著优于现有最先进方法，显示出强大的实际部署潜力。

Conclusion: CBDiff通过生成多个多样化定位图来更好地表示伪造分布，有效解决了篡改区域的不确定性和变异性问题，为图像伪造定位提供了更可靠和全面的解决方案。

Abstract: Image Forgery Localization (IFL) is a crucial task in image forensics, aimed
at accurately identifying manipulated or tampered regions within an image at
the pixel level. Existing methods typically generate a single deterministic
localization map, which often lacks the precision and reliability required for
high-stakes applications such as forensic analysis and security surveillance.
To enhance the credibility of predictions and mitigate the risk of errors, we
introduce an advanced Conditional Bernoulli Diffusion Model (CBDiff). Given a
forged image, CBDiff generates multiple diverse and plausible localization
maps, thereby offering a richer and more comprehensive representation of the
forgery distribution. This approach addresses the uncertainty and variability
inherent in tampered regions. Furthermore, CBDiff innovatively incorporates
Bernoulli noise into the diffusion process to more faithfully reflect the
inherent binary and sparse properties of forgery masks. Additionally, CBDiff
introduces a Time-Step Cross-Attention (TSCAttention), which is specifically
designed to leverage semantic feature guidance with temporal steps to improve
manipulation detection. Extensive experiments on eight publicly benchmark
datasets demonstrate that CBDiff significantly outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its strong potential for real-world
deployment.

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个系统性基准XBench，用于评估胸部X射线中视觉语言模型的跨模态可解释性，发现当前模型在临床可靠的地面定位方面仍有不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在医学图像理解中表现出色，但其地面定位能力（文本概念与视觉证据的对齐程度）尚未充分探索，而在医学领域可靠的定位对于可解释性和临床采用至关重要。

Method: 使用交叉注意力和基于相似性的定位图生成视觉解释，并定量评估其与放射科医生标注区域在多种病理上的对齐程度，评估了七种CLIP风格的VLM变体。

Result: 发现：(1)所有VLM变体对大型和明确病理的定位合理，但对小型或弥散病变性能显著下降；(2)在胸部X射线特定数据集上预训练的模型比通用领域训练模型对齐更好；(3)模型的整体识别能力与定位能力强相关。

Conclusion: 当前VLM尽管识别能力强，但在临床可靠的地面定位方面仍有不足，强调了在医学实践中部署前需要有针对性的可解释性基准。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have recently shown remarkable zero-shot
performance in medical image understanding, yet their grounding ability, the
extent to which textual concepts align with visual evidence, remains
underexplored. In the medical domain, however, reliable grounding is essential
for interpretability and clinical adoption. In this work, we present the first
systematic benchmark for evaluating cross-modal interpretability in chest
X-rays across seven CLIP-style VLM variants. We generate visual explanations
using cross-attention and similarity-based localization maps, and
quantitatively assess their alignment with radiologist-annotated regions across
multiple pathologies. Our analysis reveals that: (1) while all VLM variants
demonstrate reasonable localization for large and well-defined pathologies,
their performance substantially degrades for small or diffuse lesions; (2)
models that are pretrained on chest X-ray-specific datasets exhibit improved
alignment compared to those trained on general-domain data. (3) The overall
recognition ability and grounding ability of the model are strongly correlated.
These findings underscore that current VLMs, despite their strong recognition
ability, still fall short in clinically reliable grounding, highlighting the
need for targeted interpretability benchmarks before deployment in medical
practice. XBench code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的稀疏估计器在框架中无法充分适应复杂的信号规律性，对于边缘为分段C^α曲线的卡通图像，当Lipschitz指数α≤2是未知参数时，小波、曲波和Xlet框架都是次优的。

Method: 引入散射系数作为简化的卷积神经网络模型，通过联合最小化和最大化不同散射系数子集的ℓ¹范数来构建去噪估计器。

Result: 数值实验表明该去噪估计器能够达到卡通图像在所有Lipschitz指数α≤2下的极小极大渐近界。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种不同的调和分析方法来抑制信号噪声并指定函数的几何规律性，在调和分析与深度卷积网络去噪估计器之间建立了数学桥梁。

Abstract: A considerable amount of research in harmonic analysis has been devoted to
non-linear estimators of signals contaminated by additive Gaussian noise. They
are implemented by thresholding coefficients in a frame, which provide a sparse
signal representation, or by minimising their $\ell^1$ norm. However, sparse
estimators in frames are not sufficiently rich to adapt to complex signal
regularities. For cartoon images whose edges are piecewise $\bf C^\alpha$
curves, wavelet, curvelet and Xlet frames are suboptimal if the Lipschitz
exponent $\alpha \leq 2$ is an unknown parameter. Deep convolutional neural
networks have recently obtained much better numerical results, which reach the
minimax asymptotic bounds for all $\alpha$. Wavelet scattering coefficients
have been introduced as simplified convolutional neural network models. They
are computed by transforming the modulus of wavelet coefficients with a second
wavelet transform. We introduce a denoising estimator by jointly minimising and
maximising the $\ell^1$ norms of different subsets of scattering coefficients.
We prove that these $\ell^1$ norms capture different types of geometric image
regularity. Numerical experiments show that this denoising estimator reaches
the minimax asymptotic bound for cartoon images for all Lipschitz exponents
$\alpha \leq 2$. We state this numerical result as a mathematical conjecture.
It provides a different harmonic analysis approach to suppress noise from
signals, and to specify the geometric regularity of functions. It also opens a
mathematical bridge between harmonic analysis and denoising estimators with
deep convolutional network.

Conclusion: PWM范式成功整合了世界建模和轨迹规划，通过动作无关的未来状态预测有效提升了规划可靠性。

Abstract: Despite remarkable progress in driving world models, their potential for
autonomous systems remains largely untapped: the world models are mostly
learned for world simulation and decoupled from trajectory planning. While
recent efforts aim to unify world modeling and planning in a single framework,
the synergistic facilitation mechanism of world modeling for planning still
requires further exploration. In this work, we introduce a new driving paradigm
named Policy World Model (PWM), which not only integrates world modeling and
trajectory planning within a unified architecture, but is also able to benefit
planning using the learned world knowledge through the proposed action-free
future state forecasting scheme. Through collaborative state-action prediction,
PWM can mimic the human-like anticipatory perception, yielding more reliable
planning performance. To facilitate the efficiency of video forecasting, we
further introduce a dynamically enhanced parallel token generation mechanism,
equipped with a context-guided tokenizer and an adaptive dynamic focal loss.
Despite utilizing only front camera input, our method matches or exceeds
state-of-the-art approaches that rely on multi-view and multi-modal inputs.

Conclusion: GenComm提供了一种高效、可扩展的异构多智能体协作解决方案，通过生成式通信机制实现无缝感知。

Abstract: Multi-agent collaboration enhances the perception capabilities of individual
agents through information sharing. However, in real-world applications,
differences in sensors and models across heterogeneous agents inevitably lead
to domain gaps during collaboration. Existing approaches based on adaptation
and reconstruction fail to support pragmatic heterogeneous collaboration due to
two key limitations: (1) Intrusive retraining of the encoder or core modules
disrupts the established semantic consistency among agents; and (2)
accommodating new agents incurs high computational costs, limiting scalability.
To address these challenges, we present a novel Generative Communication
mechanism (GenComm) that facilitates seamless perception across heterogeneous
multi-agent systems through feature generation, without altering the original
network, and employs lightweight numerical alignment of spatial information to
efficiently integrate new agents at minimal cost. Specifically, a tailored
Deformable Message Extractor is designed to extract spatial message for each
collaborator, which is then transmitted in place of intermediate features. The
Spatial-Aware Feature Generator, utilizing a conditional diffusion model,
generates features aligned with the ego agent's semantic space while preserving
the spatial information of the collaborators. These generated features are
further refined by a Channel Enhancer before fusion. Experiments conducted on
the OPV2V-H, DAIR-V2X and V2X-Real datasets demonstrate that GenComm
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving an 81\% reduction in
both computational cost and parameter count when incorporating new agents. Our
code is available at https://github.com/jeffreychou777/GenComm.

Motivation: 解决现有时刻检索方法面临的三个关键问题：数据稀缺导致模型陷入浅层关键词特征关联、相邻事件间边界模糊、细粒度语义区分能力不足

Method: 提出两阶段训练框架：冷启动阶段使用课程学习在增强数据上建立基础边界/语义意识；蒸馏阶段引入双查询集（原始查询和主动查询），通过跨阶段蒸馏损失保持知识一致性

Result: 在多个基准测试中，AMR超越了之前的最先进方法，实现了性能提升

Conclusion: AMR框架能够在不依赖额外数据的情况下有效解决时刻检索中的边界模糊和语义混淆问题，同时保持边界和语义区分能力，显著提升模型性能

Abstract: Existing Moment Retrieval methods face three critical bottlenecks: (1) data
scarcity forces models into shallow keyword-feature associations; (2) boundary
ambiguity in transition regions between adjacent events; (3) insufficient
discrimination of fine-grained semantics (e.g., distinguishing ``kicking" vs.
``throwing" a ball). In this paper, we propose a zero-external-dependency
Augmented Moment Retrieval framework, AMR, designed to overcome local optima
caused by insufficient data annotations and the lack of robust boundary and
semantic discrimination capabilities. AMR is built upon two key insights: (1)
it resolves ambiguous boundary information and semantic confusion in existing
annotations without additional data (avoiding costly manual labeling), and (2)
it preserves boundary and semantic discriminative capabilities enhanced by
training while generalizing to real-world scenarios, significantly improving
performance. Furthermore, we propose a two-stage training framework with
cold-start and distillation adaptation. The cold-start stage employs curriculum
learning on augmented data to build foundational boundary/semantic awareness.
The distillation stage introduces dual query sets: Original Queries maintain
DETR-based localization using frozen Base Queries from the cold-start model,
while Active Queries dynamically adapt to real-data distributions. A
cross-stage distillation loss enforces consistency between Original and Base
Queries, preventing knowledge forgetting while enabling real-world
generalization. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show that AMR achieves
improved performance over prior state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) achieve strong performance on
vision-language tasks, yet their visual processing is opaque. Most black-box
evaluations measure task accuracy, but reveal little about underlying
mechanisms. Drawing on cognitive psychology, we adapt classic visual search
paradigms -- originally developed to study human perception -- to test whether
MLLMs exhibit the ``pop-out'' effect, where salient visual features are
detected independently of distractor set size. Using controlled experiments
targeting colour, size and lighting features, we find that advanced MLLMs
exhibit human-like pop-out effects in colour or size-based disjunctive (single
feature) search, as well as capacity limits for conjunctive (multiple feature)
search. We also find evidence to suggest that MLLMs, like humans, incorporate
natural scene priors such as lighting direction into object representations. We
reinforce our findings using targeted fine-tuning and mechanistic
interpretability analyses. Our work shows how visual search can serve as a
cognitively grounded diagnostic tool for evaluating perceptual capabilities in
MLLMs.

Result: MedReason-R1在CT疾病诊断中达到最先进性能，同时保持泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法通过强调全局定位和疾病细节，无需昂贵人工标注即可实现有效推理，显著提升医学诊断性能。

Abstract: General-purpose large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate strong
capabilities in generating detailed descriptions for natural images. However,
their performance in the medical domain remains suboptimal, even for relatively
straightforward tasks, primarily due to the lack of large-scale, high-quality,
specialized medical imaging datasets and the neglect of the diagnostic process
that progresses from coarse to fine-grained. To address the first issue, we
construct the CT-RATE-VQA dataset, which has 84K QA pairs. For the second
issue, we propose MedReason-R1, a medical VLM with explicit reasoning process
for disease diagnosis. MedReason-R1 incorporates a novel strategy that embeds
zoom-in disease region-of-interest areas into the image, highlighting the
crucial role of both global localization and disease-specific details in
enhancing the model's diagnostic performance. Furthermore, we introduce the
GRPO reinforcement learning framework to MedReason-R1, which enables effective
reasoning without relying on costly manual annotations. Compared to recent
general-purpose and medical VLMs, MedReason-R1 achieves state-of-the-art
performance in CT disease diagnosis while retaining generalization. The code,

TL;DR: ReAct-GS通过重要性感知的致密化准则和参数扰动机制，解决了3D高斯泼溅中的梯度稀释和基元冻结问题，有效消除了过重建伪影，在保持几何细节的同时实现了最先进的视图合成性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅在复杂场景中面临过重建伪影问题，表现为局部模糊和针状失真。现有方法归因于大规模高斯分布分割不足，但本文发现两个根本限制：致密化过程中的梯度幅度稀释和基元冻结现象。

Method: 提出ReAct-GS方法，包含：(1) 重要性感知致密化准则，整合多视角的α混合权重来重新激活复杂区域中停滞的基元增长；(2) 重新激活机制，通过自适应参数扰动来激活冻结的基元。

Result: 在多样化真实世界数据集上的综合实验表明，ReAct-GS有效消除了过重建伪影，在标准新视图合成指标上达到最先进性能，同时保持了精细的几何细节。

Conclusion: ReAct-GS通过重新激活机制解决了3D高斯泼溅的关键限制，该机制在其他3D-GS变体（如Pixel-GS）中也带来了一致的改进，展示了其广泛适用性。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) achieves real-time photorealistic novel view
synthesis, yet struggles with complex scenes due to over-reconstruction
artifacts, manifesting as local blurring and needle-shape distortions. While
recent approaches attribute these issues to insufficient splitting of
large-scale Gaussians, we identify two fundamental limitations: gradient
magnitude dilution during densification and the primitive frozen phenomenon,
where essential Gaussian densification is inhibited in complex regions while
suboptimally scaled Gaussians become trapped in local optima. To address these
challenges, we introduce ReAct-GS, a method founded on the principle of
re-activation. Our approach features: (1) an importance-aware densification
criterion incorporating $\alpha$-blending weights from multiple viewpoints to
re-activate stalled primitive growth in complex regions, and (2) a
re-activation mechanism that revitalizes frozen primitives through adaptive
parameter perturbations. Comprehensive experiments across diverse real-world
datasets demonstrate that ReAct-GS effectively eliminates over-reconstruction
artifacts and achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard novel view
synthesis metrics while preserving intricate geometric details. Additionally,
our re-activation mechanism yields consistent improvements when integrated with
other 3D-GS variants such as Pixel-GS, demonstrating its broad applicability.

Method: CST通过集成一个曲线提取模块来增强基线模型，提供拓扑监督，从而在训练中保持结构一致性。该框架可以无缝集成到现有方法中，如CycleGAN和UNSB。

Result: 在光学相干断层扫描血管成像、彩色眼底和X射线冠状动脉造影三种成像模态上的综合评估表明，CST提高了转换的保真度，并实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 通过增强学习映射中的几何完整性，CST为医学成像中曲线结构感知的跨域转换建立了一个有原则的途径。

Abstract: Unpaired image-to-image translation has emerged as a crucial technique in
medical imaging, enabling cross-modality synthesis, domain adaptation, and data
augmentation without costly paired datasets. Yet, existing approaches often
distort fine curvilinear structures, such as microvasculature, undermining both
diagnostic reliability and quantitative analysis. This limitation is
consequential in ophthalmic and vascular imaging, where subtle morphological
changes carry significant clinical meaning. We propose Curvilinear
Structure-preserving Translation (CST), a general framework that explicitly
preserves fine curvilinear structures during unpaired translation by
integrating structure consistency into the training. Specifically, CST augments
baseline models with a curvilinear extraction module for topological
supervision. It can be seamlessly incorporated into existing methods. We
integrate it into CycleGAN and UNSB as two representative backbones.
Comprehensive evaluation across three imaging modalities: optical coherence
tomography angiography, color fundus and X-ray coronary angiography
demonstrates that CST improves translation fidelity and achieves
state-of-the-art performance. By reinforcing geometric integrity in learned
mappings, CST establishes a principled pathway toward curvilinear
structure-aware cross-domain translation in medical imaging.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Ensemble-CAM的新技术，为基于深度学习的活体检测系统提供视觉解释，以提高系统的透明度和可信度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的深度学习活体检测系统虽然有效，但大多作为黑盒运行，决策过程不透明。需要解释性技术来理解系统判断生物特征图像真伪的原因。

Method: 提出了Ensemble-CAM技术，通过视觉解释展示深度学习模型在判断面部图像真伪时关注的关键区域。

Result: 该方法能够为基于深度学习的面部活体检测系统提供详细的视觉解释，揭示系统决策的依据。

Conclusion: Ensemble-CAM技术增强了深度学习活体检测系统的透明度和可信度，有助于用户更好地理解系统行为。

Abstract: Presentation attacks represent a critical security threat where adversaries
use fake biometric data, such as face, fingerprint, or iris images, to gain
unauthorized access to protected systems. Various presentation attack detection
(PAD) systems have been designed leveraging deep learning (DL) models to
mitigate this type of threat. Despite their effectiveness, most of the DL
models function as black boxes - their decisions are opaque to their users. The
purpose of explainability techniques is to provide detailed information about
the reason behind the behavior or decision of DL models. In particular, visual
explanation is necessary to better understand the decisions or predictions of
DL-based PAD systems and determine the key regions due to which a biometric
image is considered real or fake by the system. In this work, a novel
technique, Ensemble-CAM, is proposed for providing visual explanations for the
decisions made by deep learning-based face PAD systems. Our goal is to improve
DL-based face PAD systems by providing a better understanding of their
behavior. Our provided visual explanations will enhance the transparency and
trustworthiness of DL-based face PAD systems.

*Kuai Yu,Crystal Su,Xiang Liu,Judah Goldfeder,Mingyuan Shao,Hod Lipson*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LyTimeT是一个两阶段框架，通过时空注意力机制和稳定性约束从高维视频中提取可解释的动态变量表示，有效抑制视觉干扰因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从高维视频中提取系统真实动态变量面临背景运动、遮挡和纹理变化等视觉干扰因素的挑战，需要开发能够学习稳健潜在表示的方法。

Method: 第一阶段使用时序变换器自编码器，通过全局注意力关注动态相关区域；第二阶段通过线性相关性分析选择物理意义维度，并使用李雅普诺夫稳定性正则化器优化转移动态。

Result: 在五个合成基准和四个真实世界动态系统上的实验表明，LyTimeT在互信息和内在维度估计上最接近真实值，对背景扰动保持不变性，在CNN和纯变换器基线中实现最低分析均方误差。

Conclusion: 结合时空注意力与稳定性约束可以产生既准确又物理可解释的预测模型。

Abstract: Extracting the true dynamical variables of a system from high-dimensional
video is challenging due to distracting visual factors such as background
motion, occlusions, and texture changes. We propose LyTimeT, a two-phase
framework for interpretable variable extraction that learns robust and stable
latent representations of dynamical systems. In Phase 1, LyTimeT employs a
spatio-temporal TimeSformer-based autoencoder that uses global attention to
focus on dynamically relevant regions while suppressing nuisance variation,
enabling distraction-robust latent state learning and accurate long-horizon
video prediction. In Phase 2, we probe the learned latent space, select the
most physically meaningful dimensions using linear correlation analysis, and
refine the transition dynamics with a Lyapunov-based stability regularizer to
enforce contraction and reduce error accumulation during roll-outs. Experiments
on five synthetic benchmarks and four real-world dynamical systems, including
chaotic phenomena, show that LyTimeT achieves mutual information and intrinsic
dimension estimates closest to ground truth, remains invariant under background
perturbations, and delivers the lowest analytical mean squared error among
CNN-based (TIDE) and transformer-only baselines. Our results demonstrate that
combining spatio-temporal attention with stability constraints yields
predictive models that are not only accurate but also physically interpretable.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出ADQ框架解决QAT中的激活分布非均匀和权重量化码本不匹配问题，通过自适应权重量化方案和硬件友好的激活映射，在低比特量化下实现优异性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有量化感知训练方法面临两个主要挑战：激活分布高度非均匀，以及权重量化中使用的静态、不匹配的码本

Method: 提出自适应分布感知量化(ADQ)框架，包含三个创新：基于分位数的码本初始化、基于指数移动平均的在线码本适应机制、基于敏感度的混合精度分配策略，以及硬件友好的非均匀到均匀激活映射

Result: 在ImageNet上，ADQ使ResNet-18在平均2.81比特下达到71.512%的Top-1准确率，优于同类方法；在CIFAR-10上的消融研究验证了各组件有效性

Conclusion: ADQ框架通过自适应权重量化和硬件友好激活映射，有效解决了量化感知训练中的分布非均匀和码本不匹配问题，在低比特量化下实现了优异性能

Abstract: Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) is a critical technique for deploying deep
neural networks on resource-constrained devices. However, existing methods
often face two major challenges: the highly non-uniform distribution of
activations and the static, mismatched codebooks used in weight quantization.
To address these challenges, we propose Adaptive Distribution-aware
Quantization (ADQ), a mixed-precision quantization framework that employs a
differentiated strategy. The core of ADQ is a novel adaptive weight
quantization scheme comprising three key innovations: (1) a quantile-based
initialization method that constructs a codebook closely aligned with the
initial weight distribution; (2) an online codebook adaptation mechanism based
on Exponential Moving Average (EMA) to dynamically track distributional shifts;
and (3) a sensitivity-informed strategy for mixed-precision allocation. For
activations, we integrate a hardware-friendly non-uniform-to-uniform mapping
scheme. Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method. On
ImageNet, ADQ enables a ResNet-18 to achieve 71.512% Top-1 accuracy with an
average bit-width of only 2.81 bits, outperforming state-of-the-art methods
under comparable conditions. Furthermore, detailed ablation studies on CIFAR-10
systematically demonstrate the individual contributions of each innovative
component, validating the rationale and effectiveness of our design.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniMotion-X是一个多模态人体运动生成框架，采用自回归扩散变换器统一处理文本到动作、音乐到舞蹈、语音到手势等多种任务，并支持运动预测、补全等时空控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以统一处理多样化的多模态人体运动生成任务，且缺乏对生成内容一致性和时空动态的控制能力。

Method: 提出使用参考运动作为条件信号，采用渐进式弱到强混合条件训练策略处理多模态冲突，并构建了最大的统一多模态运动数据集OmniMoCap-X。

Result: 实验证明OmniMotion-X在多个多模态任务上显著超越现有方法，实现了最先进的性能，能够生成真实、连贯且可控的长时运动。

Conclusion: OmniMotion-X提供了一个高效统一的多模态运动生成框架，通过创新的条件信号和训练策略，实现了高质量、一致且可控的人体运动生成。

Abstract: This paper introduces OmniMotion-X, a versatile multimodal framework for
whole-body human motion generation, leveraging an autoregressive diffusion
transformer in a unified sequence-to-sequence manner. OmniMotion-X efficiently
supports diverse multimodal tasks, including text-to-motion, music-to-dance,
speech-to-gesture, and global spatial-temporal control scenarios (e.g., motion
prediction, in-betweening, completion, and joint/trajectory-guided synthesis),
as well as flexible combinations of these tasks. Specifically, we propose the
use of reference motion as a novel conditioning signal, substantially enhancing
the consistency of generated content, style, and temporal dynamics crucial for
realistic animations. To handle multimodal conflicts, we introduce a
progressive weak-to-strong mixed-condition training strategy. To enable
high-quality multimodal training, we construct OmniMoCap-X, the largest unified
multimodal motion dataset to date, integrating 28 publicly available MoCap
sources across 10 distinct tasks, standardized to the SMPL-X format at 30 fps.
To ensure detailed and consistent annotations, we render sequences into videos
and use GPT-4o to automatically generate structured and hierarchical captions,
capturing both low-level actions and high-level semantics. Extensive
experimental evaluations confirm that OmniMotion-X significantly surpasses
existing methods, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance across multiple
multimodal tasks and enabling the interactive generation of realistic,
coherent, and controllable long-duration motions.

TL;DR: 提出了CPL-NC框架，一种针对视觉语言模型的轻量级测试时自适应方法，通过类感知原型缓存和负对比学习机制，解决长尾分布中的原型退化和语义相似类混淆问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在分布偏移时性能下降，现有测试时自适应方法忽略了长尾分布中的原型退化和语义相似类混淆两个关键挑战。

Method: 使用类感知原型缓存模块动态调整每类容量，包含激活历史驱动的容量分配和原型再生机制；采用负对比学习机制识别和约束难负样本；采用非对称优化策略，仅优化文本原型而固定视觉特征。

Result: 在15个基准测试中，CPL-NC在ResNet-50和ViT-B/16骨干网络上均优于现有测试时自适应方法。

Conclusion: CPL-NC框架有效提升了视觉语言模型在分布偏移下的泛化能力，通过原型管理和负对比学习解决了长尾分布和类混淆问题。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate impressive zero-shot generalization
through large-scale image-text pretraining, yet their performance can drop once
the deployment distribution diverges from the training distribution. To address
this, Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods update models using unlabeled target
data. However, existing approaches often ignore two key challenges: prototype
degradation in long-tailed distributions and confusion between semantically
similar classes. To tackle these issues, we propose \textbf{C}lass-Aware
\textbf{P}rototype \textbf{L}earning with \textbf{N}egative
\textbf{C}ontrast(\textbf{CPL-NC}), a lightweight TTA framework designed
specifically for VLMs to enhance generalization under distribution shifts.
CPL-NC introduces a \textit{Class-Aware Prototype Cache} Module that
dynamically adjusts per-class capacity based on test-time frequency and
activation history, with a rejuvenation mechanism for inactive classes to
retain rare-category knowledge. Additionally, a \textit{Negative Contrastive
Learning} Mechanism identifies and constrains hard visual-textual negatives to
improve class separability. The framework employs asymmetric optimization,
refining only textual prototypes while anchoring on stable visual features.
Experiments on 15 benchmarks show that CPL-NC consistently outperforms prior
TTA methods across both ResNet-50 and ViT-B/16 backbones.

Conclusion: Pico-Banana-400K为训练和基准测试下一代文本引导图像编辑模型提供了强大基础，推动了多模态编辑研究的发展。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal models have demonstrated remarkable text-guided
image editing capabilities, with systems like GPT-4o and Nano-Banana setting
new benchmarks. However, the research community's progress remains constrained
by the absence of large-scale, high-quality, and openly accessible datasets
built from real images. We introduce Pico-Banana-400K, a comprehensive
400K-image dataset for instruction-based image editing. Our dataset is
constructed by leveraging Nano-Banana to generate diverse edit pairs from real
photographs in the OpenImages collection. What distinguishes Pico-Banana-400K
from previous synthetic datasets is our systematic approach to quality and
diversity. We employ a fine-grained image editing taxonomy to ensure
comprehensive coverage of edit types while maintaining precise content
preservation and instruction faithfulness through MLLM-based quality scoring
and careful curation. Beyond single turn editing, Pico-Banana-400K enables
research into complex editing scenarios. The dataset includes three specialized
subsets: (1) a 72K-example multi-turn collection for studying sequential
editing, reasoning, and planning across consecutive modifications; (2) a
56K-example preference subset for alignment research and reward model training;
and (3) paired long-short editing instructions for developing instruction
rewriting and summarization capabilities. By providing this large-scale,
high-quality, and task-rich resource, Pico-Banana-400K establishes a robust
foundation for training and benchmarking the next generation of text-guided
image editing models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单目深度估计领域缺乏标准化的评估方法，现有评估指标的选择众多但权衡和行为理解不足，需要系统分析这些指标对地面真值扰动的敏感性，并与人类判断进行比较。

Method: 通过定量分析现有指标对各种地面真值扰动的敏感性，特别关注与人类判断的比较，并基于分析结果开发了基于相对表面法线的新指标、新的深度可视化工具以及创建复合指标的原理方法。

Result: 分析显示现有指标对曲率扰动（如使平坦表面波浪化）严重不敏感，新提出的基于相对表面法线的指标能更好地检测这种扰动，且复合指标方法能更好地与人类判断对齐。

Conclusion: 现有深度估计评估指标存在严重缺陷，特别是对曲率扰动的敏感性不足，提出的新指标和工具能够改善评估质量，促进更标准化的深度估计评估实践。

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation is an important task with rapid progress, but how
to evaluate it remains an open question, as evidenced by a lack of
standardization in existing literature and a large selection of evaluation
metrics whose trade-offs and behaviors are not well understood. This paper
contributes a novel, quantitative analysis of existing metrics in terms of
their sensitivity to various types of perturbations of ground truth,
emphasizing comparison to human judgment. Our analysis reveals that existing
metrics are severely under-sensitive to curvature perturbation such as making
flat surfaces wavy. To remedy this, we introduce a new metric based on relative
surface normals, along with new depth visualization tools and a principled
method to create composite metrics with better human alignment. Code and data

videos are sourced from existing datasets and egocentric real-world recordings,
with high-quality human annotations collected through a multi-stage pipeline.
ITTO captures the motion complexity, occlusion patterns, and object diversity

current benchmarks. We conduct a rigorous analysis of state-of-the-art tracking
methods on ITTO, breaking down performance along key axes of motion complexity.
Our findings reveal that existing trackers struggle with these challenges,
particularly in re-identifying points after occlusion, highlighting critical
failure modes. These results point to the need for new modeling approaches
tailored to real-world dynamics. We envision ITTO as a foundation testbed for
advancing point tracking and guiding the development of more robust tracking

with separate models for entity recognition and disambiguation, which can be
computationally intensive and less effective. We propose a fine-tuned model
that jointly integrates entity recognition and disambiguation in a unified

the context of entity mentions, yielding better performance in entity
disambiguation. We evaluated our approach on benchmark datasets and compared

Conclusion: MiniLM在地球科学社区具有巨大潜力，可用于事实检索、趋势分析、矛盾分析和教育目的。

Abstract: Recent advancements in natural language processing, particularly with large
language models (LLMs), are transforming how scientists engage with the
literature. While the adoption of LLMs is increasing, concerns remain regarding
potential information biases and computational costs. Rather than LLMs, I
developed a framework to evaluate the feasibility of precise, rapid, and
cost-effective information retrieval from extensive geoscience literature using
freely available small language models (MiniLMs). A curated corpus of
approximately 77 million high-quality sentences, extracted from 95 leading
peer-reviewed geoscience journals such as Geophysical Research Letters and
Earth and Planetary Science Letters published during years 2000 to 2024, was
constructed. MiniLMs enable a computationally efficient approach for extracting
relevant domain-specific information from these corpora through semantic search
techniques and sentence-level indexing. This approach, unlike LLMs such as
ChatGPT-4 that often produces generalized responses, excels at identifying
substantial amounts of expert-verified information with established,
multi-disciplinary sources, especially for information with quantitative
findings. Furthermore, by analyzing emotional tone via sentiment analysis and
topical clusters through unsupervised clustering within sentences, MiniLM
provides a powerful tool for tracking the evolution of conclusions, research
priorities, advancements, and emerging questions within geoscience communities.
Overall, MiniLM holds significant potential within the geoscience community for
applications such as fact and image retrievals, trend analyses, contradiction
analyses, and educational purposes.

Conclusion: 这项工作提供了一个实用的评估工具，并对当代LLM的指令遵循能力进行了最全面的实证分析之一。

Abstract: Despite widespread deployment of Large Language Models, systematic evaluation
of instruction-following capabilities remains challenging. While comprehensive
benchmarks exist, focused assessments that quickly diagnose specific
instruction adherence patterns are valuable. As newer models may be trained on
existing benchmarks, novel evaluation approaches are needed to assess genuine
capabilities rather than memorized performance. This paper presents a
streamlined evaluation framework using twenty carefully designed prompts to
assess LLM instruction-following across diverse task categories. We demonstrate
this framework through a large-scale empirical study conducted on October 14,
2025, testing 256 verified working models from 331 available via OpenRouter. To
ensure methodological rigor and prevent selection bias, we first verified each
model's basic functionality before inclusion. Unlike large-scale benchmarks
requiring extensive computational resources, our approach offers a practical
diagnostic tool researchers and practitioners can readily apply. Our
methodology builds upon verifiable instructions while introducing a compact
test suite balancing comprehensiveness with efficiency. Each prompt targets
distinct aspects of instruction following, including format compliance, content
constraints, logical sequencing, and multi-step task execution. We evaluate
models from major providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta, Mistral) and
emerging implementations (Qwen, DeepSeek, community models), providing
comparative performance analysis. Our findings reveal consistent failure modes
and identify specific instruction types posing particular challenges. This work
contributes both a practical evaluation tool and one of the most comprehensive
empirical analyses of instruction-following capabilities across the
contemporary LLM landscape.

Motivation: 虽然机器翻译在高资源语言上取得了显著进展，但低资源语言如锡尔赫特语仍然研究不足，需要开发包容性语言技术。

Method: 通过微调多语言Transformer模型（如mBART-50和MarianMT），并与零样本大语言模型进行对比实验。

Abstract: Machine Translation (MT) has advanced from rule-based and statistical methods
to neural approaches based on the Transformer architecture. While these methods
have achieved impressive results for high-resource languages, low-resource
varieties such as Sylheti remain underexplored. In this work, we investigate
Bengali-to-Sylheti translation by fine-tuning multilingual Transformer models
and comparing them with zero-shot large language models (LLMs). Experimental
results demonstrate that fine-tuned models significantly outperform LLMs, with
mBART-50 achieving the highest translation adequacy and MarianMT showing the
strongest character-level fidelity. These findings highlight the importance of
task-specific adaptation for underrepresented languages and contribute to
ongoing efforts toward inclusive language technologies.

Result: 编码器模型在AUROC指标上达到0.97-0.99，宏F1得分0.89-0.94，同时将延迟降低8-12倍，峰值VRAM使用减少3-5倍。在跨生成器迁移和对抗性转换下，性能保持≥92%的干净AUROC。

Conclusion: 对于二元分类任务，小型语言模型（SLMs）在性能上远超大型语言模型（LLMs），同时仅使用一小部分计算资源，证明了SLMs在机器生成内容检测中的有效性。

Abstract: The prevalence of Large Language Models (LLMs) for generating multilingual
text and source code has only increased the imperative for machine-generated
content detectors to be accurate and efficient across domains. Current
detectors, predominantly utilizing zero-shot methods, such as Fast DetectGPT or
GPTZero, either incur high computational cost or lack sufficient accuracy,
often with a trade-off between the two, leaving room for further improvement.
To address these gaps, we propose the fine-tuning of encoder-only Small
Language Models (SLMs), in particular, the pre-trained models of RoBERTA and
CodeBERTa using specialized datasets on source code and other natural language
to prove that for the task of binary classification, SLMs outperform LLMs by a
huge margin whilst using a fraction of compute. Our encoders achieve AUROC $=
0.97$ to $0.99$ and macro-F1 $0.89$ to $0.94$ while reducing latency by
$8$-$12\times$ and peak VRAM by $3$-$5\times$ at $512$-token inputs. Under
cross-generator shifts and adversarial transformations (paraphrase,
back-translation; code formatting/renaming), performance retains $\geq 92%$ of
clean AUROC. We release training and evaluation scripts with seeds and configs;
a reproducibility checklist is also included.

### [81] [Improving Topic Modeling of Social Media Short Texts with Rephrasing: A Case Study of COVID-19 Related Tweets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18908)
*Wangjiaxuan Xin,Shuhua Yin,Shi Chen,Yaorong Ge*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TM-Rephrase是一个模型无关的框架，利用大语言模型在主题建模前将原始推文重述为更标准化的正式语言，显著提升了COVID-19相关推文主题建模的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体短文本的简短性、非正式性和噪声往往阻碍传统主题建模的效果，产生难以解释的不连贯或冗余主题。

Method: 开发TM-Rephrase框架，使用LLMs对原始推文进行重述，研究两种重述策略（通用重述和口语到正式重述）对多种主题建模方法的影响。

Result: TM-Rephrase提高了主题建模的三个性能指标（主题连贯性、主题独特性和主题多样性），同时减少了大多数主题建模算法的主题冗余，其中口语到正式策略效果最佳，特别是对LDA算法。

Conclusion: 该研究为公共卫生相关社交媒体分析中的主题建模提供了一种模型无关的增强方法，对改善健康危机及其他重要领域公共话语理解具有广泛意义。

Abstract: Social media platforms such as Twitter (now X) provide rich data for
analyzing public discourse, especially during crises such as the COVID-19
pandemic. However, the brevity, informality, and noise of social media short
texts often hinder the effectiveness of traditional topic modeling, producing
incoherent or redundant topics that are often difficult to interpret. To
address these challenges, we have developed \emph{TM-Rephrase}, a
model-agnostic framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to
rephrase raw tweets into more standardized and formal language prior to topic
modeling. Using a dataset of 25,027 COVID-19-related Twitter posts, we
investigate the effects of two rephrasing strategies, general- and
colloquial-to-formal-rephrasing, on multiple topic modeling methods. Results
demonstrate that \emph{TM-Rephrase} improves three metrics measuring topic
modeling performance (i.e., topic coherence, topic uniqueness, and topic
diversity) while reducing topic redundancy of most topic modeling algorithms,
with the colloquial-to-formal strategy yielding the greatest performance gains
and especially for the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm. This study
contributes to a model-agnostic approach to enhancing topic modeling in public
health related social media analysis, with broad implications for improved
understanding of public discourse in health crisis as well as other important
domains.

TL;DR: 提出了正交多样性感知选择(ODiS)算法，通过PCA分解相关指标为正交特征维度，从每个维度选择高质量数据，确保预训练数据既高质量又多样化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于分数选择的方法会压缩相关维度，导致选择的数据看似高质量但缺乏多样性，造成数据集分数与下游性能之间的非单调关系。

Method: 1) 从语言质量、知识质量、理解难度等多维度评估数据；2) 使用PCA对多维分数进行去相关，得到正交评估维度；3) 为每个维度训练Roberta评分器；4) 从每个正交维度选择高分数据构建训练集。

Result: ODiS选择的数据维度间重叠率低于2%，证实了维度的正交性。使用ODiS选择数据训练的模型在下游基准测试中显著优于其他基线方法。

Conclusion: 正交、多样性感知的数据选择对LLM至关重要，ODiS算法能有效确保预训练数据的质量和多样性。

Abstract: High-quality pre-training data is crutial for large language models, where
quality captures factual reliability and semantic value, and diversity ensures
broad coverage and distributional heterogeneity. Existing approaches typically
rely on single or multiple-dimensional score-based selection. However, directly
selecting top-scored data often degrades performance, and sampling from a
broader range is required to recover results. The above non-monotonicity
between dataset scores and downstream benchmark results reveals a fundamental
bias: score-based methods collapse correlated dimensions, causing top-scored
data to appear high-quality while systematically overlooking diversity. We
argue that ensuring diversity requires decomposing correlated metrics into
orthogonal feature dimensions, from which the top-scored data can be directly
selected. Therefore, we proposed the Orthogonal Diversity-Aware Selection
(ODiS) algorithm, which preserves both quality and diversity during data
selection. First, ODiS evaluates data from multiple dimensions, covering
language quality, knowledge quality, and comprehension difficulty. The
multi-dimensional scores are then decorrelated via Principal Component Analysis
(PCA), yielding orthogonal evaluation dimensions. For each dimension, a
Roberta-based scorer is trained to regress the data onto PCA-projected scores,
enabling scalable inference on large corpora. Finally, ODiS constructs the
training dataset by selecting top-scored data within each orthogonal dimension,
thereby ensuring both quality and diversity. Empirical results show that
ODiS-selected data exhibit less than 2\% inter-dimension overlap, confirming
orthogonality between dimensions. More importantly, models trained with
ODiS-selected data significantly outperform other baselines on downstream
benchmarks, highlighting the necessity of orthogonal, diversity-aware data
selection for LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种动态可逆的剪枝框架，通过检测上下文感知的神经元激活并应用自适应掩码来调节生成过程中的影响，实现推理时的细粒度偏见缓解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型内部表示中嵌入的不良行为会损害公平性、导致不一致性漂移、放大有害内容，并在长对话中传播不良模式。现有方法计算成本高、不可逆且难以适应新对话上下文。

Method: 使用动态可逆的剪枝框架，检测上下文感知的神经元激活，应用自适应掩码来调节生成过程中的神经元影响，实现推理时的偏见缓解。

Result: 该方法在多语言单轮和多轮对话中实现了细粒度、内存感知的偏见缓解，同时保持了知识完整性和更一致的行为。

Conclusion: 提出的推理时解决方案能够实现动态公平控制，为现实世界对话AI提供了灵活、透明的偏见缓解方法。

Abstract: Large language models often display undesirable behaviors embedded in their
internal representations, undermining fairness, inconsistency drift,
amplification of harmful content, and the propagation of unwanted patterns
during extended dialogue and conversations. Although training-time or
data-centric methods attempt to reduce these effects, they are computationally
expensive, irreversible once deployed, and slow to adapt to new conversational
contexts. Pruning-based methods provide a flexible and transparent way to
reduce bias by adjusting the neurons responsible for certain behaviors.
However, most existing approaches are static; once a neuron is removed, the
model loses the ability to adapt when the conversation or context changes. To
address this, we propose a dynamic, reversible, pruning-based framework that
detects context-aware neuron activations and applies adaptive masking to
modulate their influence during generation. Our inference-time solution
provides fine-grained, memory-aware mitigation with knowledge-preserved, more
coherent behavior across multilingual single- and multi-turn dialogues,
enabling dynamic fairness control in real-world conversational AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型正在从单模态理解向视觉、音频和语言模态的统一发展，但单模态与全模态之间的相关性尚不明确，需要全面评估来推动全模态模型的智能演进。

Method: 构建了包含1880个人工标注样本、44种任务类型的基准测试，并创新性地引入了多步骤开放式问题类型来更好地评估复杂推理任务。

Result: 实验结果显示跨模态与单模态性能之间存在组合规律，全模态能力在弱模型上表现为瓶颈效应，而在强模型上表现出协同促进作用。

Conclusion: MMAO-Bench是一个高质量、多样化的全模态基准测试，能够有效评估单模态和全模态理解能力，揭示了全模态能力在不同模型上的不同表现模式。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Languages models have been progressing from uni-modal
understanding toward unifying visual, audio and language modalities,
collectively termed omni models. However, the correlation between uni-modal and
omni-modal remains unclear, which requires comprehensive evaluation to drive
omni model's intelligence evolution. In this work, we propose a novel, high
quality and diversity omni model benchmark, MultiModal All in One Benchmark
(MMAO-Bench), which effectively assesses both uni-modal and omni-modal
understanding capabilities. The benchmark consists of 1880 human curated
samples, across 44 task types, and a innovative multi-step open-ended question
type that better assess complex reasoning tasks. Experimental result shows the
compositional law between cross-modal and uni-modal performance and the
omni-modal capability manifests as a bottleneck effect on weak models, while
exhibiting synergistic promotion on strong models.

TL;DR: 提出基于Transformer预训练语言模型的可解释性虚假信息检测流程，通过两阶段微调策略优化RoBERTa和DistilBERT，在保持性能的同时显著降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线平台虚假信息快速传播破坏信任并阻碍知情决策，需要开发可解释且计算高效的检测方法。

Method: 采用两阶段微调策略：先冻结主干网络训练分类头，然后逐步解冻主干层并应用分层学习率衰减。集成LIME进行token级解释和SHAP进行全局特征归因。

Result: 在COVID Fake News和FakeNewsNet GossipCop数据集上，DistilBERT达到与RoBERTa相当的准确率，同时显著减少计算资源需求。

Conclusion: 预训练语言模型结合原则性微调和可解释性方法，可构建可扩展、可信赖的虚假信息检测框架。

Abstract: The rapid spread of misinformation on online platforms undermines trust among
individuals and hinders informed decision making. This paper shows an
explainable and computationally efficient pipeline to detect misinformation
using transformer-based pretrained language models (PLMs). We optimize both
RoBERTa and DistilBERT using a two-step strategy: first, we freeze the backbone
and train only the classification head; then, we progressively unfreeze the
backbone layers while applying layer-wise learning rate decay. On two
real-world benchmark datasets, COVID Fake News and FakeNewsNet GossipCop, we
test the proposed approach with a unified protocol of preprocessing and
stratified splits. To ensure transparency, we integrate the Local Interpretable
Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) at the token level to present token-level
rationales and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) at the global feature
attribution level. It demonstrates that DistilBERT achieves accuracy comparable
to RoBERTa while requiring significantly less computational resources. This
work makes two key contributions: (1) it quantitatively shows that a
lightweight PLM can maintain task performance while substantially reducing
computational cost, and (2) it presents an explainable pipeline that retrieves
faithful local and global justifications without compromising performance. The
results suggest that PLMs combined with principled fine-tuning and
interpretability can be an effective framework for scalable, trustworthy
misinformation detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大型语言模型在复杂任务中的创造力通常需要难以扩展的人工评估，需要开发可扩展的评估方法

Method: 通过符号化角色网络分析叙事中的社会结构，比较了4个领先LLM生成的1200多个故事和人类写作语料库的网络属性

Result: LLM生成的故事在密度、聚类和符号化边权重等网络属性上表现出对紧密积极关系的强烈偏好

Conclusion: 该方法为评估当前和未来LLM在创意故事讲述中的局限性和倾向提供了有价值的工具

Abstract: Evaluating the creative capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in
complex tasks often requires human assessments that are difficult to scale. We
introduce a novel, scalable methodology for evaluating LLM story generation by
analyzing underlying social structures in narratives as signed character
networks. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we conduct a large-scale
comparative analysis using networks from over 1,200 stories, generated by four
leading LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4o mini, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Gemini 1.5 Flash) and a
human-written corpus. Our findings, based on network properties like density,
clustering, and signed edge weights, show that LLM-generated stories
consistently exhibit a strong bias toward tightly-knit, positive relationships,
which aligns with findings from prior research using human assessment. Our
proposed approach provides a valuable tool for evaluating limitations and
tendencies in the creative storytelling of current and future LLMs.

TL;DR: SLIM框架通过分离搜索和浏览工具，并定期总结轨迹，解决了长轨迹代理搜索中的上下文限制问题，在保持性能的同时显著降低了成本和工具调用次数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代理搜索框架在处理长轨迹时面临上下文限制问题，包括积累冗长嘈杂内容、超出上下文窗口和工具预算、过早停止等，限制了深度研究系统的应用。

Method: 提出SLIM框架，将检索分离为独立的搜索和浏览工具，并定期总结轨迹，保持上下文简洁，实现更长更专注的搜索。

Result: 在长视野任务中，SLIM以显著更低的成本和更少的工具调用达到可比性能。使用o3作为基础模型时，在BrowseComp和HLE上分别达到56%和31%，优于所有开源框架，同时工具调用减少4-6倍。

Conclusion: SLIM框架在长轨迹代理搜索中表现出更少的幻觉，作者还发布了自动细粒度轨迹分析流水线和错误分类法，为未来长视野代理系统提供参考。

Abstract: Long-horizon agentic search requires iteratively exploring the web over long
trajectories and synthesizing information across many sources, and is the
foundation for enabling powerful applications like deep research systems. In
this work, we show that popular agentic search frameworks struggle to scale to
long trajectories primarily due to context limitations-they accumulate long,
noisy content, hit context window and tool budgets, or stop early. Then, we
introduce SLIM (Simple Lightweight Information Management), a simple framework
that separates retrieval into distinct search and browse tools, and
periodically summarizes the trajectory, keeping context concise while enabling
longer, more focused searches. On long-horizon tasks, SLIM achieves comparable
performance at substantially lower cost and with far fewer tool calls than
strong open-source baselines across multiple base models. Specifically, with o3
as the base model, SLIM achieves 56% on BrowseComp and 31% on HLE,
outperforming all open-source frameworks by 8 and 4 absolute points,
respectively, while incurring 4-6x fewer tool calls. Finally, we release an
automated fine-grained trajectory analysis pipeline and error taxonomy for
characterizing long-horizon agentic search frameworks; SLIM exhibits fewer
hallucinations than prior systems. We hope our analysis framework and simple
tool design inform future long-horizon agents.

Motivation: 现有LLM评估主要局限于数学、编程等易于验证的任务，而现实应用需要评估LLM处理专业文档和生成综合报告的能力。

Method: 构建ProfBench基准，包含物理、化学、金融和咨询领域的专家评估数据，开发经济高效的LLM-Judges评估系统，减少评估成本2-3个数量级。

Result: 即使最先进的GPT-5-high模型在ProfBench上仅达到65.9%的整体性能，发现专有模型与开源模型之间存在显著性能差距。

Conclusion: ProfBench对当前LLM构成重大挑战，揭示了扩展思维在处理复杂专业领域任务中的重要性。

Abstract: Evaluating progress in large language models (LLMs) is often constrained by
the challenge of verifying responses, limiting assessments to tasks like
mathematics, programming, and short-form question-answering. However, many
real-world applications require evaluating LLMs in processing professional
documents, synthesizing information, and generating comprehensive reports in
response to user queries. We introduce ProfBench: a set of over 7000
response-criterion pairs as evaluated by human-experts with professional
knowledge across Physics PhD, Chemistry PhD, Finance MBA and Consulting MBA. We
build robust and affordable LLM-Judges to evaluate ProfBench rubrics, by
mitigating self-enhancement bias and reducing the cost of evaluation by 2-3
orders of magnitude, to make it fair and accessible to the broader community.
Our findings reveal that ProfBench poses significant challenges even for
state-of-the-art LLMs, with top-performing models like GPT-5-high achieving
only 65.9\% overall performance. Furthermore, we identify notable performance
disparities between proprietary and open-weight models and provide insights

TL;DR: 提出了OVERBENCH基准框架，通过动态生成模型特定的挑战性数据集来解决语言模型过度敏感问题，包含45万个样本，覆盖25个模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型对良性提示的防御性拒绝（过度敏感）会干扰用户交互并模糊有害与无害内容的界限。现有静态基准会随时间退化，导致数据污染和评估能力下降。

Method: 开发动态框架，为每个模型生成特定挑战性数据集，捕捉新兴防御模式并与模型独特行为对齐，构建OVERBENCH基准聚合这些数据集。

Result: OVERBENCH基准包含45万个样本，覆盖25个不同LLM家族，提供动态演进的过度敏感视角，能够持续监控模型防御触发器。

Conclusion: 该框架能够识别静态数据集忽略的漏洞，随着模型发展持续监测防御触发器，为语言模型过度敏感问题提供更有效的评估工具。

Abstract: Oversensitivity occurs when language models defensively reject prompts that
are actually benign. This behavior not only disrupts user interactions but also
obscures the boundary between harmful and harmless content. Existing benchmarks
rely on static datasets that degrade overtime as models evolve, leading to data
contamination and diminished evaluative power. To address this, we develop a
framework that dynamically generates model-specific challenging datasets,
capturing emerging defensive patterns and aligning with each model's unique
behavior. Building on this approach, we construct OVERBENCH, a benchmark that
aggregates these datasets across diverse LLM families, encompassing 450,000
samples from 25 models. OVERBENCH provides a dynamic and evolving perspective
on oversensitivity, allowing for continuous monitoring of defensive triggers as
models advance, highlighting vulnerabilities that static datasets overlook.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在人际互动中的应用增多，需要评估其在社交推理方面的能力，特别是在跨文化语境下。

Method: 构建了包含1000个对话的SCRIPTS数据集（英语和韩语），基于电影剧本，由母语者标注概率关系标签，评估了9个模型的关系推断能力。

Result: 专有LLM在英语数据集上达到75-80%准确率，但在韩语上降至58-69%；10-25%的响应选择了不可能关系；思维模型和链式思维提示对社会推理帮助有限，有时还会放大社会偏见。

Conclusion: 当前LLM的社会推理能力存在显著局限，需要开发更具社会意识的语言模型。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in human-AI
interactions, their social reasoning capabilities in interpersonal contexts are
critical. We introduce SCRIPTS, a 1k-dialogue dataset in English and Korean,
sourced from movie scripts. The task involves evaluating models' social
reasoning capability to infer the interpersonal relationships (e.g., friends,
sisters, lovers) between speakers in each dialogue. Each dialogue is annotated
with probabilistic relational labels (Highly Likely, Less Likely, Unlikely) by
native (or equivalent) Korean and English speakers from Korea and the U.S.
Evaluating nine models on our task, current proprietary LLMs achieve around
75-80% on the English dataset, whereas their performance on Korean drops to
58-69%. More strikingly, models select Unlikely relationships in 10-25% of
their responses. Furthermore, we find that thinking models and chain-of-thought
prompting, effective for general reasoning, provide minimal benefits for social
reasoning and occasionally amplify social biases. Our findings reveal
significant limitations in current LLMs' social reasoning capabilities,
highlighting the need for efforts to develop socially-aware language models.

Abstract: Evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) for mental health support is
challenging due to the emotionally and cognitively complex nature of
therapeutic dialogue. Existing benchmarks are limited in scale, reliability,
often relying on synthetic or social media data, and lack frameworks to assess
when automated judges can be trusted. To address the need for large-scale
dialogue datasets and judge reliability assessment, we introduce two benchmarks
that provide a framework for generation and evaluation. MentalBench-100k
consolidates 10,000 one-turn conversations from three real scenarios datasets,
each paired with nine LLM-generated responses, yielding 100,000 response pairs.
MentalAlign-70k}reframes evaluation by comparing four high-performing LLM
judges with human experts across 70,000 ratings on seven attributes, grouped
into Cognitive Support Score (CSS) and Affective Resonance Score (ARS). We then
employ the Affective Cognitive Agreement Framework, a statistical methodology
using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) with confidence intervals to
quantify agreement, consistency, and bias between LLM judges and human experts.
Our analysis reveals systematic inflation by LLM judges, strong reliability for
cognitive attributes such as guidance and informativeness, reduced precision
for empathy, and some unreliability in safety and relevance. Our contributions
establish new methodological and empirical foundations for reliable,
large-scale evaluation of LLMs in mental health. We release the benchmarks and

TL;DR: 评估大型语言模型在生物医学术语标准化任务中的表现，发现微调效果取决于标识符的流行度和词汇化程度。基因标识符表现最佳，而GO和HPO等非词汇化标识符效果有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物医学数据集成依赖术语标准化，需要将自然语言术语映射到标准化标识符。大型语言模型在此任务中表现不一，需要系统评估其在不同术语体系中的记忆和泛化能力。

Method: 使用Llama 3.1 8B模型在多个生物医学本体上进行微调，评估记忆能力（训练术语性能）和泛化能力（验证术语性能），并与GPT-4o等基线模型比较。

Result: GO映射显示强记忆增益（术语到标识符准确率提升77%），HPO改进最小。仅基因映射显示泛化增益（13.9%）。GPT-4o在所有术语体系中优于Llama变体。嵌入分析显示基因符号与蛋白质名称语义对齐紧密，但GO和HPO术语与标识符对齐较弱。

Conclusion: 微调成功取决于两个交互因素：标识符流行度和词汇化程度。流行标识符在预训练中更常见，增强记忆；词汇化标识符（如基因符号）支持语义泛化。GO和HPO的任意标识符限制模型只能机械学习。

Abstract: Effective biomedical data integration depends on automated term
normalization, the mapping of natural language biomedical terms to standardized
identifiers. This linking of terms to identifiers is essential for semantic
interoperability. Large language models (LLMs) show promise for this task but
perform unevenly across terminologies. We evaluated both memorization
(training-term performance) and generalization (validation-term performance)
across multiple biomedical ontologies. Fine-tuning Llama 3.1 8B revealed marked
differences by terminology. GO mappings showed strong memorization gains (up to
77% improvement in term-to-identifier accuracy), whereas HPO showed minimal
improvement. Generalization occurred only for protein-gene (GENE) mappings
(13.9% gain), while fine-tuning for HPO and GO yielded negligible transfer.
Baseline accuracy varied by model scale, with GPT-4o outperforming both Llama
variants for all terminologies. Embedding analyses showed tight semantic
alignment between gene symbols and protein names but weak alignment between
terms and identifiers for GO or HPO, consistent with limited lexicalization.
Fine-tuning success depended on two interacting factors: identifier popularity
and lexicalization. Popular identifiers were more likely encountered during
pretraining, enhancing memorization. Lexicalized identifiers, such as gene
symbols, enabled semantic generalization. By contrast, arbitrary identifiers in
GO and HPO constrained models to rote learning. These findings provide a
predictive framework for when fine-tuning enhances factual recall versus when
it fails due to sparse or non-lexicalized identifiers.

TL;DR: 该论文研究大语言模型在参数知识与提示信息冲突时的行为，特别关注代码生成领域，提出了知识冲突检测框架和评估方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs在面对参数知识与提示信息冲突时的行为表现，将知识冲突研究从问答领域扩展到代码生成领域。

Method: 提出了领域无关的知识冲突构建和解释框架，开发了针对代码冲突场景的新评估方法和数据集，使用激活级引导技术。

Result: 大型LLMs在参数中编码了知识冲突概念，检测准确率达80.65%；激活引导比随机基线提升12.6%的成功率，但效果取决于模型大小、任务领域和引导方向的平衡。

Conclusion: LLMs能够识别知识冲突，激活引导是有效的干预方法，但需要综合考虑模型规模、任务特性和引导策略的平衡。

Abstract: This paper investigates how large language models (LLMs) behave when faced
with discrepancies between their parametric knowledge and conflicting
information contained in a prompt. Building on prior question-answering (QA)
research, we extend the investigation of knowledge conflicts to the realm of
code generation. We propose a domain-agnostic framework for constructing and
interpreting such conflicts, along with a novel evaluation method and dataset
tailored to code conflict scenarios. Our experiments indicate that sufficiently
large LLMs encode the notion of a knowledge conflict in their parameters,
enabling us to detect knowledge conflicts with up to \textbf{80.65\%} accuracy.
Building on these insights, we show that activation-level steering can achieve
up to a \textbf{12.6\%} improvement in steering success over a random baseline.
However, effectiveness depends critically on balancing model size, task domain,
and steering direction. The experiment code and data will be made publicly
available after acceptance.

*Valentin Noël*

TL;DR: 提出基于图信号处理的频谱分析框架，通过分析transformer层的注意力图来检测语言模型中的幻觉问题，相比困惑度基线准确率提升13.75%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在事实推理和幻觉区分方面仍面临挑战，需要新的检测方法

Method: 将transformer层建模为由注意力诱导的动态图，令牌嵌入作为图上的信号，通过图信号处理定义Dirichlet能量、频谱熵和高频能量比等诊断指标

Result: 实验发现普遍频谱模式：事实陈述呈现低频收敛的"能量山"行为，不同幻觉类型显示独特特征。基于频谱特征的检测器达到88.75%准确率，优于困惑度基线

Conclusion: 频谱几何能够捕捉推理模式和错误行为，为大型语言模型中的幻觉检测提供了有前景的框架

Abstract: Large language models achieve impressive results but distinguishing factual
reasoning from hallucinations remains challenging. We propose a spectral
analysis framework that models transformer layers as dynamic graphs induced by
attention, with token embeddings as signals on these graphs. Through graph
signal processing, we define diagnostics including Dirichlet energy, spectral
entropy, and high-frequency energy ratios, with theoretical connections to
computational stability. Experiments across GPT architectures suggest universal
spectral patterns: factual statements exhibit consistent "energy mountain"
behavior with low-frequency convergence, while different hallucination types
show distinct signatures. Logical contradictions destabilize spectra with large
effect sizes ($g>1.0$), semantic errors remain stable but show connectivity
drift, and substitution hallucinations display intermediate perturbations. A
simple detector using spectral signatures achieves 88.75% accuracy versus 75%
for perplexity-based baselines, demonstrating practical utility. These findings
indicate that spectral geometry may capture reasoning patterns and error
behaviors, potentially offering a framework for hallucination detection in
large language models.

TL;DR: 通过图信号处理分析transformer模型在语音交替任务中的计算指纹，发现不同架构在早期层表现出独特的连接模式，这些光谱特征与行为差异强相关，可作为无训练的诊断工具揭示架构偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究不同transformer架构如何通过不同的连接模式实现相同的语言计算，并检测这些"计算指纹"以揭示训练强调对模型处理策略的影响。

Method: 使用图信号处理分析注意力诱导的token图，在20种语言和3个模型家族中跟踪语音交替下代数连通性（Fiedler值）的变化，特别关注早期层（2-5层）。

Result: 发现清晰的架构特征：Phi-3-Mini在英语中表现出显著的早期层中断，而其他19种语言影响最小；Qwen2.5-7B显示对形态丰富语言的小幅分布式偏移；LLaMA-3.2-1B表现出系统但较弱的响应。这些光谱特征与行为差异强相关（Phi-3: r=-0.976）。

Conclusion: 训练强调会在计算中留下可检测的印记，表现为句法转换期间可测量的连接模式。该方法可作为简单、无需训练的诊断工具，揭示架构偏见并支持模型可靠性分析。

Abstract: Different transformer architectures implement identical linguistic
computations via distinct connectivity patterns, yielding model imprinted
``computational fingerprints'' detectable through spectral analysis. Using
graph signal processing on attention induced token graphs, we track changes in
algebraic connectivity (Fiedler value, $\Delta\lambda_2$) under voice
alternation across 20 languages and three model families, with a prespecified
early window (layers 2--5). Our analysis uncovers clear architectural
signatures: Phi-3-Mini shows a dramatic English specific early layer disruption
($\overline{\Delta\lambda_2}_{[2,5]}\!\approx\!-0.446$) while effects in 19
other languages are minimal, consistent with public documentation that
positions the model primarily for English use. Qwen2.5-7B displays small,
distributed shifts that are largest for morphologically rich languages, and
LLaMA-3.2-1B exhibits systematic but muted responses. These spectral signatures
correlate strongly with behavioral differences (Phi-3: $r=-0.976$) and are
modulated by targeted attention head ablations, linking the effect to early
attention structure and confirming functional relevance. Taken together, the
findings are consistent with the view that training emphasis can leave
detectable computational imprints: specialized processing strategies that
manifest as measurable connectivity patterns during syntactic transformations.
Beyond voice alternation, the framework differentiates reasoning modes,
indicating utility as a simple, training free diagnostic for revealing
architectural biases and supporting model reliability analysis.

Conclusion: 讨论了跨语言迁移、多模态学习和社区驱动资源创建的潜力，鼓励合作努力为低资源语言构建包容和可持续的AI生态系统。

Abstract: Tibetan, one of the major low-resource languages in Asia, presents unique
linguistic and sociocultural characteristics that pose both challenges and
opportunities for AI research. Despite increasing interest in developing AI
systems for underrepresented languages, Tibetan has received limited attention
due to a lack of accessible data resources, standardized benchmarks, and
dedicated tools. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of the current
state of Tibetan AI in the AI domain, covering textual and speech data
resources, NLP tasks, machine translation, speech recognition, and recent
developments in LLMs. We systematically categorize existing datasets and tools,
evaluate methods used across different tasks, and compare performance where
possible. We also identify persistent bottlenecks such as data sparsity,
orthographic variation, and the lack of unified evaluation metrics.
Additionally, we discuss the potential of cross-lingual transfer, multi-modal
learning, and community-driven resource creation. This survey aims to serve as
a foundational reference for future work on Tibetan AI research and encourages
collaborative efforts to build an inclusive and sustainable AI ecosystem for
low-resource languages.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI技术发展，科技公司需要大量软件工程师，建立多阶段筛选流程。鉴于LLM在编码和推理任务中的优异表现，研究LLM是否能通过专业招聘评估。

Method: 使用最先进的LLM对广泛使用的专业评估问卷生成回答，并与公司参考解决方案进行对比评估。

Result: 模型生成的答案与公司参考解决方案存在显著不一致，所有评估的LLM都未能通过招聘评估。

Conclusion: 尽管LLM在编码任务中表现出色，但无法通过实际的标准化招聘评估，表明当前LLM与理想工程师标准仍有差距。

Abstract: With the proliferation of the internet and the rapid advancement of
Artificial Intelligence, leading technology companies face an urgent annual
demand for a considerable number of software and algorithm engineers. To
efficiently and effectively identify high-potential candidates from thousands
of applicants, these firms have established a multi-stage selection process,
which crucially includes a standardized hiring evaluation designed to assess
job-specific competencies. Motivated by the demonstrated prowess of Large
Language Models (LLMs) in coding and reasoning tasks, this paper investigates a
critical question: Can LLMs successfully pass these hiring evaluations? To this
end, we conduct a comprehensive examination of a widely used professional
assessment questionnaire. We employ state-of-the-art LLMs to generate responses
and subsequently evaluate their performance. Contrary to any prior expectation
of LLMs being ideal engineers, our analysis reveals a significant inconsistency
between the model-generated answers and the company-referenced solutions. Our
empirical findings lead to a striking conclusion: All evaluated LLMs fails to
pass the hiring evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多跳RAG方法存在效率问题，包括重复生成可预测token序列和依赖随机停止机制，导致token使用过多和终止不稳定。

Method: 提出TSSS框架：1) 模板化推理，缓存重复前缀并将子查询锚定到主问题；2) 检索器终止器，当子查询重复时确定性地停止推理。

Result: 在HotpotQA、2WikiMultiHop和MuSiQue数据集上，TSSS达到了最先进的准确率和在RAG-CoT方法中具有竞争性的效率。

Conclusion: TSSS通过分离结构化推理和终止控制，实现了更快的推理和更可靠的答案，特别适用于设备端推理等效率受限场景。

Abstract: Multi-hop retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a promising strategy for
complex reasoning, yet existing iterative prompting approaches remain
inefficient. They often regenerate predictable token sequences at every step
and rely on stochastic stopping, leading to excessive token usage and unstable
termination. We propose TSSS (Think Straight, Stop Smart), a structured
multi-hop RAG framework designed for efficiency. TSSS introduces (i) a
template-based reasoning that caches recurring prefixes and anchors sub-queries
to the main question, reducing token generation cost while promoting stable
reasoning, and (ii) a retriever-based terminator, which deterministically halts
reasoning once additional sub-queries collapse into repetition. This separation
of structured reasoning and termination control enables both faster inference
and more reliable answers. On HotpotQA, 2WikiMultiHop, and MuSiQue, TSSS
achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and competitive efficiency among RAG-CoT
approaches, highlighting its effectiveness in efficiency-constrained scenarios
such as on-device inference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究基于结构化知识库评估时序知识冲突，但只关注流行实体且缺乏动态结构来公平评估不同知识截止日期的LLMs。

Method: 从三个真实时间戳语料库识别自然发生的知识演化，生成针对不同LLM知识截止日期的定制化问题和黄金答案。

Result: 在12个开源和闭源LLMs上的评估显示，相比静态知识问题，在evolveQA上性能下降高达31%。

Conclusion: evolveQA基准能有效揭示LLMs处理时序知识冲突的局限性，为改进LLMs的时间感知能力提供了重要评估工具。

Abstract: LLMs often fail to handle temporal knowledge conflicts--contradictions
arising when facts evolve over time within their training data. Existing
studies evaluate this phenomenon through benchmarks built on structured
knowledge bases like Wikidata, but they focus on widely-covered,
easily-memorized popular entities and lack the dynamic structure needed to
fairly evaluate LLMs with different knowledge cut-off dates. We introduce
evolveQA, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLMs on temporally
evolving knowledge, constructed from 3 real-world, time-stamped corpora: AWS
updates, Azure changes, and WHO disease outbreak reports. Our framework
identifies naturally occurring knowledge evolution and generates questions with
gold answers tailored to different LLM knowledge cut-off dates. Through
extensive evaluation of 12 open and closed-source LLMs across 3 knowledge
probing formats, we demonstrate significant performance drops of up to 31% on
evolveQA compared to static knowledge questions.

Motivation: 开发不依赖检索增强生成(RAG)和大语言模型(LLM)的问答系统，减少计算资源需求并提高效率。

Method: 两阶段流水线：第一阶段预处理文档生成问答对，第二阶段将问答对转换为知识图谱，使用嵌入和模糊技术进行图检索、重排序和转述生成最终答案。

Result: 在CRAG基准测试中，使用LLAMA-3.2和GPT-3.5-Turbo分别达到71.9%和54.4%的准确率。

Conclusion: 该方法证明了不依赖LLM的问答系统的可行性，通过知识图谱检索和小型转述模型能够实现有效的问答性能。

Abstract: This paper presents a question answering system that operates exclusively on
a knowledge graph retrieval without relying on retrieval augmented generation
(RAG) with large language models (LLMs). Instead, a small paraphraser model is
used to paraphrase the entity relationship edges retrieved from querying the
knowledge graph. The proposed pipeline is divided into two main stages. The
first stage involves pre-processing a document to generate sets of
question-answer (QA) pairs. The second stage converts these QAs into a
knowledge graph from which graph-based retrieval is performed using embeddings
and fuzzy techniques. The graph is queried, re-ranked, and paraphrased to
generate a final answer. This work includes an evaluation using LLM-as-a-judge
on the CRAG benchmark, which resulted in accuracies of 71.9% and 54.4% using
LLAMA-3.2 and GPT-3.5-Turbo, respectively.

Motivation: 现有评估方法无法捕捉多轮工具增强对话中的关键错误，特别是当代理误解工具结果但仍让用户满意的情况。

Method: 构建TRACE基准包含系统合成的工具增强对话，开发SCOPE框架自动发现错误模式和评估标准。

Result: 实验显示SCOPE显著优于基线方法，特别是在用户满意度信号具有误导性的挑战性案例上。

Conclusion: TRACE和SCOPE为解决工具增强对话系统的评估挑战提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Evaluating conversational AI systems that use external tools is challenging,
as errors can arise from complex interactions among user, agent, and tools.
While existing evaluation methods assess either user satisfaction or agents'
tool-calling capabilities, they fail to capture critical errors in multi-turn
tool-augmented dialogues-such as when agents misinterpret tool results yet
appear satisfactory to users. We introduce TRACE, a benchmark of systematically
synthesized tool-augmented conversations covering diverse error cases, and
SCOPE, an evaluation framework that automatically discovers diverse error
patterns and evaluation rubrics in tool-augmented dialogues. Experiments show
SCOPE significantly outperforms the baseline, particularly on challenging cases
where user satisfaction signals are misleading.

TL;DR: DiSRouter是一种分布式路由范式，通过LLM代理的自我意识来决定是否回答或路由查询，相比集中式路由具有更好的灵活性、可扩展性和泛化能力。


<details>

Motivation: 当前基于固定LLM集合的集中式路由系统不够灵活，且小型路由器无法充分理解不同LLM的知识边界，导致性能不佳。

Method: 提出DiSRouter分布式路由范式，查询在网络中的LLM代理间传递，每个代理基于自我意识独立决定是否回答或路由；采用两阶段自我意识训练流程增强LLM的自我认知能力。

Result: 实验表明DiSRouter在各种场景下的效用显著优于现有路由方法，能有效区分简单和困难查询，并在域外任务上表现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 利用LLM内在的自我意识比外部评估更有效，为更模块化和高效的多智能体系统开辟了新途径。

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has created a diverse
ecosystem of models with highly varying performance and costs, necessitating
effective query routing to balance performance and expense. Current routing
systems often rely on a centralized external router trained on a fixed set of
LLMs, making them inflexible and prone to poor performance since the small
router can not fully understand the knowledge boundaries of different LLMs. We
introduce DiSRouter (Distributed Self-Router), a novel paradigm that shifts
from centralized control to distributed routing. In DiSRouter, a query
traverses a network of LLM agents, each independently deciding whether to
answer or route to other agents based on its own self-awareness, its ability to
judge its competence. This distributed design offers superior flexibility,
scalability, and generalizability. To enable this, we propose a two-stage
Self-Awareness Training pipeline that enhances each LLM's self-awareness.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiSRouter significantly outperforms
existing routing methods in utility across various scenarios, effectively
distinguishes between easy and hard queries, and shows strong generalization to
out-of-domain tasks. Our work validates that leveraging an LLM's intrinsic
self-awareness is more effective than external assessment, paving the way for
more modular and efficient multi-agent systems.

Motivation: 现有语言知识库存在两个关键局限：一刀切的向量表示不适合语言数据的多样化结构，缺乏将多种信号聚合为单一综合得分的系统方法

Method: 为每种距离类型提出新颖的结构感知表示：地理距离使用说话者加权分布，谱系距离使用双曲嵌入，类型学距离使用潜变量模型，并将这些信号统一为任务无关的复合距离

Result: 在跨语言迁移的语言选择中，所提出的表示和复合距离在各种NLP任务中持续提升性能

Conclusion: 该框架为多语言研究提供了更系统和有效的工具包

Abstract: Existing linguistic knowledge bases such as URIEL+ provide valuable
geographic, genetic and typological distances for cross-lingual transfer but
suffer from two key limitations. One, their one-size-fits-all vector
representations are ill-suited to the diverse structures of linguistic data,
and two, they lack a principled method for aggregating these signals into a
single, comprehensive score. In this paper, we address these gaps by
introducing a framework for type-matched language distances. We propose novel,
structure-aware representations for each distance type: speaker-weighted
distributions for geography, hyperbolic embeddings for genealogy, and a latent
variables model for typology. We unify these signals into a robust,
task-agnostic composite distance. In selecting transfer languages, our
representations and composite distances consistently improve performance across
a wide range of NLP tasks, providing a more principled and effective toolkit
for multilingual research.

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning over complex spreadsheets remain fundamental
challenges for large language models (LLMs), which often struggle with
accurately capturing the complex structure of tables and ensuring reasoning
correctness. In this work, we propose SheetBrain, a neuro-symbolic dual
workflow agent framework designed for accurate reasoning over tabular data,
supporting both spreadsheet question answering and manipulation tasks.
SheetBrain comprises three core modules: an understanding module, which
produces a comprehensive overview of the spreadsheet - including sheet summary
and query-based problem insight to guide reasoning; an execution module, which
integrates a Python sandbox with preloaded table-processing libraries and an
Excel helper toolkit for effective multi-turn reasoning; and a validation
module, which verifies the correctness of reasoning and answers, triggering
re-execution when necessary. We evaluate SheetBrain on multiple public tabular
QA and manipulation benchmarks, and introduce SheetBench, a new benchmark
targeting large, multi-table, and structurally complex spreadsheets.
Experimental results show that SheetBrain significantly improves accuracy on
both existing benchmarks and the more challenging scenarios presented in
SheetBench. Our code is publicly available at

Motivation: 现有难度可控问题生成方法存在两大局限：无法直接生成多项选择题（教育场景中最常用题型），且没有显式优化难度控制的准确性。

Abstract: Difficulty-controllable question generation for reading comprehension has
gained significant attention in the field of education as a fundamental tool
for adaptive learning support. Although several neural question generation
methods have recently succeeded in controlling difficulty, conventional
approaches still face two major limitations. First, they cannot directly
generate multiple-choice questions, which are the most widely used question
type in educational contexts. Second, they are not explicitly trained to
optimize the accuracy of difficulty control, leaving room for further
improvement in difficulty controllability. To address these limitations, this
study proposes a novel difficulty-controllable multiple-choice question
generation method for reading comprehension which leverages a large language
model trained using a direct preference optimization technique to improve the
accuracy of difficulty control.

TL;DR: TheMCPCompany是一个用于评估工具调用代理在现实服务交互任务中的基准，包含超过18,000个工具。研究表明，先进推理模型在简单环境中能有效发现工具，但在复杂企业环境中面临挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前通用代理主要依赖网页浏览器与环境交互，而MCP协议提供了大量任务特定工具集，这些工具比通用工具更易开发维护。需要评估工具调用代理在现实服务交互中的实际效果。

Method: 使用各种现实服务的REST API创建MCP服务器，提供超过18,000个工具，并为每个任务手动标注真实工具。实验比较了完美工具检索和实际工具检索下的代理性能。

Result: 使用真实工具时，工具调用代理能显著提升性能并降低成本。通过工具检索，所有模型表现相似或优于基于浏览器的代理，但小模型无法充分利用可用工具。GPT-5的工具检索性能接近其使用真实工具的性能。

Conclusion: 在数万工具中导航并以非平凡方式组合它们解决复杂问题，对当前模型仍是挑战，需要更好的推理和检索模型。最先进推理模型在简单环境中能有效发现工具，但在复杂企业环境中表现严重受限。

Abstract: Since the introduction of the Model Context Protocol (MCP), the number of
available tools for Large Language Models (LLMs) has increased significantly.
These task-specific tool sets offer an alternative to general-purpose tools
such as web browsers, while being easier to develop and maintain than GUIs.
However, current general-purpose agents predominantly rely on web browsers for
interacting with the environment. Here, we introduce TheMCPCompany, a benchmark
for evaluating tool-calling agents on tasks that involve interacting with
various real-world services. We use the REST APIs of these services to create
MCP servers, which include over 18,000 tools. We also provide manually
annotated ground-truth tools for each task. In our experiments, we use the
ground truth tools to show the potential of tool-calling agents for both
improving performance and reducing costs assuming perfect tool retrieval. Next,
we explore agent performance using tool retrieval to study the real-world
practicality of tool-based agents. While all models with tool retrieval perform
similarly or better than browser-based agents, smaller models cannot take full
advantage of the available tools through retrieval. On the other hand, GPT-5's
performance with tool retrieval is very close to its performance with
ground-truth tools. Overall, our work shows that the most advanced reasoning
models are effective at discovering tools in simpler environments, but
seriously struggle with navigating complex enterprise environments.
TheMCPCompany reveals that navigating tens of thousands of tools and combining
them in non-trivial ways to solve complex problems is still a challenging task
for current models and requires both better reasoning and better retrieval
models.

Abstract: Current large language models (LLMs) often suffer from hallucination issues,
i,e, generating content that appears factual but is actually unreliable. A
typical hallucination detection pipeline involves response decomposition (i.e.,
claim extraction), query generation, evidence collection (i.e., search or
retrieval), and claim verification. However, existing methods exhibit
limitations in the first two stages, such as context loss during claim
extraction and low specificity in query generation, resulting in degraded
performance across the hallucination detection pipeline. In this work, we
introduce JointCQ https://github.com/pku0xff/JointCQ, a joint claim-and-query
generation framework designed to construct an effective and efficient
claim-query generator. Our framework leverages elaborately designed evaluation
criteria to filter synthesized training data, and finetunes a language model
for joint claim extraction and query generation, providing reliable and
informative inputs for downstream search and verification. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method outperforms previous methods on multiple
open-domain QA hallucination detection benchmarks, advancing the goal of more
trustworthy and transparent language model systems.

TL;DR: KORE是一种协同方法，通过知识导向的增强和约束，在向大型多模态模型注入新知识的同时保留旧知识，解决知识适应和知识保留的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型多模态模型的知识是静态且有限的，无法跟上现实世界的发展，这阻碍了持续知识获取。现有方法在学习新知识时往往困难，并遭受灾难性遗忘。

Method: KORE自动将单个知识项转换为结构化和全面的知识，确保模型准确学习新知识。同时，将先前知识存储在LMM线性层激活的协方差矩阵中，并通过将原始权重投影到矩阵的零空间来初始化适配器，定义最小化与先前知识干扰的微调方向。

Result: 在LLaVA-v1.5-7B、LLaVA-v1.5-13B和Qwen2.5-VL-7B等多种LMM上的广泛实验表明，KORE实现了优越的新知识注入性能，并有效缓解了灾难性遗忘。

Conclusion: KORE通过知识导向的增强和约束，成功解决了大型多模态模型在知识注入过程中的适应和保留问题，为持续知识获取提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models encode extensive factual knowledge in their
pre-trained weights. However, its knowledge remains static and limited, unable
to keep pace with real-world developments, which hinders continuous knowledge
acquisition. Effective knowledge injection thus becomes critical, involving two
goals: knowledge adaptation (injecting new knowledge) and knowledge retention
(preserving old knowledge). Existing methods often struggle to learn new
knowledge and suffer from catastrophic forgetting. To address this, we propose
KORE, a synergistic method of KnOwledge-oRientEd augmentations and constraints
for injecting new knowledge into large multimodal models while preserving old
knowledge. Unlike general text or image data augmentation, KORE automatically
converts individual knowledge items into structured and comprehensive knowledge
to ensure that the model accurately learns new knowledge, enabling accurate
adaptation. Meanwhile, KORE stores previous knowledge in the covariance matrix
of LMM's linear layer activations and initializes the adapter by projecting the
original weights into the matrix's null space, defining a fine-tuning direction
that minimizes interference with previous knowledge, enabling powerful
retention. Extensive experiments on various LMMs, including LLaVA-v1.5-7B,
LLaVA-v1.5-13B, and Qwen2.5-VL-7B, show that KORE achieves superior new
knowledge injection performance and effectively mitigates catastrophic
forgetting.

TL;DR: 提出了HAD模型，将幻觉检测、跨度识别和修正集成到单一推理过程中，在多个基准测试中达到最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着自然语言生成模型的广泛应用，模型产生看似合理但错误信息的幻觉问题日益突出，需要有效的检测方法。

Method: 构建包含11个类别的综合幻觉分类法，开发HAD模型，在约90K合成数据集上训练，整合检测、识别和修正功能。

Result: 在领域内和领域外测试集上，HAD模型普遍优于现有基线，在HaluEval、FactCHD和FaithBench上达到最先进结果。

Conclusion: HAD模型展示了在多种NLG任务中的鲁棒性和多功能性，为幻觉检测提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The increasing reliance on natural language generation (NLG) models,
particularly large language models, has raised concerns about the reliability
and accuracy of their outputs. A key challenge is hallucination, where models
produce plausible but incorrect information. As a result, hallucination
detection has become a critical task. In this work, we introduce a
comprehensive hallucination taxonomy with 11 categories across various NLG
tasks and propose the HAllucination Detection (HAD) models
https://github.com/pku0xff/HAD, which integrate hallucination detection,
span-level identification, and correction into a single inference process.
Trained on an elaborate synthetic dataset of about 90K samples, our HAD models
are versatile and can be applied to various NLG tasks. We also carefully
annotate a test set for hallucination detection, called HADTest, which contains
2,248 samples. Evaluations on in-domain and out-of-domain test sets show that
our HAD models generally outperform the existing baselines, achieving
state-of-the-art results on HaluEval, FactCHD, and FaithBench, confirming their
robustness and versatility.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于超体积优化的多目标强化学习策略HVO，用于平衡文本摘要的多个目标（一致性、连贯性、相关性和流畅性），在多个数据集上优于GRPO方法，7B模型性能接近GPT-4但生成更短。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本摘要需要同时优化多个目标，但现有基于LLM的强化学习方法很少关注多目标优化问题。

Method: 使用超体积方法在强化学习奖励过程中动态调整组间分数，引导模型逐步逼近帕累托前沿，生成跨多个目标的平衡摘要。

Result: 在多个代表性摘要数据集上，HVO方法在总体得分上优于GRPO，在不同维度上表现更平衡；7B基础模型增强后性能与GPT-4相当但生成更短。

Conclusion: HVO是一种有效的多目标优化策略，能够生成平衡多个目标的优质摘要，小模型也能达到大模型性能。

Abstract: Text summarization is a crucial task that requires the simultaneous
optimization of multiple objectives, including consistency, coherence,
relevance, and fluency, which presents considerable challenges. Although large
language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance, enhanced by
reinforcement learning (RL), few studies have focused on optimizing the
multi-objective problem of summarization through RL based on LLMs. In this
paper, we introduce hypervolume optimization (HVO), a novel optimization
strategy that dynamically adjusts the scores between groups during the reward
process in RL by using the hypervolume method. This method guides the model's
optimization to progressively approximate the pareto front, thereby generating
balanced summaries across multiple objectives. Experimental results on several
representative summarization datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms
group relative policy optimization (GRPO) in overall scores and shows more
balanced performance across different dimensions. Moreover, a 7B foundation
model enhanced by HVO performs comparably to GPT-4 in the summarization task,
while maintaining a shorter generation length. Our code is publicly available
at https://github.com/ai4business-LiAuto/HVO.git

TL;DR: 将推理能力集成到语音大语言模型中，通过思维链框架分解槽填充任务，创建推理数据集并进行监督微调，展示了推理步骤带来的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受推理大语言模型发展的启发，希望在语音大语言模型中集成推理能力，以改进端到端槽填充任务的性能。

Method: 使用思维链框架将槽填充任务分解为多个推理步骤，创建推理数据集，对语音大语言模型进行监督微调，并比较不同类型和大小的文本基础模型。

Result: 引入推理步骤确实提高了性能，但主要为数学、逻辑和编码领域设计的推理文本LLM作为语音LLM的基础模型效果较差。混合语音LLM（基于混合文本基础LLM并保留直接和推理两种操作模式）性能优于仅使用单一模式的模型。

Conclusion: 在语音大语言模型中集成推理能力可以提升槽填充任务的性能，但需要选择合适的文本基础模型，且混合模型（同时支持直接和推理模式）效果最佳。

Abstract: We propose integration of reasoning into speech large language models
(speechLLMs) for the end-to-end slot-filling task. Inspired by the recent
development of reasoning LLMs, we use a chain-of-thought framework to decompose
the slot-filling task into multiple reasoning steps, create a reasoning dataset
and apply the supervised fine-tuning strategy to a speechLLM. We distinguish
between regular and reasoning speechLLMs and experiment with different types
and sizes of LLMs as their text foundation models. We demonstrate performance
improvements by introducing reasoning (intermediate) steps. However, we show
that a reasoning textual LLM developed mainly for math, logic and coding
domains might be inferior as a foundation model for a reasoning speechLLM. We
further show that hybrid speechLLMs, built on a hybrid text foundation LLM and
fine-tuned to preserve both direct and reasoning modes of operation, have
better performance than those fine-tuned employing only one mode of operation.

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了在大型语言模型中融入标注者身份特征如何影响其对仇恨言论的敏感性，特别是关于标注者与目标群体身份相似或不同时的偏见问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将心理学中的群体身份理论与先进NLP技术结合，研究通过融入社会人口属性来减少自动仇恨言论检测中的偏见。

Method: 使用Google Gemini和OpenAI GPT-4.1-mini模型，采用两种身份提示方法：浅层身份提示和基于检索增强生成的深度情境化身份开发。

Result: 结果表明，基于身份的方法在减少偏见方面既有潜力也有局限性，为开发更公平的仇恨言论检测系统提供了重要见解。

Conclusion: 将社会人口属性融入LLMs可以解决自动仇恨言论检测中的偏见问题，但需要进一步优化身份基础方法。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate how personalising Large Language Models
(Persona-LLMs) with annotator personas affects their sensitivity to hate
speech, particularly regarding biases linked to shared or differing identities
between annotators and targets. To this end, we employ Google's Gemini and
OpenAI's GPT-4.1-mini models and two persona-prompting methods: shallow persona
prompting and a deeply contextualised persona development based on
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to incorporate richer persona profiles. We
analyse the impact of using in-group and out-group annotator personas on the
models' detection performance and fairness across diverse social groups. This
work bridges psychological insights on group identity with advanced NLP
techniques, demonstrating that incorporating socio-demographic attributes into
LLMs can address bias in automated hate speech detection. Our results highlight
both the potential and limitations of persona-based approaches in reducing
bias, offering valuable insights for developing more equitable hate speech
detection systems.

TL;DR: LOGICAL是一个基于微调GLiNER模型的本地化PII去除系统，在临床笔记中高效去除个人身份信息，性能优于大型语言模型，适合资源受限环境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在临床笔记PII去除中计算成本高和数据隐私风险的问题，特别是在低资源环境中。

Method: 使用微调的GLiNER模型，在1515份临床文档上定义9个PII类别，在2849个文本实例上微调模型，并与多个基线系统比较。

Result: 微调GLiNER模型达到0.980的F1分数，显著优于Gemini-Pro-2.5（0.845），95%的文档完全净化，在标准笔记本电脑上高效运行。

Conclusion: 微调的专业化transformer模型如GLiNER为临床笔记PII去除提供了准确、计算高效且安全的解决方案，是资源密集型LLMs的实用替代方案。

Abstract: Removing Personally Identifiable Information (PII) from clinical notes in
Electronic Health Records (EHRs) is essential for research and AI development.
While Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful, their high computational costs
and the data privacy risks of API-based services limit their use, especially in
low-resource settings. To address this, we developed LOGICAL (Local Obfuscation
by GLINER for Impartial Context-Aware Lineage), an efficient, locally
deployable PII removal system built on a fine-tuned Generalist and Lightweight
Named Entity Recognition (GLiNER) model. We used 1515 clinical documents from a
psychiatric hospital's EHR system. We defined nine PII categories for removal.
A modern-gliner-bi-large-v1.0 model was fine-tuned on 2849 text instances and
evaluated on a test set of 376 instances using character-level precision,
recall, and F1-score. We compared its performance against Microsoft Azure NER,
Microsoft Presidio, and zero-shot prompting with Gemini-Pro-2.5 and
Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct. The fine-tuned GLiNER model achieved superior
performance, with an overall micro-average F1-score of 0.980, significantly
outperforming Gemini-Pro-2.5 (F1-score: 0.845). LOGICAL correctly sanitised 95%
of documents completely, compared to 64% for the next-best solution. The model
operated efficiently on a standard laptop without a dedicated GPU. However, a
2% entity-level false negative rate underscores the need for human-in-the-loop
validation across all tested systems. Fine-tuned, specialised transformer
models like GLiNER offer an accurate, computationally efficient, and secure
solution for PII removal from clinical notes. This "sanitisation at the source"
approach is a practical alternative to resource-intensive LLMs, enabling the
creation of de-identified datasets for research and AI development while
preserving data privacy, particularly in resource-constrained environments.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了DnD Gesture++数据集，包含2,663个语义手势标注，并提出了一个集成文本、音频和手势的专家混合框架来预测对话中的话轮转换。实验表明，语义手势的加入能持续提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究人类对话中多模态线索（如语音、手势、注视）在话轮转换中的作用，特别是手势作为补充线索的重要性。

Method: 扩展了多参与者DnD Gesture语料库，创建DnD Gesture++数据集，包含四种语义手势类型（图标、隐喻、指示、话语），并使用专家混合框架整合文本、音频和手势特征进行话轮转换预测。

Result: 实验结果显示，加入语义引导的手势特征相比基线模型能带来一致的性能提升，证明了手势在多模态话轮转换中的补充作用。

Conclusion: 语义手势在多模态话轮转换建模中具有重要的补充价值，能有效提升预测性能。

Abstract: In conversation, humans use multimodal cues, such as speech, gestures, and
gaze, to manage turn-taking. While linguistic and acoustic features are
informative, gestures provide complementary cues for modeling these
transitions. To study this, we introduce DnD Gesture++, an extension of the
multi-party DnD Gesture corpus enriched with 2,663 semantic gesture annotations
spanning iconic, metaphoric, deictic, and discourse types. Using this dataset,
we model turn-taking prediction through a Mixture-of-Experts framework
integrating text, audio, and gestures. Experiments show that incorporating
semantically guided gestures yields consistent performance gains over
baselines, demonstrating their complementary role in multimodal turn-taking.

TL;DR: M3-SLU是一个新的多模态大语言模型基准测试，专注于评估多说话人、多轮对话的口语理解能力，特别关注说话人归属推理问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型在语音和文本理解方面表现良好，但在理解自然对话中谁在什么时候说了什么（说话人归属推理）方面仍存在困难。

Method: 基于四个开放语料库构建了包含12,000多个验证实例的数据集，包含配对音频、转录文本和元数据，设计了说话人归属问答和说话人归属匹配两个任务。

Result: 模型能够捕捉对话内容，但经常无法准确识别说话人身份，揭示了说话人感知对话理解的关键差距。

Conclusion: M3-SLU作为一个具有挑战性的基准测试，将推动说话人感知多模态理解的研究进展。

Abstract: We present M3-SLU, a new multimodal large language model (MLLM) benchmark for
evaluating multi-speaker, multi-turn spoken language understanding. While
recent models show strong performance in speech and text comprehension, they
still struggle with speaker-attributed reasoning, the ability to understand who
said what and when in natural conversations. M3-SLU is built from four open
corpora (CHiME-6, MELD, MultiDialog, and AMI) and comprises over 12,000
validated instances with paired audio, transcripts, and metadata. It includes
two tasks: (1) Speaker-Attributed Question Answering and (2) Speaker
Attribution via Utterance Matching. We provide baseline results for both
cascaded pipelines and end-to-end MLLMs, evaluated using an LLM-as-Judge and
accuracy metrics. Results show that while models can capture what was said,
they often fail to identify who said it, revealing a key gap in speaker-aware
dialogue understanding. M3-SLU offers as a challenging benchmark to advance
research in speaker-aware multimodal understanding.

TL;DR: AgenticMath：一种用于生成高质量数学问答对的代理流水线，通过四个阶段（种子问题筛选、问题重述、答案增强、问答评估）提升LLM的数学推理能力，仅需3-6万样本即可在3B-8B参数模型上实现与更大规模数据集相当的竞争性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前用于改进LLM推理的数据集生成方法存在生成答案质量低、信息丰富度有限的问题，需要一种能自动生成高质量数学问答对的方法来增强监督微调。

Method: 四阶段代理流水线：1) 种子问题筛选（选择信息丰富、复杂、清晰的问题）；2) 代理问题重述（多代理系统生成多样化、逻辑一致的改写）；3) 答案增强（使用思维链推理重写答案以提高数值和逻辑正确性）；4) 问答评估（保留最优问答对）。

Result: 在3B-8B参数LLM上使用AgenticMath生成的3-6万数学样本进行微调，在多样化的领域内和领域外数学推理基准测试中，相比使用更大规模数据（如40万或230万样本）的基线方法，实现了竞争性或更优的性能。

Conclusion: 针对性的高质量数据生成比大规模低质量数据更有效地提升LLM的数学推理能力，证明了数据质量比数量更重要。

Abstract: The creation of high-quality datasets to improve Large Language Model (LLM)
reasoning remains a significant challenge, as current methods often suffer from
generating low-quality/incorrect answers and limited information richness from
available data sources. To address this, we propose AgenticMath, a novel
agentic pipeline for generating high-quality mathematical question-answer pairs
to enhance the supervised fine-tuning of LLMs. Our method operates through four
stages: (1) Seed Question Filter that selects questions with high information
richness, complexity, and clarity; (2) an Agentic Question Rephrase step that
employs a multi-agent system to generate diverse, logically consistent
paraphrases; (3) an Answer Augment step where rewrite answers using
chain-of-thought reasoning to enhance numerical and logical correctness,
without reliance on human-provided labels; and (4) a final Question and Answer
Evaluation that retains only the most superior pairs. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that, fine-tuning 3B-8B parameter LLMs on AgenticMath generated
datasets (comprising only 30-60K math samples) achieves competitive or superior
performance on diverse in domain and out-of-domain mathematical reasoning
benchmarks compared to baselines trained on much more data (e.g., 400K or 2.3M
samples). Our work demonstrates that targeted, high-quality data generation is
a more efficient path to improving mathematical reasoning in LLMs than
large-scale, low-quality alternatives.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LoongRL是一种数据驱动的强化学习方法，通过KeyChain技术将短多跳问答转化为高难度长上下文任务，训练模型在16K长度下获得128K长度的推理能力，显著提升长上下文多跳问答准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然强化学习能增强短上下文推理，但对于长上下文推理所需的高级思维模式仍缺乏探索，且高难度RL数据稀缺。

Method: 提出KeyChain合成方法，通过插入UUID链将短多跳QA转化为长上下文任务，要求模型逐步追踪正确链、识别真实问题、检索相关事实并进行推理。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-7B和14B上，LoongRL将长上下文多跳QA准确率分别提升23.5%和21.1%。LoongRL-14B达到74.2分，媲美更大前沿模型。

Conclusion: LoongRL诱导出计划-检索-推理-复查的推理模式，能泛化到远超训练长度的任务，同时保持短上下文推理能力。

Abstract: Reasoning over long contexts is essential for large language models. While
reinforcement learning (RL) enhances short-context reasoning by inducing "Aha"
moments in chain-of-thought, the advanced thinking patterns required for
long-context reasoning remain largely unexplored, and high-difficulty RL data
are scarce. In this paper, we introduce LoongRL, a data-driven RL method for
advanced long-context reasoning. Central to LoongRL is KeyChain, a synthesis
approach that transforms short multi-hop QA into high-difficulty long-context
tasks by inserting UUID chains that hide the true question among large
collections of distracting documents. Solving these tasks requires the model to
trace the correct chain step-by-step, identify the true question, retrieve
relevant facts and reason over them to answer correctly. RL training on
KeyChain data induces an emergent plan-retrieve-reason-recheck reasoning
pattern that generalizes far beyond training length. Models trained at 16K
effectively solve 128K tasks without prohibitive full-length RL rollout costs.
On Qwen2.5-7B and 14B, LoongRL substantially improves long-context multi-hop QA
accuracy by +23.5% and +21.1% absolute gains. The resulting LoongRL-14B reaches
a score of 74.2, rivaling much larger frontier models such as o3-mini (74.5)
and DeepSeek-R1 (74.9). It also improves long-context retrieval, passes all
128K needle-in-a-haystack stress tests, and preserves short-context reasoning
capabilities.

TL;DR: MoE-Prism通过模型-系统协同设计，将刚性MoE模型转变为弹性服务，提供细粒度控制，在保持质量的同时显著提升系统效率和适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MoE模型存在"质量悬崖"问题，只能提供少量粗粒度操作点，导致成本与质量之间的困难权衡，无法适应多样化的服务级别目标，造成资源过度配置。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：离线重构引擎将单体专家分解为细粒度"子专家"，使用基于元启发式的分区优化求解器分组神经元；在线调度引擎通过QoS感知调度利用这种弹性，实现云部署吞吐量最大化和内存受限设备的延迟优化卸载。

Result: 在三种不同MoE模型上的评估显示，MoE-Prism比基线提供超过4倍的稳定操作点，在严格延迟预算下可将吞吐量提升19.9%，在有限资源下可将延迟降低10.36%。

Conclusion: MoE-Prism提供了关键的"控制旋钮"，弥合了模型与系统之间的差距，实现了自适应、高效且QoS感知的AI服务。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, the state-of-the-art in large-scale AI,
achieve high quality by sparsely activating parameters. However, their reliance
on routing between a few monolithic experts via a top-k mechanism creates a
"quality cliff", offering only a few coarse-grained operating points. This
inflexibility forces a difficult trade-off between cost and quality, preventing
adaptation to diverse Service Level Objectives (SLOs) and leading to
significant resource over-provisioning.
  This paper introduces MoE-Prism, a model-system co-design that transforms
rigid MoE models into elastic services. Our methodology is divided into two
phases. First, an \emph{Offline Refactoring Engine} systematically deconstructs
monolithic experts into fine-grained "sub-experts." This engine employs a
partitioning optimization solver that uses a metaheuristic-based approach to
group neurons, preserving functional locality without requiring retraining.
Second, an \emph{Online Scheduling Engine} leverages this new elasticity
through QoS-aware scheduling. It implements specialized policies to solve
complex system problems, including maximizing throughput in cloud deployments
and managing latency-optimized offloading for memory-constrained devices. Our
evaluation across three different MoE models shows that MoE-Prismprovides over
4 times more distinct, stable operating points than the baseline. This allows
an AI service to dynamically improve throughput by up to 19.9\% under a strict
latency budget or reduce latency by up to 10.36\% under limited resources.
MoE-Prism provides the critical "control knob" to bridge the model-system gap,
enabling the next generation of adaptive, efficient, and QoS-aware AI services.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统手语翻译系统依赖手语注释，但这类标注数据通常规模有限且不同数据集间差异很大，需要一种无需手动标注的监督方法。

Method: 使用目标句子的句子嵌入作为训练时的监督信号，这种方法不需要手动标注，而是从原始文本数据中学习，支持单语和多语言句子嵌入及翻译系统。

Result: 在德语(PHOENIX-2014T)和美国手语(How2Sign)数据集上的评估显示，该方法显著优于其他无注释方法，在没有额外预训练数据的情况下达到了新的最优性能。

Conclusion: 该方法通过句子嵌入有效替代了传统手语注释，缩小了无注释与有注释系统之间的性能差距，为手语翻译提供了一种更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: State-of-the-art sign language translation (SLT) systems facilitate the

involving an intermediate step. Unfortunately, gloss labelled sign language
data is usually not available at scale and, when available, gloss annotations
widely differ from dataset to dataset. We present a novel approach using
sentence embeddings of the target sentences at training time that take the role
of glosses. The new kind of supervision does not need any manual annotation but
it is learned on raw textual data. As our approach easily facilitates
multilinguality, we evaluate it on datasets covering German (PHOENIX-2014T) and
American (How2Sign) sign languages and experiment with mono- and multilingual
sentence embeddings and translation systems. Our approach significantly
outperforms other gloss-free approaches, setting the new state-of-the-art for
data sets where glosses are not available and when no additional SLT datasets
are used for pretraining, diminishing the gap between gloss-free and
gloss-dependent systems.

*Yasser Hamidullah,Shakib Yazdani,Cennet Oguz,Josef van Genabith,Cristina España-Bonet*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 使用语言无关的多模态嵌入监督手语翻译，结合多语言目标增强和视频扰动，提升多语言翻译性能和模型鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统手语翻译通常使用单一语言的文本进行训练，限制了可扩展性和跨语言泛化能力。

Method: 采用在多种语言文本和语音上训练的语言无关多模态嵌入来监督SLT，并提出结合多语言目标增强和视频级扰动的耦合增强方法。

Result: 实验显示在BLEURT指标上持续优于仅使用文本句子嵌入监督的方法，在低资源设置下改进更显著。

Conclusion: 语言无关嵌入监督结合耦合增强为传统SLT训练提供了可扩展且语义鲁棒的替代方案。

Abstract: Sign language translation (SLT) is typically trained with text in a single
spoken language, which limits scalability and cross-language generalization.
Earlier approaches have replaced gloss supervision with text-based sentence
embeddings, but up to now, these remain tied to a specific language and
modality. In contrast, here we employ language-agnostic, multimodal embeddings
trained on text and speech from multiple languages to supervise SLT, enabling
direct multilingual translation. To address data scarcity, we propose a coupled
augmentation method that combines multilingual target augmentations (i.e.
translations into many languages) with video-level perturbations, improving
model robustness. Experiments show consistent BLEURT gains over text-only
sentence embedding supervision, with larger improvements in low-resource
settings. Our results demonstrate that language-agnostic embedding supervision,
combined with coupled augmentation, provides a scalable and semantically robust
alternative to traditional SLT training.

*Victor Morand,Nadi Tomeh,Josiane Mothe,Benjamin Piwowarski*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ToMMeR是一个轻量级模型(<300K参数)，通过探测早期LLM层实现实体提及检测，在13个NER基准测试中达到93%的零样本召回率，90%以上的精确度，证明结构化实体表示存在于早期transformer层中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实体提及检测是信息提取的基础任务，但也是已知的性能瓶颈。研究旨在探索是否可以从早期LLM层中高效恢复结构化实体表示。

Method: 引入ToMMeR模型，通过探测早期LLM层来提取实体提及检测能力，使用LLM作为判断器验证预测质量，并进行跨模型架构分析。

Result: 在13个NER基准测试中实现93%的零样本召回率和90%以上的精确度；跨模型分析显示不同架构(14M-15B参数)在提及边界上高度一致(DICE >75%)；扩展span分类头后达到接近SOTA的NER性能(80-87% F1)。

Conclusion: 实体提及检测自然从语言建模中涌现，结构化实体表示存在于早期transformer层中，可以用极少参数高效恢复。

Abstract: Identifying which text spans refer to entities -- mention detection -- is
both foundational for information extraction and a known performance
bottleneck. We introduce ToMMeR, a lightweight model (<300K parameters) probing
mention detection capabilities from early LLM layers. Across 13 NER benchmarks,
ToMMeR achieves 93\% recall zero-shot, with over 90\% precision using an LLM as
a judge showing that ToMMeR rarely produces spurious predictions despite high
recall. Cross-model analysis reveals that diverse architectures (14M-15B
parameters) converge on similar mention boundaries (DICE >75\%), confirming
that mention detection emerges naturally from language modeling. When extended
with span classification heads, ToMMeR achieves near SOTA NER performance
(80-87\% F1 on standard benchmarks). Our work provides evidence that structured
entity representations exist in early transformer layers and can be efficiently
recovered with minimal parameters.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DFKI-MLT团队在WMT-SLT 2022手语翻译任务中提出了一个端到端架构，从瑞士德语手语视频直接翻译成德语文本，但测试集性能显著下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有手语翻译系统通常使用序列到序列架构，但很少利用时间特征。作者希望开发一个能同时学习时空特征表示和翻译的端到端模型，以更好地泛化到新数据集。

Method: 提出了一个端到端架构，在单一模型中同时学习手语视频的时空特征表示和翻译任务，而不是使用预提取的特征。

Result: 在开发集上取得了5±1 BLEU分数，但在测试集上性能大幅下降至0.11±0.06 BLEU分数。

Conclusion: 虽然端到端方法在开发集上表现良好，但在测试集上的显著性能下降表明模型泛化能力有限，需要进一步改进。

Abstract: This paper describes the DFKI-MLT submission to the WMT-SLT 2022 sign
language translation (SLT) task from Swiss German Sign Language (video) into
German (text). State-of-the-art techniques for SLT use a generic seq2seq
architecture with customized input embeddings. Instead of word embeddings as
used in textual machine translation, SLT systems use features extracted from
video frames. Standard approaches often do not benefit from temporal features.
In our participation, we present a system that learns spatio-temporal feature
representations and translation in a single model, resulting in a real
end-to-end architecture expected to better generalize to new data sets. Our
best system achieved $5\pm1$ BLEU points on the development set, but the
performance on the test dropped to $0.11\pm0.06$ BLEU points.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BLiSS 1.0是一个评估认知启发模型的新基准，通过选择性容忍度测试模型是否能区分自然学习者错误与人工错误，验证不同训练目标对模型与人类语言习得模式对齐的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 弥补性能导向基准与认知启发模型评估之间的差距，提供更贴近人类语言习得模式的评估方法。

Method: 基于280万自然学习者句子构建136,867个控制三元组（正确、学习者、人工），测试模型对自然学习者错误与匹配人工错误的容忍度差异。

Result: 实验表明选择性容忍度是区别于标准语法性的独立能力，模型表现按训练范式明显聚类。

Conclusion: BLiSS是衡量不同训练目标如何影响模型与人类语言习得系统性模式对齐的稳健工具。

Abstract: To bridge the gap between performance-oriented benchmarks and the evaluation
of cognitively inspired models, we introduce BLiSS 1.0, a Benchmark of Learner
Interlingual Syntactic Structure. Our benchmark operationalizes a new paradigm
of selective tolerance, testing whether a model finds a naturalistic learner
error more plausible than a matched, artificial error within the same sentence.
Constructed from over 2.8 million naturalistic learner sentences, BLiSS
provides 136,867 controlled triplets (corrected, learner, artificial) for this
purpose. Experiments on a diverse suite of models demonstrate that selective
tolerance is a distinct capability from standard grammaticality, with
performance clustering strongly by training paradigm. This validates BLiSS as a
robust tool for measuring how different training objectives impact a model's
alignment with the systematic patterns of human language acquisition.

TL;DR: MINED是一个评估大型多模态模型时间感知能力的综合基准，包含6个关键维度和11个任务，涵盖2104个时间敏感知识样本。评估显示大多数开源LMM缺乏时间理解能力，但可以通过知识编辑方法有效更新知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准设计静态，无法充分评估LMMs对时间敏感知识的理解能力，需要构建专门的时间感知评估基准。

Method: 从维基百科构建MINED基准，包含2104个时间敏感知识样本，涵盖6种知识类型，由专业标注者标注。评估15个广泛使用的LMMs，并研究通过知识编辑方法更新时间敏感知识的可行性。

Result: Gemini-2.5-Pro获得最高平均CEM分数63.07，大多数开源LMMs缺乏时间理解能力。LMMs在组织知识上表现最好，在体育知识上表现最弱。知识编辑方法在单次编辑场景中能有效更新LMMs的知识。

Conclusion: MINED基准揭示了LMMs在时间敏感知识理解方面的局限性，但知识编辑方法为解决这一问题提供了可行途径。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) encode rich factual knowledge via cross-modal
pre-training, yet their static representations struggle to maintain an accurate
understanding of time-sensitive factual knowledge. Existing benchmarks remain
constrained by static designs, inadequately evaluating LMMs' ability to
understand time-sensitive knowledge. To address this gap, we propose MINED, a
comprehensive benchmark that evaluates temporal awareness along 6 key
dimensions and 11 challenging tasks: cognition, awareness, trustworthiness,
understanding, reasoning, and robustness. MINED is constructed from Wikipedia
by two professional annotators, containing 2,104 time-sensitive knowledge
samples spanning six knowledge types. Evaluating 15 widely used LMMs on MINED
shows that Gemini-2.5-Pro achieves the highest average CEM score of 63.07,
while most open-source LMMs still lack time understanding ability. Meanwhile,
LMMs perform best on organization knowledge, whereas their performance is
weakest on sport. To address these challenges, we investigate the feasibility
of updating time-sensitive knowledge in LMMs through knowledge editing methods
and observe that LMMs can effectively update knowledge via knowledge editing
methods in single editing scenarios.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MBR解码在语音转文本任务中优于波束搜索，在大多数实验设置中提高了ASR和ST的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 鉴于MBR解码在文本到文本生成任务中有效，期望其在语音到文本任务中同样有效，但目前波束搜索仍是ASR和ST的标准实践。

Method: 使用Whisper及其衍生模型在英语和日语上评估MBR解码，并与波束搜索进行比较。

Result: 在大多数实验设置中，MBR解码的准确性优于波束搜索。

Conclusion: MBR解码是离线ASR和ST任务中一种有前景的高精度方法。

Abstract: Recent work has shown that sample-based Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decoding
outperforms beam search in text-to-text generation tasks, such as machine
translation, text summarization, and image captioning. On the other hand, beam
search is the current practice for speech-to-text tasks such as automatic
speech recognition (ASR) and Speech Translation (ST). Given that MBR decoding
is effective in text-to-text generation tasks, it is reasonable to expect it to
also be effective for speech-to-text tasks. In this paper, we evaluate MBR
decoding for ASR and ST tasks on English and Japanese using Whisper and its
derivative models. We observe that the accuracy of MBR decoding outperforms
that of beam search in most of the experimental settings we have evaluated. The
results show that MBR decoding is a promising method for offline ASR and ST
tasks that require high accuracy. The code is available at

TL;DR: VideoAgentTrek是一个从公开屏幕录制视频自动挖掘训练数据的可扩展管道，无需人工标注，显著提升了计算机使用代理的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 训练计算机使用代理需要大量GUI交互数据，但手动标注成本过高，需要寻找可扩展的自动化数据生成方法。

Method: 开发Video2Action逆向动态模块，包含视频定位模型和动作内容识别器，从YouTube教程视频中自动提取结构化交互数据。

Result: 从39,000个YouTube视频生成152万交互步骤，在OSWorld-Verified上任务成功率从9.3%提升至15.8%，在AgentNetBench上步骤准确率从64.1%提升至69.3%。

Conclusion: 被动互联网视频可以转化为高质量的训练数据，为计算机使用代理提供可扩展的监督学习替代方案。

Abstract: Training computer-use agents requires massive amounts of GUI interaction
data, but manually annotating action trajectories at scale is prohibitively
expensive. We present VideoAgentTrek, a scalable pipeline that automatically
mines training data from publicly available screen-recorded videos at web
scale, eliminating the need for manual annotation. Our approach addresses a key
challenge: raw videos contain implicit demonstrations but lack explicit action
labels. To solve this, we develop Video2Action, an inverse dynamics module
(IDM) with two components: (1) a video grounding model that detects and
localizes GUI actions with precise temporal boundaries and context, and (2) an
action-content recognizer that extracts structured parameters like click
coordinates and typed text with high fidelity. Applied to 39,000 YouTube
tutorial videos, our pipeline generates 1.52 million interaction steps
automatically. We leverage this data through continued pretraining followed by
supervised fine-tuning. On OSWorld-Verified, our approach improves task success
rates from 9.3% (SFT-only baseline) to 15.8%, a 70% relative improvement. On
AgentNetBench, step accuracy increases from 64.1% to 69.3%. Our results
demonstrate that passive internet videos can be transformed into high-quality
supervision for computer-use agents, providing a scalable alternative to
expensive manual annotation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然成员推理攻击和机器生成文本检测目标不同，但方法都基于语言模型的概率分布信号。由于两者独立研究，可能忽略了另一任务中的更强方法和宝贵见解。

Method: 理论证明两种任务的最优性能度量相同，并通过大规模实验（7种MIA方法和5种机器文本检测器，涵盖13个领域和10个生成器）验证跨任务性能的强相关性。

Result: 发现跨任务性能存在非常强的秩相关性（rho > 0.6），其中为机器文本检测设计的Binoculars方法在MIA基准测试中也达到了最先进性能。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明两个研究社区需要更多的跨任务意识和合作，并提出了MINT统一评估套件来促进跨任务发展和公平评估。

Abstract: Although membership inference attacks (MIAs) and machine-generated text
detection target different goals, identifying training samples and synthetic
texts, their methods often exploit similar signals based on a language model's
probability distribution. Despite this shared methodological foundation, the
two tasks have been independently studied, which may lead to conclusions that
overlook stronger methods and valuable insights developed in the other task. In
this work, we theoretically and empirically investigate the transferability,
i.e., how well a method originally developed for one task performs on the
other, between MIAs and machine text detection. For our theoretical
contribution, we prove that the metric that achieves the asymptotically highest
performance on both tasks is the same. We unify a large proportion of the
existing literature in the context of this optimal metric and hypothesize that
the accuracy with which a given method approximates this metric is directly
correlated with its transferability. Our large-scale empirical experiments,
including 7 state-of-the-art MIA methods and 5 state-of-the-art machine text
detectors across 13 domains and 10 generators, demonstrate very strong rank
correlation (rho > 0.6) in cross-task performance. We notably find that
Binoculars, originally designed for machine text detection, achieves
state-of-the-art performance on MIA benchmarks as well, demonstrating the
practical impact of the transferability. Our findings highlight the need for
greater cross-task awareness and collaboration between the two research
communities. To facilitate cross-task developments and fair evaluations, we
introduce MINT, a unified evaluation suite for MIAs and machine-generated text
detection, with implementation of 15 recent methods from both tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了在BabyLM预训练中序列长度的影响，发现在固定计算预算下，不同任务和架构对序列长度的需求不同：语法泛化任务需要较短序列，而形态类比推理任务需要较长上下文。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer语言模型通常使用固定长度的上下文窗口，但在BabyLM挑战赛中许多提交使用了更短的序列长度。本研究旨在确定BabyLM训练时应使用的最佳序列长度。

Method: 使用100M词的训练数据和固定计算预算，比较了125M参数的Mamba和OPT模型在不同序列长度下的表现。

Result: 虽然更长的序列通常更好，但最佳长度取决于任务和架构。语法泛化任务使用较短序列就足够，而形态类比推理任务需要更长上下文才能获得更好表现。

Conclusion: 在BabyLM预训练中，序列长度的选择应基于具体任务需求和模型架构，没有统一的最优长度。

Abstract: Transformer language models typically operate with a fixed-length context
window, which has grown in step with large-scale pretraining datasets. In the
BabyLM Challenge, however, many past submissions have defaulted to using much
shorter sequence lengths. We examine the impact of sequence length on BabyLM
pretraining, to answer the simple question: what sequence length should we be
using when training Baby LMs? Using 100M-word training data and fixed compute
budgets, we compare 125M-parameter Mamba and OPT models, finding that although
longer is often better, the optimal length depends on both task and
architecture. Shorter sequences are sufficient for grammatical generalization
tasks whereas longer contexts benefit morphological analogical reasoning tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Lookahead路由框架，通过预测潜在输出来指导模型选择，在多个基准测试中比现有方法平均提升7.7%性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有路由方法仅基于输入查询进行分类，忽略了潜在输出信息，无法捕捉隐含意图和上下文细微差别，导致复杂或模糊查询的路由决策不理想

Method: 提出Lookahead框架，通过预测模型输出的潜在表示来"预见"可能输出，基于因果和掩码语言模型实现两种方法

Result: 在七个公共基准测试（指令跟随、数学推理、代码生成）中持续优于现有路由基线

Conclusion: Lookahead框架能够在不进行完整推理的情况下实现更明智的路由决策，显著提升多模型系统的效率

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) routers improve the efficiency of multi-model
systems by directing each query to the most appropriate model while leveraging
the diverse strengths of heterogeneous LLMs. Most existing approaches frame
routing as a classification problem based solely on the input query. While this
reduces overhead by avoiding inference across all models, it overlooks valuable
information that could be gleaned from potential outputs and fails to capture
implicit intent or contextual nuances that often emerge only during response
generation. These limitations can result in suboptimal routing decisions,
particularly for complex or ambiguous queries that require deeper semantic
understanding. To address this challenge, we propose Lookahead, a routing
framework that "foresees" potential model outputs by predicting their latent
representations and uses these predictions to guide model selection, thus
enabling more informed routing without full inference. Within this framework,
we implement two approaches based on causal and masked language models.
Empirical evaluations across seven public benchmarks - spanning instruction
following, mathematical reasoning, and code generation - show that Lookahead
consistently outperforms existing routing baselines, achieving an average
performance gain of 7.7% over the state-of-the-art. Our code is available at
https://github.com/huangcb01/lookahead-routing.

Conclusion: 该工作为语音模型评估提供了概念基础和实践指南，帮助研究者选择、解释和扩展评估方法，推动更全面的模型评估发展。

Abstract: Speech foundation models have recently achieved remarkable capabilities
across a wide range of tasks. However, their evaluation remains disjointed
across tasks and model types. Different models excel at distinct aspects of
speech processing and thus require different evaluation protocols. This paper
proposes a unified taxonomy that addresses the question: Which evaluation is
appropriate for which model? The taxonomy defines three orthogonal axes: the
\textbf{evaluation aspect} being measured, the model capabilities required to
attempt the task, and the task or protocol requirements needed to perform it.
We classify a broad set of existing evaluations and benchmarks along these
axes, spanning areas such as representation learning, speech generation, and
interactive dialogue. By mapping each evaluation to the capabilities a model
exposes (e.g., speech generation, real-time processing) and to its
methodological demands (e.g., fine-tuning data, human judgment), the taxonomy
provides a principled framework for aligning models with suitable evaluation
methods. It also reveals systematic gaps, such as limited coverage of prosody,
interaction, or reasoning, that highlight priorities for future benchmark
design. Overall, this work offers a conceptual foundation and practical guide
for selecting, interpreting, and extending evaluations of speech models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言基础模型在特定语言上微调时常引发灾难性遗忘，降低未见语言性能，但文献对此现象何时发生存在分歧结果，需要系统研究来澄清。

Method: 使用机器翻译作为测试平台，在不同模型架构、数据规模和微调方法上进行受控实验，分析遗忘触发条件。

Result: 发现模型与数据规模的相对比例是遗忘的主要决定因素；指令遵循能力对保留多语言知识比架构更关键；参数高效微调相比全参数微调在缓解遗忘方面无优势；跨语言对齐可缓解遗忘并促进对未见目标语言的正面迁移。

Conclusion: 多语言微调中的灾难性遗忘主要由模型-数据规模比例决定，指令遵循能力是关键因素，跨语言对齐是有效的缓解策略。

Abstract: Fine-tuning multilingual foundation models on specific languages often
induces catastrophic forgetting, degrading performance on languages unseen in
fine-tuning. While this phenomenon is widely-documented, the literature
presents fragmented results about when forgetting occurs. To address this
ambiguity, we conduct a systematic empirical study using machine translation as
a testbed to identify the conditions that trigger catastrophic forgetting in
multilingual fine-tuning. Through controlled experiments across different model
architectures, data scales, and fine-tuning approaches, we reveal that the
relative scale between model and data size is a primary determinant of
forgetting. Moreover, we demonstrate that a model's instruction-following
ability is more critical for retaining multilingual knowledge than its
architecture. Contrary to assumptions, parameter-efficient fine-tuning offers
no clear advantage over full fine-tuning in mitigating forgetting. Lastly, we
show that cross-lingual alignment can mitigate forgetting while also
facilitating positive transfer to unseen target languages.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型的广泛采用，确保其与社会规范保持一致变得至关重要。现有研究主要关注其他语言的偏见检测，波斯文化背景下的社会偏见资源存在显著空白。

Method: 通过与社会科学专家合作，让250名来自不同人口统计背景的个体填写问卷，开发了包含16个文化类别的PBBQ基准数据集，包含37,000多个精心策划的问题。

Result: 对多个开源LLM、闭源模型和波斯语微调模型进行基准测试，发现当前LLM在波斯文化中表现出显著的社会偏见。模型输出与人类响应比较显示，LLM经常复制人类偏见模式。

Abstract: With the increasing adoption of large language models (LLMs), ensuring their
alignment with social norms has become a critical concern. While prior research
has examined bias detection in various languages, there remains a significant
gap in resources addressing social biases within Persian cultural contexts. In
this work, we introduce PBBQ, a comprehensive benchmark dataset designed to
evaluate social biases in Persian LLMs. Our benchmark, which encompasses 16
cultural categories, was developed through questionnaires completed by 250
diverse individuals across multiple demographics, in close collaboration with
social science experts to ensure its validity. The resulting PBBQ dataset
contains over 37,000 carefully curated questions, providing a foundation for
the evaluation and mitigation of bias in Persian language models. We benchmark
several open-source LLMs, a closed-source model, and Persian-specific
fine-tuned models on PBBQ. Our findings reveal that current LLMs exhibit
significant social biases across Persian culture. Additionally, by comparing
model outputs to human responses, we observe that LLMs often replicate human
bias patterns, highlighting the complex interplay between learned
representations and cultural stereotypes.Upon acceptance of the paper, our PBBQ
dataset will be publicly available for use in future work. Content warning:

Result: 测试了从传统词袋模型、基于Transformer的架构到大型语言模型（LLMs）等多种模型，结果突显了多语言新闻分析的挑战。

Conclusion: 该研究为跨语言新闻分析提供了新的数据集和方法，揭示了多语言新闻分析中的挑战，并为模型性能提供了见解。

Abstract: In the era of social networks and rapid misinformation spread, news analysis
remains a critical task. Detecting fake news across multiple languages,
particularly beyond English, poses significant challenges. Cross-lingual news
comparison offers a promising approach to verify information by leveraging
external sources in different languages (Chen and Shu, 2024). However, existing
datasets for cross-lingual news analysis (Chen et al., 2022a) were manually
curated by journalists and experts, limiting their scalability and adaptability
to new languages. In this work, we address this gap by introducing a scalable,
explainable crowdsourcing pipeline for cross-lingual news similarity
assessment. Using this pipeline, we collected a novel dataset CrossNews-UA of
news pairs in Ukrainian as a central language with linguistically and
contextually relevant languages-Polish, Russian, and English. Each news pair is
annotated for semantic similarity with detailed justifications based on the 4W
criteria (Who, What, Where, When). We further tested a range of models, from
traditional bag-of-words, Transformer-based architectures to large language
models (LLMs). Our results highlight the challenges in multilingual news
analysis and offer insights into models performance.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于字体风格的攻击方法SAD，利用人类与NLP模型对风格化文本的感知差异，在保持人类可读性的同时有效攻击NLP模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体中用户使用风格化字体和字体表情表达个性，这些视觉上吸引人的文本对人类可读，但对NLP模型构成潜在威胁，因为模型将这些字符处理为不同标记，导致干扰。

Method: 设计了Style Attack Disguise (SAD)攻击方法，包含轻量版（注重查询效率）和强力版（注重攻击性能），利用风格化文本的人类-模型感知差异。

Result: 在情感分类和机器翻译任务上对传统模型、LLM和商业服务的实验显示SAD具有强大的攻击性能，并在多模态任务（文本到图像、文本到语音生成）中展示潜在威胁。

Conclusion: 风格化文本在NLP模型中引入了隐藏漏洞，SAD攻击方法有效利用了人类与模型感知的差异，对多种NLP任务构成实际威胁。

Abstract: With social media growth, users employ stylistic fonts and font-like emoji to
express individuality, creating visually appealing text that remains
human-readable. However, these fonts introduce hidden vulnerabilities in NLP
models: while humans easily read stylistic text, models process these
characters as distinct tokens, causing interference. We identify this
human-model perception gap and propose a style-based attack, Style Attack
Disguise (SAD). We design two sizes: light for query efficiency and strong for
superior attack performance. Experiments on sentiment classification and
machine translation across traditional models, LLMs, and commercial services
demonstrate SAD's strong attack performance. We also show SAD's potential
threats to multimodal tasks including text-to-image and text-to-speech
generation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LlavaCode框架通过将代码压缩为紧凑的语义表示来改进代码补全，在保持生成质量的同时显著减少推理延迟


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 检索增强生成在代码补全中很有效，但引入上下文会延长序列长度导致推理变慢，这在IDE等交互环境中是严重限制

Method: 使用小型投影器模块将代码压缩为可由代码LLM解释的紧凑语义表示，将检索上下文减少到仅几个压缩的单标记向量

Result: 压缩上下文使行级补全任务的首次标记时间减少20-38%，同时通过可忽略的延迟增加显著提高了EM和ES指标

Conclusion: LlavaCode框架通过代码压缩有效解决了RAG在代码补全中的延迟问题，在保持质量的同时大幅提升推理速度

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation has emerged as one of the most effective
approaches for code completion, particularly when context from a surrounding
repository is essential. However, incorporating context significantly extends
sequence length, leading to slower inference - a critical limitation for
interactive settings such as IDEs. In this work, we introduce LlavaCode, a
framework that compresses code into compact, semantically rich representations
interpretable by code LLM, enhancing generation quality while reducing the
retrieved context to only a few compressed single-token vectors. Using a small
projector module we can significantly increase the EM and ES metrics of coding
model with negligible latency increase. Our experiments demonstrate that
compressed context enables 20-38% reduction in Time-to-First-Token (TTFT) on
line completion tasks compared to full-RAG pipelines.

Motivation: 探索开放文本中情感分析的挑战，如上下文歧义、语言变异性和复杂情感表达解释困难，这些限制使得通用模型直接应用困难。

Method: 在三种不同场景下比较微调和提示工程效果：(i)微调预训练模型与使用简单提示的通用LLMs性能；(ii)不同情感提示设计对LLMs的有效性；(iii)情感分组技术对这些模型的影响。

Result: 实验测试显示微调预训练模型在情感识别中达到70%以上指标，LLMs需要结构化提示工程和情感分组来提升性能。

Conclusion: 这些进展改进了情感分析、人机交互以及跨领域用户行为的理解。

Abstract: Transformer models have significantly advanced the field of emotion
recognition. However, there are still open challenges when exploring open-ended
queries for Large Language Models (LLMs). Although current models offer good
results, automatic emotion analysis in open texts presents significant
challenges, such as contextual ambiguity, linguistic variability, and
difficulty interpreting complex emotional expressions. These limitations make
the direct application of generalist models difficult. Accordingly, this work
compares the effectiveness of fine-tuning and prompt engineering in emotion
detection in three distinct scenarios: (i) performance of fine-tuned
pre-trained models and general-purpose LLMs using simple prompts; (ii)
effectiveness of different emotion prompt designs with LLMs; and (iii) impact
of emotion grouping techniques on these models. Experimental tests attain
metrics above 70% with a fine-tuned pre-trained model for emotion recognition.
Moreover, the findings highlight that LLMs require structured prompt
engineering and emotion grouping to enhance their performance. These
advancements improve sentiment analysis, human-computer interaction, and
understanding of user behavior across various domains.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了DiffAdapt框架，通过分析推理轨迹中的熵模式来识别过度思考现象，并基于问题难度自适应选择推理策略，在不微调基础LLM的情况下显著减少计算资源消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在推理时经常生成冗长的思考轨迹，但其中很多内容可能是不必要的过度思考，导致计算效率低下。本文旨在提高推理效率，让模型在不牺牲性能的情况下避免过度思考。

Method: 首先分析推理轨迹中token概率的熵模式，发现U型熵分布规律。然后提出DiffAdapt框架，使用小型探针分类LLM的最终隐藏状态，根据问题难度和推理轨迹熵为每个问题选择Easy/Normal/Hard推理策略（包含固定提示、温度和最大token长度）。

Result: 在5个模型和8个基准测试上的评估显示，该方法在保持或提高准确率的同时，将token使用量减少了高达22.4%。观察到从简单到中等难度区域有22-25%的熵减少，证实了简单实例上的过度思考现象。

Conclusion: DiffAdapt为计算高效的推理提供了一条实用路径，通过轻量级自适应策略选择显著减少计算资源消耗，同时维持模型性能。

Abstract: Recent reasoning Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable
problem-solving abilities but often generate long thinking traces whose utility
is unclear. Our work aims to improve their efficiency, enabling them to reach
high performance without overthinking. First, we analyze the entropy of token
probabilities in reasoning traces. Across three models, we observe a consistent
U-shaped entropy pattern: high entropy on easy problems despite high accuracy,
low entropy on problems with medium difficulty, and high entropy on hard
problems reflecting uncertainty. Specifically, we notice 22--25\% entropy
reduction from easy to medium difficulty regions, suggesting an {overthinking}
phenomenon on easy instances. Building on these insights, we introduce
\textbf{DiffAdapt}, a lightweight framework that selects Easy/Normal/Hard
inference strategies per question based on their difficulty and reasoning trace
entropy. Each inference strategy consists of a fixed prompt, temperature and
maximum token length. In contrast to existing efficiency optimization methods,
our approach does not fine-tune base LLM but a small probe that classifies
LLM's final hidden state, allowing inexpensive adaptation. We comprehensively
evaluate our method on five models and eight benchmarks. Our method achieves
comparable or improved accuracy while reducing token usage by up to 22.4\%,
establishing a practical path toward compute-efficient reasoning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文研究了大型语言模型是否具备动机警觉能力，即能否像人类一样考虑信息来源的动机来评估内容可信度。研究发现LLMs在受控实验中表现出类似人类的动机敏感性，但在真实广告场景中表现不佳，通过简单的引导干预可显著提升其表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类沟通具有动机性，人们会根据信息来源的意图决定是否信任陈述。为了让LLMs在现实世界中有效运作，它们必须具备评估信息来源动机的能力，比如判断销售宣传中的主张可信度。

Method: 首先使用认知科学的受控实验验证LLMs行为是否与理性学习模型一致，然后扩展到赞助在线广告等更自然的信息环境，最后测试简单的引导干预是否能提升模型表现。

Result: 在受控实验中，LLMs成功以类似人类的方式对有偏见来源的信息进行折扣；但在真实广告场景中，LLMs的推理与理性模型预测不符，部分原因是额外信息分散了注意力。简单的引导干预显著提高了LLMs与理性模型的一致性。

Conclusion: LLMs具备对他人动机的基本敏感性，但要泛化到新的现实世界场景还需要进一步改进这些模型。

Abstract: Human communication is motivated: people speak, write, and create content
with a particular communicative intent in mind. As a result, information that
large language models (LLMs) and AI agents process is inherently framed by
humans' intentions and incentives. People are adept at navigating such nuanced
information: we routinely identify benevolent or self-serving motives in order
to decide what statements to trust. For LLMs to be effective in the real world,
they too must critically evaluate content by factoring in the motivations of
the source -- for instance, weighing the credibility of claims made in a sales
pitch. In this paper, we undertake a comprehensive study of whether LLMs have
this capacity for motivational vigilance. We first employ controlled
experiments from cognitive science to verify that LLMs' behavior is consistent
with rational models of learning from motivated testimony, and find they
successfully discount information from biased sources in a human-like manner.
We then extend our evaluation to sponsored online adverts, a more naturalistic
reflection of LLM agents' information ecosystems. In these settings, we find
that LLMs' inferences do not track the rational models' predictions nearly as
closely -- partly due to additional information that distracts them from
vigilance-relevant considerations. However, a simple steering intervention that
boosts the salience of intentions and incentives substantially increases the
correspondence between LLMs and the rational model. These results suggest that
LLMs possess a basic sensitivity to the motivations of others, but generalizing
to novel real-world settings will require further improvements to these models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在干扰环境中部署大型模型时的语义理解、隐私保护和可预测延迟等共同目标，特别是在边缘设备上处理多模态传感器数据的需求。

Method: 包含四个核心组件：SenseFusion轻量编码器、Edge-RAG本地检索层、PromptRouter成本感知策略和Secure Execution安全执行路径，结合现代服务优化技术。

Result: 在家庭、办公室和诊所部署中实现亚秒级延迟，减少跨层令牌和带宽成本，通过本地检索提高事实一致性，隐私保护仅传输离散代码和脱敏元数据。

Conclusion: 支持边缘优先设计，将语义理解、隐私保护和可预测延迟作为干扰环境中大型模型部署的同等重要目标。

Abstract: We present CoSense-LLM, an edge-first framework that turns continuous
multimodal sensor streams (for example Wi-Fi CSI, IMU, audio, RFID, and
lightweight vision) into compact, verifiable semantic tokens and coordinates
with large language models under explicit latency, energy, bandwidth, and
privacy constraints. CoSense-LLM has four parts: (i) SenseFusion, a lightweight
encoder that aligns sensor embeddings with language and compresses them into
short discrete code sequences; (ii) Edge-RAG, a local hybrid retrieval layer
that grounds generation in site specific policies and notes; (iii)
PromptRouter, a cost and uncertainty aware policy that selects edge only
generation, edge plus retrieval, or compact cloud escalation; and (iv) Secure
Execution, an auditable redaction path that enforces data minimization so raw
waveforms never leave the device. The system works with modern serving
optimizations, including paged or streaming KV caches, FlashAttention style
kernels, speculative decoding, and quantized LoRA adapters, and supports on
device personalization and federated updates under non IID drift. Across home,
office, and clinic deployments, CoSense-LLM delivers grounded explanations
while meeting tight service level objectives: it sustains sub second (p95) end
to end latency on edge dominant paths, reduces inter tier token and bandwidth
costs by preferring local retrieval grounded responses, and preserves privacy
by transmitting only discrete codes and redacted metadata. Ablations show that
Edge-RAG improves factual consistency and reduces contradictions, calibrated
uncertainty enables selective abstention and controlled escalations, and KV
plus decoding accelerators lower energy per decision. The results support an
edge first design that treats semantics, privacy, and predictable latency as co
equal goals for large model deployments in interference prone environments.

Motivation: 理解语言模型在零样本设置下如何通过提示执行多样化任务的内在机制，以及预训练嵌入如何支持上下文任务解决。

Method: 进行一系列探针实验，分析不同提示模板组合在零样本分类任务中的嵌入表征质量。

Result: 提示确实影响表征质量，但这些变化与提示对目标任务的相关性并不一致相关。

Conclusion: 研究挑战了更相关提示必然产生更好表征的假设，并分析了可能导致这种意外行为的潜在因素。

Abstract: Prompting is a common approach for leveraging LMs in zero-shot settings.
However, the underlying mechanisms that enable LMs to perform diverse tasks
without task-specific supervision remain poorly understood. Studying the
relationship between prompting and the quality of internal representations can
shed light on how pre-trained embeddings may support in-context task solving.
In this empirical study, we conduct a series of probing experiments on prompt
embeddings, analyzing various combinations of prompt templates for zero-shot
classification. Our findings show that while prompting affects the quality of
representations, these changes do not consistently correlate with the relevance
of the prompts to the target task. This result challenges the assumption that
more relevant prompts necessarily lead to better representations. We further
analyze potential factors that may contribute to this unexpected behavior.

Motivation: 长链思维能力是LLM在复杂推理任务中取得突破的关键，但存在"欠思考"问题，即模型频繁切换思维而缺乏充分探索，限制了性能和token效率。

Method: SmartSwitch框架包含感知模块和干预模块。感知模块使用现成的过程奖励模型检测思维切换点并评估前一个思维的潜力；干预模块在发现高潜力思维被过早放弃时，回溯到切换点前并插入深化提示。

Result: 在具有挑战性的数学推理基准测试上的广泛实验表明，该方法显著提升了不同规模的各种大语言模型的性能。

Conclusion: SmartSwitch是一个简单有效的推理策略，可作为即插即用解决方案集成到任何大语言模型中，通过检测和干预"欠思考"问题来提升推理深度和性能。

Abstract: The long chain-of-thought (LongCoT) capability is central to the recent
breakthroughs achieved by large language models in complex reasoning tasks.
However, the accompanying issue of ''underthinking'', where models exhibit
shallow reasoning by frequently switching thoughts without sufficient
exploration, limits both performance and token efficiency. To address this
problem, we propose a simple yet effective reasoning strategy: the SmartSwitch
inference framework. This framework can be easily integrated into any large
language model as a plug-and-play solution, continuously monitoring the model's
reasoning process to detect underthinking and guide it toward deeper
exploration of promising but overlooked thoughts. Specifically, the perception
module identifies points where thoughts switch and evaluates the potential of
the preceding thought using an off-the-shelf process reward model (PRM). If a
high-potential thought is found to be prematurely abandoned, the intervention
module interrupts the ongoing inference, backtracks to the point before the
switch, and inserts a "deepening prompt" to encourage further exploration along
that promising path. Extensive experiments on challenging mathematical
reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the
performance of various large language models of different sizes.

TL;DR: AdaSPEC是一种改进推测解码的方法，通过选择性token过滤增强知识蒸馏，提高小模型与大模型的对齐度，从而显著提升token接受率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统知识蒸馏方法在所有token上最小化KL散度，这与推测解码最大化token接受率的目标不一致。由于容量限制，小模型难以完全吸收大模型知识，导致性能不佳。

Method: AdaSPEC引入选择性token过滤机制，使用参考模型识别并过滤难以拟合的token，使小模型能更好地在简单token上与目标模型对齐。

Result: 在算术推理、指令遵循、编程和摘要等任务上，AdaSPEC在31M/1.4B和350M/2.7B参数配置下均优于最先进的DistillSpec方法，接受率提升高达15%。

Conclusion: AdaSPEC通过选择性知识蒸馏有效提升了推测解码的性能，在不影响生成质量的前提下显著提高了token接受率。

Abstract: Speculative Decoding (SD) accelerates large language model inference by
employing a small draft model to generate predictions, which are then verified
by a larger target model. The effectiveness of SD hinges on the alignment
between these models, which is typically enhanced by Knowledge Distillation
(KD). However, conventional KD methods aim to minimize the KL divergence
between the draft and target models across all tokens, a goal that is
misaligned with the true objective of SD, which is to maximize token acceptance
rate. Therefore, draft models often struggle to fully assimilate the target
model's knowledge due to capacity constraints, leading to suboptimal
performance. To address this challenge, we propose AdaSPEC, a novel method that
incorporates selective token filtering into the KD process. AdaSPEC utilizes a
reference model to identify and filter out difficult-to-fit tokens, enabling
the distillation of a draft model that better aligns with the target model on
simpler tokens. This approach improves the overall token acceptance rate
without compromising generation quality. We evaluate AdaSPEC across diverse
tasks, including arithmetic reasoning, instruction-following, coding, and
summarization, using model configurations of 31M/1.4B and 350M/2.7B parameters.
Our results demonstrate that AdaSPEC consistently outperforms the
state-of-the-art DistillSpec method, achieving higher acceptance rates across
all tasks (up to 15\%). The code is publicly available at

Motivation: 解决普通公民难以理解和应用复杂欧盟法律信息的问题，尽管欧盟提供了开放的法律资源。

Method: 构建包含880个对话轮次的EUDial数据集，并开发LexGuide框架，采用检索增强生成和分层主题组织来结构化对话流程。

Result: 主动结构化导航缩小了法律信息可用性与公民理解之间的差距，EUDial和LexGuide成为推进主动法律对话系统的实用资源。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了法律信息的可访问性，为开发面向公民的法律对话系统提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: The accessibility of legal information remains a constant challenge,
particularly for laypersons seeking to understand and apply complex
institutional texts. While the European Union provides open access to
legislation, parliamentary responses, and regulatory documents, these resources
can be challenging for laypeople to explore. In this paper, we introduce
EUDial, a proactive multi-turn dialogue dataset constructed from 204 blogs
curated by the Citizens' Enquiries Unit (AskEP) of the European Parliamentary
Research Service. EUDial contains 880 dialogue turns (averaging 4.3 turns per
dialogue), where each dialogue includes initial questions, structured answers,
and follow-up questions. Beyond dataset construction, we propose the LexGuide
framework that leverages retrieval-augmented generation with hierarchical topic
organization to structure dialogue progression, ensuring both comprehensive
coverage of legal aspects and coherence across conversational turns. The
results demonstrate that proactive, structured navigation closes the gap
between the availability of legal information and citizen comprehension,
establishing EUDial and LexGuide as practical resources for advancing proactive
legal dialogue systems.

Motivation: 现有基于可验证奖励的强化学习方法面临"学习悬崖"现象：当模型遇到远超其当前能力的问题时，持续获得零奖励信号，导致优势计算崩溃，学习梯度消失，难以解决困难问题。

Method: 提出Scaf-GRPO（脚手架分组相对策略优化）框架：1）诊断学习停滞；2）在需要时注入分层提示（从抽象概念到具体步骤）；3）让模型自主构建有效解决方案。

Result: 在具有挑战性的数学基准测试中，Scaf-GRPO将Qwen2.5-Math-7B模型在AIME24基准上的pass@1分数相比普通GRPO基线相对提升了44.3%。

Conclusion: 该框架为解锁LLM解决超出其当前能力范围问题的能力提供了稳健有效的方法，是推进自主推理前沿的关键一步。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards has emerged as a powerful
technique for enhancing the complex reasoning abilities of Large Language
Models (LLMs). However, these methods are fundamentally constrained by the
''learning cliff'' phenomenon: when faced with problems far beyond their
current capabilities, models consistently fail, yielding a persistent
zero-reward signal. In policy optimization algorithms like GRPO, this collapses
the advantage calculation to zero, rendering these difficult problems invisible
to the learning gradient and stalling progress. To overcome this, we introduce
Scaf-GRPO (Scaffolded Group Relative Policy Optimization), a progressive
training framework that strategically provides minimal guidance only when a
model's independent learning has plateaued. The framework first diagnoses
learning stagnation and then intervenes by injecting tiered in-prompt hints,
ranging from abstract concepts to concrete steps, enabling the model to
construct a valid solution by itself. Extensive experiments on challenging
mathematics benchmarks demonstrate Scaf-GRPO's effectiveness, boosting the
pass@1 score of the Qwen2.5-Math-7B model on the AIME24 benchmark by a relative
44.3% over a vanilla GRPO baseline. This result demonstrates our framework
provides a robust and effective methodology for unlocking a model's ability to
solve problems previously beyond its reach, a critical step towards extending
the frontier of autonomous reasoning in LLM.

Motivation: 现有方法无法确保LLM按照特定文化规范生成内容，直接微调LoRA权重会引入大量参数，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 提出Zhyper框架，使用因子化超网络从文本描述生成上下文感知的LoRA适配器，实现参数高效的文化条件化。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，Zhyper达到与最先进基线相当的性能，同时参数数量最多减少26倍，在文化对齐任务中展现出更好的泛化能力和细粒度上下文价值捕捉。

Conclusion: Zhyper提供了一种参数高效的方法来实现LLM的文化条件化，在保持性能的同时显著减少参数数量，并展现出更好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) conditioning refers to instructing an LLM to
generate content in accordance with the norms and values of a specific culture,
beliefs of a particular political orientation, or any desired text-specified
semantic conditioning. Unfortunately, prompt engineering does not ensure that
LLMs behave in accordance with a desired conditioning due to the inductive bias
of the pre-training and alignment datasets. Prior works have focused on
fine-tuning LLMs by directly conditioning the LoRA weights; however, such
methods introduce a large number of parameters. As a remedy, we propose Zhyper,
a parameter-efficient factorized hypernetwork framework that generates
context-aware LoRA adapters from textual descriptions. Experiments on multiple
benchmarks show that Zhyper achieves competitive performance with up to 26x
fewer parameters than the state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, we extend
Zhyper to cultural alignment, demonstrating improved generalization to
out-of-domain settings and a better capturing of fine-grained contextual
values.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究模型合并作为代码混合NLP的实用替代策略，以更有效地利用未标注数据，提升在低资源代码混合语言对上的性能。

Method: 从多语言基础模型开始：(i)在未标注代码混合文本上进行持续预训练获得适应检查点，(ii)将检查点与基础模型合并，(iii)在下游任务数据上进行微调。使用XLM-R和Llama-3.2-1B模型在英语-印地语和英语-西班牙语上进行评估。

Result: 合并模型始终优于全微调和CPT->FT方法，在F1分数上比全微调提升2-5分，比CPT->FT提升约1-2分。在跨语言对迁移测试中，合并检查点比单语英语基线表现更好，表明代码混合知识是低资源语言对更可靠的基板。

Conclusion: 模型合并能更有效地利用未标注数据，在代码混合NLP任务中表现优异，特别是在低资源场景下。论文提供了针对不同数据情况的适应方案，并讨论了在大模型和更广泛任务中的扩展考虑。

Abstract: We study model merging as a practical alternative to conventional adaptation
strategies for code-mixed NLP. Starting from a multilingual base model, we: (i)
perform continued pre-training (CPT) on unlabeled code-mixed text to obtain an
adapted checkpoint, (ii) merge checkpoint with the base model, and (iii)
fine-tune (FT) on the downstream task data. We evaluate our approach for
sentence classification (sentiment and hate speech) task in English-Hindi
(En-Hi) and English-Spanish (En-Es) using XLM-R and Llama-3.2-1B models. Our
results show that merged models consistently outperform full fine-tuning and
CPT->FT. We observe gains of 2--5 points in F1 over full fine-tuning and ~1-2
points over CPT->FT, indicating that unlabeled data is leveraged more
effectively via merging than via CPT alone. Zero-/few-shot prompting with
larger LLMs (e.g., Llama-3.3-70B) lags behind fine-tuned and merged
checkpoints, underscoring limits of in-context learning for code-mixed inputs.
We further test cross-pair transfer by training on En-Hi and evaluating on
En-Ta and En-Ml: merged checkpoints transfer more strongly than
monolingual-English baselines (e.g., TV/TIES variants reaching 0.65-0.68 F1 vs
0.61-0.63 for full fine-tuning), suggesting that code-mixed knowledge is a more
reliable substrate for low-resource pairs. We conclude with adaptation recipes
matched to common data regimes (labeled only; labeled+unlabeled; transfer-only)
and discuss limitations and scaling considerations for broader tasks and larger
models.

*Saptarshi Sengupta,Zhengyu Zhou,Jun Araki,Xingbo Wang,Bingqing Wang,Suhang Wang,Zhe Feng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ToolDreamer是一个框架，通过使用LLM生成假设性的工具描述来改进工具检索，使检索器能更好地理解用户查询与工具之间的语义对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检索模型基于用户查询与工具描述的相似度进行排名，但用户请求往往与工具描述语言不匹配，导致检索效果不佳。

Method: 提出ToolDreamer框架，使用LLM生成假设性的合成工具描述，使检索器能够基于这些描述来获取相关工具，实现查询与工具在语言空间中的自然对齐。

Result: 在ToolRet数据集上的实验表明，该方法提升了稀疏和稠密检索器的性能，无论是否经过训练都有效，展示了其灵活性。

Conclusion: 该框架旨在将部分推理负担转移到检索器上，使LLM能够有效处理大量工具而不会超出其上下文窗口限制。

Abstract: Tool calling has become increasingly popular for Large Language Models
(LLMs). However, for large tool sets, the resulting tokens would exceed the
LLM's context window limit, making it impossible to include every tool. Hence,
an external retriever is used to provide LLMs with the most relevant tools for
a query. Existing retrieval models rank tools based on the similarity between a
user query and a tool description (TD). This leads to suboptimal retrieval as
user requests are often poorly aligned with the language of TD. To remedy the
issue, we propose ToolDreamer, a framework to condition retriever models to
fetch tools based on hypothetical (synthetic) TD generated using an LLM, i.e.,
description of tools that the LLM feels will be potentially useful for the
query. The framework enables a more natural alignment between queries and tools
within the language space of TD's. We apply ToolDreamer on the ToolRet dataset
and show that our method improves the performance of sparse and dense
retrievers with and without training, thus showcasing its flexibility. Through
our proposed framework, our aim is to offload a portion of the reasoning burden
to the retriever so that the LLM may effectively handle a large collection of
tools without inundating its context window.

TL;DR: 提出轻量级提示空间优化框架，通过自然性、文化适应和难度增强三个维度改进多语言提示，在相同数据条件下显著提升多语言LLM性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多语言合成数据主要依赖翻译式提示，继承了英语中心框架和风格，忽视文化维度，限制了模型泛化能力

Method: 引入轻量级提示空间优化框架，对翻译后的提示进行系统化转换，包括自然性、文化适应和难度增强三个维度，在12种语言上进行测试

Result: 在相同数据条件下，相比仅翻译基线，Global-MMLU准确率提升4.7%，Flores XCometXL提升2.4%，mArenaHard偏好胜率提升35.3%

Conclusion: 提示空间优化是构建更鲁棒、文化基础和全球能力的多语言LLM的简单而强大的范式

Abstract: Synthetic data has become a cornerstone for scaling large language models,
yet its multilingual use remains bottlenecked by translation-based prompts.
This strategy inherits English-centric framing and style and neglects cultural
dimensions, ultimately constraining model generalization. We argue that the
overlooked prompt space-the very inputs that define training
distributions-offers a more powerful lever for improving multilingual
performance. We introduce a lightweight framework for prompt-space
optimization, where translated prompts are systematically transformed for
Naturalness, Cultural Adaptation, and Difficulty Enhancement. Using an
off-the-shelf multilingual LLM, we apply these transformations to prompts for
12 languages spanning 7 families. Under identical data conditions, our
approaches achieve substantial and consistent downstream improvements over the
translation-only baseline: +4.7% on Global-MMLU accuracy, +2.4% on Flores
XCometXL and +35.3% wins in preferences on mArenaHard. We establish
prompt-space optimization as a simple yet powerful paradigm for building
multilingual LLMs that are more robust, culturally grounded, and globally
capable.

TL;DR: Hubble是一套用于研究LLM记忆机制的开源模型套件，包含标准和扰动变体，通过控制文本插入来模拟记忆风险，揭示了训练数据频率和训练阶段对记忆的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型的记忆机制，特别是敏感数据的记忆风险，为理解和管理模型记忆提供科学基础。

Method: 开发标准和扰动变体的LLM（1B和8B参数），在训练过程中控制插入特定文本（如书籍段落、传记等），分析不同训练阶段和频率对记忆的影响。

Result: 发现记忆风险取决于敏感数据在训练语料中的相对频率，以及敏感数据在训练过程中是否持续暴露；增加训练语料规模可以稀释敏感数据，早期训练阶段插入的数据更容易被记住。

Conclusion: 提出了两种应对记忆风险的最佳实践：通过扩大训练语料稀释敏感数据，以及安排敏感数据在训练早期出现；Hubble为记忆研究、成员推断和机器遗忘提供了理想测试平台。

Abstract: We present Hubble, a suite of fully open-source large language models (LLMs)
for the scientific study of LLM memorization. Hubble models come in standard
and perturbed variants: standard models are pretrained on a large English
corpus, and perturbed models are trained in the same way but with controlled
insertion of text (e.g., book passages, biographies, and test sets) designed to
emulate key memorization risks. Our core release includes 8 models -- standard
and perturbed models with 1B or 8B parameters, pretrained on 100B or 500B
tokens -- establishing that memorization risks are determined by the frequency
of sensitive data relative to size of the training corpus (i.e., a password
appearing once in a smaller corpus is memorized better than the same password
in a larger corpus). Our release also includes 6 perturbed models with text
inserted at different pretraining phases, showing that sensitive data without
continued exposure can be forgotten. These findings suggest two best practices
for addressing memorization risks: to dilute sensitive data by increasing the
size of the training corpus, and to order sensitive data to appear earlier in
training. Beyond these general empirical findings, Hubble enables a broad range
of memorization research; for example, analyzing the biographies reveals how
readily different types of private information are memorized. We also
demonstrate that the randomized insertions in Hubble make it an ideal testbed
for membership inference and machine unlearning, and invite the community to
further explore, benchmark, and build upon our work.

*Arpan Mukherjee,Marcello Bullo,Debabrota Basu,Deniz Gündüz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个统一框架来分析验证式测试时扩展中生成器覆盖率、验证器收敛区域和采样算法次优性之间的几何交互关系，揭示了次优性-覆盖率曲线的三个不同区域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然基于验证的测试时扩展在提升大语言模型性能方面显示出潜力，但验证器的作用及其不完善性仍未得到充分探索。现有研究只捕捉了这些因素的部分子集，缺乏一个量化它们交互几何关系的统一框架。

Method: 将可验证的测试时扩展构建为一个传输问题，通过分析生成器覆盖率、验证器收敛区域和采样算法次优性之间的相互作用，提出了顺序和批量两类采样算法，并考察了它们的计算复杂度如何影响这些权衡关系。

Result: 理论分析表明次优性-覆盖率曲线存在三个区域：传输区域（次优性随覆盖率增加而增加）、策略改进区域（次优性可能随覆盖率减少，取决于验证器的收敛区域）和饱和区域（次优性趋于平稳，不受覆盖率影响）。在Qwen、Llama和Gemma模型上的实证结果验证了理论发现。

Conclusion: 通过传输问题框架揭示了验证式测试时扩展中关键因素之间的几何交互关系，为理解和优化大语言模型的测试时扩展提供了理论基础和实用指导。

Abstract: While test-time scaling with verification has shown promise in improving the
performance of large language models (LLMs), the role of the verifier and its
imperfections remain underexplored. The effect of verification manifests
through interactions of three quantities: (i) the generator's coverage, (ii)
the verifier's region of convergence (ROC), and (iii) the sampling algorithm's
sub-optimality. Though recent studies capture subsets of these factors, a
unified framework quantifying the geometry of their interplay is missing. We
frame verifiable test-time scaling as a transport problem. This characterizes
the interaction of coverage, ROC, and sub-optimality, and uncovers that the
sub-optimality--coverage curve exhibits three regimes. A transport regime --
where sub-optimality increases with coverage, a policy improvement regime --
where sub-optimality may decrease with coverage, depending on the verifier's
ROC, and a saturation regime -- where sub-optimality plateaus, unaffected by
coverage. We further propose and analyze two classes of sampling algorithms --
sequential and batched, and examine how their computational complexities shape
these trade-offs. Empirical results with Qwen, Llama, and Gemma models
corroborate our theoretical findings.

TL;DR: ACTMED是一个结合贝叶斯实验设计和大型语言模型的临床诊断框架，通过逐步选择能最大程度减少诊断不确定性的测试来优化诊断过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器学习诊断方法依赖静态完整数据集，无法模拟临床医生在实际中的顺序性、资源感知推理过程，特别是在高压或资源有限环境中需要更有效的诊断支持。

Method: 将贝叶斯实验设计与大型语言模型结合，LLMs作为灵活模拟器生成患者状态分布并支持信念更新，无需结构化任务特定训练数据。

Result: 在真实数据集上评估显示，ACTMED能够优化测试选择，提高诊断准确性、可解释性和资源利用效率。

Conclusion: 该框架代表了向透明、自适应且与临床医生对齐的诊断系统迈出的一步，能够跨环境泛化并减少对领域特定数据的依赖。

Abstract: There is growing interest in using machine learning (ML) to support clinical
diag- nosis, but most approaches rely on static, fully observed datasets and
fail to reflect the sequential, resource-aware reasoning clinicians use in
practice. Diagnosis remains complex and error prone, especially in
high-pressure or resource-limited settings, underscoring the need for
frameworks that help clinicians make timely and cost-effective decisions. We
propose ACTMED (Adaptive Clinical Test selection via Model-based Experimental
Design), a diagnostic framework that integrates Bayesian Experimental Design
(BED) with large language models (LLMs) to better emulate real-world diagnostic
reasoning. At each step, ACTMED selects the test expected to yield the greatest
reduction in diagnostic uncertainty for a given patient. LLMs act as flexible
simulators, generating plausible patient state distributions and supporting
belief updates without requiring structured, task-specific training data.
Clinicians can remain in the loop; reviewing test suggestions, interpreting
intermediate outputs, and applying clinical judgment throughout. We evaluate
ACTMED on real-world datasets and show it can optimize test selection to
improve diagnostic accuracy, interpretability, and resource use. This
represents a step to- ward transparent, adaptive, and clinician-aligned
diagnostic systems that generalize across settings with reduced reliance on
domain-specific data.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出PRISM方法，通过组不变核学习缓解基于偏好的奖励模型中的捷径行为问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于人类反馈的奖励模型容易出现过优化和奖励破解问题，它们通过利用训练数据中的虚假特征（如回答冗长、讨好语气等）来获得高奖励分数，而不是真正反映预期目标

Method: 受核视角不变性理论启发，提出PRISM方法，在闭式学习目标中学习具有特征映射的组不变核

Result: 在多个基准测试中，该方法持续提高了奖励模型在多样化分布外任务上的准确性，并减少了下游策略模型对捷径的依赖

Conclusion: PRISM为基于偏好的对齐建立了一个稳健的框架，有效缓解了奖励学习中的捷径行为问题

Abstract: In reinforcement learning from human feedback, preference-based reward models
play a central role in aligning large language models to human-aligned
behavior. However, recent studies show that these models are prone to reward
hacking and often fail to generalize well due to over-optimization. They
achieve high reward scores by exploiting shortcuts, that is, exploiting
spurious features (e.g., response verbosity, agreeable tone, or sycophancy)
that correlate with human preference labels in the training data rather than
genuinely reflecting the intended objectives. In this paper, instead of probing
these issues one at a time, we take a broader view of the reward hacking
problem as shortcut behaviors and introduce a principled yet flexible approach
to mitigate shortcut behaviors in preference-based reward learning. Inspired by
the invariant theory in the kernel perspective, we propose Preference-based
Reward Invariance for Shortcut Mitigation (PRISM), which learns group-invariant
kernels with feature maps in a closed-form learning objective. Experimental
results in several benchmarks show that our method consistently improves the
accuracy of the reward model on diverse out-of-distribution tasks and reduces
the dependency on shortcuts in downstream policy models, establishing a robust
framework for preference-based alignment.

TL;DR: 提出了MUSE基准测试，用于评估多模态大语言模型的音乐理解能力，发现当前SOTA模型在关系推理方面存在严重缺陷，与人类专家存在显著差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的多模态大语言模型在音频理解方面的评估可能掩盖了其在关系推理方面的基本弱点，需要更全面的评估工具。

Method: 开发了MUSE基准测试，包含10个任务来探测基础音乐感知技能，评估了4个SOTA模型并与200名人类专家进行对比。

Result: SOTA模型能力差异很大，与人类专家存在持续差距。Gemini Pro在基础感知上表现良好，但Qwen和Audio Flamingo 3表现接近随机水平，思维链提示效果不稳定且往往有害。

Conclusion: MUSE基准为评估不变音乐表示提供了关键工具，将推动开发更鲁棒的AI系统。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated capabilities in
audio understanding, but current evaluations may obscure fundamental weaknesses
in relational reasoning. We introduce the Music Understanding and Structural
Evaluation (MUSE) Benchmark, an open-source resource with 10 tasks designed to
probe fundamental music perception skills. We evaluate four SOTA models (Gemini
Pro and Flash, Qwen2.5-Omni, and Audio-Flamingo 3) against a large human
baseline (N=200). Our results reveal a wide variance in SOTA capabilities and a
persistent gap with human experts. While Gemini Pro succeeds on basic
perception, Qwen and Audio Flamingo 3 perform at or near chance, exposing
severe perceptual deficits. Furthermore, we find Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
prompting provides inconsistent, often detrimental results. Our work provides a
critical tool for evaluating invariant musical representations and driving
development of more robust AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型在医疗领域快速扩张，但这些系统根据CONSORT标准评估临床试验报告的能力尚不明确，特别是在认知和推理策略方面。

Method: 采用行为和元认知分析方法，使用专家验证数据，在三种提示条件下系统比较了两个代表性大型语言模型。

Result: 不同模型在处理各种CONSORT项目和提示类型时表现出明显差异，包括推理风格的转变、明确的不确定性表达和替代解释模式。

Conclusion: 结果凸显了这些系统在临床合规自动化方面的当前局限性，并强调了理解其认知适应和策略行为对于开发更可解释和可靠的医疗AI的重要性。

Abstract: Despite the rapid expansion of Large Language Models (LLMs) in healthcare,
the ability of these systems to assess clinical trial reporting according to
CONSORT standards remains unclear, particularly with respect to their cognitive
and reasoning strategies. This study applies a behavioral and metacognitive
analytic approach with expert-validated data, systematically comparing two
representative LLMs under three prompt conditions. Clear differences emerged in
how the models approached various CONSORT items, and prompt types, including
shifts in reasoning style, explicit uncertainty, and alternative
interpretations shaped response patterns. Our results highlight the current
limitations of these systems in clinical compliance automation and underscore
the importance of understanding their cognitive adaptations and strategic
behavior in developing more explainable and reliable medical AI.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了推理模型中的模式选择问题，将其识别为早期退出问题的更具挑战性变体，旨在通过零步思考减少计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推理模型在数学和逻辑推理任务中表现出色，但其逐步思考过程常导致过度思考，产生不必要的计算负担。模式选择和早期退出方法都旨在减轻这种计算负担。

Method: 将模式选择识别为早期退出问题的变体，通过零步思考在推理过程开始时决定使用长链思维或短链思维模式。在九个基线方法上进行实证研究，比较基于提示的方法和利用内部信息的方法。

Result: 基于提示的方法由于分类能力有限且仅提供少量手工制作信息而经常失败。利用内部信息的方法在大多数场景中表现更好，但仍存在稳定性问题。现有方法仅依赖模型提供的信息不足以有效解决信息有限场景下的模式选择问题。

Conclusion: 模式选择是早期退出问题的更具挑战性变体，现有方法在信息有限场景下效果不足，凸显了该任务的持续挑战性。

Abstract: Reasoning models have demonstrated exceptional performance in tasks such as
mathematics and logical reasoning, primarily due to their ability to engage in
step-by-step thinking during the reasoning process. However, this often leads
to overthinking, resulting in unnecessary computational overhead. To address
this issue, Mode Selection aims to automatically decide between Long-CoT
(Chain-of-Thought) or Short-CoT by utilizing either a Thinking or NoThinking
mode. Simultaneously, Early Exit determines the optimal stopping point during
the iterative reasoning process. Both methods seek to reduce the computational
burden. In this paper, we first identify Mode Selection as a more challenging
variant of the Early Exit problem, as they share similar objectives but differ
in decision timing. While Early Exit focuses on determining the best stopping
point for concise reasoning at inference time, Mode Selection must make this
decision at the beginning of the reasoning process, relying on pre-defined fake
thoughts without engaging in an explicit reasoning process, referred to as
zero-step thinking. Through empirical studies on nine baselines, we observe
that prompt-based approaches often fail due to their limited classification
capabilities when provided with minimal hand-crafted information. In contrast,
approaches that leverage internal information generally perform better across
most scenarios but still exhibit issues with stability. Our findings indicate
that existing methods relying solely on the information provided by models are
insufficient for effectively addressing Mode Selection in scenarios with
limited information, highlighting the ongoing challenges of this task. Our code
is available at https://github.com/Trae1ounG/Zero_Step_Thinking.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前网页智能体评估主要依赖二元成功指标或单一参考轨迹，忽略了基准数据集中存在的结构多样性。

Method: 将多个智能体的轨迹抽象为统一加权动作图，规范编码动作，合并重复行为，并应用结构分析包括奖励传播和成功加权边统计。

Result: 在来自六个网页智能体的数千条轨迹评估中，图抽象捕捉了跨模型规律性，突出了冗余和低效，并识别了基于结果指标忽略的关键决策点。

Conclusion: 通过将网页交互构建为图结构数据，WebGraphEval建立了多路径、跨智能体和效率感知的网页智能体评估通用方法。

Abstract: Current evaluation of web agents largely reduces to binary success metrics or
conformity to a single reference trajectory, ignoring the structural diversity
present in benchmark datasets. We present WebGraphEval, a framework that
abstracts trajectories from multiple agents into a unified, weighted action
graph. This representation is directly compatible with benchmarks such as
WebArena, leveraging leaderboard runs and newly collected trajectories without
modifying environments. The framework canonically encodes actions, merges
recurring behaviors, and applies structural analyses including reward
propagation and success-weighted edge statistics. Evaluations across thousands
of trajectories from six web agents show that the graph abstraction captures
cross-model regularities, highlights redundancy and inefficiency, and
identifies critical decision points overlooked by outcome-based metrics. By
framing web interaction as graph-structured data, WebGraphEval establishes a
general methodology for multi-path, cross-agent, and efficiency-aware
evaluation of web agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估ChatGPT在法律领域的实际表现，特别是与正则表达式基线对比，而非仅关注与人类表现的比较，以揭示AI在法律推理任务中的真实局限性。

Method: 在法律领域进行实验，将ChatGPT与正则表达式(Regex)作为基线进行性能比较，分析其在提取法律判决关键段落和法理原则(PoLs)任务中的表现。

Result: 研究发现ChatGPT即使拥有必要知识和能力，也无法有效整合推理得出全面结果，在法律决策解读和法理原则提取任务中表现有限。

Conclusion: 真正的智能需要分解复杂问题并整合多种能力提供统一解决方案，在法律领域，这种全面理解和推理能力仍是人类独有的特质，AI存在固有局限性。

Abstract: This study examines the performance of ChatGPT with an experiment in the
legal domain. We compare the outcome with it a baseline using regular
expressions (Regex), rather than focusing solely on the assessment against
human performance. The study reveals that even if ChatGPT has access to the
necessary knowledge and competencies, it is unable to assemble them, reason
through, in a way that leads to an exhaustive result. This unveils a major
limitation of ChatGPT. Intelligence encompasses the ability to break down
complex issues and address them according to multiple required competencies,
providing a unified and comprehensive solution. In the legal domain, one of the
most crucial tasks is reading legal decisions and extracting key passages
condensed from principles of law (PoLs), which are then incorporated into
subsequent rulings by judges or defense documents by lawyers. In performing
this task, artificial intelligence lacks an all-encompassing understanding and
reasoning, which makes it inherently limited. Genuine intelligence, remains a
uniquely human trait, at least in this particular field.

Motivation: 传统基于先例的推理假设先例集必须一致，而广义理由模型放松了这一假设。目前缺乏针对这种容纳不一致先例的广义推理框架的论证性解释方法。

Method: 扩展推导状态论证框架（DSA-framework），使其能够解释基于广义理由模型的推理过程。

Result: 开发了一种能够处理不一致先例的论证性解释框架，填补了现有方法的空白。

Conclusion: 扩展后的DSA框架为广义理由模型提供了有效的论证性解释方法，支持在不一致先例集下的推理解释。

Abstract: Precedential constraint is one foundation of case-based reasoning in AI and
Law. It generally assumes that the underlying set of precedents must be
consistent. To relax this assumption, a generalized notion of the reason model
has been introduced. While several argumentative explanation approaches exist
for reasoning with precedents based on the traditional consistent reason model,
there has been no corresponding argumentative explanation method developed for
this generalized reasoning framework accommodating inconsistent precedents. To
address this question, this paper examines an extension of the derivation state
argumentation framework (DSA-framework) to explain the reasoning according to
the generalized notion of the reason model.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLM智能体是否能重现人类在线行为中的复杂社会动态，包括同质性、互惠性和社会验证等特征，以及探索实现这些动态的记忆和学习机制。

Method: 提出了一个多智能体LLM模拟框架，智能体通过重复互动、相互评估和情境学习来适应行为，使用捕捉在线参与核心驱动因素的行为奖励函数，包括社交互动、信息寻求、自我展示、协调和情感支持。

Result: 实验表明，经过指导的LLM智能体发展出稳定的互动模式并形成涌现的社会联系，产生的网络结构反映了真实在线社区的特性。

Conclusion: 该框架为研究LLM群体中的集体动态建立了原则性测试平台，揭示了人工智能智能体如何近似或偏离类人社交行为。

Abstract: Can large language model (LLM) agents reproduce the complex social dynamics
that characterize human online behavior -- shaped by homophily, reciprocity,
and social validation -- and what memory and learning mechanisms enable such
dynamics to emerge? We present a multi-agent LLM simulation framework in which
agents repeatedly interact, evaluate one another, and adapt their behavior
through in-context learning accelerated by a coaching signal. To model human
social behavior, we design behavioral reward functions that capture core
drivers of online engagement, including social interaction, information
seeking, self-presentation, coordination, and emotional support. These rewards
align agent objectives with empirically observed user motivations, enabling the
study of how network structures and group formations emerge from individual
decision-making. Our experiments show that coached LLM agents develop stable
interaction patterns and form emergent social ties, yielding network structures
that mirror properties of real online communities. By combining behavioral
rewards with in-context adaptation, our framework establishes a principled
testbed for investigating collective dynamics in LLM populations and reveals
how artificial agents may approximate or diverge from human-like social
behavior.

TL;DR: 提出了CKA-RL方法，通过持续知识适应策略解决强化学习中的灾难性遗忘问题，在三个基准测试中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实环境通常是非平稳的，需要智能体持续适应新任务和变化条件。现有的持续强化学习方法存在灾难性遗忘和知识利用效率低的问题。

Method: 提出持续知识适应策略，维护任务特定知识向量池，动态使用历史知识适应新任务；引入自适应知识合并机制，合并相似知识向量以减少内存需求。

Result: 在三个基准测试中，CKA-RL优于最先进方法，整体性能提升4.20%，前向迁移提升8.02%。

Conclusion: CKA-RL通过持续知识适应有效缓解了灾难性遗忘，实现了跨任务的高效知识迁移。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning enables agents to learn optimal behaviors through
interactions with environments. However, real-world environments are typically
non-stationary, requiring agents to continuously adapt to new tasks and
changing conditions. Although Continual Reinforcement Learning facilitates
learning across multiple tasks, existing methods often suffer from catastrophic
forgetting and inefficient knowledge utilization. To address these challenges,
we propose Continual Knowledge Adaptation for Reinforcement Learning (CKA-RL),
which enables the accumulation and effective utilization of historical
knowledge. Specifically, we introduce a Continual Knowledge Adaptation
strategy, which involves maintaining a task-specific knowledge vector pool and
dynamically using historical knowledge to adapt the agent to new tasks. This
process mitigates catastrophic forgetting and enables efficient knowledge
transfer across tasks by preserving and adapting critical model parameters.
Additionally, we propose an Adaptive Knowledge Merging mechanism that combines
similar knowledge vectors to address scalability challenges, reducing memory
requirements while ensuring the retention of essential knowledge. Experiments
on three benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed CKA-RL outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, achieving an improvement of 4.20% in overall
performance and 8.02% in forward transfer. The source code is available at

### [164] [MSC-Bench: A Rigorous Benchmark for Multi-Server Tool Orchestration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19423)
*Jia-Kai Dong,I-Wei Huang,Chun-Tin Wu,Yi-Tien Tsai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MSC-Bench是一个大规模基准测试，用于评估LLM代理在分层MCP生态系统中的多跳端到端工具编排能力，通过五级课程系统测试代理从单工具编排到跨服务器规划的全面能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试往往孤立评估工具，忽略了功能重叠和跨服务器编排等挑战，导致评估过于乐观，需要更全面的评估框架。

Method: 构建基于'等效功能集'的真实基准，采用五级课程设计，从单工具编排到复杂跨服务器规划，测试代理的鲁棒性和能力。

Result: 实验显示刚性层次结构会阻碍性能，即使最先进的代理在鲁棒性方面也存在系统性弱点。

Conclusion: MSC-Bench提供了一个诊断框架，暴露现有代理的局限性，指导开发更强大高效的工具使用代理。

Abstract: We introduce MSC-Bench, a large-scale benchmark for evaluating multi-hop,
end-to-end tool orchestration by LLM agents in a hierarchical Model-Context
Protocol (MCP) ecosystem. Existing benchmarks often evaluate tools in
isolation, ignoring challenges such as functional overlap and cross-server
orchestration, leading to overly optimistic assessments. MSC-Bench addresses
these gaps by constructing ground truth through 'equal function sets', allowing
objective metrics such as F1 score and reducing the dependency on
LLM-as-a-judge evaluation. Organized as a five-level curriculum, it
systematically tests agent capabilities from single-tool orchestration to
complex cross-server planning, and robustness to out-of-scope requests.
Experiments reveal that rigid hierarchies can hinder performance without
co-designed strategies, and even state-of-the-art agents exhibit systemic
weaknesses in robustness. MSC-Bench provides a diagnostic framework to expose
these limitations and guide the development of more capable and efficient
tool-using agents. The benchmark and resources are publicly available at
https://github.com/snooow1029/MSC_Bench.

### [165] [NeSyPr: Neurosymbolic Proceduralization For Efficient Embodied Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19429)
*Wonje Choi,Jooyoung Kim,Honguk Woo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: NeSyPr是一个神经符号程序化框架，通过将符号规划转化为可组合的程序表示，使语言模型能够在资源受限的动态环境中进行高效推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语言模型在动态环境中因延迟、连接性和资源限制而无法访问大规模推理引擎或符号规划器的问题。

Method: 首先使用符号工具生成任务特定规划，然后将这些规划转化为编码隐式产生规则的可组合程序表示，最后将这些程序无缝集成到语言模型的推理过程中。

Result: 在PDDLGym、VirtualHome和ALFWorld等基准测试中，NeSyPr相比大规模推理模型和符号规划器展现出更高效的推理能力，同时使用更紧凑的语言模型。

Conclusion: 神经符号程序化能够将多步符号结构化路径查找和推理抽象为单步语言模型推理，适合在延迟敏感和资源受限的物理系统中部署。

Abstract: We address the challenge of adopting language models (LMs) for embodied tasks
in dynamic environments, where online access to large-scale inference engines
or symbolic planners is constrained due to latency, connectivity, and resource
limitations. To this end, we present NeSyPr, a novel embodied reasoning
framework that compiles knowledge via neurosymbolic proceduralization, thereby
equipping LM-based agents with structured, adaptive, and timely reasoning
capabilities. In NeSyPr, task-specific plans are first explicitly generated by
a symbolic tool leveraging its declarative knowledge. These plans are then
transformed into composable procedural representations that encode the plans'
implicit production rules, enabling the resulting composed procedures to be
seamlessly integrated into the LM's inference process. This neurosymbolic
proceduralization abstracts and generalizes multi-step symbolic structured
path-finding and reasoning into single-step LM inference, akin to human
knowledge compilation. It supports efficient test-time inference without
relying on external symbolic guidance, making it well suited for deployment in
latency-sensitive and resource-constrained physical systems. We evaluate NeSyPr
on the embodied benchmarks PDDLGym, VirtualHome, and ALFWorld, demonstrating
its efficient reasoning capabilities over large-scale reasoning models and a
symbolic planner, while using more compact LMs.

*Runpeng Xie,Quanwei Wang,Hao Hu,Zherui Zhou,Ni Mu,Xiyun Li,Yiqin Yang,Shuang Xu,Qianchuan Zhao,Bo XU*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出DAIL方法解决语言指令的模糊性问题，通过分布策略和语义对齐增强任务可区分性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然语言指令的灵活性导致任务模糊性，严重影响算法性能

Method: DAIL方法包含分布策略和语义对齐两个核心组件，分布策略增强任务可区分性，语义对齐捕获轨迹与语言指令的对应关系

Result: 在结构化和视觉观察基准测试中，DAIL有效解决指令模糊性，性能优于基线方法

Conclusion: DAIL通过分布对齐学习有效处理语言指令的模糊性，提升智能代理的语言理解和指令跟随能力

Abstract: Comprehending natural language and following human instructions are critical
capabilities for intelligent agents. However, the flexibility of linguistic
instructions induces substantial ambiguity across language-conditioned tasks,
severely degrading algorithmic performance. To address these limitations, we
present a novel method named DAIL (Distributional Aligned Learning), featuring
two key components: distributional policy and semantic alignment. Specifically,
we provide theoretical results that the value distribution estimation mechanism
enhances task differentiability. Meanwhile, the semantic alignment module
captures the correspondence between trajectories and linguistic instructions.
Extensive experimental results on both structured and visual observation
benchmarks demonstrate that DAIL effectively resolves instruction ambiguities,
achieving superior performance to baseline methods. Our implementation is
available at https://github.com/RunpengXie/Distributional-Aligned-Learning.

### [167] [HSCodeComp: A Realistic and Expert-level Benchmark for Deep Search Agents in Hierarchical Rule Application](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19631)
*Yiqian Yang,Tian Lan,Qianghuai Jia,Li Zhu,Hui Jiang,Hang Zhu,Longyue Wang,Weihua Luo,Kaifu Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HSCodeComp是首个评估深度搜索代理在分层规则应用能力的电子商务基准，要求代理根据复杂规则预测产品的10位HS编码，现有最佳代理准确率仅46.8%，远低于人类专家的95.0%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前代理基准忽略了深度搜索代理在应用复杂规则（如法律条款、医疗手册、关税规则）方面的能力，这些规则具有模糊边界和隐式逻辑关系，对代理构成挑战。

Method: 从大型电商平台收集真实数据构建HSCodeComp基准，包含632个产品条目，涵盖多样产品类别，HS编码由多位人类专家标注。

Result: 在多个最先进的LLM、开源和闭源代理上的实验结果显示巨大性能差距：最佳代理仅达到46.8%的10位准确率，远低于人类专家的95.0%。测试时扩展也无法进一步提升性能。

Conclusion: 分层规则应用对当前深度搜索代理构成重大挑战，需要开发更强大的规则理解和应用能力。

Abstract: Effective deep search agents must not only access open-domain and
domain-specific knowledge but also apply complex rules-such as legal clauses,
medical manuals and tariff rules. These rules often feature vague boundaries
and implicit logic relationships, making precise application challenging for
agents. However, this critical capability is largely overlooked by current
agent benchmarks.
  To fill this gap, we introduce HSCodeComp, the first realistic, expert-level
e-commerce benchmark designed to evaluate deep search agents in hierarchical
rule application. In this task, the deep reasoning process of agents is guided
by these rules to predict 10-digit Harmonized System Code (HSCode) of products
with noisy but realistic descriptions. These codes, established by the World
Customs Organization, are vital for global supply chain efficiency. Built from
real-world data collected from large-scale e-commerce platforms, our proposed
HSCodeComp comprises 632 product entries spanning diverse product categories,
with these HSCodes annotated by several human experts.
  Extensive experimental results on several state-of-the-art LLMs, open-source,
and closed-source agents reveal a huge performance gap: best agent achieves
only 46.8% 10-digit accuracy, far below human experts at 95.0%. Besides,
detailed analysis demonstrates the challenges of hierarchical rule application,
and test-time scaling fails to improve performance further.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AgentSense是一个基于多智能体进化系统的混合训练免费框架，将大语言模型集成到参与式城市感知中，通过迭代优化解决方案来适应动态城市条件和异构工作者偏好，同时提供自然语言解释以增强透明度和信任。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的城市感知系统在多样化城市场景中的泛化能力有限，决策过程缺乏可解释性。需要一种能够适应动态城市条件、考虑工作者偏好并提供透明解释的解决方案。

Method: 结合大语言模型和多智能体进化系统，首先使用经典规划器生成基线解决方案，然后迭代优化这些方案以适应动态城市条件和异构工作者偏好，同时生成自然语言解释。

Result: 在两个大规模移动数据集和七种动态干扰类型上的实验表明，AgentSense在适应性和可解释性方面优于传统方法，相比单智能体LLM基线在性能和鲁棒性方面表现更优，并提供更合理透明的解释。

Conclusion: AgentSense代表了向部署自适应和可解释的城市感知系统迈出的重要一步，在web环境中具有显著优势。

Abstract: Web-based participatory urban sensing has emerged as a vital approach for
modern urban management by leveraging mobile individuals as distributed
sensors. However, existing urban sensing systems struggle with limited
generalization across diverse urban scenarios and poor interpretability in
decision-making. In this work, we introduce AgentSense, a hybrid, training-free
framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) into participatory urban
sensing through a multi-agent evolution system. AgentSense initially employs
classical planner to generate baseline solutions and then iteratively refines
them to adapt sensing task assignments to dynamic urban conditions and
heterogeneous worker preferences, while producing natural language explanations
that enhance transparency and trust. Extensive experiments across two
large-scale mobility datasets and seven types of dynamic disturbances
demonstrate that AgentSense offers distinct advantages in adaptivity and
explainability over traditional methods. Furthermore, compared to single-agent
LLM baselines, our approach outperforms in both performance and robustness,
while delivering more reasonable and transparent explanations. These results
position AgentSense as a significant advancement towards deploying adaptive and
explainable urban sensing systems on the web.

*Matthew Keating,Michael Casey*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 开发了一个基于图论的引擎，为吉他学生提供和弦音即兴演奏建议，通过构建和弦音琶音图并计算最优路径来生成和弦音独奏线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 和弦音即兴演奏是爵士吉他理论的基础练习，但学习和实践难度较大，需要一种系统化的方法来帮助学生掌握这一技能。

Method: 首先生成和弦音琶音，构建加权图（节点代表和弦音琶音），计算连续和弦节点间的最优过渡音权重，然后找到最短路径并重构和弦音独奏线。

Result: 开发了一个用户友好的系统，能够处理输入输出，为吉他学生提供可练习的和弦音即兴演奏建议。

Conclusion: 该基于图论的引擎为吉他学生提供了一种有效的和弦音即兴演奏学习方法，有助于掌握这一重要的爵士吉他技巧。

Abstract: We present a graph-based engine for computing chord tone soloing suggestions
for guitar students. Chord tone soloing is a fundamental practice for
improvising over a chord progression, where the instrumentalist uses only the
notes contained in the current chord. This practice is a building block for all
advanced jazz guitar theory but is difficult to learn and practice. First, we
discuss methods for generating chord-tone arpeggios. Next, we construct a
weighted graph where each node represents a chord tone arpeggio for a chord in
the progression. Then, we calculate the edge weight between each consecutive
chord's nodes in terms of optimal transition tones. We then find the shortest
path through this graph and reconstruct a chord-tone soloing line. Finally, we
discuss a user-friendly system to handle input and output to this engine for
guitar students to practice chord tone soloing.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种可解释的电子竞技流式胜率预测分类解决方案，通过滑动窗口控制输入数据以反映游戏变化，准确率超过90%，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子竞技观众和玩家数量增长，加上通信技术和云计算发展，推动了在线游戏产业发展。现有AI解决方案主要关注批量分类，忽视了可视化技术和流式处理。

Method: 采用可解释的胜率预测分类方法，通过多个滑动窗口控制输入数据来反映游戏相关变化，实现流式处理。

Result: 实验结果显示准确率超过90%，超越了文献中的竞争解决方案。

Conclusion: 该系统可被排名和推荐系统利用进行明智决策，解释性模块增强了预测结果的可信度。

Abstract: The increasing number of spectators and players in e-sports, along with the
development of optimized communication solutions and cloud computing
technology, has motivated the constant growth of the online game industry. Even
though Artificial Intelligence-based solutions for e-sports analytics are
traditionally defined as extracting meaningful patterns from related data and
visualizing them to enhance decision-making, most of the effort in professional
winning prediction has been focused on the classification aspect from a batch
perspective, also leaving aside the visualization techniques. Consequently,
this work contributes to an explainable win prediction classification solution
in streaming in which input data is controlled over several sliding windows to
reflect relevant game changes. Experimental results attained an accuracy higher
than 90 %, surpassing the performance of competing solutions in the literature.
Ultimately, our system can be leveraged by ranking and recommender systems for
informed decision-making, thanks to the explainability module, which fosters
trust in the outcome predictions.

### [171] [RLIE: Rule Generation with Logistic Regression, Iterative Refinement, and Evaluation for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19698)
*Yang Yang,Hua XU,Zhangyi Hu,Yutao Yue*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RLIE是一个将大语言模型与概率建模相结合的统一框架，用于学习带权重的规则集，通过规则生成、逻辑回归、迭代优化和评估四个阶段实现更可靠的神经符号推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的方法忽视了规则间的相互作用，且将LLM与概率规则学习结合进行鲁棒推理的机会尚未充分探索。

Method: RLIE包含四个阶段：(1) LLM生成和筛选候选规则；(2) 逻辑回归学习概率权重；(3) 基于预测误差迭代优化规则集；(4) 评估带权重规则集作为直接分类器的性能。

Result: 使用学习到的权重直接应用规则可获得优越性能，而将规则、权重和逻辑模型输出提示给LLM反而会降低准确性。

Conclusion: LLM擅长语义生成和解释，但在精确概率集成方面可靠性较低。RLIE阐明了LLM在归纳推理中的潜力和局限性，并将其与经典概率规则组合方法结合，实现更可靠的神经符号推理。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can propose rules in natural language,
sidestepping the need for a predefined predicate space in traditional rule
learning. Yet many LLM-based approaches ignore interactions among rules, and
the opportunity to couple LLMs with probabilistic rule learning for robust
inference remains underexplored. We present RLIE, a unified framework that
integrates LLMs with probabilistic modeling to learn a set of weighted rules.
RLIE has four stages: (1) Rule generation, where an LLM proposes and filters
candidates; (2) Logistic regression, which learns probabilistic weights for
global selection and calibration; (3) Iterative refinement, which updates the
rule set using prediction errors; and (4) Evaluation, which compares the
weighted rule set as a direct classifier with methods that inject rules into an
LLM. We evaluate multiple inference strategies on real-world datasets. Applying
rules directly with their learned weights yields superior performance, whereas
prompting LLMs with the rules, weights, and logistic-model outputs surprisingly
degrades accuracy. This supports the view that LLMs excel at semantic
generation and interpretation but are less reliable for precise probabilistic
integration. RLIE clarifies the potential and limitations of LLMs for inductive
reasoning and couples them with classic probabilistic rule combination methods
to enable more reliable neuro-symbolic reasoning.

*Gunshi Gupta,Karmesh Yadav,Zsolt Kira,Yarin Gal,Rahaf Aljundi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Memo是一个基于transformer的架构和训练方法，用于解决强化学习中记忆密集型、长视野任务的挑战，通过插入周期性总结标记来创建和检索记忆，在计算和存储效率上优于传统长上下文transformer基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于transformer的具身智能体策略训练中，视觉输入常常超出transformer的上下文限制，而人类能够维护和利用压缩为记忆的终身经验。现有方法主要关注固定大小记忆的循环模型或完全依赖上下文的transformer，缺乏有效的记忆压缩机制。

Method: Memo在训练过程中通过周期性插入总结标记来创建和检索记忆，这种架构允许模型在长期任务中有效管理记忆，同时保持计算和存储效率。

Result: 在网格世界元RL基准测试和照片级真实室内环境中的多目标导航任务上，Memo优于朴素的长上下文transformer基线，在推理时对更长上下文具有更好的泛化能力，并在流式设置中保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Memo提供了一种有效的记忆管理解决方案，使具身智能体能够在长视野任务中更好地利用压缩记忆，同时保持计算效率，为长期操作提供了可行的架构设计。

Abstract: To enable embodied agents to operate effectively over extended timeframes, it
is crucial to develop models that form and access memories to stay
contextualized in their environment. In the current paradigm of training
transformer-based policies for embodied sequential decision-making tasks,
visual inputs often overwhelm the context limits of transformers, while humans
can maintain and utilize a lifetime of experience compressed as memories.
Significant compression is possible in principle, as much of the input is
irrelevant and can be abstracted. However, existing approaches predominantly
focus on either recurrent models with fixed-size memory or transformers with
full-context reliance. In this work, we propose Memo, a transformer-based
architecture and training recipe for reinforcement learning (RL) on
memory-intensive, long-horizon tasks. Memo incorporates the creation and
retrieval of memory by interleaving periodic summarization tokens with the
inputs of a model during training. We demonstrate Memo's effectiveness on a
gridworld meta-RL benchmark and a multi-object navigation task in
photo-realistic indoor settings. Memo outperforms naive long-context
transformer baselines while being more compute and storage efficient.
Additionally, Memo generalizes better to longer contexts at inference time and
remains robust in streaming settings, where historical context must be
truncated to fit inference constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估主动性的基准受限于局部上下文，无法测试跨来源和长时间跨度的推理能力，需要更全面的评估框架。

Method: 将主动性分解为三个核心能力管道：搜索未指定问题、识别具体瓶颈和执行适当解决方案，并应用于评估领先LLM和流行智能体框架。

Result: 即使是先进模型也难以解决该基准，GPT-5和Claude Opus-4.1的最佳端到端性能仅为40%，揭示了自主行动系统的当前局限性。

Conclusion: 结果突显了智能体系统中自主行动的当前局限性，并揭示了有前景的未来研究方向。

Abstract: LLM-based agents are increasingly moving towards proactivity: rather than
awaiting instruction, they exercise agency to anticipate user needs and solve
them autonomously. However, evaluating proactivity is challenging; current
benchmarks are constrained to localized context, limiting their ability to test
reasoning across sources and longer time horizons. To address this gap, we
present PROBE (Proactive Resolution Of BottlEnecks). PROBE decomposes
proactivity as a pipeline of three core capabilities: (1) searching for
unspecified issues, (2) identifying specific bottlenecks, and (3) executing
appropriate resolutions. We apply PROBE to evaluate leading LLMs and popular
agentic frameworks, showing that even state-of-the-art models struggle to solve
this benchmark. Computing our consistent measurements across frontier LLMs and
agents, we find that the best end-to-end performance of 40% is achieved by both
GPT-5 and Claude Opus-4.1. Additionally, we demonstrate the relative
capabilities of each model and analyze mutual failure modes. Our results
highlight the current limitations of autonomous action in agentic systems, and
expose promising future research directions.

Motivation: 当前世界模型学习和评估方法偏离了目标：训练和评估锚定在下一帧预测上，成功通过相同环境中的奖励最大化来评分。

Method: 提出WorldTest协议，包含无奖励探索、衍生测试和行为评分三个模板，并实例化为AutumnBench套件，包含43个交互式网格世界环境和129个任务。

Result: 比较了517名人类参与者和三个前沿模型，发现人类表现优于模型，计算规模扩展仅在某些环境中提高性能。

Conclusion: WorldTest提供了评估智能体学习环境动态的新模板，AutumnBench揭示了世界模型学习的显著提升空间。

Abstract: Model-learning agents should gather information to learn world models that
support many downstream tasks and inferences, such as predicting unobserved
states, estimating near- and far-term consequences of actions, planning action
sequences, and detecting changes in dynamics. Current methods for learning and
evaluating world models diverge from this goal: training and evaluation are
anchored to next-frame prediction, and success is scored by reward maximization
in the same environment. We propose WorldTest, a protocol to evaluate
model-learning agents that separates reward-free interaction from a scored test
phase in a different but related environment. WorldTest is
open-ended$\unicode{x2014}$models should support many different tasks unknown
ahead of time$\unicode{x2014}$and agnostic to model representation, allowing
comparison across approaches. We instantiated WorldTest with AutumnBench, a
suite of 43 interactive grid-world environments and 129 tasks across three
families: masked-frame prediction, planning, and predicting changes to the
causal dynamics. We compared 517 human participants and three frontier models
on AutumnBench. We found that humans outperform the models, and scaling compute
improves performance only in some environments but not others. WorldTest
provides a novel template$\unicode{x2014}$reward-free exploration, derived
tests, and behavior-based scoring$\unicode{x2014}$to evaluate what agents learn
about environment dynamics, and AutumnBench exposes significant headroom in
world-model learning.

TL;DR: FlexiDataGen是一个自适应LLM框架，用于在敏感领域动态生成语义数据集，解决数据稀缺和标注瓶颈问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医疗、生物医学和网络安全等领域中数据获取成本高、标注数据有限、关键事件罕见或敏感等数据集挑战，这些挑战阻碍了机器学习模型的发展。

Method: 集成四个核心组件：句法-语义分析、检索增强生成、动态元素注入、迭代释义与语义验证，确保生成高质量、领域相关的数据。

Result: 实验结果表明，FlexiDataGen有效缓解了数据短缺和标注瓶颈，支持可扩展且准确的机器学习模型开发。

Conclusion: FlexiDataGen为敏感领域提供了一种动态语义数据集生成的有效解决方案，有助于推动机器学习模型在数据稀缺环境中的应用。

Abstract: Dataset availability and quality remain critical challenges in machine
learning, especially in domains where data are scarce, expensive to acquire, or
constrained by privacy regulations. Fields such as healthcare, biomedical
research, and cybersecurity frequently encounter high data acquisition costs,
limited access to annotated data, and the rarity or sensitivity of key events.
These issues-collectively referred to as the dataset challenge-hinder the
development of accurate and generalizable machine learning models in such
high-stakes domains. To address this, we introduce FlexiDataGen, an adaptive
large language model (LLM) framework designed for dynamic semantic dataset
generation in sensitive domains. FlexiDataGen autonomously synthesizes rich,
semantically coherent, and linguistically diverse datasets tailored to
specialized fields. The framework integrates four core components: (1)
syntactic-semantic analysis, (2) retrieval-augmented generation, (3) dynamic
element injection, and (4) iterative paraphrasing with semantic validation.
Together, these components ensure the generation of high-quality,
domain-relevant data. Experimental results show that FlexiDataGen effectively
alleviates data shortages and annotation bottlenecks, enabling scalable and
accurate machine learning model development.

Motivation: 研究合取查询在特定排序(最小/最大值)下的高效处理，旨在识别哪些查询可以在接近理想时间内解决，即(准)线性预处理时间后每个输出在常数或对数时间内完成。

Method: 开发了细粒度复杂性分析工具，对无自连接的合取查询在不同任务(直接访问、排序枚举、计数、谓词消除)中进行系统分类，基于查询结构特征建立复杂性边界。

Result: 为无自连接CQ建立了完整的复杂性二分法，精确识别了可以在接近理想时间内解决的查询类别，为每个任务提供了明确的复杂性分类。

Conclusion: 该研究为合取查询在最小/最大值排序下的处理提供了全面的复杂性理论框架，明确了各类查询任务的可处理边界，对数据库查询优化具有重要意义。

Abstract: We investigate the fine-grained complexity of direct access to Conjunctive
Query (CQ) answers according to their position, ordered by the minimum (or
maximum) value between attributes. We further use the tools we develop to
explore a wealth of related tasks. We consider the task of ranked enumeration
under min/max orders, as well as tasks concerning CQs with predicates of the
form x <= min X , where X is a set of variables and x is a single variable:
counting, enumeration, direct access, and predicate elimination (i.e.,
transforming the pair of query and database to an equivalent pair without
min-predicates). For each task, we establish a complete dichotomy for
self-join-free CQs, precisely identifying the cases that are solvable in
near-ideal time, i.e., (quasi)linear preprocessing time followed by constant or
logarithmic time per output.
