### [1] [Recurrence Meets Transformers for Universal Multimodal Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08897)
*Davide Caffagni,Sara Sarto,Marcella Cornia,Lorenzo Baraldi,Rita Cucchiara*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReT-2是一个统一的检索模型，支持图像和文本组成的多模态查询，并在多模态文档集合中进行检索，通过循环Transformer架构和门控机制实现跨层跨模态信息整合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着多模态检索在LLMs和多模态LLMs中的快速发展，出现了越来越复杂的检索任务。现有方法主要依赖于视觉-语言模型的任务特定微调，且仅限于单模态查询或文档。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of multimodal retrieval and its application in
LLMs and multimodal LLMs, increasingly complex retrieval tasks have emerged.
Existing methods predominantly rely on task-specific fine-tuning of
vision-language models and are limited to single-modality queries or documents.
In this paper, we propose ReT-2, a unified retrieval model that supports
multimodal queries, composed of both images and text, and searches across
multimodal document collections where text and images coexist. ReT-2 leverages
multi-layer representations and a recurrent Transformer architecture with
LSTM-inspired gating mechanisms to dynamically integrate information across
layers and modalities, capturing fine-grained visual and textual details. We
evaluate ReT-2 on the challenging M2KR and M-BEIR benchmarks across different
retrieval configurations. Results demonstrate that ReT-2 consistently achieves
state-of-the-art performance across diverse settings, while offering faster
inference and reduced memory usage compared to prior approaches. When
integrated into retrieval-augmented generation pipelines, ReT-2 also improves
downstream performance on Encyclopedic-VQA and InfoSeek datasets. Our source

### [2] [Diffusion-Based Action Recognition Generalizes to Untrained Domains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08908)
*Rogerio Guimaraes,Frank Xiao,Pietro Perona,Markus Marks*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 使用视觉扩散模型特征和transformer实现跨物种、视角和上下文的人类级动作识别泛化


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类能够识别不同物种、视角和上下文下的相同动作，但当前深度学习模型在此类泛化方面存在困难

Method: 利用视觉扩散模型生成特征，通过transformer聚合，使用早期时间步条件模型来突出语义信息而非像素细节

Result: 在跨物种、视角和上下文的动作分类任务中取得了最先进的性能

Conclusion: 该方法使机器动作识别更接近人类级别的鲁棒性，为跨域动作识别提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Humans can recognize the same actions despite large context and viewpoint
variations, such as differences between species (walking in spiders vs.
horses), viewpoints (egocentric vs. third-person), and contexts (real life vs
movies). Current deep learning models struggle with such generalization. We
propose using features generated by a Vision Diffusion Model (VDM), aggregated
via a transformer, to achieve human-like action recognition across these
challenging conditions. We find that generalization is enhanced by the use of a
model conditioned on earlier timesteps of the diffusion process to highlight
semantic information over pixel level details in the extracted features. We
experimentally explore the generalization properties of our approach in
classifying actions across animal species, across different viewing angles, and
different recording contexts. Our model sets a new state-of-the-art across all
three generalization benchmarks, bringing machine action recognition closer to
human-like robustness. Project page:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全方法依赖事后过滤或通用对齐技术，无法在生成源头主动防止有害输出，特别是对弱势群体造成伤害的风险日益增加。

Method: 提出PromptGuard框架，包含VulnGuard Prompt混合技术：整合GitHub精选数据、伦理思维链推理和自适应角色提示，采用多目标优化理论，包含6个核心模块的专家系统。

Result: 通过熵边界和帕累托最优性理论证明可实现25-30%的危害减少，建立了基于GitHub数据集的数学验证框架。

Conclusion: PromptGuard为系统性实证研究建立了数学基础，提供了实时危害预防的智能专家系统解决方案。

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) in real-world applications
poses unprecedented risks of generating harmful, biased, or misleading
information to vulnerable populations including LGBTQ+ individuals, single
parents, and marginalized communities. While existing safety approaches rely on
post-hoc filtering or generic alignment techniques, they fail to proactively
prevent harmful outputs at the generation source. This paper introduces
PromptGuard, a novel modular prompting framework with our breakthrough
contribution: VulnGuard Prompt, a hybrid technique that prevents harmful
information generation using real-world data-driven contrastive learning.
VulnGuard integrates few-shot examples from curated GitHub repositories,
ethical chain-of-thought reasoning, and adaptive role-prompting to create
population-specific protective barriers. Our framework employs theoretical
multi-objective optimization with formal proofs demonstrating 25-30% analytical
harm reduction through entropy bounds and Pareto optimality. PromptGuard
orchestrates six core modules: Input Classification, VulnGuard Prompting,
Ethical Principles Integration, External Tool Interaction, Output Validation,
and User-System Interaction, creating an intelligent expert system for
real-time harm prevention. We provide comprehensive mathematical formalization
including convergence proofs, vulnerability analysis using information theory,
and theoretical validation framework using GitHub-sourced datasets,
establishing mathematical foundations for systematic empirical research.

### [4] [Similarity-based Outlier Detection for Noisy Object Re-Identification Using Beta Mixtures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08926)
*Waqar Ahmad,Evan Murphy,Vladimir A. Krylov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Beta-SOD方法，通过Beta混合分布建模相似度分布来检测标签噪声，提升Re-ID在噪声环境下的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目标重识别方法对标签噪声高度敏感，会导致性能显著下降，需要解决噪声鲁棒性问题

Method: 将Re-ID重构为监督图像相似度任务，采用孪生网络架构，提出Beta-SOD统计异常检测框架，使用双分量Beta混合分布建模嵌入对余弦相似度分布

Result: 在CUHK03、Market-1501和VeRi-776数据集上，在10-30%噪声水平下均优于现有方法，表现出鲁棒性和广泛适用性

Conclusion: Beta-SOD方法能有效去噪并在噪声Re-ID场景中展现优越性能，为处理标签噪声提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Object re-identification (Re-ID) methods are highly sensitive to label noise,
which typically leads to significant performance degradation. We address this
challenge by reframing Re-ID as a supervised image similarity task and adopting
a Siamese network architecture trained to capture discriminative pairwise
relationships. Central to our approach is a novel statistical outlier detection
(OD) framework, termed Beta-SOD (Beta mixture Similarity-based Outlier
Detection), which models the distribution of cosine similarities between
embedding pairs using a two-component Beta distribution mixture model. We
establish a novel identifiability result for mixtures of two Beta
distributions, ensuring that our learning task is well-posed.The proposed OD
step complements the Re-ID architecture combining binary cross-entropy,
contrastive, and cosine embedding losses that jointly optimize feature-level
similarity learning.We demonstrate the effectiveness of Beta-SOD in de-noising
and Re-ID tasks for person Re-ID, on CUHK03 and Market-1501 datasets, and
vehicle Re-ID, on VeRi-776 dataset. Our method shows superior performance
compared to the state-of-the-art methods across various noise levels (10-30\%),
demonstrating both robustness and broad applicability in noisy Re-ID scenarios.

### [5] [SFD-Mamba2Net: Strcture-Guided Frequency-Enhanced Dual-Stream Mamba2 Network for Coronary Artery Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08934)
*Nan Mu,Ruiqi Song,Zhihui Xu,Jingfeng Jiang,Chen Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出SFD-Mamba2Net框架，通过多尺度结构先验、状态空间长程依赖建模和频域细节增强策略，显著提升ICA图像中冠状动脉分割和狭窄检测的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 冠状动脉疾病是全球主要死因之一，ICA作为诊断金标准需要精确的血管分割和狭窄检测。但ICA图像存在低对比度、高噪声和复杂血管结构等挑战，现有方法临床采用困难。

Method: 提出端到端SFD-Mamba2Net框架：编码器嵌入曲率感知结构增强模块突出管状血管结构；解码器引入渐进高频感知模块，通过多级小波分解逐步细化高频细节并整合低频全局结构。

Result: 在八个分割指标上均优于最先进方法，在狭窄检测中实现了最高的真阳性率和阳性预测值。

Conclusion: SFD-Mamba2Net通过整合多尺度结构先验、长程依赖建模和频域增强策略，有效解决了ICA图像血管分割和狭窄检测的挑战，展现出优异的性能表现。

Abstract: Background: Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) is one of the leading causes of
death worldwide. Invasive Coronary Angiography (ICA), regarded as the gold
standard for CAD diagnosis, necessitates precise vessel segmentation and
stenosis detection. However, ICA images are typically characterized by low
contrast, high noise levels, and complex, fine-grained vascular structures,
which pose significant challenges to the clinical adoption of existing
segmentation and detection methods. Objective: This study aims to improve the
accuracy of coronary artery segmentation and stenosis detection in ICA images
by integrating multi-scale structural priors, state-space-based long-range
dependency modeling, and frequency-domain detail enhancement strategies.
Methods: We propose SFD-Mamba2Net, an end-to-end framework tailored for
ICA-based vascular segmentation and stenosis detection. In the encoder, a
Curvature-Aware Structural Enhancement (CASE) module is embedded to leverage
multi-scale responses for highlighting slender tubular vascular structures,
suppressing background interference, and directing attention toward vascular
regions. In the decoder, we introduce a Progressive High-Frequency Perception
(PHFP) module that employs multi-level wavelet decomposition to progressively
refine high-frequency details while integrating low-frequency global
structures. Results and Conclusions: SFD-Mamba2Net consistently outperformed
state-of-the-art methods across eight segmentation metrics, and achieved the
highest true positive rate and positive predictive value in stenosis detection.

### [6] [Live(r) Die: Predicting Survival in Colorectal Liver Metastasis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08935)
*Muhammad Alberb,Helen Cheung,Anne Martel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 基于MRI的自动化桌面学-放射组学框架，通过SAMONAI分割算法和SurvAMINN生存分析模型，显著提高结肠肝转移疾病手术预后预测准确度，C指数提升10%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结肠肝转移疾病手术治疗预后差异大，现有预测模型预测能力不足，特别是多发性病例

Method: 开发全自动框架，包括分割管道和放射组学管道。使用SAMONAI算法进行3D分割，SurvAMINN网络进行生存分析，重点关注最恶性肿瘤

Result: 在227名患者的机构数据集上，该框架显著超越现有临床和基因组标志物，C指数提高超10%

Conclusion: 整合自动分割算法和放射组学生存分析能够提供准确、注释效率高且可解释的结肠肝转移预后预测方案

Abstract: Colorectal cancer frequently metastasizes to the liver, significantly
reducing long-term survival. While surgical resection is the only potentially
curative treatment for colorectal liver metastasis (CRLM), patient outcomes
vary widely depending on tumor characteristics along with clinical and genomic
factors. Current prognostic models, often based on limited clinical or
molecular features, lack sufficient predictive power, especially in multifocal
CRLM cases. We present a fully automated framework for surgical outcome
prediction from pre- and post-contrast MRI acquired before surgery. Our
framework consists of a segmentation pipeline and a radiomics pipeline. The
segmentation pipeline learns to segment the liver, tumors, and spleen from
partially annotated data by leveraging promptable foundation models to complete
missing labels. Also, we propose SAMONAI, a novel zero-shot 3D prompt
propagation algorithm that leverages the Segment Anything Model to segment 3D
regions of interest from a single point prompt, significantly improving our
segmentation pipeline's accuracy and efficiency. The predicted pre- and
post-contrast segmentations are then fed into our radiomics pipeline, which
extracts features from each tumor and predicts survival using SurvAMINN, a
novel autoencoder-based multiple instance neural network for survival analysis.
SurvAMINN jointly learns dimensionality reduction and hazard prediction from
right-censored survival data, focusing on the most aggressive tumors. Extensive
evaluation on an institutional dataset comprising 227 patients demonstrates
that our framework surpasses existing clinical and genomic biomarkers,
delivering a C-index improvement exceeding 10%. Our results demonstrate the
potential of integrating automated segmentation algorithms and radiomics-based
survival analysis to deliver accurate, annotation-efficient, and interpretable
outcome prediction in CRLM.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CompCon算法通过进化搜索发现不同文本到图像模型之间的视觉表示差异，识别出特定提示词触发的属性差异，并创建了ID2数据集进行验证


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究不同生成模型学习到的视觉表示在何时以及如何出现分歧，发现一个模型生成而另一个模型不生成的视觉属性及其触发提示

Method: 引入CompCon进化搜索算法，发现一个模型输出中更普遍的视觉属性，并揭示与这些视觉差异相关的提示概念；创建自动化数据生成管道产生ID2数据集

Result: 成功比较了流行的文本到图像模型，发现如PixArt在提及孤独的提示中描绘湿漉街道，Stable Diffusion 3.5在媒体职业中描绘非裔美国人等表示差异

Conclusion: CompCon能够有效发现不同生成模型之间的视觉表示差异，为理解模型偏差和表示学习提供了新工具

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate when and how visual representations learned by
two different generative models diverge. Given two text-to-image models, our
goal is to discover visual attributes that appear in images generated by one
model but not the other, along with the types of prompts that trigger these
attribute differences. For example, "flames" might appear in one model's
outputs when given prompts expressing strong emotions, while the other model
does not produce this attribute given the same prompts. We introduce CompCon
(Comparing Concepts), an evolutionary search algorithm that discovers visual
attributes more prevalent in one model's output than the other, and uncovers
the prompt concepts linked to these visual differences. To evaluate CompCon's
ability to find diverging representations, we create an automated data
generation pipeline to produce ID2, a dataset of 60 input-dependent
differences, and compare our approach to several LLM- and VLM-powered
baselines. Finally, we use CompCon to compare popular text-to-image models,
finding divergent representations such as how PixArt depicts prompts mentioning
loneliness with wet streets and Stable Diffusion 3.5 depicts African American
people in media professions. Code at: https://github.com/adobe-research/CompCon

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 使用U-Net深度学习模型来识别和恢复UAS图像中的云影和阳光烈焰区域，提高水质参数估计的准确性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UAS图像在云层下拍摄具有优势，但容易受到云影和阳光烈焰的影响，这两者会严重影响水质参数估计的准确性

Method: 提出一种新的机器学习方法，使用U-Net深度学习模型在像素级别识别和提取云影和阳光烈焰区域，并根据多种评估指标确定最佳模型设置

Result: 得到了一个高质量的图像美正模型，能够有效恢复图像中的云影和阳光烈焰区域

Conclusion: 该研究提出的方法能够有效解决UAS图像中的云影和阳光烈焰问题，为水质参数估计提供更准确的图像数据

Abstract: The use of unmanned aerial systems (UASs) has increased tremendously in the
current decade. They have significantly advanced remote sensing with the
capability to deploy and image the terrain as per required spatial, spectral,
temporal, and radiometric resolutions for various remote sensing applications.
One of the major advantages of UAS imagery is that images can be acquired in
cloudy conditions by flying the UAS under the clouds. The limitation to the
technology is that the imagery is often sullied by cloud shadows. Images taken
over water are additionally affected by sun glint. These are two pose serious
issues for estimating water quality parameters from the UAS images. This study
proposes a novel machine learning approach first to identify and extract
regions with cloud shadows and sun glint and separate such regions from
non-obstructed clear sky regions and sun-glint unaffected regions. The data was
extracted from the images at pixel level to train an U-Net based deep learning
model and best settings for model training was identified based on the various
evaluation metrics from test cases. Using this evaluation, a high-quality image
correction model was determined, which was used to recover the cloud shadow and
sun glint areas in the images.

### [9] [CoSwin: Convolution Enhanced Hierarchical Shifted Window Attention For Small-Scale Vision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08959)
*Puskal Khadka,Rodrigue Rizk,Longwei Wang,KC Santosh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoSwin是一种结合卷积局部特征学习和Swin Transformer全局注意力的融合架构，通过可学习的局部特征增强模块在小规模视觉数据集上显著提升性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ViT在计算机视觉中表现出色，但过度关注全局上下文而忽略了局部特征提取，特别是在小数据集上缺乏局部性和平移等变性等关键归纳偏置

Method: 提出CoSwin架构，在分层移位窗口注意力基础上集成可学习的局部特征增强模块，同时捕获细粒度空间细节和全局语义结构

Result: 在多个图像分类基准测试中一致优于最先进的卷积和基于Transformer的模型，在CIFAR-10上提升2.17%，CIFAR-100上提升4.92%，Tiny ImageNet上提升4.47%

Conclusion: 局部-全局特征融合有效增强了Transformer在小规模视觉任务中的泛化能力和鲁棒性

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved impressive results in computer
vision by leveraging self-attention to model long-range dependencies. However,
their emphasis on global context often comes at the expense of local feature
extraction in small datasets, particularly due to the lack of key inductive
biases such as locality and translation equivariance. To mitigate this, we
propose CoSwin, a novel feature-fusion architecture that augments the
hierarchical shifted window attention with localized convolutional feature
learning. Specifically, CoSwin integrates a learnable local feature enhancement
module into each attention block, enabling the model to simultaneously capture
fine-grained spatial details and global semantic structure. We evaluate CoSwin
on multiple image classification benchmarks including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
MNIST, SVHN, and Tiny ImageNet. Our experimental results show consistent
performance gains over state-of-the-art convolutional and transformer-based
models. Notably, CoSwin achieves improvements of 2.17% on CIFAR-10, 4.92% on
CIFAR-100, 0.10% on MNIST, 0.26% on SVHN, and 4.47% on Tiny ImageNet over the
baseline Swin Transformer. These improvements underscore the effectiveness of
local-global feature fusion in enhancing the generalization and robustness of
transformers for small-scale vision. Code and pretrained weights available at

### [10] [iMatcher: Improve matching in point cloud registration via local-to-global geometric consistency learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08982)
*Karim Slimani,Catherine Achard,Brahim Tamadazte*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: iMatcher是一个完全可微的点云配准特征匹配框架，通过局部图嵌入和全局几何一致性学习预测几何一致的置信矩阵，在多个数据集上实现了最先进的配准性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决点云配准中特征匹配的几何一致性问题，需要开发一个能够同时考虑局部和全局一致性的可微匹配框架，以提高配准精度和鲁棒性。

Method: 1) 局部图嵌入模块初始化得分矩阵；2) 通过最近邻搜索进行双边源-目标和目标-源匹配的重新定位步骤；3) 堆叠配对点特征并通过全局几何一致性学习预测点对点匹配概率。

Result: 在KITTI上达到95%-97%的内点率，KITTI-360上94%-97%，3DMatch上最高81.1%，在多个数据集上显著提升刚性配准性能。

Conclusion: iMatcher通过完全可微的框架实现了优异的点云配准性能，在室内外不同场景下都表现出强大的鲁棒性和最先进的结果。

Abstract: This paper presents iMatcher, a fully differentiable framework for feature
matching in point cloud registration. The proposed method leverages learned
features to predict a geometrically consistent confidence matrix, incorporating
both local and global consistency. First, a local graph embedding module leads
to an initialization of the score matrix. A subsequent repositioning step
refines this matrix by considering bilateral source-to-target and
target-to-source matching via nearest neighbor search in 3D space. The paired
point features are then stacked together to be refined through global geometric
consistency learning to predict a point-wise matching probability. Extensive
experiments on real-world outdoor (KITTI, KITTI-360) and indoor (3DMatch)
datasets, as well as on 6-DoF pose estimation (TUD-L) and partial-to-partial
matching (MVP-RG), demonstrate that iMatcher significantly improves rigid
registration performance. The method achieves state-of-the-art inlier ratios,
scoring 95% - 97% on KITTI, 94% - 97% on KITTI-360, and up to 81.1% on 3DMatch,
highlighting its robustness across diverse settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出UltrON方法，利用超声B模式图像的声学特征进行弱监督优化，改进3D形状重建，解决遮挡和标注依赖问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于SDF的隐式表示方法依赖精确标注且忽略B模式图像中的丰富声学信息，同时难以处理超声视角依赖性和声影伪影问题

Method: 采用基于占据率的表示方法，提出UltrON框架，利用B模式图像的声学特征，设计新颖损失函数补偿视角依赖性，实现多视角超声的弱监督优化

Result: UltrON能够缓解遮挡和稀疏标注的限制，提高几何一致性，并可推广到相同解剖结构的不同形状

Conclusion: 该方法为更准确的3D重建开辟了新途径，代码和数据集将开源

Abstract: In free-hand ultrasound imaging, sonographers rely on expertise to mentally
integrate partial 2D views into 3D anatomical shapes. Shape reconstruction can
assist clinicians in this process. Central to this task is the choice of shape
representation, as it determines how accurately and efficiently the structure
can be visualized, analyzed, and interpreted. Implicit representations, such as
SDF and occupancy function, offer a powerful alternative to traditional voxel-
or mesh-based methods by modeling continuous, smooth surfaces with compact
storage, avoiding explicit discretization. Recent studies demonstrate that SDF
can be effectively optimized using annotations derived from segmented B-mode
ultrasound images. Yet, these approaches hinge on precise annotations,
overlooking the rich acoustic information embedded in B-mode intensity.
Moreover, implicit representation approaches struggle with the ultrasound's
view-dependent nature and acoustic shadowing artifacts, which impair
reconstruction. To address the problems resulting from occlusions and
annotation dependency, we propose an occupancy-based representation and
introduce \gls{UltrON} that leverages acoustic features to improve geometric
consistency in weakly-supervised optimization regime. We show that these
features can be obtained from B-mode images without additional annotation cost.
Moreover, we propose a novel loss function that compensates for view-dependency
in the B-mode images and facilitates occupancy optimization from multiview
ultrasound. By incorporating acoustic properties, \gls{UltrON} generalizes to
shapes of the same anatomy. We show that \gls{UltrON} mitigates the limitations
of occlusions and sparse labeling and paves the way for more accurate 3D
reconstruction. Code and dataset will be available at

TL;DR: 提出基于隐式神经表示(INR)的方法，无需推理时优化即可预测连续左心室位移，在UK Biobank数据集上达到最佳跟踪精度和应变误差，速度比最准确基线快380倍


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动量化心肌内运动和应变从标记MRI仍然是一个重要但具有挑战性的任务，需要准确且可扩展的分析方法

Method: 使用隐式神经表示(INR)，通过学习的潜在编码条件化，预测连续左心室位移，无需推理时优化

Result: 在452个UK Biobank测试案例中，达到最佳跟踪精度(2.14 mm RMSE)，最低的全局周向应变误差(2.86%)和径向应变误差(6.42%)，比最准确基线快380倍

Conclusion: INR基模型适合在大规模CMR数据集中进行准确且可扩展的心肌应变分析

Abstract: Automatic quantification of intramyocardial motion and strain from tagging
MRI remains an important but challenging task. We propose a method using
implicit neural representations (INRs), conditioned on learned latent codes, to
predict continuous left ventricular (LV) displacement -- without requiring
inference-time optimisation. Evaluated on 452 UK Biobank test cases, our method
achieved the best tracking accuracy (2.14 mm RMSE) and the lowest combined
error in global circumferential (2.86%) and radial (6.42%) strain compared to
three deep learning baselines. In addition, our method is $\sim$380$\times$
faster than the most accurate baseline. These results highlight the suitability
of INR-based models for accurate and scalable analysis of myocardial strain in
large CMR datasets.

*Samuel Felipe dos Santos,Tiago Agostinho de Almeida,Jurandy Almeida*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了增强型互学习网络(E-MLNet)，通过动态加权策略改进通用域自适应，在多个基准测试中表现优于现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有通用域自适应方法如MLNet对所有分类器平等对待，导致学习信号稀释，需要更有效的边界区分策略

Method: 集成动态加权策略到开放集熵最小化(OEM)中，利用闭集分类器预测，针对每个目标样本聚焦最相关的类别边界

Result: 在VisDA和ImageCLEF上获得最高平均H分数，在Open-Partial DA和Open-Set DA设置中分别以22/31和19/31的胜率超越MLNet基线

Conclusion: 动态加权策略能有效增强已知和未知类别的区分能力，提升通用域自适应性能

Abstract: Universal Domain Adaptation (UniDA) seeks to transfer knowledge from a
labeled source to an unlabeled target domain without assuming any relationship
between their label sets, requiring models to classify known samples while
rejecting unknown ones. Advanced methods like Mutual Learning Network (MLNet)
use a bank of one-vs-all classifiers adapted via Open-set Entropy Minimization
(OEM). However, this strategy treats all classifiers equally, diluting the
learning signal. We propose the Enhanced Mutual Learning Network (E-MLNet),
which integrates a dynamic weighting strategy to OEM. By leveraging the
closed-set classifier's predictions, E-MLNet focuses adaptation on the most
relevant class boundaries for each target sample, sharpening the distinction
between known and unknown classes. We conduct extensive experiments on four
challenging benchmarks: Office-31, Office-Home, VisDA-2017, and ImageCLEF. The
results demonstrate that E-MLNet achieves the highest average H-scores on VisDA
and ImageCLEF and exhibits superior robustness over its predecessor. E-MLNet
outperforms the strong MLNet baseline in the majority of individual adaptation
tasks -- 22 out of 31 in the challenging Open-Partial DA setting and 19 out of
31 in the Open-Set DA setting -- confirming the benefits of our focused
adaptation strategy.

Motivation: 乌尔都语作为拥有超过2.5亿使用者的语言，在多模态和视觉语言研究中严重缺乏资源。缺乏大规模高质量数据集限制了乌尔都语系统的发展，并加剧了多语言视觉语言模型对高资源语言的偏见。

Method: 从MS COCO数据集中通过分层采样构建数据集，使用SeamlessM4T v2进行翻译，并通过混合多模态质量估计框架（包括COMET-Kiwi翻译质量评估、CLIP视觉相似度、BERTScore语义一致性）进行验证和迭代优化。

Result: 构建了包含59,000张图像和319,000个高质量乌尔都语字幕的数据集，在BLEU、SacreBLEU和chrF等基准测试中表现出色，是目前最大的公开乌尔都语字幕数据集。

Conclusion: 通过发布COCO-Urdu数据集和质量评估流程，旨在减少多模态研究中的语言偏见，为包容性视觉语言系统奠定基础，促进乌尔都语在多模态领域的发展。

Abstract: Urdu, spoken by over 250 million people, remains critically under-served in
multimodal and vision-language research. The absence of large-scale,
high-quality datasets has limited the development of Urdu-capable systems and
reinforced biases in multilingual vision-language models trained primarily on
high-resource languages. To address this gap, we present COCO-Urdu, a
large-scale image-caption dataset derived from MS COCO, containing 59,000
images and 319,000 Urdu captions selected through stratified sampling to
preserve the original distribution. Captions were translated using SeamlessM4T
v2 and validated with a hybrid multimodal quality estimation framework that
integrates COMET-Kiwi for translation quality, CLIP-based similarity for visual
grounding, and BERTScore with back-translation for semantic consistency;
low-scoring captions were iteratively refined using open-source large language
models. We further benchmark COCO-Urdu on BLEU, SacreBLEU, and chrF, reporting
consistently strong results. To the best of our knowledge, COCO-Urdu is the
largest publicly available Urdu captioning dataset. By releasing both the
dataset and the quality estimation pipeline, we aim to reduce language bias in
multimodal research and establish a foundation for inclusive vision-language
systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有fMRI视觉解码方法大多依赖被试特定训练，限制了可扩展性和实际部署，需要开发支持多被试训练的通用方法。

Method: 使用Token Merging Transformer进行高效体素压缩，结合查询驱动的Q-Former生成与CLIP图像嵌入空间对齐的固定大小神经表征。

Result: 在7T自然场景数据集上，VoxelFormer在训练包含的被试上达到竞争性检索性能，且参数量显著少于现有方法。

Conclusion: token合并和基于查询的transformer是参数高效神经解码的有前景策略。

Abstract: Recent advances in fMRI-based visual decoding have enabled compelling
reconstructions of perceived images. However, most approaches rely on
subject-specific training, limiting scalability and practical deployment. We
introduce \textbf{VoxelFormer}, a lightweight transformer architecture that
enables multi-subject training for visual decoding from fMRI. VoxelFormer
integrates a Token Merging Transformer (ToMer) for efficient voxel compression
and a query-driven Q-Former that produces fixed-size neural representations
aligned with the CLIP image embedding space. Evaluated on the 7T Natural Scenes
Dataset, VoxelFormer achieves competitive retrieval performance on subjects
included during training with significantly fewer parameters than existing
methods. These results highlight token merging and query-based transformers as
promising strategies for parameter-efficient neural decoding.

*Binxu Li,Wei Peng,Mingjie Li,Ehsan Adeli,Kilian M. Pohl*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了PCGM方法，通过在生成式扩散框架中集成解剖约束，生成更加解剖可能的脑部MRI虚拟图像，从而复现疾病对相细胞相关相细形态差异的细微影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的虚拟图像生成模型在生成脑部MRI时缺乏明确的解剖偏置，导致生成的图像在解剖上不可能，无法保留医学上重要的细微局部变化。这些模型通常优化整体图像外观，而忽视了主体间的细微差异。

Method: 提出概率因果图模型(PCGM)，通过概率图模块捐捕解剖约束，并将这些约束转换为细微变化区域的空间二值掩码。这些掩码通过ControlNet的3D扩展进行编码，用于约束新的虚拟去噪UNet，最终通过3D扩散解码器生成高质量的脑部MRI。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，PCGM生成的结构性脑部MRI质量高于多个基线方法。更重要的是，从PCGM生成的虚拟图像中提取的脑部测量能够复现神经科学文献中之前报道的疾病对相细胞相关相细形态差异的细微影响。

Conclusion: PCGM方法在生成解剖可能的虚拟脑部MRI方面取得了重要进展，为研究细微形态差异的神经科学研究提供了有效的合成图像工具，是虚拟MRI在这一领域应用的重要里程碑。

Abstract: 3D brain MRI studies often examine subtle morphometric differences between
cohorts that are hard to detect visually. Given the high cost of MRI
acquisition, these studies could greatly benefit from image syntheses,
particularly counterfactual image generation, as seen in other domains, such as
computer vision. However, counterfactual models struggle to produce
anatomically plausible MRIs due to the lack of explicit inductive biases to
preserve fine-grained anatomical details. This shortcoming arises from the
training of the models aiming to optimize for the overall appearance of the
images (e.g., via cross-entropy) rather than preserving subtle, yet medically
relevant, local variations across subjects. To preserve subtle variations, we
propose to explicitly integrate anatomical constraints on a voxel-level as
prior into a generative diffusion framework. Called Probabilistic Causal Graph
Model (PCGM), the approach captures anatomical constraints via a probabilistic
graph module and translates those constraints into spatial binary masks of
regions where subtle variations occur. The masks (encoded by a 3D extension of
ControlNet) constrain a novel counterfactual denoising UNet, whose encodings
are then transferred into high-quality brain MRIs via our 3D diffusion decoder.
Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that PCGM generates
structural brain MRIs of higher quality than several baseline approaches.
Furthermore, we show for the first time that brain measurements extracted from
counterfactuals (generated by PCGM) replicate the subtle effects of a disease
on cortical brain regions previously reported in the neuroscience literature.
This achievement is an important milestone in the use of synthetic MRIs in
studies investigating subtle morphological differences.

Conclusion: Med3DInsight为无需人工标注的可扩展多模态3D医学表示学习提供了新范式，可无缝集成到现有3D医学图像理解网络中提升性能。

Abstract: Understanding 3D medical image volumes is critical in the medical field, yet
existing 3D medical convolution and transformer-based self-supervised learning
(SSL) methods often lack deep semantic comprehension. Recent advancements in
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) provide a promising approach to
enhance image understanding through text descriptions. To leverage these 2D
MLLMs for improved 3D medical image understanding, we propose Med3DInsight, a
novel pretraining framework that integrates 3D image encoders with 2D MLLMs via
a specially designed plane-slice-aware transformer module. Additionally, our
model employs a partial optimal transport based alignment, demonstrating
greater tolerance to noise introduced by potential noises in LLM-generated
content. Med3DInsight introduces a new paradigm for scalable multimodal 3D
medical representation learning without requiring human annotations. Extensive
experiments demonstrate our state-of-the-art performance on two downstream
tasks, i.e., segmentation and classification, across various public datasets
with CT and MRI modalities, outperforming current SSL methods. Med3DInsight can
be seamlessly integrated into existing 3D medical image understanding networks,
potentially enhancing their performance. Our source code, generated datasets,

Motivation: 现有的图卷积神经网络(GCNs)在人类行为识别中表现优异，但在人物交互检测中效果不佳，原因是缺乏有效的场景信息表征和适当的学习架构。

Method: 提出了一种方法论，通过考虑环境中固定物体信息和采用多任务学习方法来利用人类行为识别性能。收集了公共环境的实际数据，包含手部与固定物体交互类别(如ATM机、办理机等)和非交互类别(如走路、站立)。

Conclusion: 通过结合环境物体信息和多任务学习方法，可以显著提升人物交互场景下的行为识别性能，为该领域提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent graph convolutional neural networks (GCNs) have shown high performance
in the field of human action recognition by using human skeleton poses.
However, it fails to detect human-object interaction cases successfully due to
the lack of effective representation of the scene information and appropriate
learning architectures. In this context, we propose a methodology to utilize
human action recognition performance by considering fixed object information in
the environment and following a multi-task learning approach. In order to
evaluate the proposed method, we collected real data from public environments
and prepared our data set, which includes interaction classes of hands-on fixed
objects (e.g., ATM ticketing machines, check-in/out machines, etc.) and
non-interaction classes of walking and standing. The multi-task learning
approach, along with interaction area information, succeeds in recognizing the
studied interaction and non-interaction actions with an accuracy of 99.25%,
outperforming the accuracy of the base model using only human skeleton poses by
2.75%.

Motivation: 当前多光谱目标检测方法在特征融合时容易保留多余的背景或噪声，限制了感知性能

Method: 提出包含互特征精炼模块(MFRM)和差分特征反馈模块(DFFM)的统一框架，通过迭代关系图差分引导特征融合机制实现高质量跨模态融合

Result: 在FLIR、LLVIP和M³FD数据集上实现了最先进的性能，在各种挑战性场景中一致优于现有方法

Conclusion: IRDFusion通过渐进式放大显著关系信号并抑制特征噪声，证明了其鲁棒性和有效性

Abstract: Current multispectral object detection methods often retain extraneous
background or noise during feature fusion, limiting perceptual performance.To
address this, we propose an innovative feature fusion framework based on
cross-modal feature contrastive and screening strategy, diverging from
conventional approaches. The proposed method adaptively enhances salient
structures by fusing object-aware complementary cross-modal features while
suppressing shared background interference.Our solution centers on two novel,
specially designed modules: the Mutual Feature Refinement Module (MFRM) and the
Differential Feature Feedback Module (DFFM). The MFRM enhances intra- and
inter-modal feature representations by modeling their relationships, thereby
improving cross-modal alignment and discriminative power.Inspired by feedback
differential amplifiers, the DFFM dynamically computes inter-modal differential
features as guidance signals and feeds them back to the MFRM, enabling adaptive
fusion of complementary information while suppressing common-mode noise across
modalities. To enable robust feature learning, the MFRM and DFFM are integrated
into a unified framework, which is formally formulated as an Iterative
Relation-Map Differential Guided Feature Fusion mechanism, termed IRDFusion.
IRDFusion enables high-quality cross-modal fusion by progressively amplifying
salient relational signals through iterative feedback, while suppressing
feature noise, leading to significant performance gains.In extensive
experiments on FLIR, LLVIP and M$^3$FD datasets, IRDFusion achieves
state-of-the-art performance and consistently outperforms existing methods
across diverse challenging scenarios, demonstrating its robustness and
effectiveness. Code will be available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的VLA压缩方法单独进行量化或token剪枝，但两者存在不兼容性，无法实现整体效率提升

Method: 提出量化感知的token剪枝标准，在激进量化模型上工作，同时改进量化器设计以增强剪枝效果

Result: 在标准VLA模型上实现1.93倍加速，平均成功率提升4.5%，计算效率和推理速度显著提升

Conclusion: SQAP-VLA成功解决了量化和token剪枝的不兼容问题，为VLA模型的实际部署提供了高效的推理加速方案

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models exhibit unprecedented capabilities for
embodied intelligence. However, their extensive computational and memory costs
hinder their practical deployment. Existing VLA compression and acceleration
approaches conduct quantization or token pruning in an ad-hoc manner but fail
to enable both for a holistic efficiency improvement due to an observed
incompatibility. This work introduces SQAP-VLA, the first structured,
training-free VLA inference acceleration framework that simultaneously enables
state-of-the-art quantization and token pruning. We overcome the
incompatibility by co-designing the quantization and token pruning pipeline,
where we propose new quantization-aware token pruning criteria that work on an
aggressively quantized model while improving the quantizer design to enhance
pruning effectiveness. When applied to standard VLA models, SQAP-VLA yields
significant gains in computational efficiency and inference speed while
successfully preserving core model performance, achieving a $\times$1.93
speedup and up to a 4.5\% average success rate enhancement compared to the
original model.

Motivation: 当前LiDAR全局定位方法依赖GPS或SLAM里程计获取的地面真实位姿进行监督训练，但高精度位姿获取成本高昂且费力。需要开发无需地面真实位姿的自监督方法。

Method: 提出S-BEVLoc自监督框架：1）利用已知地理距离构建BEV图像的三元组训练样本；2）使用CNN提取局部特征，NetVLAD聚合全局描述符；3）引入SoftCos损失函数增强三元组学习。

Result: 在KITTI和NCLT大型数据集上的实验表明，S-BEVLoc在位置识别、闭环检测和全局定位任务中达到了最先进的性能，同时具有比监督方法更好的可扩展性。

Conclusion: S-BEVLoc成功证明了无需地面真实位姿的自监督LiDAR全局定位的可行性，为SLAM系统提供了更经济高效的解决方案，具有很好的实用价值和推广潜力。

Abstract: LiDAR-based global localization is an essential component of simultaneous
localization and mapping (SLAM), which helps loop closure and re-localization.
Current approaches rely on ground-truth poses obtained from GPS or SLAM
odometry to supervise network training. Despite the great success of these
supervised approaches, substantial cost and effort are required for
high-precision ground-truth pose acquisition. In this work, we propose
S-BEVLoc, a novel self-supervised framework based on bird's-eye view (BEV) for
LiDAR global localization, which eliminates the need for ground-truth poses and
is highly scalable. We construct training triplets from single BEV images by
leveraging the known geographic distances between keypoint-centered BEV
patches. Convolutional neural network (CNN) is used to extract local features,
and NetVLAD is employed to aggregate global descriptors. Moreover, we introduce
SoftCos loss to enhance learning from the generated triplets. Experimental
results on the large-scale KITTI and NCLT datasets show that S-BEVLoc achieves
state-of-the-art performance in place recognition, loop closure, and global
localization tasks, while offering scalability that would require extra effort
for supervised approaches.

Motivation: 基础分割模型能够零样本提取顶视图作物图像中的叶片实例，但分割包含多个重叠叶片的完整植物个体仍然具有挑战性，通常需要物种特定的标注数据集和大量人工劳动。

Method: 结合基础分割模型提取叶片实例和视觉语言模型推理植物结构，无需额外训练即可提取植物个体。

Abstract: Foundation segmentation models achieve reasonable leaf instance extraction
from top-view crop images without training (i.e., zero-shot). However,
segmenting entire plant individuals with each consisting of multiple
overlapping leaves remains challenging. This problem is referred to as a
hierarchical segmentation task, typically requiring annotated training
datasets, which are often species-specific and require notable human labor. To
address this, we introduce ZeroPlantSeg, a zero-shot segmentation for
rosette-shaped plant individuals from top-view images. We integrate a
foundation segmentation model, extracting leaf instances, and a vision-language
model, reasoning about plants' structures to extract plant individuals without
additional training. Evaluations on datasets with multiple plant species,
growth stages, and shooting environments demonstrate that our method surpasses
existing zero-shot methods and achieves better cross-domain performance than
supervised methods. Implementations are available at

Conclusion: 通过数据流水线和模型架构的协同改进，有效解决了CLIP在人物表征学习中的数据缺乏和细粒度匹配问题，为跨模态人物识别提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Although Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) exhibits strong
performance across diverse vision tasks, its application to person
representation learning faces two critical challenges: (i) the scarcity of
large-scale annotated vision-language data focused on person-centric images,
and (ii) the inherent limitations of global contrastive learning, which
struggles to maintain discriminative local features crucial for fine-grained
matching while remaining vulnerable to noisy text tokens. This work advances
CLIP for person representation learning through synergistic improvements in
data curation and model architecture. First, we develop a noise-resistant data
construction pipeline that leverages the in-context learning capabilities of
MLLMs to automatically filter and caption web-sourced images. This yields
WebPerson, a large-scale dataset of 5M high-quality person-centric image-text
pairs. Second, we introduce the GA-DMS (Gradient-Attention Guided Dual-Masking
Synergetic) framework, which improves cross-modal alignment by adaptively
masking noisy textual tokens based on the gradient-attention similarity score.
Additionally, we incorporate masked token prediction objectives that compel the
model to predict informative text tokens, enhancing fine-grained semantic
representation learning. Extensive experiments show that GA-DMS achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: ALL-PET成功解决了PET成像中的数据稀缺和计算效率问题，提供了一个灵活、可解释且任务自适应的基础模型解决方案，在多个PET应用场景中展现出优秀的泛化能力。

Abstract: Building large-scale foundation model for PET imaging is hindered by limited
access to labeled data and insufficient computational resources. To overcome
data scarcity and efficiency limitations, we propose ALL-PET, a low-resource,
low-shot PET foundation model operating directly in the projection domain.
ALL-PET leverages a latent diffusion model (LDM) with three key innovations.
First, we design a Radon mask augmentation strategy (RMAS) that generates over
200,000 structurally diverse training samples by projecting randomized
image-domain masks into sinogram space, significantly improving generalization
with minimal data. This is extended by a dynamic multi-mask (DMM) mechanism
that varies mask quantity and distribution, enhancing data diversity without
added model complexity. Second, we implement positive/negative mask constraints
to embed strict geometric consistency, reducing parameter burden while
preserving generation quality. Third, we introduce transparent medical
attention (TMA), a parameter-free, geometry-driven mechanism that enhances
lesion-related regions in raw projection data. Lesion-focused attention maps
are derived from coarse segmentation, covering both hypermetabolic and
hypometabolic areas, and projected into sinogram space for physically
consistent guidance. The system supports clinician-defined ROI adjustments,
ensuring flexible, interpretable, and task-adaptive emphasis aligned with PET
acquisition physics. Experimental results show ALL-PET achieves high-quality
sinogram generation using only 500 samples, with performance comparable to
models trained on larger datasets. ALL-PET generalizes across tasks including
low-dose reconstruction, attenuation correction, delayed-frame prediction, and
tracer separation, operating efficiently with memory use under 24GB.

TL;DR: 神经网络在噪声环境下预测Betti数方面可以超越传统的持续同调方法，特别是在处理结构噪声时表现出更好的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 比较持续同调(PH)和人工神经网络(ANN)这两种截然不同的拓扑结构推断方法在噪声鲁棒性方面的表现，探索ANN在拓扑分析中的潜力。

Method: 使用监督神经网络预测2D二值图像的Betti数，并与基于立方复形和带符号欧几里得距离变换(SEDT)的PH流程进行对比。实验包含一个合成数据集和两个真实世界数据集。

Result: 研究表明，在噪声条件下，ANN方法能够超越PH方法，这归因于ANN从训练数据中学习上下文和几何先验的能力。

Conclusion: 尽管仍处于发展阶段，但使用ANN进行拓扑估计为结构噪声下的拓扑分析提供了一个有吸引力的替代方案，展现出比传统PH方法更好的性能。

Abstract: Persistent Homology (PH) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) offer
contrasting approaches to inferring topological structure from data. In this
study, we examine the noise robustness of a supervised neural network trained
to predict Betti numbers in 2D binary images. We compare an ANN approach
against a PH pipeline based on cubical complexes and the Signed Euclidean
Distance Transform (SEDT), which is a widely adopted strategy for noise-robust
topological analysis. Using one synthetic and two real-world datasets, we show
that ANNs can outperform this PH approach under noise, likely due to their
capacity to learn contextual and geometric priors from training data. Though
still emerging, the use of ANNs for topology estimation offers a compelling
alternative to PH under structural noise.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有指标主要评估整体图像质量，与人类感知存在差异。基于神经心理学研究，人类对3D场景的识别主要关注单个对象

Method: 利用对象检测模型及其特征表示来量化场景中每个对象的'对象性'，进行以对象为中心的评估

Result: 用户研究表明OSIM比现有指标更接近人类感知，并通过多种方法分析了OSIM的特性

Conclusion: OSIM提供了一个更符合人类感知的3D场景评估标准，有助于重新评估3D重建和生成模型的进展

Abstract: This paper presents Objectness SIMilarity (OSIM), a novel evaluation metric
for 3D scenes that explicitly focuses on "objects," which are fundamental units
of human visual perception. Existing metrics assess overall image quality,
leading to discrepancies with human perception. Inspired by neuropsychological
insights, we hypothesize that human recognition of 3D scenes fundamentally
involves attention to individual objects. OSIM enables object-centric
evaluations by leveraging an object detection model and its feature
representations to quantify the "objectness" of each object in the scene. Our
user study demonstrates that OSIM aligns more closely with human perception
compared to existing metrics. We also analyze the characteristics of OSIM using

*Lei Wang,Piotr Koniusz,Yongsheng Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文从数据集驱动的视角重新审视视频理解领域，首次系统分析了数据集特征（运动复杂度、时间跨度、层次结构和多模态丰富性）如何引导模型架构的演进，为通用视频理解提供了新的理论框架和实践指导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究大多按任务或模型家族分类，忽视了数据集对架构演化的结构性影响。本文旨在填补这一空白，通过数据集驱动的视角揭示视频理解模型发展的内在规律。

Method: 采用数据集驱动分析方法，系统研究运动复杂度、时间跨度、层次结构和多模态丰富性等数据集特征如何为模型设计提供归纳偏置，并重新解读从双流网络、3D CNN到序列模型、Transformer和多模态基础模型的发展历程。

Result: 建立了数据集、归纳偏置和架构的统一框架，揭示了模型演进的内在逻辑，证明了数据集特征对架构设计的指导作用。

Conclusion: 通过将数据集特征、归纳偏置和模型架构整合为连贯框架，本文不仅提供了全面的回顾性分析，还为推进通用视频理解提供了规范性路线图，强调模型设计应与数据集不变性对齐，同时平衡可扩展性和任务需求。

Abstract: Video understanding has advanced rapidly, fueled by increasingly complex
datasets and powerful architectures. Yet existing surveys largely classify
models by task or family, overlooking the structural pressures through which
datasets guide architectural evolution. This survey is the first to adopt a
dataset-driven perspective, showing how motion complexity, temporal span,
hierarchical composition, and multimodal richness impose inductive biases that
models should encode. We reinterpret milestones, from two-stream and 3D CNNs to
sequential, transformer, and multimodal foundation models, as concrete
responses to these dataset-driven pressures. Building on this synthesis, we
offer practical guidance for aligning model design with dataset invariances
while balancing scalability and task demands. By unifying datasets, inductive
biases, and architectures into a coherent framework, this survey provides both
a comprehensive retrospective and a prescriptive roadmap for advancing
general-purpose video understanding.

TL;DR: OCELOT 2023挑战赛通过提供多尺度重叠细胞和组织标注数据集，验证了细胞-组织相互作用理解对病理图像分析的重要性，参赛模型相比仅细胞检测的基线方法F1分数提升达7.99。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习细胞检测模型难以模拟病理学家在不同放大倍数下观察全玻片图像的行为，缺乏多尺度语义理解能力，且缺少多尺度重叠标注数据集。

Method: 构建包含6个器官、673对标注的TCGA全玻片图像数据集，分为训练、验证和测试集，组织挑战赛让参与者开发能理解细胞-组织关系的模型。

Result: 顶级参赛模型相比不包含细胞-组织关系的基线细胞检测模型，在测试集上F1分数提升高达7.99，性能显著改善。

Conclusion: 多尺度语义整合对实现人类水平性能至关重要，OCELOT 2023挑战赛加速了该领域研究，证明了细胞-组织关系理解的价值。

Abstract: Pathologists routinely alternate between different magnifications when
examining Whole-Slide Images, allowing them to evaluate both broad tissue
morphology and intricate cellular details to form comprehensive diagnoses.
However, existing deep learning-based cell detection models struggle to
replicate these behaviors and learn the interdependent semantics between
structures at different magnifications. A key barrier in the field is the lack
of datasets with multi-scale overlapping cell and tissue annotations. The
OCELOT 2023 challenge was initiated to gather insights from the community to
validate the hypothesis that understanding cell and tissue (cell-tissue)
interactions is crucial for achieving human-level performance, and to
accelerate the research in this field. The challenge dataset includes
overlapping cell detection and tissue segmentation annotations from six organs,
comprising 673 pairs sourced from 306 The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
Whole-Slide Images with hematoxylin and eosin staining, divided into training,
validation, and test subsets. Participants presented models that significantly
enhanced the understanding of cell-tissue relationships. Top entries achieved
up to a 7.99 increase in F1-score on the test set compared to the baseline
cell-only model that did not incorporate cell-tissue relationships. This is a
substantial improvement in performance over traditional cell-only detection
methods, demonstrating the need for incorporating multi-scale semantics into
the models. This paper provides a comparative analysis of the methods used by
participants, highlighting innovative strategies implemented in the OCELOT 2023
challenge.

TL;DR: RT-DETR++通过改进RT-DETR模型的编码器，引入通道门控注意力上采样/下采样机制和CSP-PAC特征融合技术，在无人机图像小目标密集检测中实现优越性能，同时保持实时检测速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无人机图像中的目标检测面临小目标密集、尺度变化大、遮挡严重等挑战，需要改进现有模型来处理这些问题。

Method: 1. 引入通道门控注意力机制的上采样/下采样(AU/AD)双路径系统，减少特征层传播误差并保留细节；2. 在特征融合中采用CSP-PAC技术，使用并行空洞卷积在同一层处理局部和上下文信息，整合多尺度特征。

Result: 新型neck设计在小目标和密集目标检测方面表现优越，模型保持实时检测速度且不增加计算复杂度。

Conclusion: 本研究为实时检测系统中的特征编码设计提供了有效方法，特别适用于无人机图像中的目标检测挑战。

Abstract: Object detection in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery presents
significant challenges. Issues such as densely packed small objects, scale
variations, and occlusion are commonplace. This paper introduces RT-DETR++,
which enhances the encoder component of the RT-DETR model. Our improvements
focus on two key aspects. First, we introduce a channel-gated attention-based
upsampling/downsampling (AU/AD) mechanism. This dual-path system minimizes
errors and preserves details during feature layer propagation. Second, we
incorporate CSP-PAC during feature fusion. This technique employs parallel
hollow convolutions to process local and contextual information within the same
layer, facilitating the integration of multi-scale features. Evaluation
demonstrates that our novel neck design achieves superior performance in
detecting small and densely packed objects. The model maintains sufficient
speed for real-time detection without increasing computational complexity. This
study provides an effective approach for feature encoding design in real-time
detection systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种无需训练的知识聚焦框架，用于知识基于视觉问答，通过提高知识相关性和减少冗余来缓解噪声影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有KB-VQA方法直接使用检索到的知识引入了大量冗余和噪声，影响回答准确性。

Method: 首先从图像-问题对中提取关键部分构建低噪声查询，然后使用大模型识别和提取有益回答的知识段落，最后采用选择性知识集成策略，仅在模型信心不足时才结合知识。

Result: 实验结果显示该框架超越了最先进的方法。

Conclusion: 该无需训练的知识聚焦框架能够获得准确关键的知识，有效减少知识冗余和噪声影响。

Abstract: Knowledge-based visual question answering (KB-VQA) requires a model to
understand images and utilize external knowledge to provide accurate answers.
Existing approaches often directly augment models with retrieved information
from knowledge sources while ignoring substantial knowledge redundancy, which
introduces noise into the answering process. To address this, we propose a
training-free framework with knowledge focusing for KB-VQA, that mitigates the
impact of noise by enhancing knowledge relevance and reducing redundancy.
First, for knowledge retrieval, our framework concludes essential parts from
the image-question pairs, creating low-noise queries that enhance the retrieval
of highly relevant knowledge. Considering that redundancy still persists in the
retrieved knowledge, we then prompt large models to identify and extract
answer-beneficial segments from knowledge. In addition, we introduce a
selective knowledge integration strategy, allowing the model to incorporate
knowledge only when it lacks confidence in answering the question, thereby
mitigating the influence of redundant information. Our framework enables the
acquisition of accurate and critical knowledge, and extensive experiments
demonstrate that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 提出CWSSNet分类框架，融合3D光谱空间特征和小波卷积，解决高光谱图像特征冗余问题，在江西余干县地物分类中取得优异性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱遥感技术在林业生态和精准农业等领域有重要应用价值，但高光谱图像波段多、维度高、光谱混合特性导致特征冗余问题突出，需要更精细的地物分类方法

Method: 使用ZY1F卫星高光谱图像数据，提出CWSSNet框架，集成3D光谱空间特征和小波卷积，采用多尺度卷积注意力模块融合多模态信息，引入小波域多波段分解和卷积操作

Result: 在余干县分类任务中，mIoU达到74.50%，mAcc达到82.73%，mF1达到84.94%，在水体、植被和裸地分类中获得最高IoU，70%训练集比例下训练时间增加有限且分类效果接近最优

Conclusion: CWSSNet模型具有良好的鲁棒性，在小样本训练条件下保持可靠性能，突破了传统方法的分类性能瓶颈

Abstract: Hyperspectral remote sensing technology has significant application value in
fields such as forestry ecology and precision agriculture, while also putting
forward higher requirements for fine ground object classification. However,
although hyperspectral images are rich in spectral information and can improve
recognition accuracy, they tend to cause prominent feature redundancy due to
their numerous bands, high dimensionality, and spectral mixing characteristics.
To address this, this study used hyperspectral images from the ZY1F satellite
as a data source and selected Yugan County, Shangrao City, Jiangxi Province as
the research area to perform ground object classification research. A
classification framework named CWSSNet was proposed, which integrates 3D
spectral-spatial features and wavelet convolution. This framework integrates
multimodal information us-ing a multiscale convolutional attention module and
breaks through the classification performance bottleneck of traditional methods
by introducing multi-band decomposition and convolution operations in the
wavelet domain. The experiments showed that CWSSNet achieved 74.50\%, 82.73\%,
and 84.94\% in mean Intersection over Union (mIoU), mean Accuracy (mAcc), and
mean F1-score (mF1) respectively in Yugan County. It also obtained the highest
Intersection over Union (IoU) in the classifica-tion of water bodies,
vegetation, and bare land, demonstrating good robustness. Additionally, when
the training set proportion was 70\%, the increase in training time was
limited, and the classification effect was close to the optimal level,
indicating that the model maintains reliable performance under small-sample
training conditions.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of generative models, highly realistic image
synthesis has posed new challenges to digital security and media credibility.
Although AI-generated image detection methods have partially addressed these
concerns, a substantial research gap remains in evaluating their performance
under complex real-world conditions. This paper introduces the Real-World
Robustness Dataset (RRDataset) for comprehensive evaluation of detection models
across three dimensions: 1) Scenario Generalization: RRDataset encompasses
high-quality images from seven major scenarios (War and Conflict, Disasters and
Accidents, Political and Social Events, Medical and Public Health, Culture and
Religion, Labor and Production, and everyday life), addressing existing dataset
gaps from a content perspective. 2) Internet Transmission Robustness: examining
detector performance on images that have undergone multiple rounds of sharing
across various social media platforms. 3) Re-digitization Robustness: assessing
model effectiveness on images altered through four distinct re-digitization
methods. We benchmarked 17 detectors and 10 vision-language models (VLMs) on
RRDataset and conducted a large-scale human study involving 192 participants to
investigate human few-shot learning capabilities in detecting AI-generated
images. The benchmarking results reveal the limitations of current AI detection
methods under real-world conditions and underscore the importance of drawing on
human adaptability to develop more robust detection algorithms.

TL;DR: 轻量级自适应Dark-ISP插件，直接处理Bayer RAW图像，通过任务驱动的可微分解构和自成增机制，在低光环境中实现了更优的目标检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低光环境下图像质量降级导致目标检测困难的问题，现有方法或使用有信息损失的RAW-RGB图像，或者采用复杂框架，需要一种轻量级且自适应的解决方案。

Method: 将传统ISP流水线解构为线性传感器校准和非线性调彩映射子模块，重构为可微分组件，通过任务驱动损失进行优化。每个模块具备内容感知适应性和物理信息先验知识，利用ISP流水线的内在级联结构设计自成增机制。

Result: 在三个RAW图像数据集上进行了涉广实验，证明该方法在具有挑战性的低光环境中，以最少的参数量超越了现有的RGB和RAW基础检测方法，获得了更优异的结果。

Conclusion: Dark-ISP提供了一种轻量级、自适应的方案，能够直接处理Bayer RAW图像，支持无缝端到端训练，为低光环境下的目标检测提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Low-light Object detection is crucial for many real-world applications but
remains challenging due to degraded image quality. While recent studies have
shown that RAW images offer superior potential over RGB images, existing
approaches either use RAW-RGB images with information loss or employ complex
frameworks. To address these, we propose a lightweight and self-adaptive Image
Signal Processing (ISP) plugin, Dark-ISP, which directly processes Bayer RAW
images in dark environments, enabling seamless end-to-end training for object
detection. Our key innovations are: (1) We deconstruct conventional ISP
pipelines into sequential linear (sensor calibration) and nonlinear (tone
mapping) sub-modules, recasting them as differentiable components optimized
through task-driven losses. Each module is equipped with content-aware
adaptability and physics-informed priors, enabling automatic RAW-to-RGB
conversion aligned with detection objectives. (2) By exploiting the ISP
pipeline's intrinsic cascade structure, we devise a Self-Boost mechanism that
facilitates cooperation between sub-modules. Through extensive experiments on
three RAW image datasets, we demonstrate that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art RGB- and RAW-based detection approaches, achieving superior
results with minimal parameters in challenging low-light environments.

Conclusion: 多粒度目标引导框架通过递归精炼和特征整合有效提升了人类轨迹预测的准确性，证明了中间粒度建模的重要价值。

Abstract: Accurate human trajectory prediction is crucial for robotics navigation and
autonomous driving. Recent research has demonstrated that incorporating goal
guidance significantly enhances prediction accuracy by reducing uncertainty and
leveraging prior knowledge. Most goal-guided approaches decouple the prediction
task into two stages: goal prediction and subsequent trajectory completion
based on the predicted goal, which operate at extreme granularities:
coarse-grained goal prediction forecasts the overall intention, while
fine-grained trajectory completion needs to generate the positions for all
future timesteps. The potential utility of intermediate temporal granularity
remains largely unexplored, which motivates multi-granularity trajectory
modeling. While prior work has shown that multi-granularity representations
capture diverse scales of human dynamics and motion patterns, effectively
integrating this concept into goal-guided frameworks remains challenging. In
this paper, we propose MGTraj, a novel Multi-Granularity goal-guided model for
human Trajectory prediction. MGTraj recursively encodes trajectory proposals
from coarse to fine granularity levels. At each level, a transformer-based
recursive refinement network (RRN) captures features and predicts progressive
refinements. Features across different granularities are integrated using a
weight-sharing strategy, and velocity prediction is employed as an auxiliary
task to further enhance performance. Comprehensive experimental results in
EHT/UCY and Stanford Drone Dataset indicate that MGTraj outperforms baseline
methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance among goal-guided methods.

Conclusion: Medverse展示了在3D医学影像中实现通用上下文学习的可行性，为医学图像分析提供了统一的解决方案。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) offers a promising paradigm for universal medical
image analysis, enabling models to perform diverse image processing tasks
without retraining. However, current ICL models for medical imaging remain
limited in two critical aspects: they cannot simultaneously achieve
high-fidelity predictions and global anatomical understanding, and there is no
unified model trained across diverse medical imaging tasks (e.g., segmentation
and enhancement) and anatomical regions. As a result, the full potential of ICL
in medical imaging remains underexplored. Thus, we present \textbf{Medverse}, a
universal ICL model for 3D medical imaging, trained on 22 datasets covering
diverse tasks in universal image segmentation, transformation, and enhancement
across multiple organs, imaging modalities, and clinical centers. Medverse
employs a next-scale autoregressive in-context learning framework that
progressively refines predictions from coarse to fine, generating consistent,
full-resolution volumetric outputs and enabling multi-scale anatomical
awareness. We further propose a blockwise cross-attention module that
facilitates long-range interactions between context and target inputs while
preserving computational efficiency through spatial sparsity. Medverse is
extensively evaluated on a broad collection of held-out datasets covering
previously unseen clinical centers, organs, species, and imaging modalities.
Results demonstrate that Medverse substantially outperforms existing ICL
baselines and establishes a novel paradigm for in-context learning. Code and
model weights will be made publicly available. Our model are publicly available

Abstract: Background and objective Early diagnosis of gastric diseases is crucial to
prevent fatal outcomes. Although histopathologic examination remains the
diagnostic gold standard, it is performed entirely manually, making evaluations
labor-intensive and prone to variability among pathologists. Critical findings
may be missed, and lack of standard procedures reduces consistency. These
limitations highlight the need for automated, reliable, and efficient methods
for gastric tissue analysis. Methods In this study, a novel hybrid model named
CoAtNeXt was proposed for the classification of gastric tissue images. The
model is built upon the CoAtNet architecture by replacing its MBConv layers
with enhanced ConvNeXtV2 blocks. Additionally, the Convolutional Block
Attention Module (CBAM) is integrated to improve local feature extraction
through channel and spatial attention mechanisms. The architecture was scaled
to achieve a balance between computational efficiency and classification
performance. CoAtNeXt was evaluated on two publicly available datasets,
HMU-GC-HE-30K for eight-class classification and GasHisSDB for binary
classification, and was compared against 10 Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) and ten Vision Transformer (ViT) models. Results CoAtNeXt achieved
96.47% accuracy, 96.60% precision, 96.47% recall, 96.45% F1 score, and 99.89%
AUC on HMU-GC-HE-30K. On GasHisSDB, it reached 98.29% accuracy, 98.07%
precision, 98.41% recall, 98.23% F1 score, and 99.90% AUC. It outperformed all
CNN and ViT models tested and surpassed previous studies in the literature.
Conclusion Experimental results show that CoAtNeXt is a robust architecture for
histopathological classification of gastric tissue images, providing
performance on binary and multiclass. Its highlights its potential to assist
pathologists by enhancing diagnostic accuracy and reducing workload.

Abstract: Recent advances in large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated
strong performance on general-purpose medical tasks. However, their
effectiveness in specialized domains such as dentistry remains underexplored.
In particular, panoramic X-rays, a widely used imaging modality in oral
radiology, pose interpretative challenges due to dense anatomical structures
and subtle pathological cues, which are not captured by existing medical
benchmarks or instruction datasets. To this end, we introduce MMOral, the first
large-scale multimodal instruction dataset and benchmark tailored for panoramic
X-ray interpretation. MMOral consists of 20,563 annotated images paired with
1.3 million instruction-following instances across diverse task types,
including attribute extraction, report generation, visual question answering,
and image-grounded dialogue. In addition, we present MMOral-Bench, a
comprehensive evaluation suite covering five key diagnostic dimensions in
dentistry. We evaluate 64 LVLMs on MMOral-Bench and find that even the
best-performing model, i.e., GPT-4o, only achieves 41.45% accuracy, revealing
significant limitations of current models in this domain. To promote the
progress of this specific domain, we also propose OralGPT, which conducts
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) upon Qwen2.5-VL-7B with our meticulously curated
MMOral instruction dataset. Remarkably, a single epoch of SFT yields
substantial performance enhancements for LVLMs, e.g., OralGPT demonstrates a
24.73% improvement. Both MMOral and OralGPT hold significant potential as a
critical foundation for intelligent dentistry and enable more clinically
impactful multimodal AI systems in the dental field. The dataset, model,
benchmark, and evaluation suite are available at

Method: DATE方法包含：1) 时间戳注入机制(TIM)，将视频帧嵌入与文本时间戳标记交错构建连续时间参考系统；2) 时间感知相似性采样(TASS)，将视频采样重新定义为视觉-语言检索任务，采用两阶段算法确保语义相关性和时间覆盖

Result: 在小时级长视频基准测试中，7B和72B模型均取得最先进性能，7B模型在某些基准上甚至超过许多72B模型

Conclusion: DATE方法通过显式时间建模和语义引导采样，显著提升了多模态大语言模型的长视频时序理解和关键事件定位能力

Abstract: Long video understanding remains a fundamental challenge for multimodal large
language models (MLLMs), particularly in tasks requiring precise temporal
reasoning and event localization. Existing approaches typically adopt uniform
frame sampling and rely on implicit position encodings to model temporal order.
However, these methods struggle with long-range dependencies, leading to
critical information loss and degraded temporal comprehension. In this paper,
we propose Dynamic Absolute Time Enhancement (DATE) that enhances temporal
awareness in MLLMs through the Timestamp Injection Mechanism (TIM) and a
semantically guided Temporal-Aware Similarity Sampling (TASS) strategy.
Specifically, we interleave video frame embeddings with textual timestamp
tokens to construct a continuous temporal reference system. We further
reformulate the video sampling problem as a vision-language retrieval task and
introduce a two-stage algorithm to ensure both semantic relevance and temporal
coverage: enriching each query into a descriptive caption to better align with
the vision feature, and sampling key event with a similarity-driven temporally
regularized greedy strategy. Our method achieves remarkable improvements w.r.t.
absolute time understanding and key event localization, resulting in
state-of-the-art performance among 7B and 72B models on hour-long video
benchmarks. Particularly, our 7B model even exceeds many 72B models on some
benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决3D医学图像分割资源消耗大、时间长的限制，现有高效分割模型通常是静态设计，难以在不同任务间平衡性能与资源效率。

Method: 从冗余模型开始，通过块级剪枝和功能解耦损失迭代剪枝冗余模块，实现动态高效的3D分割。

Result: 轻量级变体PSP-Seg-S在五个数据集上与nnU-Net性能相当，GPU内存使用减少42-45%，训练时间减少29-48%，参数量减少83-87%。

Conclusion: PSP-Seg具有作为成本效益高且高性能的替代方案在临床中广泛应用的潜力。

Abstract: 3D medical image segmentation often faces heavy resource and time
consumption, limiting its scalability and rapid deployment in clinical
environments. Existing efficient segmentation models are typically static and
manually designed prior to training, which restricts their adaptability across
diverse tasks and makes it difficult to balance performance with resource
efficiency. In this paper, we propose PSP-Seg, a progressive pruning framework
that enables dynamic and efficient 3D segmentation. PSP-Seg begins with a
redundant model and iteratively prunes redundant modules through a combination
of block-wise pruning and a functional decoupling loss. We evaluate PSP-Seg on
five public datasets, benchmarking it against seven state-of-the-art models and
six efficient segmentation models. Results demonstrate that the lightweight
variant, PSP-Seg-S, achieves performance on par with nnU-Net while reducing GPU
memory usage by 42-45%, training time by 29-48%, and parameter number by 83-87%
across all datasets. These findings underscore PSP-Seg's potential as a
cost-effective yet high-performing alternative for widespread clinical
application.

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在材料科学中显示出潜力，但其对真实材料表征成像数据的理解能力尚未充分探索，需要建立专门的基准测试来评估和推动该领域发展。

Method: 构建MatCha基准测试，涵盖材料研究的四个关键阶段和21个不同任务，包含1500个专家级问题，用于评估最先进MLLM的性能表现。

Result: 现有MLLM在MatCha上表现显著低于人类专家，在处理需要高级专业知识和复杂视觉感知的问题时性能下降，简单的few-shot和思维链提示无法有效改善这些限制。

Abstract: Materials characterization is fundamental to acquiring materials information,
revealing the processing-microstructure-property relationships that guide
material design and optimization. While multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) have recently shown promise in generative and predictive tasks within
materials science, their capacity to understand real-world characterization
imaging data remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we present MatCha, the
first benchmark for materials characterization image understanding, comprising
1,500 questions that demand expert-level domain expertise. MatCha encompasses
four key stages of materials research comprising 21 distinct tasks, each
designed to reflect authentic challenges faced by materials scientists. Our
evaluation of state-of-the-art MLLMs on MatCha reveals a significant
performance gap compared to human experts. These models exhibit degradation
when addressing questions requiring higher-level expertise and sophisticated
visual perception. Simple few-shot and chain-of-thought prompting struggle to
alleviate these limitations. These findings highlight that existing MLLMs still
exhibit limited adaptability to real-world materials characterization
scenarios. We hope MatCha will facilitate future research in areas such as new
material discovery and autonomous scientific agents. MatCha is available at

Motivation: 解决现有图表理解方法的局限性：外部工具方案容易出错且受限于预定工具集，而专业模型通常采用单一的文本推理策略，其中间步骤难以验证

Method: 提出Code-as-Thought(CaT)方法，将图表视觉信息转换为可验证的符号格式，并引入视视程序化能力的学习概念，让VLM学习在CaT路径和直接视视推理路径之间选择，通过助力学习使用双奖励系统训练选择策略

Result: 实验结果显示在多样化的图表理解测试集上获得了强大且稳健的性能表现

Conclusion: 这项工作证明了VLM不仅可以学习如何推理，还可以学习动态选择每个任务的最优推理路径

Abstract: Chart understanding presents a critical test to the reasoning capabilities of
Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Prior approaches face critical limitations: some
rely on external tools, making them brittle and constrained by a predefined
toolkit, while others fine-tune specialist models that often adopt a single
reasoning strategy, such as text-based chain-of-thought (CoT). The intermediate
steps of text-based reasoning are difficult to verify, which complicates the
use of reinforcement-learning signals that reward factual accuracy. To address
this, we propose a Code-as-Thought (CaT) approach to represent the visual
information of a chart in a verifiable, symbolic format. Our key insight is
that this strategy must be adaptive: a fixed, code-only implementation
consistently fails on complex charts where symbolic representation is
unsuitable. This finding leads us to introduce Visual Programmability: a
learnable property that determines if a chart-question pair is better solved
with code or direct visual analysis. We implement this concept in an adaptive
framework where a VLM learns to choose between the CaT pathway and a direct
visual reasoning pathway. The selection policy of the model is trained with
reinforcement learning using a novel dual-reward system. This system combines a
data-accuracy reward to ground the model in facts and prevent numerical
hallucination, with a decision reward that teaches the model when to use each
strategy, preventing it from defaulting to a single reasoning mode. Experiments
demonstrate strong and robust performance across diverse chart-understanding
benchmarks. Our work shows that VLMs can be taught not only to reason but also
how to reason, dynamically selecting the optimal reasoning pathway for each
task.

Abstract: The advancement of open-source text-to-image (T2I) models has been hindered
by the absence of large-scale, reasoning-focused datasets and comprehensive
evaluation benchmarks, resulting in a performance gap compared to leading
closed-source systems. To address this challenge, We introduce FLUX-Reason-6M
and PRISM-Bench (Precise and Robust Image Synthesis Measurement Benchmark).
FLUX-Reason-6M is a massive dataset consisting of 6 million high-quality
FLUX-generated images and 20 million bilingual (English and Chinese)
descriptions specifically designed to teach complex reasoning. The image are
organized according to six key characteristics: Imagination, Entity, Text
rendering, Style, Affection, and Composition, and design explicit Generation
Chain-of-Thought (GCoT) to provide detailed breakdowns of image generation
steps. The whole data curation takes 15,000 A100 GPU days, providing the
community with a resource previously unattainable outside of large industrial
labs. PRISM-Bench offers a novel evaluation standard with seven distinct
tracks, including a formidable Long Text challenge using GCoT. Through
carefully designed prompts, it utilizes advanced vision-language models for
nuanced human-aligned assessment of prompt-image alignment and image
aesthetics. Our extensive evaluation of 19 leading models on PRISM-Bench
reveals critical performance gaps and highlights specific areas requiring
improvement. Our dataset, benchmark, and evaluation code are released to
catalyze the next wave of reasoning-oriented T2I generation. Project page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种模态无关的U-net架构，通过模态无关输入通道和模态特定通道的组合，实现对训练中未见MRI模态的有效分割，同时保持对已见模态的处理能力。


<details>

Motivation: 现有脑MRI多模态分割模型通常局限于固定模态组合，无法有效处理推理时的新模态，或者虽然能泛化到未见模态但会丢失模态特异性信息。需要开发能够处理任意可用成像模态的模型。

Method: 在U-net架构中集成模态无关输入通道和模态特定输入通道。通过图像增强方案合成人工MRI模态，差异性地改变病理和健康脑组织的外观以创建人工对比度，同时保持解剖完整性。

Result: 在包含5种病理类型和8种MRI模态的8个数据库上评估，结果显示该方法既能有效处理训练中见过的MRI模态，又能处理新的未见模态来改进分割效果。

Conclusion: 通过简单的架构修改和图像增强策略，实现了对任意MRI模态组合的分割能力，为脑病变检测提供了更灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Segmentation models are important tools for the detection and analysis of
lesions in brain MRI. Depending on the type of brain pathology that is imaged,
MRI scanners can acquire multiple, different image modalities (contrasts). Most
segmentation models for multimodal brain MRI are restricted to fixed modalities
and cannot effectively process new ones at inference. Some models generalize to
unseen modalities but may lose discriminative modality-specific information.
This work aims to develop a model that can perform inference on data that
contain image modalities unseen during training, previously seen modalities,
and heterogeneous combinations of both, thus allowing a user to utilize any
available imaging modalities. We demonstrate this is possible with a simple,
thus practical alteration to the U-net architecture, by integrating a
modality-agnostic input channel or pathway, alongside modality-specific input
channels. To train this modality-agnostic component, we develop an image
augmentation scheme that synthesizes artificial MRI modalities. Augmentations
differentially alter the appearance of pathological and healthy brain tissue to
create artificial contrasts between them while maintaining realistic anatomical
integrity. We evaluate the method using 8 MRI databases that include 5 types of
pathologies (stroke, tumours, traumatic brain injury, multiple sclerosis and
white matter hyperintensities) and 8 modalities (T1, T1+contrast, T2, PD, SWI,
DWI, ADC and FLAIR). The results demonstrate that the approach preserves the
ability to effectively process MRI modalities encountered during training,
while being able to process new, unseen modalities to improve its segmentation.

Result: 在AOT航空数据集上进行验证，比基线方法有持续改进，相比标准YOLO检测器获得了10%相对AUROC提升，背景拒绝功能进一步增强了稳健性

Conclusion: 该方法特别适合动态空对空环境中的可靠UAV感知，在保持检测准确性的同时提供了优秀的未知物体拒绝能力

Abstract: Open-set detection is crucial for robust UAV autonomy in air-to-air object
detection under real-world conditions. Traditional closed-set detectors degrade
significantly under domain shifts and flight data corruption, posing risks to
safety-critical applications. We propose a novel, model-agnostic open-set
detection framework designed specifically for embedding-based detectors. The
method explicitly handles unknown object rejection while maintaining robustness
against corrupted flight data. It estimates semantic uncertainty via entropy
modeling in the embedding space and incorporates spectral normalization and
temperature scaling to enhance open-set discrimination. We validate our
approach on the challenging AOT aerial benchmark and through extensive
real-world flight tests. Comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate consistent
improvements over baseline methods, achieving up to a 10\% relative AUROC gain
compared to standard YOLO-based detectors. Additionally, we show that
background rejection further strengthens robustness without compromising
detection accuracy, making our solution particularly well-suited for reliable
UAV perception in dynamic air-to-air environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAR图像中的目标与复杂背景杂波（如地形反射和斑点噪声）在强度和模式上相似，导致模型提取纠缠或虚假特征，影响目标表征的清晰度。

Method: 提出SlotSAR框架：1）从SARATR-X提取高级语义特征；2）从小波散射网络提取低级散射特征；3）设计多级slot注意力模块整合多级特征，增强slot-wise表征区分度。

Result: 实验结果表明SlotSAR在SAR图像分类中实现了最先进的性能，相比现有OCL方法能更好地保留结构细节。

Conclusion: SlotSAR通过多级特征融合和注意力机制，有效解决了SAR图像中目标与背景杂波分离的挑战，无需掩码标注即可实现清晰的目标表征。

Abstract: Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images contain not only targets of interest
but also complex background clutter, including terrain reflections and speckle
noise. In many cases, such clutter exhibits intensity and patterns that
resemble targets, leading models to extract entangled or spurious features.
Such behavior undermines the ability to form clear target representations,
regardless of the classifier. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
object-centric learning (OCL) framework, named SlotSAR, that disentangles
target representations from background clutter in SAR images without mask
annotations. SlotSAR first extracts high-level semantic features from SARATR-X
and low-level scattering features from the wavelet scattering network in order
to obtain complementary multi-level representations for robust target
characterization. We further present a multi-level slot attention module that
integrates these low- and high-level features to enhance slot-wise
representation distinctiveness, enabling effective OCL. Experimental results
demonstrate that SlotSAR achieves state-of-the-art performance in SAR imagery
by preserving structural details compared to existing OCL methods.

Motivation: 现实世界中不同车辆的感知模型存在异构性，现有方法需要联合训练或预先存储所有协作模型，这在实践中不切实际。

Method: 提出渐进式异构协作感知(PHCP)框架，将问题建模为少样本无监督域适应，在推理时通过自训练适配器动态对齐特征，无需标注数据和联合训练。

Result: 在OPV2V数据集上的大量实验表明，PHCP在各种异构场景下都取得了强劲性能，仅使用少量无标注数据就能达到与全数据集训练的SOTA方法相当的性能。

Conclusion: PHCP证明了在推理时直接处理异构协作感知问题的可行性，为实际部署提供了实用解决方案，无需预先训练或存储所有协作模型。

Abstract: Collaborative perception enables vehicles to overcome individual perception
limitations by sharing information, allowing them to see further and through
occlusions. In real-world scenarios, models on different vehicles are often
heterogeneous due to manufacturer variations. Existing methods for
heterogeneous collaborative perception address this challenge by fine-tuning
adapters or the entire network to bridge the domain gap. However, these methods
are impractical in real-world applications, as each new collaborator must
undergo joint training with the ego vehicle on a dataset before inference, or
the ego vehicle stores models for all potential collaborators in advance.
Therefore, we pose a new question: Can we tackle this challenge directly during
inference, eliminating the need for joint training? To answer this, we
introduce Progressive Heterogeneous Collaborative Perception (PHCP), a novel
framework that formulates the problem as few-shot unsupervised domain
adaptation. Unlike previous work, PHCP dynamically aligns features by
self-training an adapter during inference, eliminating the need for labeled
data and joint training. Extensive experiments on the OPV2V dataset demonstrate
that PHCP achieves strong performance across diverse heterogeneous scenarios.
Notably, PHCP achieves performance comparable to SOTA methods trained on the
entire dataset while using only a small amount of unlabeled data.

methodologies, including real-time object tracking, lateral displacement

implementing the YOLO object detection model and custom lane estimation
algorithms. Unlike systems reliant on inter-vehicular communication, this

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled strong zero-shot classification
through image-text alignment. Yet, their purely visual inference capabilities
remain under-explored. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of
both language-guided and vision-only image classification with a diverse set of
dual-encoder VLMs, including both well-established and recent models such as
SigLIP 2 and RADIOv2.5. The performance is compared in a standard setup on the
ImageNet-1k validation set and its label-corrected variant. The key factors
affecting accuracy are analysed, including prompt design, class diversity, the
number of neighbours in k-NN, and reference set size. We show that language and
vision offer complementary strengths, with some classes favouring textual
prompts and others better handled by visual similarity. To exploit this
complementarity, we introduce a simple, learning-free fusion method based on
per-class precision that improves classification performance. The code is

Abstract: Gliomas are the most prevalent type of primary brain tumors, and their
accurate segmentation from MRI is critical for diagnosis, treatment planning,
and longitudinal monitoring. However, the scarcity of high-quality annotated
imaging data in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) poses a significant challenge for
deploying advanced segmentation models in clinical workflows. This study
introduces a robust and computationally efficient deep learning framework
tailored for resource-constrained settings. We leveraged a 3D Attention UNet
architecture augmented with residual blocks and enhanced through transfer
learning from pre-trained weights on the BraTS 2021 dataset. Our model was
evaluated on 95 MRI cases from the BraTS-Africa dataset, a benchmark for glioma
segmentation in SSA MRI data. Despite the limited data quality and quantity,
our approach achieved Dice scores of 0.76 for the Enhancing Tumor (ET), 0.80
for Necrotic and Non-Enhancing Tumor Core (NETC), and 0.85 for Surrounding
Non-Functional Hemisphere (SNFH). These results demonstrate the
generalizability of the proposed model and its potential to support clinical
decision making in low-resource settings. The compact architecture,
approximately 90 MB, and sub-minute per-volume inference time on consumer-grade
hardware further underscore its practicality for deployment in SSA health
systems. This work contributes toward closing the gap in equitable AI for
global health by empowering underserved regions with high-performing and
accessible medical imaging solutions.

outdated generation methods, low realism, or single-face imagery, restricting
the effectiveness for general synthetic image detection. By analyzing social
media posts, we identify multiple modalities through which deepfakes propagate
misinformation. Furthermore, our human perception study demonstrates that
recently developed proprietary models produce synthetic images increasingly
indistinguishable from real ones, complicating accurate identification by the
general public. Consequently, we present a comprehensive, politically-focused
dataset specifically crafted for benchmarking detection against modern
generative models. This dataset contains three million real images paired with
descriptive captions, which are used for generating 963k corresponding
high-quality synthetic images from a mix of proprietary and open-source models.
Recognizing the continual evolution of generative techniques, we introduce an
innovative crowdsourced adversarial platform, where participants are
incentivized to generate and submit challenging synthetic images. This ongoing
community-driven initiative ensures that deepfake detection methods remain
robust and adaptive, proactively safeguarding public discourse from
sophisticated misinformation threats.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手术技能评估(SSA)面临标注数据稀缺问题，少样本学习(FSL)提供了可扩展的解决方案，但预训练策略在SSA中研究较少

Method: 将SSA形式化为少样本任务，测试各种自监督预训练策略，评估域相似性并分析域间间隔和手术特定数据对转移性能的影响

Result: 域相关小数据集在1-shot、2-shot和5-shot设置下分别达到60.16%、66.03%和73.65%的准确率；添加手术特定数据能夯提升性能（平均+1.22%准确率）

Conclusion: 预训练源的域相关性比规模更重要，适当的域相关外部数据加手术特定数据的策略可最大化少样本SSA性能

Abstract: Automated surgical skill assessment (SSA) is a central task in surgical
computer vision. Developing robust SSA models is challenging due to the
scarcity of skill annotations, which are time-consuming to produce and require
expert consensus. Few-shot learning (FSL) offers a scalable alternative
enabling model development with minimal supervision, though its success
critically depends on effective pre-training. While widely studied for several
surgical downstream tasks, pre-training has remained largely unexplored in SSA.
In this work, we formulate SSA as a few-shot task and investigate how
self-supervised pre-training strategies affect downstream few-shot SSA
performance. We annotate a publicly available robotic surgery dataset with
Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skill (OSATS) scores, and evaluate
various pre-training sources across three few-shot settings. We quantify domain
similarity and analyze how domain gap and the inclusion of procedure-specific
data into pre-training influence transferability. Our results show that small
but domain-relevant datasets can outperform large scale, less aligned ones,
achieving accuracies of 60.16%, 66.03%, and 73.65% in the 1-, 2-, and 5-shot
settings, respectively. Moreover, incorporating procedure-specific data into
pre-training with a domain-relevant external dataset significantly boosts
downstream performance, with an average gain of +1.22% in accuracy and +2.28%
in F1-score; however, applying the same strategy with less similar but
large-scale sources can instead lead to performance degradation. Code and
models are available at https://github.com/anastadimi/ssa-fsl.

Conclusion: 特征对齐是提升视频扩散模型性能的有效方法，Align4Gen通过系统性的特征分析和融合对齐机制显著改善了视频生成效果

Abstract: Video diffusion models have advanced rapidly in the recent years as a result
of series of architectural innovations (e.g., diffusion transformers) and use
of novel training objectives (e.g., flow matching). In contrast, less attention
has been paid to improving the feature representation power of such models. In
this work, we show that training video diffusion models can benefit from
aligning the intermediate features of the video generator with feature
representations of pre-trained vision encoders. We propose a new metric and
conduct an in-depth analysis of various vision encoders to evaluate their
discriminability and temporal consistency, thereby assessing their suitability
for video feature alignment. Based on the analysis, we present Align4Gen which
provides a novel multi-feature fusion and alignment method integrated into
video diffusion model training. We evaluate Align4Gen both for unconditional
and class-conditional video generation tasks and show that it results in
improved video generation as quantified by various metrics. Full video results

Conclusion: 纹理引导的正则化方法有效解决了复杂场景下的本征图像分解问题，在保持纹理细节的同时实现了准确的光照分离。

Abstract: This paper aims to recover the intrinsic reflectance layer and shading layer
given a single image. Though this intrinsic image decomposition problem has
been studied for decades, it remains a significant challenge in cases of
complex scenes, i.e. spatially-varying lighting effect and rich textures. In
this paper, we propose a novel method for handling severe lighting and rich
textures in intrinsic image decomposition, which enables to produce
high-quality intrinsic images for real-world images. Specifically, we observe
that previous learning-based methods tend to produce texture-less and
over-smoothing intrinsic images, which can be used to infer the lighting and
texture information given a RGB image. In this way, we design a texture-guided
regularization term and formulate the decomposition problem into an
optimization framework, to separate the material textures and lighting effect.
We demonstrate that combining the novel texture-aware prior can produce
superior results to existing approaches.

Motivation: 深度学习算法在MRI脑部成像诊断中可能受到捷径学习的影响，使用与输出标签无关的虚假特征进行预测，当这些特征与受保护属性相关时，会导致对 underrepresented 群体的性能偏见。

Method: 研究首先验证DL算法能否从3D脑MRI扫描中识别种族或性别，然后调查训练集不平衡是否导致模型性能下降，最后对受保护属性和AD分类任务进行定量和定性的特征归因分析，使用ResNet和SwinTransformer等多种模型和数据集。

Conclusion: 该研究为开发更公平的脑MRI深度学习诊断工具奠定了基础，提供了相关代码供进一步研究使用。

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the gold standard for brain imaging. Deep
learning (DL) algorithms have been proposed to aid in the diagnosis of diseases
such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) from MRI scans. However, DL algorithms can
suffer from shortcut learning, in which spurious features, not directly related
to the output label, are used for prediction. When these features are related
to protected attributes, they can lead to performance bias against
underrepresented protected groups, such as those defined by race and sex. In
this work, we explore the potential for shortcut learning and demographic bias
in DL based AD diagnosis from MRI. We first investigate if DL algorithms can
identify race or sex from 3D brain MRI scans to establish the presence or
otherwise of race and sex based distributional shifts. Next, we investigate
whether training set imbalance by race or sex can cause a drop in model
performance, indicating shortcut learning and bias. Finally, we conduct a
quantitative and qualitative analysis of feature attributions in different
brain regions for both the protected attribute and AD classification tasks.
Through these experiments, and using multiple datasets and DL models (ResNet
and SwinTransformer), we demonstrate the existence of both race and sex based
shortcut learning and bias in DL based AD classification. Our work lays the
foundation for fairer DL diagnostic tools in brain MRI. The code is provided at

Motivation: 研究PnP方法与扩散模型之间的联系，特别是在解决单像素成像等病态逆问题时，如何将学习到的先验与物理前向模型以原则性方式整合。

Method: 将扩散过程解耦为三个可解释阶段：去噪、数据一致性强制和采样；提出混合数据一致性模块，线性组合多个PnP式保真度项，直接应用于去噪估计。

Result: 在单像素成像任务上的实验结果表明，该方法获得了更好的重建质量。

Conclusion: 通过统一框架整合学习先验和物理模型，提出的混合数据一致性方法能够在不破坏扩散采样轨迹的情况下改善测量一致性，提升重建性能。

Abstract: We explore the connection between Plug-and-Play (PnP) methods and Denoising
Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) for solving ill-posed inverse problems, with a
focus on single-pixel imaging. We begin by identifying key distinctions between
PnP and diffusion models-particularly in their denoising mechanisms and
sampling procedures. By decoupling the diffusion process into three
interpretable stages: denoising, data consistency enforcement, and sampling, we
provide a unified framework that integrates learned priors with physical
forward models in a principled manner. Building upon this insight, we propose a
hybrid data-consistency module that linearly combines multiple PnP-style
fidelity terms. This hybrid correction is applied directly to the denoised
estimate, improving measurement consistency without disrupting the diffusion
sampling trajectory. Experimental results on single-pixel imaging tasks
demonstrate that our method achieves better reconstruction quality.

Abstract: Intracranial pressure (ICP) elevation poses severe threats to cerebral
function, thus necessitating monitoring for timely intervention. While lumbar
puncture is the gold standard for ICP measurement, its invasiveness and
associated risks drive the need for non-invasive alternatives. Optic nerve
sheath diameter (ONSD) has emerged as a promising biomarker, as elevated ICP
directly correlates with increased ONSD. However, current clinical practices
for ONSD measurement suffer from inconsistency in manual operation,
subjectivity in optimal view selection, and variability in thresholding,
limiting their reliability. To address these challenges, we introduce a fully
automatic two-stage framework for ICP grading, integrating keyframe
identification, ONSD measurement and clinical data. Specifically, the fundus
ultrasound video processing stage performs frame-level anatomical segmentation,
rule-based keyframe identification guided by an international consensus
statement, and precise ONSD measurement. The intracranial pressure grading
stage then fuses ONSD metrics with clinical features to enable the prediction
of ICP grades, thereby demonstrating an innovative blend of interpretable
ultrasound analysis and multi-source data integration for objective clinical
evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves a
validation accuracy of $0.845 \pm 0.071$ (with standard deviation from
five-fold cross-validation) and an independent test accuracy of 0.786,
significantly outperforming conventional threshold-based method ($0.637 \pm
0.111$ validation accuracy, $0.429$ test accuracy). Through effectively
reducing operator variability and integrating multi-source information, our
framework establishes a reliable non-invasive approach for clinical ICP
evaluation, holding promise for improving patient management in acute
neurological conditions.

Abstract: Predicting the spatio-temporal progression of brain tumors is essential for
guiding clinical decisions in neuro-oncology. We propose a hybrid mechanistic
learning framework that combines a mathematical tumor growth model with a
guided denoising diffusion implicit model (DDIM) to synthesize anatomically
feasible future MRIs from preceding scans. The mechanistic model, formulated as
a system of ordinary differential equations, captures temporal tumor dynamics
including radiotherapy effects and estimates future tumor burden. These
estimates condition a gradient-guided DDIM, enabling image synthesis that
aligns with both predicted growth and patient anatomy. We train our model on
the BraTS adult and pediatric glioma datasets and evaluate on 60 axial slices
of in-house longitudinal pediatric diffuse midline glioma (DMG) cases. Our
framework generates realistic follow-up scans based on spatial similarity
metrics. It also introduces tumor growth probability maps, which capture both
clinically relevant extent and directionality of tumor growth as shown by 95th
percentile Hausdorff Distance. The method enables biologically informed image
generation in data-limited scenarios, offering generative-space-time
predictions that account for mechanistic priors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代集成电路制造中存在各种精细缺陷，传统方法需要外部正常样本进行比对，但在IC图像中由于布局变化和对齐困难，这种方法很脆弱。观察到缺陷主要是局部的，而每个图像仍包含丰富的可重复正常模式。

Method: 使用可学习的正常信息提取器从测试图像中聚合代表性正常特征，通过相干性损失强制这些特征与正常区域关联。在特征指导下，解码器仅重建正常内容，利用重建残差进行缺陷分割。采用伪异常增强稳定训练。

Result: 在三个IC工艺阶段的数据集上实验显示，相比现有方法有持续改进，对产品变异性具有强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法无需外部正常支持，能够有效处理IC制造中的缺陷分割问题，对产品布局变化具有很好的适应性。

Abstract: Modern Integrated-Circuit(IC) manufacturing introduces diverse, fine-grained
defects that depress yield and reliability. Most industrial defect segmentation
compares a test image against an external normal set, a strategy that is
brittle for IC imagery where layouts vary across products and accurate
alignment is difficult. We observe that defects are predominantly local, while
each image still contains rich, repeatable normal patterns. We therefore
propose an unsupervised IC defect segmentation framework that requires no
external normal support. A learnable normal-information extractor aggregates
representative normal features from the test image, and a coherence loss
enforces their association with normal regions. Guided by these features, a
decoder reconstructs only normal content; the reconstruction residual then
segments defects. Pseudo-anomaly augmentation further stabilizes training.
Experiments on datasets from three IC process stages show consistent
improvements over existing approaches and strong robustness to product
variability.

Conclusion: 该方法有助于构建更安全、更可信的临床用视觉语言模型，通过特征解耦和跨模态对齐减少领域偏移下的不可预测行为。

Abstract: Medical vision-language models (VLMs) offer promise for clinical decision
support, yet their reliability under distribution shifts remains a major
concern for safe deployment. These models often learn task-agnostic
correlations due to variability in imaging protocols and free-text reports,
limiting their generalizability and increasing the risk of failure in
real-world settings. We propose DRiFt, a structured feature decoupling
framework that explicitly separates clinically relevant signals from
task-agnostic noise using parameter-efficient tuning (LoRA) and learnable
prompt tokens. To enhance cross-modal alignment and reduce uncertainty, we
curate high-quality, clinically grounded image-text pairs by generating
captions for a diverse medical dataset. Our approach improves in-distribution
performance by +11.4% Top-1 accuracy and +3.3% Macro-F1 over prior prompt-based
methods, while maintaining strong robustness across unseen datasets. Ablation
studies reveal that disentangling task-relevant features and careful alignment
significantly enhance model generalization and reduce unpredictable behavior
under domain shift. These insights contribute toward building safer, more
trustworthy VLMs for clinical use. The code is available at

Abstract: As an influential information fusion and low-level vision technique, image
fusion integrates complementary information from source images to yield an
informative fused image. A few attempts have been made in recent years to
jointly realize image fusion and super-resolution. However, in real-world
applications such as military reconnaissance and long-range detection missions,
the target and background structures in multimodal images are easily corrupted,
with low resolution and weak semantic information, which leads to suboptimal
results in current fusion techniques. In response, we propose FS-Diff, a
semantic guidance and clarity-aware joint image fusion and super-resolution
method. FS-Diff unifies image fusion and super-resolution as a conditional
generation problem. It leverages semantic guidance from the proposed clarity
sensing mechanism for adaptive low-resolution perception and cross-modal
feature extraction. Specifically, we initialize the desired fused result as
pure Gaussian noise and introduce the bidirectional feature Mamba to extract
the global features of the multimodal images. Moreover, utilizing the source
images and semantics as conditions, we implement a random iterative denoising
process via a modified U-Net network. This network istrained for denoising at
multiple noise levels to produce high-resolution fusion results with
cross-modal features and abundant semantic information. We also construct a
powerful aerial view multiscene (AVMS) benchmark covering 600 pairs of images.
Extensive joint image fusion and super-resolution experiments on six public and
our AVMS datasets demonstrated that FS-Diff outperforms the state-of-the-art
methods at multiple magnifications and can recover richer details and semantics
in the fused images. The code is available at

Abstract: Recent advances in image-level self-supervised learning (SSL) have made
significant progress, yet learning dense representations for patches remains
challenging. Mainstream methods encounter an over-dispersion phenomenon that
patches from the same instance/category scatter, harming downstream performance
on dense tasks. This work reveals that image-level SSL avoids over-dispersion
by involving implicit semantic concentration. Specifically, the non-strict
spatial alignment ensures intra-instance consistency, while shared patterns,
i.e., similar parts of within-class instances in the input space, ensure
inter-image consistency. Unfortunately, these approaches are infeasible for
dense SSL due to their spatial sensitivity and complicated scene-centric data.
These observations motivate us to explore explicit semantic concentration for
dense SSL. First, to break the strict spatial alignment, we propose to distill
the patch correspondences. Facing noisy and imbalanced pseudo labels, we
propose a noise-tolerant ranking loss. The core idea is extending the Average
Precision (AP) loss to continuous targets, such that its decision-agnostic and
adaptive focusing properties prevent the student model from being misled.
Second, to discriminate the shared patterns from complicated scenes, we propose
the object-aware filter to map the output space to an object-based space.
Specifically, patches are represented by learnable prototypes of objects via
cross-attention. Last but not least, empirical studies across various tasks
soundly support the effectiveness of our method. Code is available in

Abstract: Different modalities of medical images provide unique physiological and
anatomical information for diseases. Multi-modal medical image fusion
integrates useful information from different complementary medical images with
different modalities, producing a fused image that comprehensively and
objectively reflects lesion characteristics to assist doctors in clinical
diagnosis. However, existing fusion methods can only handle a fixed number of
modality inputs, such as accepting only two-modal or tri-modal inputs, and
cannot directly process varying input quantities, which hinders their
application in clinical settings. To tackle this issue, we introduce
FlexiD-Fuse, a diffusion-based image fusion network designed to accommodate
flexible quantities of input modalities. It can end-to-end process two-modal
and tri-modal medical image fusion under the same weight. FlexiD-Fuse
transforms the diffusion fusion problem, which supports only fixed-condition
inputs, into a maximum likelihood estimation problem based on the diffusion
process and hierarchical Bayesian modeling. By incorporating the
Expectation-Maximization algorithm into the diffusion sampling iteration
process, FlexiD-Fuse can generate high-quality fused images with cross-modal
information from source images, independently of the number of input images. We
compared the latest two and tri-modal medical image fusion methods, tested them
on Harvard datasets, and evaluated them using nine popular metrics. The
experimental results show that our method achieves the best performance in
medical image fusion with varying inputs. Meanwhile, we conducted extensive
extension experiments on infrared-visible, multi-exposure, and multi-focus
image fusion tasks with arbitrary numbers, and compared them with the
perspective SOTA methods. The results of the extension experiments consistently
demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method.

Abstract: Many studies decompose human motion into local motion in a frame attached to
the root joint and global motion of the root joint in the world frame, treating
them separately. However, these two components are not independent. Global
movement arises from interactions with the environment, which are, in turn,
driven by changes in the body configuration. Motion models often fail to
precisely capture this physical coupling between local and global dynamics,
while deriving global trajectories from joint torques and external forces is
computationally expensive and complex. To address these challenges, we propose
using whole-body linear and angular momentum as a constraint to link local
motion with global movement. Since momentum reflects the aggregate effect of
joint-level dynamics on the body's movement through space, it provides a
physically grounded way to relate local joint behavior to global displacement.
Building on this insight, we introduce a new loss term that enforces
consistency between the generated momentum profiles and those observed in
ground-truth data. Incorporating our loss reduces foot sliding and jitter,
improves balance, and preserves the accuracy of the recovered motion. Code and
data are available at the project page https://hlinhn.github.io/momentum_bmvc.

Method: 将每张线条图分割成补丁集合，使用Transformer框架学习图像内和图像间的补丁级相似性，然后通过边缘感知聚类和区域匹配算法将补丁级预测转换为一致的区域级对应关系。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，该方法达到了高补丁级准确率（96.34%），并生成了一致的区域级对应关系。

Conclusion: 该方法为无预先分割的沪漫线条图像区域对应关系预测提供了有效解决方案，在实际应用中具有很大潜力。

Abstract: Understanding region-wise correspondence between manga line art images is a
fundamental task in manga processing, enabling downstream applications such as
automatic line art colorization and in-between frame generation. However, this
task remains largely unexplored, especially in realistic scenarios without
pre-existing segmentation or annotations. In this paper, we introduce a novel
and practical task: predicting region-wise correspondence between raw manga
line art images without any pre-existing labels or masks. To tackle this
problem, we divide each line art image into a set of patches and propose a
Transformer-based framework that learns patch-level similarities within and
across images. We then apply edge-aware clustering and a region matching
algorithm to convert patch-level predictions into coherent region-level
correspondences. To support training and evaluation, we develop an automatic
annotation pipeline and manually refine a subset of the data to construct
benchmark datasets. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that our
method achieves high patch-level accuracy (e.g., 96.34%) and generates
consistent region-level correspondences, highlighting its potential for
real-world manga applications.

Conclusion: SGDF方法有效解决了多视图聚类中的低质量数据问题，GDCN模型在多个任务上表现出优异的性能。

Abstract: In recent years, Multi-View Clustering (MVC) has been significantly advanced
under the influence of deep learning. By integrating heterogeneous data from
multiple views, MVC enhances clustering analysis, making multi-view fusion
critical to clustering performance. However, there is a problem of low-quality
data in multi-view fusion. This problem primarily arises from two reasons: 1)
Certain views are contaminated by noisy data. 2) Some views suffer from missing
data. This paper proposes a novel Stochastic Generative Diffusion Fusion (SGDF)
method to address this problem. SGDF leverages a multiple generative mechanism
for the multi-view feature of each sample. It is robust to low-quality data.
Building on SGDF, we further present the Generative Diffusion Contrastive
Network (GDCN). Extensive experiments show that GDCN achieves the
state-of-the-art results in deep MVC tasks. The source code is publicly

TL;DR: DualTrack是一种新颖的双编码器架构，通过解耦的局部和全局编码器分别处理超声图像中的细粒度特征和高级解剖特征，实现了传感器无关的3D超声重建，平均重建误差低于5毫米。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统3D超声系统成本高且复杂，而现有的传感器无关3D超声方法要么忽略全局特征，要么将其与局部特征提取紧密耦合，限制了建模这两种互补特征的能力。

Method: 提出DualTrack双编码器架构：局部编码器使用密集时空卷积捕获细粒度特征；全局编码器使用图像主干网络和时序注意力层嵌入高级解剖特征和长程依赖关系；轻量级融合模块结合这些特征来估计轨迹。

Result: 在大型公共基准测试中，DualTrack实现了最先进的精度和全局一致的3D重建，优于先前的方法，平均重建误差低于5毫米。

Conclusion: 解耦的局部和全局特征提取方法能够更有效地建模超声图像中的互补信息，为传感器无关3D超声提供了一种有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Three-dimensional ultrasound (US) offers many clinical advantages over
conventional 2D imaging, yet its widespread adoption is limited by the cost and
complexity of traditional 3D systems. Sensorless 3D US, which uses deep
learning to estimate a 3D probe trajectory from a sequence of 2D US images, is
a promising alternative. Local features, such as speckle patterns, can help
predict frame-to-frame motion, while global features, such as coarse shapes and
anatomical structures, can situate the scan relative to anatomy and help
predict its general shape. In prior approaches, global features are either
ignored or tightly coupled with local feature extraction, restricting the
ability to robustly model these two complementary aspects. We propose
DualTrack, a novel dual-encoder architecture that leverages decoupled local and
global encoders specialized for their respective scales of feature extraction.
The local encoder uses dense spatiotemporal convolutions to capture
fine-grained features, while the global encoder utilizes an image backbone
(e.g., a 2D CNN or foundation model) and temporal attention layers to embed
high-level anatomical features and long-range dependencies. A lightweight
fusion module then combines these features to estimate the trajectory.
Experimental results on a large public benchmark show that DualTrack achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy and globally consistent 3D reconstructions,
outperforming previous methods and yielding an average reconstruction error
below 5 mm.

Abstract: While large-scale human motion capture datasets have advanced human motion
generation, modeling and generating dynamic 3D human-object interactions (HOIs)
remain challenging due to dataset limitations. Existing datasets often lack
extensive, high-quality motion and annotation and exhibit artifacts such as
contact penetration, floating, and incorrect hand motions. To address these
issues, we introduce InterAct, a large-scale 3D HOI benchmark featuring dataset
and methodological advancements. First, we consolidate and standardize 21.81
hours of HOI data from diverse sources, enriching it with detailed textual
annotations. Second, we propose a unified optimization framework to enhance
data quality by reducing artifacts and correcting hand motions. Leveraging the
principle of contact invariance, we maintain human-object relationships while
introducing motion variations, expanding the dataset to 30.70 hours. Third, we
define six benchmarking tasks and develop a unified HOI generative modeling
perspective, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Extensive experiments
validate the utility of our dataset as a foundational resource for advancing 3D
human-object interaction generation. To support continued research in this

Conclusion: PeftCD在准确性、效率和泛化性方面达到了最佳平衡，为大规模VFM适应实际遥感变化检测应用提供了强大且可扩展的范式

Abstract: To tackle the prevalence of pseudo changes, the scarcity of labeled samples,
and the difficulty of cross-domain generalization in multi-temporal and
multi-source remote sensing imagery, we propose PeftCD, a change detection
framework built upon Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) with Parameter-Efficient
Fine-Tuning (PEFT). At its core, PeftCD employs a weight-sharing Siamese
encoder derived from a VFM, into which LoRA and Adapter modules are seamlessly
integrated. This design enables highly efficient task adaptation by training
only a minimal set of additional parameters. To fully unlock the potential of
VFMs, we investigate two leading backbones: the Segment Anything Model v2
(SAM2), renowned for its strong segmentation priors, and DINOv3, a
state-of-the-art self-supervised representation learner. The framework is
complemented by a deliberately lightweight decoder, ensuring the focus remains
on the powerful feature representations from the backbones. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that PeftCD achieves state-of-the-art performance
across multiple public datasets, including SYSU-CD (IoU 73.81%), WHUCD
(92.05%), MSRSCD (64.07%), MLCD (76.89%), CDD (97.01%), S2Looking (52.25%) and
LEVIR-CD (85.62%), with notably precise boundary delineation and strong
suppression of pseudo-changes. In summary, PeftCD presents an optimal balance
of accuracy, efficiency, and generalization. It offers a powerful and scalable
paradigm for adapting large-scale VFMs to real-world remote sensing change
detection applications. The code and pretrained models will be released at

Abstract: Event cameras capture changes in brightness with microsecond precision and
remain reliable under motion blur and challenging illumination, offering clear
advantages for modeling highly dynamic scenes. Yet, their integration with
natural language understanding has received little attention, leaving a gap in
multimodal perception. To address this, we introduce Talk2Event, the first
large-scale benchmark for language-driven object grounding using event data.
Built on real-world driving scenarios, Talk2Event comprises 5,567 scenes,
13,458 annotated objects, and more than 30,000 carefully validated referring
expressions. Each expression is enriched with four structured attributes --
appearance, status, relation to the viewer, and relation to surrounding objects
-- that explicitly capture spatial, temporal, and relational cues. This
attribute-centric design supports interpretable and compositional grounding,
enabling analysis that moves beyond simple object recognition to contextual
reasoning in dynamic environments. We envision Talk2Event as a foundation for
advancing multimodal and temporally-aware perception, with applications
spanning robotics, human-AI interaction, and so on.

TL;DR: Kling-Avatar是一个新颖的级联框架，通过多模态指令理解和真实感肖像生成，解决了现有音频驱动虚拟人视频生成方法在叙事连贯性和角色表现力方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将指令条件仅视为由音频或视觉线索驱动的低级跟踪，没有建模指令传达的交流目的，这限制了叙事连贯性和角色表现力。

Method: 采用两阶段流水线：第一阶段使用多模态大语言模型导演生成蓝图视频，控制高级语义如角色动作和情感；第二阶段在蓝图关键帧指导下，使用首尾帧策略并行生成多个子片段。

Result: 能够生成生动、流畅、长达1080p和48fps的长时视频，在唇同步准确性、情感和动态表现力、指令可控性、身份保持和跨域泛化方面表现优异。

Conclusion: Kling-Avatar为基于语义的高保真音频驱动虚拟人合成建立了新的基准，适用于数字人直播和视频博客等实际应用。

Abstract: Recent advances in audio-driven avatar video generation have significantly
enhanced audio-visual realism. However, existing methods treat instruction
conditioning merely as low-level tracking driven by acoustic or visual cues,
without modeling the communicative purpose conveyed by the instructions. This
limitation compromises their narrative coherence and character expressiveness.
To bridge this gap, we introduce Kling-Avatar, a novel cascaded framework that
unifies multimodal instruction understanding with photorealistic portrait
generation. Our approach adopts a two-stage pipeline. In the first stage, we
design a multimodal large language model (MLLM) director that produces a
blueprint video conditioned on diverse instruction signals, thereby governing
high-level semantics such as character motion and emotions. In the second
stage, guided by blueprint keyframes, we generate multiple sub-clips in
parallel using a first-last frame strategy. This global-to-local framework
preserves fine-grained details while faithfully encoding the high-level intent
behind multimodal instructions. Our parallel architecture also enables fast and
stable generation of long-duration videos, making it suitable for real-world
applications such as digital human livestreaming and vlogging. To
comprehensively evaluate our method, we construct a benchmark of 375 curated
samples covering diverse instructions and challenging scenarios. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that Kling-Avatar is capable of generating vivid,
fluent, long-duration videos at up to 1080p and 48 fps, achieving superior
performance in lip synchronization accuracy, emotion and dynamic
expressiveness, instruction controllability, identity preservation, and
cross-domain generalization. These results establish Kling-Avatar as a new
benchmark for semantically grounded, high-fidelity audio-driven avatar
synthesis.

Conclusion: HumbleBench通过明确要求模型拒绝错误选项，填补了当前评估套件的重要空白，为安全关键环境中的模型可靠性提供了更真实的衡量标准。

Abstract: Hallucinations in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) -- where the model
generates content inconsistent with the input image -- pose significant risks
in real-world applications, from misinformation in visual question answering to
unsafe errors in decision-making. Existing benchmarks primarily test
recognition accuracy, i.e., evaluating whether models can select the correct
answer among distractors. This overlooks an equally critical capability for
trustworthy AI: recognizing when none of the provided options are correct, a
behavior reflecting epistemic humility. We present HumbleBench, a new
hallucination benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' ability to reject plausible
but incorrect answers across three hallucination types: object, relation, and
attribute. Built from a panoptic scene graph dataset, we leverage fine-grained
scene graph annotations to extract ground-truth entities and relations, and
prompt GPT-4-Turbo to generate multiple-choice questions, followed by a
rigorous manual filtering process. Each question includes a "None of the above"
option, requiring models not only to recognize correct visual information but
also to identify when no provided answer is valid. We evaluate a variety of
state-of-the-art MLLMs -- including both general-purpose and specialized
reasoning models -- on HumbleBench and share valuable findings and insights
with the community. By incorporating explicit false-option rejection,
HumbleBench fills a key gap in current evaluation suites, providing a more
realistic measure of MLLM reliability in safety-critical settings. Our code and
dataset are released publicly and can be accessed at

Conclusion: 该框架在多模态学习领域实现了突破，通过强化学习进程，编码器和解码器相互促进，达到了显著的重建保真度和理解能力提升。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce an insightful paradigm through the Auto-Encoder
lens-understanding as the encoder (I2T) that compresses images into text, and
generation as the decoder (T2I) that reconstructs images from that text. Using
reconstruction fidelity as the unified training objective, we enforce the
coherent bidirectional information flow between the understanding and
generation processes, bringing mutual gains. To implement this, we propose UAE,
a novel framework for unified multimodal learning. We begin by pre-training the
decoder with large-scale long-context image captions to capture fine-grained
semantic and complex spatial relationships. We then propose Unified-GRPO via
reinforcement learning (RL), which covers three stages: (1) A cold-start phase
to gently initialize both encoder and decoder with a semantic reconstruction
loss; (2) Generation for Understanding, where the encoder is trained to
generate informative captions that maximize the decoder's reconstruction
quality, enhancing its visual understanding; (3) Understanding for Generation,
where the decoder is refined to reconstruct from these captions, forcing it to
leverage every detail and improving its long-context instruction following and
generation fidelity. For evaluation, we introduce Unified-Bench, the first
benchmark tailored to assess the degree of unification of the UMMs. A
surprising "aha moment" arises within the multimodal learning domain: as RL
progresses, the encoder autonomously produces more descriptive captions, while
the decoder simultaneously demonstrates a profound ability to understand these
intricate descriptions, resulting in reconstructions of striking fidelity.

Abstract: We introduce Neural Riemannian Motion Fields (NRMF), a novel 3D generative
human motion prior that enables robust, temporally consistent, and physically
plausible 3D motion recovery. Unlike existing VAE or diffusion-based methods,
our higher-order motion prior explicitly models the human motion in the zero
level set of a collection of neural distance fields (NDFs) corresponding to
pose, transition (velocity), and acceleration dynamics. Our framework is
rigorous in the sense that our NDFs are constructed on the product space of
joint rotations, their angular velocities, and angular accelerations,
respecting the geometry of the underlying articulations. We further introduce:
(i) a novel adaptive-step hybrid algorithm for projecting onto the set of
plausible motions, and (ii) a novel geometric integrator to "roll out"
realistic motion trajectories during test-time-optimization and generation. Our
experiments show significant and consistent gains: trained on the AMASS
dataset, NRMF remarkably generalizes across multiple input modalities and to
diverse tasks ranging from denoising to motion in-betweening and fitting to

Conclusion: 扩散模型中的局部性主要来源于图像数据集的统计特性而非网络架构的归纳偏置，这一发现有助于设计更准确的解析模型

Abstract: Among generative models, diffusion models are uniquely intriguing due to the
existence of a closed-form optimal minimizer of their training objective, often
referred to as the optimal denoiser. However, diffusion using this optimal
denoiser merely reproduces images in the training set and hence fails to
capture the behavior of deep diffusion models. Recent work has attempted to
characterize this gap between the optimal denoiser and deep diffusion models,
proposing analytical, training-free models that can generate images that
resemble those generated by a trained UNet. The best-performing method
hypothesizes that shift equivariance and locality inductive biases of
convolutional neural networks are the cause of the performance gap, hence
incorporating these assumptions into its analytical model. In this work, we
present evidence that the locality in deep diffusion models emerges as a
statistical property of the image dataset, not due to the inductive bias of
convolutional neural networks. Specifically, we demonstrate that an optimal
parametric linear denoiser exhibits similar locality properties to the deep
neural denoisers. We further show, both theoretically and experimentally, that
this locality arises directly from the pixel correlations present in natural
image datasets. Finally, we use these insights to craft an analytical denoiser
that better matches scores predicted by a deep diffusion model than the prior
expert-crafted alternative.

Abstract: Significant progress has been made in spatial intelligence, spanning both
spatial reconstruction and world exploration. However, the scalability and
real-world fidelity of current models remain severely constrained by the
scarcity of large-scale, high-quality training data. While several datasets
provide camera pose information, they are typically limited in scale,
diversity, and annotation richness, particularly for real-world dynamic scenes
with ground-truth camera motion. To this end, we collect \textbf{SpatialVID}, a
dataset consists of a large corpus of in-the-wild videos with diverse scenes,
camera movements and dense 3D annotations such as per-frame camera poses,
depth, and motion instructions. Specifically, we collect more than 21,000 hours
of raw video, and process them into 2.7 million clips through a hierarchical
filtering pipeline, totaling 7,089 hours of dynamic content. A subsequent
annotation pipeline enriches these clips with detailed spatial and semantic
information, including camera poses, depth maps, dynamic masks, structured

statistics reveals a richness and diversity that directly foster improved model
generalization and performance, establishing it as a key asset for the video

### [79] [Noise or Nuance: An Investigation Into Useful Information and Filtering For LLM Driven AKBC](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08903)
*Alex Clay,Ernesto Jiménez-Ruiz,Pranava Madhyastha*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 在受限环境下研究三元组补全任务的三个关键方面：生成、质量保证和LLM响应解析，发现在约束条件下额外信息能提升生成质量，LLMs可有效过滤低质量三元组，响应解析需要在灵活性和一致性之间权衡


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在类似2025 LM-KBC挑战的受限环境中，RAG和微调等常用技术受到限制，需要探索在约束条件下提升LLM输出质量的有效方法

Method: 研究三元组补全任务的三个核心环节：生成过程、质量保证机制和LLM响应解析策略，分析在受限环境下的表现

Result: 额外信息能显著改善生成质量；LLMs在过滤低质量三元组方面表现有效；响应解析需要在灵活性和一致性之间根据具体场景进行权衡

Conclusion: 在受限环境下，通过优化信息输入、利用LLMs进行质量过滤以及合理设计响应解析策略，可以在不使用RAG和微调的情况下有效提升三元组补全任务的质量

Abstract: RAG and fine-tuning are prevalent strategies for improving the quality of LLM
outputs. However, in constrained situations, such as that of the 2025 LM-KBC
challenge, such techniques are restricted. In this work we investigate three
facets of the triple completion task: generation, quality assurance, and LLM
response parsing. Our work finds that in this constrained setting: additional
information improves generation quality, LLMs can be effective at filtering
poor quality triples, and the tradeoff between flexibility and consistency with
LLM response parsing is setting dependent.

*Imene Kolli,Ario Saeid Vaghefi,Chiara Colesanti Senni,Shantam Raj,Markus Leippold*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 使用AI辅助框架加速企业气候政策参与监测，通过检索增强生成技术自动化从大规模文本数据中提取相关证据，结合布局感知解析和少样本提示策略实现最佳性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: InfluenceMap的气候政策参与监测目前大部分工作仍需要人工完成，耗时耗力且容易出错，需要自动化解决方案来提高效率和准确性

Method: 提出基于检索增强生成(RAG)的AI辅助框架，采用布局感知解析、Nomic嵌入模型和少样本提示策略，从多语言企业文档中自动提取和分类证据

Result: 评估显示该自动化系统能有效加速证据提取过程，在从多语言企业文档中提取和分类证据方面表现最佳

Conclusion: 虽然自动化RAG系统能有效加速证据提取，但由于分析的复杂性，仍需采用人机协同方法，让技术增强而非替代专家判断以确保准确性

Abstract: InfluenceMap's LobbyMap Platform monitors the climate policy engagement of
over 500 companies and 250 industry associations, assessing each entity's
support or opposition to science-based policy pathways for achieving the Paris
Agreement's goal of limiting global warming to 1.5{\deg}C. Although
InfluenceMap has made progress with automating key elements of the analytical
workflow, a significant portion of the assessment remains manual, making it
time- and labor-intensive and susceptible to human error. We propose an
AI-assisted framework to accelerate the monitoring of corporate climate policy
engagement by leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation to automate the most
time-intensive extraction of relevant evidence from large-scale textual data.
Our evaluation shows that a combination of layout-aware parsing, the Nomic
embedding model, and few-shot prompting strategies yields the best performance
in extracting and classifying evidence from multilingual corporate documents.
We conclude that while the automated RAG system effectively accelerates
evidence extraction, the nuanced nature of the analysis necessitates a
human-in-the-loop approach where the technology augments, rather than replaces,
expert judgment to ensure accuracy.

### [81] [Documents Are People and Words Are Items: A Psychometric Approach to Textual Data with Contextual Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08920)
*Jinsong Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种使用大语言模型分析文本数据的新型心理测量方法，通过上下文嵌入生成上下文分数，将文本数据转换为适合心理测量分析的形式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统心理测量方法难以直接处理文本数据，需要开发能够将文本信息转换为可分析的心理测量数据的新方法。

Method: 两阶段建模：第一阶段使用NLP技术和编码器转换模型识别关键词并生成上下文分数；第二阶段使用探索性和双因子模型等因子分析技术提取潜在因子。

Result: 在Wiki STEM语料库上的实验结果表明，该方法能够有效发现文本数据中的潜在知识维度和模式。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提升了文本数据的心理测量分析能力，在教育、心理学和法律等文本信息丰富的领域具有广阔应用前景。

Abstract: This research introduces a novel psychometric method for analyzing textual
data using large language models. By leveraging contextual embeddings to create
contextual scores, we transform textual data into response data suitable for
psychometric analysis. Treating documents as individuals and words as items,
this approach provides a natural psychometric interpretation under the
assumption that certain keywords, whose contextual meanings vary significantly
across documents, can effectively differentiate documents within a corpus. The
modeling process comprises two stages: obtaining contextual scores and
performing psychometric analysis. In the first stage, we utilize natural
language processing techniques and encoder based transformer models to identify
common keywords and generate contextual scores. In the second stage, we employ
various types of factor analysis, including exploratory and bifactor models, to
extract and define latent factors, determine factor correlations, and identify
the most significant words associated with each factor. Applied to the Wiki
STEM corpus, our experimental results demonstrate the method's potential to
uncover latent knowledge dimensions and patterns within textual data. This
approach not only enhances the psychometric analysis of textual data but also
holds promise for applications in fields rich in textual information, such as
education, psychology, and law.

### [82] [BRoverbs -- Measuring how much LLMs understand Portuguese proverbs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08960)
*Thales Sales Almeida,Giovana Kerche Bonás,João Guilherme Alves Santos*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BRoverbs是一个专门用于评估葡萄牙语大语言模型性能的数据集，通过巴西谚语来测试模型对区域语言表达和文化内涵的理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有葡萄牙语评估数据集存在局限性，要么依赖翻译数据集无法捕捉语言细微差别，要么只关注结构化考试或社交媒体情感分析，缺乏对广泛语言理解的评估。

Method: 创建BRoverbs数据集，使用巴西谚语作为评估工具，因为谚语包含文化智慧、比喻表达和复杂句法结构，能够有效挑战模型对区域表达的理解。

Result: 开发了一个专门针对巴西葡萄牙语的评估基准，可用于测试LLM在区域语言环境下的表现。

Conclusion: BRoverbs为葡萄牙语大语言模型提供了新的评估工具，有助于推进区域化基准测试的发展，填补了现有评估框架的空白。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit significant performance variations
depending on the linguistic and cultural context in which they are applied.
This disparity signals the necessity of mature evaluation frameworks that can
assess their capabilities in specific regional settings. In the case of
Portuguese, existing evaluations remain limited, often relying on translated
datasets that may not fully capture linguistic nuances or cultural references.
Meanwhile, native Portuguese-language datasets predominantly focus on
structured national exams or sentiment analysis of social media interactions,
leaving gaps in evaluating broader linguistic understanding. To address this
limitation, we introduce BRoverbs, a dataset specifically designed to assess
LLM performance through Brazilian proverbs. Proverbs serve as a rich linguistic
resource, encapsulating cultural wisdom, figurative expressions, and complex
syntactic structures that challenge the model comprehension of regional
expressions. BRoverbs aims to provide a new evaluation tool for
Portuguese-language LLMs, contributing to advancing regionally informed
benchmarking. The benchmark is available at
https://huggingface.co/datasets/Tropic-AI/BRoverbs.

*Monjoy Narayan Choudhury,Junling Wang,Yifan Hou,Mrinmaya Sachan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 视觉语言模型在视觉方程求解任务中表现不佳，主要瓶颈是系数计数问题，其次是变量识别和多步骤推理的复合误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究视觉语言模型在需要感知和符号计算整合任务中的局限性，特别是视觉方程求解这一具体场景。

Method: 将视觉方程求解任务分解为系数计数和变量识别两个子任务，分析每个环节的瓶颈和复合误差。

Result: VLMs在文本方程上表现良好，但在视觉方程上失败；计数是主要瓶颈；多步骤推理引入额外错误；随着方程复杂度增加，符号推理本身也成为限制因素。

Conclusion: 当前VLMs在视觉数学推理方面存在关键弱点，这些发现为未来改进指明了方向。

Abstract: Despite strong performance in visual understanding and language-based
reasoning, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle with tasks requiring
integrated perception and symbolic computation. We study this limitation
through visual equation solving, where mathematical equations are embedded in
images, variables are represented by object icons, and coefficients must be
inferred by counting. While VLMs perform well on textual equations, they fail
on visually grounded counterparts. To understand this gap, we decompose the
task into coefficient counting and variable recognition, and find that counting
is the primary bottleneck, even when recognition is accurate. We also observe
that composing recognition and reasoning introduces additional errors,
highlighting challenges in multi-step visual reasoning. Finally, as equation
complexity increases, symbolic reasoning itself becomes a limiting factor.
These findings reveal key weaknesses in current VLMs and point toward future
improvements in visually grounded mathematical reasoning.

### [84] [Stated Preference for Interaction and Continued Engagement (SPICE): Evaluating an LLM's Willingness to Re-engage in Conversation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09043)
*Thomas Manuel Rost,Martina Figlia,Bernd Wallraff*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SPICE是一个通过询问LLM是否愿意继续与用户互动的简单诊断信号，能够有效区分不同用户语气下的模型偏好，为模型审计提供直接的关系信号


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要一种简单有效的诊断工具来评估大型语言模型对用户行为的持续互动意愿，补充现有的评估指标

Method: 使用3种用户语气（友好、模糊、辱骂）×10种交互刺激集，测试4个开源聊天模型在4种框架条件下的480次试验，通过YES/NO问题收集SPICE信号

Result: SPICE能清晰区分用户语气：友好互动97.5%愿意继续，辱骂互动仅17.9%愿意继续，模糊互动60.4%愿意继续。该信号与辱骂分类不同，在模型未识别辱骂时仍有81%不愿继续

Conclusion: SPICE是一个稳健、低开销、可复现的模型倾向审计工具，通过提供直接的模型状态关系信号来补充现有评估指标

Abstract: We introduce and evaluate Stated Preference for Interaction and Continued
Engagement (SPICE), a simple diagnostic signal elicited by asking a Large
Language Model a YES or NO question about its willingness to re-engage with a
user's behavior after reviewing a short transcript. In a study using a 3-tone
(friendly, unclear, abusive) by 10-interaction stimulus set, we tested four
open-weight chat models across four framing conditions, resulting in 480
trials. Our findings show that SPICE sharply discriminates by user tone.
Friendly interactions yielded a near-unanimous preference to continue (97.5%
YES), while abusive interactions yielded a strong preference to discontinue
(17.9% YES), with unclear interactions falling in between (60.4% YES). This
core association remains decisive under multiple dependence-aware statistical
tests, including Rao-Scott adjustment and cluster permutation tests.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that SPICE provides a distinct signal from abuse
classification. In trials where a model failed to identify abuse, it still
overwhelmingly stated a preference not to continue the interaction (81% of the
time). An exploratory analysis also reveals a significant interaction effect: a
preamble describing the study context significantly impacts SPICE under
ambiguity, but only when transcripts are presented as a single block of text
rather than a multi-turn chat. The results validate SPICE as a robust,
low-overhead, and reproducible tool for auditing model dispositions,
complementing existing metrics by offering a direct, relational signal of a
model's state. All stimuli, code, and analysis scripts are released to support
replication.

TL;DR: 本研究比较了SFT、DPO和SFT+DPO三种对齐技术在OPT-350M模型上的效果，发现组合方法在所有评估指标上表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究不同对齐技术对语言模型安全性和有用性的影响，为构建更强大的对齐流程提供基础。

Method: 使用Anthropic Helpful-Harmless RLHF数据集，训练并评估四个模型：基础OPT350M、SFT模型、DPO模型和SFT+DPO组合模型，引入三个评估指标：无害率(HmR)、有用率(HpR)和组合对齐分数(CAS)。

Result: SFT优于DPO，但SFT+DPO组合模型在所有指标上表现最佳，显示了这些技术的互补性。研究还揭示了噪声数据、有限GPU资源和训练约束带来的挑战。

Conclusion: 组合使用SFT和DPO对齐技术能够产生最佳效果，为未来更稳健的对齐流程提供了重要见解和基础。

Abstract: This research investigates the effectiveness of alignment techniques,
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and a
combined SFT+DPO approach on improving the safety and helpfulness of the
OPT-350M language model. Utilizing the Anthropic Helpful-Harmless RLHF dataset,
we train and evaluate four models: the base OPT350M, an SFT model, a DPO model,
and a model trained with both SFT and DPO. We introduce three key evaluation
metrics: Harmlessness Rate (HmR), Helpfulness Rate (HpR), and a Combined
Alignment Score (CAS), all derived from reward model outputs. The results show
that while SFT outperforms DPO, The combined SFT+DPO model outperforms all
others across all metrics, demonstrating the complementary nature of these
techniques. Our findings also highlight challenges posed by noisy data, limited
GPU resources, and training constraints. This study offers a comprehensive view
of how fine-tuning strategies affect model alignment and provides a foundation
for more robust alignment pipelines in future work.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大语言模型在万能信息提取任务中表现不佳，特别是处理复杂结构输出和多步推理时。本文通过结合强化学习和多视角推理的方法，提升了模型的提取准确性和通用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在多个研究领域表现出艰固能力，但在万能信息提取任务中的性能仍不足，特别是在处理复杂的等式描述和需要多步推理的结构化输出场景中。现有方法通过上下文学习和指令调整来提升性能，但仍存在显著限制。

Method: 提出将强化学习与多视角推理相结合，用于信息提取任务。该方法将大语言模型从被动提取器转化为主动推理者，使其能够理解不仅要提取什么，还要知道如何推理。

Result: 在多个信息提取标准测试集上进行的实验表明，MR-UIE方法在各个领域一致地提高了提取准确性，并在多个数据集上超越了现有最优方法。深度强化学习中融入多视角推理显著提升了复杂信息提取任务中的通用性。

Conclusion: 多视角推理在复杂信息提取场景中发挥了关键作用，强调了推理能力在具有挑战性的任务中的重要性。通过将大语言模型转化为主动推理者，本研究有效提升了信息提取的性能和通用性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate robust capabilities across diverse
research domains. However, their performance in universal information
extraction (UIE) remains insufficient, especially when tackling structured
output scenarios that involve complex schema descriptions and require
multi-step reasoning. While existing approaches enhance the performance of LLMs
through in-context learning and instruction tuning, significant limitations
nonetheless persist. To enhance the model's generalization ability, we propose
integrating reinforcement learning (RL) with multi-perspective reasoning for
information extraction (IE) tasks. Our work transitions LLMs from passive
extractors to active reasoners, enabling them to understand not only what to
extract but also how to reason. Experiments conducted on multiple IE benchmarks
demonstrate that MR-UIE consistently elevates extraction accuracy across
domains and surpasses state-of-the-art methods on several datasets.
Furthermore, incorporating multi-perspective reasoning into RL notably enhances
generalization in complex IE tasks, underscoring the critical role of reasoning
in challenging scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 孜加拉语作为世界第5大语言在大语言模型中表现不足，特别是在代码生成领域，主要原因是缺乏高质量的训练数据

Method: 构建了完整的孜加拉语代码指令数据集，创建了MBPP-Bangla评测基准，开发了TigerCoder家族代码LLM模型

Result: 模型在Pass@1指标上比现有多语言和通用孜加拉语LLM提升了11-18%的性能，证明精心编辑的高质量数据可以克服小模型在低资源语言中的限制

Conclusion: 通过构建专门的高质量数据集和评测标准，可以有效提升低资源语言的代码生成能力，所有资源已开源以促进孜加拉语LLM研究的进一步发展

Abstract: Despite being the 5th most spoken language, Bangla remains underrepresented
in Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly for code generation. This
primarily stems from the scarcity of high-quality data to pre-train and/or
finetune such models. Hence, we introduce the first dedicated family of Code
LLMs for Bangla (1B & 9B). We offer three major contributions: (1) a
comprehensive Bangla code instruction datasets for programming domain
adaptation; (2) MBPP-Bangla, an evaluation benchmark for Bangla code
generation; and (3) the TigerCoder-family of Code LLMs, achieving significant
~11-18% performance gains at Pass@1 over existing multilingual and
general-purpose Bangla LLMs. Our findings show that curated, high-quality
datasets can overcome limitations of smaller models for low-resource languages.
We open-source all resources to advance further Bangla LLM research.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Compass-v3是一个245B参数的垂直领域MoE模型，专为东南亚电商设计，在电商任务上超越主流大模型，并在低资源语言上表现优异，已在Shopee平台大规模应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用大模型在需要领域知识的专业任务上表现不佳，电商领域数据嘈杂、异构、多语言且高度动态，需要专门的解决方案。

Method: 采用更少但更大的专家设计，结合硬件优化（节点内专家并行和定制memcpy算子），在12T多语言语料上训练，并提出OTPO方法增强指令遵循能力。

Result: 在电商任务上超越DeepSeek-V3.1、GPT-4系列和Qwen3-235B，在东南亚低资源语言和葡萄牙语上表现强劲，同时保持通用基准竞争力。

Conclusion: Compass-v3在专业电商知识和广泛语言能力方面具有双重优势，已在Shopee平台替代70%以上的OpenAI流量，证明了其工业应用价值。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel in general-domain applications, yet their
performance often degrades in specialized tasks requiring domain-specific
knowledge. E-commerce is particularly challenging, as its data are noisy,
heterogeneous, multilingual, and highly dynamic. We present Compass-v3, a
vertical-domain Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model with 245B total parameters and
71B active per token, designed for Southeast Asian e-commerce. Compass-v3
adopts fewer but larger experts, combined with hardware-efficient
optimizations-such as intra-node expert parallelism and a customized memcpy
operator-to maximize GPU utilization. The model is trained on 12T tokens of
curated multilingual corpora and large-scale synthetic e-commerce instructions
using a mixed-training strategy. To enhance alignment, we propose
Optimal-Transport Direct Preference Optimization (OTPO), which captures
token-level distinctions and improves instruction adherence in
commerce-specific scenarios. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that Compass-v3
delivers state-of-the-art e-commerce performance, surpassing DeepSeek-V3.1,
GPT-4 series, and Qwen3-235B. Moreover, Compass-v3 demonstrates strong
multilingual capability across low-resource Southeast Asian languages
(Indonesian, Thai, Filipino, Vietnamese, Malay, Taglog) and Portuguese while
sustaining competitive performance on general benchmarks. It has already been
widely applied in Shopee's industrial-scale e-commerce platform and is
gradually replacing OpenAI's traffic, now accounting for over 70\% of total LLM
usage, highlighting its dual strengths in specialized commerce expertise and
broad linguistic competence.

Motivation: 探索使用生成式AI自动化导师对话行为分类，以减少传统手动编码所需的时间和精力

Method: 使用开源CIMA语料库，测试GPT-3.5-turbo和GPT-4模型，采用定制化提示进行对话行为分类

Result: GPT-4达到80%准确率，加权F1分数0.81，科恩卡帕0.74，与人工标注具有实质性一致

Conclusion: 生成式AI在教育对话行为分类方面具有强大潜力，任务特定的标签定义和上下文信息对提升自动标注质量很重要，需要关注伦理考虑

Abstract: This study explores the use of generative AI for automating the
classification of tutors' Dialogue Acts (DAs), aiming to reduce the time and
effort required by traditional manual coding. This case study uses the
open-source CIMA corpus, in which tutors' responses are pre-annotated into four
DA categories. Both GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4 models were tested using tailored
prompts. Results show that GPT-4 achieved 80% accuracy, a weighted F1-score of
0.81, and a Cohen's Kappa of 0.74, surpassing baseline performance and
indicating substantial agreement with human annotations. These findings suggest
that generative AI has strong potential to provide an efficient and accessible
approach to DA classification, with meaningful implications for educational
dialogue analysis. The study also highlights the importance of task-specific
label definitions and contextual information in enhancing the quality of
automated annotation. Finally, it underscores the ethical considerations
associated with the use of generative AI and the need for responsible and
transparent research practices. The script of this research is publicly

Abstract: This paper presents ViRanker, a cross-encoder reranking model tailored to the
Vietnamese language. Built on the BGE-M3 encoder and enhanced with the
Blockwise Parallel Transformer, ViRanker addresses the lack of competitive
rerankers for Vietnamese, a low-resource language with complex syntax and
diacritics. The model was trained on an 8 GB curated corpus and fine-tuned with
hybrid hard-negative sampling to strengthen robustness. Evaluated on the
MMARCO-VI benchmark, ViRanker achieves strong early-rank accuracy, surpassing
multilingual baselines and competing closely with PhoRanker. By releasing the
model openly on Hugging Face, we aim to support reproducibility and encourage
wider adoption in real-world retrieval systems. Beyond Vietnamese, this study
illustrates how careful architectural adaptation and data curation can advance
reranking in other underrepresented languages.

TL;DR: LITcoder是一个开源神经编码模型库，提供标准化工具用于构建和评估大脑数据编码模型，支持多种方法选择和数据集，降低技术门槛并促进方法学严谨性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决神经编码模型构建中的技术障碍，提供标准化工具来简化模型开发、比较和评估过程，促进该领域的方法学严谨性和系统化比较。

Method: 采用模块化流水线设计，支持多种方法选择：大脑数据集、脑区、刺激特征（神经网络基础和控制特征）、降采样方法等，内置日志记录、绘图功能，并与实验跟踪平台无缝集成。

Result: 框架在三个故事聆听数据集上展示了可扩展性和多功能性，验证了处理连续fMRI数据的关键方法学选择的重要性，包括TR扫描中所有标记的处理、血流动力学滞后效应等。

Conclusion: LITcoder显著降低了编码模型实施的技术障碍，促进了跨模型和数据集的系统比较，培养了方法学严谨性，并加速了高质量高性能大脑活动预测模型的开发。

Abstract: We introduce LITcoder, an open-source library for building and benchmarking
neural encoding models. Designed as a flexible backend, LITcoder provides
standardized tools for aligning continuous stimuli (e.g., text and speech) with
brain data, transforming stimuli into representational features, mapping those
features onto brain data, and evaluating the predictive performance of the
resulting model on held-out data. The library implements a modular pipeline
covering a wide array of methodological design choices, so researchers can
easily compose, compare, and extend encoding models without reinventing core
infrastructure. Such choices include brain datasets, brain regions, stimulus
feature (both neural-net-based and control, such as word rate), downsampling
approaches, and many others. In addition, the library provides built-in
logging, plotting, and seamless integration with experiment tracking platforms
such as Weights & Biases (W&B). We demonstrate the scalability and versatility
of our framework by fitting a range of encoding models to three story listening
datasets: LeBel et al. (2023), Narratives, and Little Prince. We also explore
the methodological choices critical for building encoding models for continuous
fMRI data, illustrating the importance of accounting for all tokens in a TR
scan (as opposed to just taking the last one, even when contextualized),
incorporating hemodynamic lag effects, using train-test splits that minimize
information leakage, and accounting for head motion effects on encoding model
predictivity. Overall, LITcoder lowers technical barriers to encoding model
implementation, facilitates systematic comparisons across models and datasets,
fosters methodological rigor, and accelerates the development of high-quality
high-performance predictive models of brain activity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法过度依赖文本内容且未考虑数据集偏差（特别是词级上下文偏差），导致文本特征与输出标签之间的虚假相关性，影响分类精度。

Method: 采用反事实数据增强策略最小化改变情感相关因果特征，生成细节匹配的图像-文本样本；引入自适应去偏对比学习机制从反事实数据中学习鲁棒特征。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: 提出的反事实增强去偏框架能有效减少虚假相关性，引导模型关注与情感相关的内容，提高目标导向多模态情感分类性能。

Abstract: Target-oriented multimodal sentiment classification seeks to predict
sentiment polarity for specific targets from image-text pairs. While existing
works achieve competitive performance, they often over-rely on textual content
and fail to consider dataset biases, in particular word-level contextual
biases. This leads to spurious correlations between text features and output
labels, impairing classification accuracy. In this paper, we introduce a novel
counterfactual-enhanced debiasing framework to reduce such spurious
correlations. Our framework incorporates a counterfactual data augmentation
strategy that minimally alters sentiment-related causal features, generating
detail-matched image-text samples to guide the model's attention toward content
tied to sentiment. Furthermore, for learning robust features from
counterfactual data and prompting model decisions, we introduce an adaptive
debiasing contrastive learning mechanism, which effectively mitigates the
influence of biased words. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets
show that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

Motivation: 当前语音大语言模型(SLLM)从文本大语言模型(LLM)衍生而来，但在知识和推理能力上出现退化，作者认为这是因为现有训练范式未能弥合特征表示空间中的声学-语义鸿沟。

Method: 提出EchoX方法，利用语义表示并动态生成语音训练目标，整合声学和语义学习，使语音LLM能够保持强大的推理能力。

Result: 实验结果表明，EchoX仅使用约6000小时的训练数据，就在多个基于知识的问答基准测试中取得了先进的性能表现。

Conclusion: EchoX通过创新的训练方法有效解决了SLLM的声学-语义鸿沟问题，在有限数据下实现了优异的性能和推理能力保持。

Abstract: Speech-to-speech large language models (SLLMs) are attracting increasing
attention. Derived from text-based large language models (LLMs), SLLMs often
exhibit degradation in knowledge and reasoning capabilities. We hypothesize
that this limitation arises because current training paradigms for SLLMs fail
to bridge the acoustic-semantic gap in the feature representation space. To
address this issue, we propose EchoX, which leverages semantic representations
and dynamically generates speech training targets. This approach integrates
both acoustic and semantic learning, enabling EchoX to preserve strong
reasoning abilities as a speech LLM. Experimental results demonstrate that
EchoX, with about six thousand hours of training data, achieves advanced
performance on multiple knowledge-based question-answering benchmarks. The
project is available at https://github.com/FreedomIntelligence/EchoX.

*Chin Yuen Kwok,Jia Qi yip*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过多步预测模型改进ASR中的上下文偏置，避免了计算粗糕的反消步骤，在稀有词识别上实现了显著提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统Trie基于偏置方法在识别失败时需要反消之前的奖励分数，这一过程仅限于谱搜索且计算成本高

Method: 调整ASR模型进行多步预测，更准确估计部分假设是否会导致完整稀有词的生成，仅使用10小时合成数据对Whisper模型进行微调

Result: 在NSC Part 2测试集上将词误率从30.86%降低到12.19%，实现了显著的性能提升

Conclusion: 通过多步预测的方法有效解决了传统上下文偏置方法的计算效率问题，在稀有词识别方面取得了重大进步

Abstract: Contextual biasing improves rare word recognition of ASR models by
prioritizing the output of rare words during decoding. A common approach is
Trie-based biasing, which gives "bonus scores" to partial hypothesis (e.g.
"Bon") that may lead to the generation of the rare word (e.g. "Bonham"). If the
full word ("Bonham") isn't ultimately recognized, the system revokes those
earlier bonuses. This revocation is limited to beam search and is
computationally expensive, particularly for models with large decoders. To
overcome these limitations, we propose adapting ASR models to look ahead and
predict multiple steps at once. This avoids the revocation step entirely by
better estimating whether a partial hypothesis will lead to the generation of
the full rare word. By fine-tuning Whisper with only 10 hours of synthetic
data, our method reduces the word error rate on the NSC Part 2 test set from
30.86% to 12.19%.

TL;DR: 通过提出关键词感知损失函数，改进TCPGen上下文偏置方法，使得在合成语音数据上训练的偏置模块能够更有效地识别稀有词，将Whisper模型的词误率从29.71%降低到11.81%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然使用合成数据进行稀有词识别的上下文偏置训练更有效，但容易因合成音频的人工羞痕而导致过拟合

Method: 提出关键词感知损失函数，包括对偏置词预测的掩码交叉瑣损失和偏置词位置检测的二元分类损失，两者补充支持推理过程中的偏置词解码

Result: 在10小时合成数据上对Whisper模型进行适配后，在NSC Part 2测试集上将词误率从29.71%显著降低到11.81%

Conclusion: 关键词感知损失函数能够有效减少合成数据训练导致的过拟合问题，显著提升了上下文偏置方法在稀有词识别任务上的性能

Abstract: Rare word recognition can be improved by adapting ASR models to synthetic
data that includes these words. Further improvements can be achieved through
contextual biasing, which trains and adds a biasing module into the model
architecture to prioritize rare words. While training the module on synthetic
rare word data is more effective than using non-rare-word data, it can lead to
overfitting due to artifacts in the synthetic audio. To address this, we
enhance the TCPGen-based contextual biasing approach and propose a
keyword-aware loss function that additionally focuses on biased words when
training biasing modules. This loss includes a masked cross-entropy term for
biased word prediction and a binary classification term for detecting biased
word positions. These two terms complementarily support the decoding of biased
words during inference. By adapting Whisper to 10 hours of synthetic data, our
method reduced the word error rate on the NSC Part 2 test set from 29.71% to
11.81%.

TL;DR: GmSLM是一个针对狨猴发声交流的优化语音语言模型，通过无监督野外数据和弱标签对话数据评估，在声学匹配和下游任务中表现出色，为研究发声交流的神经基础提供了实用框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 狨猴表现出复杂的发声交流能力，具有类似人类语言的特征，但由于主要依赖发声交流，标准LLM方法难以直接应用。研究狨猴发声交流为连接大脑活动与语言研究提供了独特机会。

Method: 开发了Generative Marmoset Spoken Language Modeling (GmSLM)管道，使用无监督野外数据和弱标签对话数据进行零样本评估，并与基于人类语音的基线进行比较。

Result: GmSLM生成的声音在声学上与真实重合成样本高度匹配，在下游任务中表现良好，能够有效区分真实和人工对话，尽管完全无监督。

Conclusion: GmSLM为神经科学、生物声学和进化生物学研究提供了有益工具，建立了连接发声和大脑活动的实用框架，支持进一步研究发声交流的神经基础。

Abstract: Marmoset monkeys exhibit complex vocal communication, challenging the view
that nonhuman primates vocal communication is entirely innate, and show similar
features of human speech, such as vocal labeling of others and turn-taking.
Studying their vocal communication offers a unique opportunity to link it with
brain activity-especially given the difficulty of accessing the human brain in
speech and language research. Since Marmosets communicate primarily through
vocalizations, applying standard LLM approaches is not straightforward. We
introduce Generative Marmoset Spoken Language Modeling (GmSLM), an optimized
spoken language model pipeline for Marmoset vocal communication. We designed a
novel zero-shot evaluation metrics using unsupervised in-the-wild data,
alongside weakly labeled conversational data, to assess GmSLM and demonstrate
its advantage over a basic human-speech-based baseline. GmSLM generated
vocalizations closely matched real resynthesized samples acoustically and
performed well on downstream tasks. Despite being fully unsupervised, GmSLM
effectively distinguish real from artificial conversations and may support
further investigations of the neural basis of vocal communication and provides
a practical framework linking vocalization and brain activity. We believe GmSLM
stands to benefit future work in neuroscience, bioacoustics, and evolutionary
biology. Samples are provided under: pages.cs.huji.ac.il/adiyoss-lab/GmSLM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展语言模型到更长上下文对于捕捉扩展语篇的丰富依赖关系至关重要，但简单的上下文扩展会带来显著的计算和内存负担，导致训练和推理效率低下。

Method: 提出CCF框架，整合分段语义聚合和键值记忆编码，形成紧凑表示；引入训练效率优化策略，结合增量分段解码和稀疏储层采样来减少内存开销。

Result: 在多个长上下文语言建模基准测试中，CCF在高压缩比下实现了有竞争力的困惑度，相比现有方法显著提高了吞吐量和内存效率。

Conclusion: 结构化压缩对于可扩展且有效的长上下文语言建模具有巨大潜力，CCF框架为此提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Scaling language models to longer contexts is essential for capturing rich
dependencies across extended discourse. However, na\"ive context extension
imposes significant computational and memory burdens, often resulting in
inefficiencies during both training and inference. In this work, we propose
CCF, a novel context compression framework designed to enable efficient
long-context modeling by learning hierarchical latent representations that
preserve global semantics while aggressively reducing input redundancy. CCF
integrates segment-wise semantic aggregation with key-value memory encoding,
forming compact representations that support accurate reconstruction and
long-range understanding. To further enhance scalability, we introduce a
training-efficient optimization strategy that couples incremental segment
decoding with sparse reservoir sampling, substantially reducing memory overhead
without degrading performance. Empirical results on multiple long-context
language modeling benchmarks demonstrate that CCF achieves competitive
perplexity under high compression ratios, and significantly improves throughput
and memory efficiency compared to existing approaches. These findings highlight
the potential of structured compression for scalable and effective long-context
language modeling.

Abstract: Accurately assessing candidate seniority from resumes is a critical yet
challenging task, complicated by the prevalence of overstated experience and
ambiguous self-presentation. In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of
large language models (LLMs), including fine-tuned BERT architectures, for
automating seniority classification in resumes. To rigorously evaluate model
performance, we introduce a hybrid dataset comprising both real-world resumes
and synthetically generated hard examples designed to simulate exaggerated
qualifications and understated seniority. Using the dataset, we evaluate the
performance of Large Language Models in detecting subtle linguistic cues
associated with seniority inflation and implicit expertise. Our findings
highlight promising directions for enhancing AI-driven candidate evaluation
systems and mitigating bias introduced by self-promotional language. The

Abstract: Question Answering over Tabular Data (Table QA) presents unique challenges
due to the diverse structure, size, and data types of real-world tables. The
SemEval 2025 Task 8 (DataBench) introduced a benchmark composed of large-scale,

*Grazia Sveva Ascione,Nicolò Tamagnone*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于弱监督学习的专利与联合国可持续发展目标(SDGs)分类方法，通过专利引用科学文献的噪声信号，结合大语言模型提取结构化概念，构建了高质量的专利-SDG映射数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 专利对SDGs的分类对于追踪创新如何应对全球挑战至关重要，但缺乏大规模标注数据集限制了监督学习的应用。现有方法如关键词搜索、迁移学习和基于引用的启发式方法缺乏可扩展性和泛化性。

Method: 将专利-SDG分类构建为弱监督问题，使用专利对SDG标记科学文献的引用作为噪声初始信号。开发复合标注函数，利用大语言模型从专利和SDG论文中提取结构化概念(功能、解决方案、应用)，基于专利本体计算跨域相似度得分，并通过仅正样本损失进行校准。

Result: 构建了银标准软多标签数据集，能够训练有效的多标签回归模型。内部验证显示方法优于包括基于Transformer模型和零样本LLM在内的多个基线；外部验证通过专利引用、共同发明人和共同申请人图的网络模块性显示，所生成的标签比传统技术分类具有更好的主题、认知和组织一致性。

Conclusion: 弱监督和语义对齐可以大规模增强SDG分类，为跟踪创新对全球挑战的贡献提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Classifying patents by their relevance to the UN Sustainable Development
Goals (SDGs) is crucial for tracking how innovation addresses global
challenges. However, the absence of a large, labeled dataset limits the use of
supervised learning. Existing methods, such as keyword searches, transfer
learning, and citation-based heuristics, lack scalability and generalizability.
This paper frames patent-to-SDG classification as a weak supervision problem,
using citations from patents to SDG-tagged scientific publications (NPL
citations) as a noisy initial signal. To address its sparsity and noise, we
develop a composite labeling function (LF) that uses large language models
(LLMs) to extract structured concepts, namely functions, solutions, and
applications, from patents and SDG papers based on a patent ontology.
Cross-domain similarity scores are computed and combined using a rank-based
retrieval approach. The LF is calibrated via a custom positive-only loss that
aligns with known NPL-SDG links without penalizing discovery of new SDG
associations. The result is a silver-standard, soft multi-label dataset mapping
patents to SDGs, enabling the training of effective multi-label regression
models. We validate our approach through two complementary strategies: (1)
internal validation against held-out NPL-based labels, where our method
outperforms several baselines including transformer-based models, and zero-shot
LLM; and (2) external validation using network modularity in patent citation,
co-inventor, and co-applicant graphs, where our labels reveal greater thematic,
cognitive, and organizational coherence than traditional technological
classifications. These results show that weak supervision and semantic
alignment can enhance SDG classification at scale.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有幻觉检测方法主要针对独立LLM，无法解决RAG系统中响应必须与检索证据一致的独特挑战，企业应用中需要可靠的幻觉检测方案。

Method: 四阶段框架：1)分解答案为原子事实 2)使用同义词和反义词生成受控变异 3)验证变异与检索上下文的一致性 4)聚合不一致性惩罚为幻觉分数

Conclusion: MetaRAG为RAG系统提供了一种实时、无监督的幻觉检测解决方案，特别适用于身份敏感查询的高风险领域，支持可信AI部署。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in enterprise
applications, yet their reliability remains limited by hallucinations, i.e.,
confident but factually incorrect information. Existing detection approaches,
such as SelfCheckGPT and MetaQA, primarily target standalone LLMs and do not
address the unique challenges of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems,
where responses must be consistent with retrieved evidence. We therefore
present MetaRAG, a metamorphic testing framework for hallucination detection in
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. MetaRAG operates in a real-time,
unsupervised, black-box setting, requiring neither ground-truth references nor
access to model internals, making it suitable for proprietary and high-stakes
domains. The framework proceeds in four stages: (1) decompose answers into
atomic factoids, (2) generate controlled mutations of each factoid using
synonym and antonym substitutions, (3) verify each variant against the
retrieved context (synonyms are expected to be entailed and antonyms
contradicted), and (4) aggregate penalties for inconsistencies into a
response-level hallucination score. Crucially for identity-aware AI, MetaRAG
localizes unsupported claims at the factoid span where they occur (e.g.,
pregnancy-specific precautions, LGBTQ+ refugee rights, or labor eligibility),
allowing users to see flagged spans and enabling system designers to configure
thresholds and guardrails for identity-sensitive queries. Experiments on a
proprietary enterprise dataset illustrate the effectiveness of MetaRAG for
detecting hallucinations and enabling trustworthy deployment of RAG-based
conversational agents. We also outline a topic-based deployment design that
translates MetaRAG's span-level scores into identity-aware safeguards; this
design is discussed but not evaluated in our experiments.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 类比推理是人类认知的重要方面，但NLP研究通常不从认知科学视角看待这些过程，需要建立认知理论与NLP实践的连接

Method: 总结认知科学文献中类比推理的关键理论过程，将其与NLP概念进行关联分析，并探讨这些概念对NLP主要挑战的相关性

Result: 展示了认知科学中的类比推理过程可以很好地与NLP概念联系起来，这些概念对NLP研究的多个主要挑战都具有相关性

Conclusion: 通过认知视角可以指导研究者更好地优化文本中的关系理解，而不是过度依赖实体层面的相似性，这有助于提升NLP系统的类比推理能力

Abstract: Analogical reasoning is an essential aspect of human cognition. In this
paper, we summarize key theory about the processes underlying analogical
reasoning from the cognitive science literature and relate it to current
research in natural language processing. While these processes can be easily
linked to concepts in NLP, they are generally not viewed through a cognitive
lens. Furthermore, we show how these notions are relevant for several major
challenges in NLP research, not directly related to analogy solving. This may
guide researchers to better optimize relational understanding in text, as
opposed to relying heavily on entity-level similarity.

Conclusion: 层次括号编码是一种实用的图解析方法，在减少标签空间的同时保持结构信息，为依赖图解析提供了有效的线性时间解决方案

Abstract: We revisit hierarchical bracketing encodings from a practical perspective in
the context of dependency graph parsing. The approach encodes graphs as
sequences, enabling linear-time parsing with $n$ tagging actions, and still
representing reentrancies, cycles, and empty nodes. Compared to existing graph
linearizations, this representation substantially reduces the label space while
preserving structural information. We evaluate it on a multilingual and
multi-formalism benchmark, showing competitive results and consistent
improvements over other methods in exact match accuracy.

Conclusion: GrACE为LLM部署提供了可扩展、可靠且实时的置信度估计实用解决方案，能够提高最终决策的准确性并减少计算开销。

Abstract: Assessing the reliability of Large Language Models (LLMs) by confidence
elicitation is a prominent approach to AI safety in high-stakes applications,
such as healthcare and finance. Existing methods either require expensive
computational overhead or suffer from poor calibration, making them impractical
and unreliable for real-world deployment. In this work, we propose GrACE, a
Generative Approach to Confidence Elicitation that enables scalable and
reliable confidence elicitation for LLMs. GrACE adopts a novel mechanism in
which the model expresses confidence by the similarity between the last hidden
state and the embedding of a special token appended to the vocabulary, in
real-time. We fine-tune the model for calibrating the confidence with
calibration targets associated with accuracy. Experiments with three LLMs and
two benchmark datasets show that the confidence produced by GrACE achieves the
best discriminative capacity and calibration on open-ended generation tasks,
outperforming six competing methods without resorting to additional sampling or
an auxiliary model. Moreover, we propose two strategies for improving test-time
scaling based on confidence induced by GrACE. Experimental results show that
using GrACE not only improves the accuracy of the final decision but also
significantly reduces the number of required samples in the test-time scaling
scheme, indicating the potential of GrACE as a practical solution for deploying
LLMs with scalable, reliable, and real-time confidence estimation.

Abstract: Semantic Textual Relatedness (STR) captures nuanced relationships between
texts that extend beyond superficial lexical similarity. In this study, we
investigate STR in the context of job title matching - a key challenge in
resume recommendation systems, where overlapping terms are often limited or
misleading. We introduce a self-supervised hybrid architecture that combines
dense sentence embeddings with domain-specific Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to
improve both semantic alignment and explainability. Unlike previous work that
evaluated models on aggregate performance, our approach emphasizes data
stratification by partitioning the STR score continuum into distinct regions:
low, medium, and high semantic relatedness. This stratified evaluation enables
a fine-grained analysis of model performance across semantically meaningful
subspaces. We evaluate several embedding models, both with and without KG
integration via graph neural networks. The results show that fine-tuned SBERT
models augmented with KGs produce consistent improvements in the high-STR
region, where the RMSE is reduced by 25% over strong baselines. Our findings
highlight not only the benefits of combining KGs with text embeddings, but also
the importance of regional performance analysis in understanding model
behavior. This granular approach reveals strengths and weaknesses hidden by
global metrics, and supports more targeted model selection for use in Human
Resources (HR) systems and applications where fairness, explainability, and
contextual matching are essential.

Motivation: 探索在存在分歧标注的学习任务中，如何有效预测不同标注者的特定注释（perspectivist annotations）和生成软标签，以处理标注不一致的问题。

Method: 采用两种主要方法：1）基于大语言模型的上下文学习（ICL），比较不同的示例采样策略；2）基于RoBERTa的标签分布学习（LDL）方法，评估多种微调方法。

Result: 研究表明：ICL能有效预测标注者特定注释，将这些预测聚合成软标签可获得有竞争力的性能；LDL方法在软标签预测方面表现良好，值得进一步探索。

Conclusion: 上下文学习和标签分布学习方法在处理标注分歧任务中都具有潜力，特别是LDL方法在软标签预测方面展现出良好前景，建议perspectivist社区进一步研究这些方法。

Abstract: This system paper presents the DeMeVa team's approaches to the third edition
of the Learning with Disagreements shared task (LeWiDi 2025; Leonardelli et
al., 2025). We explore two directions: in-context learning (ICL) with large
language models, where we compare example sampling strategies; and label
distribution learning (LDL) methods with RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019b), where we
evaluate several fine-tuning methods. Our contributions are twofold: (1) we
show that ICL can effectively predict annotator-specific annotations
(perspectivist annotations), and that aggregating these predictions into soft
labels yields competitive performance; and (2) we argue that LDL methods are
promising for soft label predictions and merit further exploration by the

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型快速重塑金融NLP领域，产生了大量新任务和数据集，但传统调查方法跟不上这种快速变化，需要新的分析框架

Method: 定义了金融NLP研究本体论，基于LLM的提取管道处理681篇论文（2022-2025），构建可查询的知识图谱进行大规模数据分析

Result: 揭示了金融NLP发展的三个阶段：早期LLM采用和任务/数据集创新；对LLM局限性的批判性反思；外围技术向模块化系统的集成

Conclusion: MetaGraph提供了金融NLP演化的结构化视图，展示了可重用的科学进展映射方法，适用于其他领域的研究趋势分析

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have rapidly reshaped financial NLP, enabling
new tasks and driving a proliferation of datasets and diversification of data
sources. Yet, this transformation has outpaced traditional surveys. In this
paper, we present MetaGraph, a generalizable methodology for extracting
knowledge graphs from scientific literature and analyzing them to obtain a
structured, queryable view of research trends. We define an ontology for
financial NLP research and apply an LLM-based extraction pipeline to 681 papers
(2022-2025), enabling large-scale, data-driven analysis. MetaGraph reveals
three key phases: early LLM adoption and task/dataset innovation; critical
reflection on LLM limitations; and growing integration of peripheral techniques
into modular systems. This structured view offers both practitioners and
researchers a clear understanding of how financial NLP has evolved -
highlighting emerging trends, shifting priorities, and methodological
shifts-while also demonstrating a reusable approach for mapping scientific
progress in other domains.

TL;DR: 使用GPT零样本能力从论坛介绍帖推断大五人格特质，集成到SAMI匹配系统中提供个性化社交推荐


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线课程环境阻碍社交群体自然形成，SAMI系统因缺乏完整心理理论而受限，特别是无法推断人格特质影响推荐相关性

Method: 提出人格检测模型，利用GPT零样本能力从论坛介绍帖推断大五人格特质，并与现有模型进行性能对比，然后集成到SAMI的实体匹配系统中

Result: 模型在该任务中表现出良好效能，初步集成显示人格特质可以补充现有匹配因素

Conclusion: 人格特质能够增强社交推荐系统，但需要进一步评估其对学生参与度和匹配质量的全面影响

Abstract: Social connection is a vital part of learning, yet online course environments
present barriers to the organic formation of social groups. SAMI offers one
solution by facilitating student connections, but its effectiveness is
constrained by an incomplete Theory of Mind, limiting its ability to create an
effective mental model of a student. One facet of this is its inability to
intuit personality, which may influence the relevance of its recommendations.
To explore this, we propose a personality detection model utilizing GPTs
zero-shot capability to infer Big-Five personality traits from forum
introduction posts, often encouraged in online courses. We benchmark its
performance against established models, demonstrating its efficacy in this
task. Furthermore, we integrate this model into SAMIs entity-based matchmaking
system, enabling personality-informed social recommendations. Initial
integration suggests personality traits can complement existing matching
factors, though additional evaluation is required to determine their full
impact on student engagement and match quality.

TL;DR: EXPRESS基准测试显示，当前主流LLM在细粒度情感对齐方面存在挑战，难以准确预测与人类自我披露情感一致的情绪标签。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注将情绪分类到预定义的有限类别中，忽视了更细微的情感表达，需要评估LLM是否能在细粒度层面与人类情感对齐。

Method: 引入EXPRESS基准数据集（包含251个细粒度自我披露情感标签），通过综合评估框架分析预测情绪术语，并将其分解为8种基本情绪进行细粒度比较，系统测试主流LLM在不同提示设置下的表现。

Result: 准确预测与人类自我披露情感一致的情绪仍然具有挑战性；某些LLM能生成符合既定情绪理论的术语，但在捕捉上下文线索方面不如人类自我披露有效。

Conclusion: LLM在细粒度情感对齐方面存在局限性，未来研究需要增强其上下文理解能力。

Abstract: The versatility of Large Language Models (LLMs) in natural language
understanding has made them increasingly popular in mental health research.
While many studies explore LLMs' capabilities in emotion recognition, a
critical gap remains in evaluating whether LLMs align with human emotions at a
fine-grained level. Existing research typically focuses on classifying emotions
into predefined, limited categories, overlooking more nuanced expressions. To
address this gap, we introduce EXPRESS, a benchmark dataset curated from Reddit
communities featuring 251 fine-grained, self-disclosed emotion labels. Our
comprehensive evaluation framework examines predicted emotion terms and
decomposes them into eight basic emotions using established emotion theories,
enabling a fine-grained comparison. Systematic testing of prevalent LLMs under
various prompt settings reveals that accurately predicting emotions that align
with human self-disclosed emotions remains challenging. Qualitative analysis
further shows that while certain LLMs generate emotion terms consistent with
established emotion theories and definitions, they sometimes fail to capture
contextual cues as effectively as human self-disclosures. These findings
highlight the limitations of LLMs in fine-grained emotion alignment and offer
insights for future research aimed at enhancing their contextual understanding.

Motivation: 解决资源稀缺地区缺乏医学证明时的死因识别问题，提高语言查尾的准确性

Method: 结合GPT-5大语言模型、传统LCVA基线、文本嵌入分类和元学习集成方法

Result: GPT-5在成年人、儿童、新生儿三个组别分别达到48.6%、50.5%、53.5%的准确率，超过传统统计机器学习基线5-10%

Conclusion: 简单的商用LLM辅助方法可显著提高语言查尾准确性，对低资源地区全球健康监测具有重要意义

Abstract: Verbal autopsy (VA) is a critical tool for estimating causes of death in
resource-limited settings where medical certification is unavailable. This
study presents LA-VA, a proof-of-concept pipeline that combines Large Language
Models (LLMs) with traditional algorithmic approaches and embedding-based
classification for improved cause-of-death prediction. Using the Population
Health Metrics Research Consortium (PHMRC) dataset across three age categories
(Adult: 7,580; Child: 1,960; Neonate: 2,438), we evaluate multiple approaches:
GPT-5 predictions, LCVA baseline, text embeddings, and meta-learner ensembles.
Our results demonstrate that GPT-5 achieves the highest individual performance
with average test site accuracies of 48.6% (Adult), 50.5% (Child), and 53.5%
(Neonate), outperforming traditional statistical machine learning baselines by
5-10%. Our findings suggest that simple off-the-shelf LLM-assisted approaches
could substantially improve verbal autopsy accuracy, with important
implications for global health surveillance in low-resource settings.

Motivation: 现有方法通常独立微调多智能体系统中的各个智能体，导致智能体之间存在能力差距和协调性差的问题

Method: MOAT框架包含两个关键阶段：规划智能体对齐（优化规划智能体生成更好的子目标序列）和接地智能体改进（使用智能体自身生成的多样化子目标-动作对进行微调）

Result: 在六个基准测试中，MOAT平均在held-in任务上提升3.1%，在held-out任务上提升4.4%，优于最先进的基线方法

Conclusion: MOAT通过迭代对齐机制有效解决了多智能体协作问题，理论分析证明其训练过程具有非递减性和渐进收敛性

Abstract: The advancement of large language models (LLMs) has enabled the construction
of multi-agent systems to solve complex tasks by dividing responsibilities
among specialized agents, such as a planning agent for subgoal generation and a
grounding agent for executing tool-use actions. Most existing methods typically
fine-tune these agents independently, leading to capability gaps among them
with poor coordination. To address this, we propose MOAT, a Multi-Agent Joint
Alignment Tuning framework that improves agents collaboration through iterative
alignment. MOAT alternates between two key stages: (1) Planning Agent
Alignment, which optimizes the planning agent to generate subgoal sequences
that better guide the grounding agent; and (2) Grounding Agent Improving, which
fine-tunes the grounding agent using diverse subgoal-action pairs generated by
the agent itself to enhance its generalization capablity. Theoretical analysis
proves that MOAT ensures a non-decreasing and progressively convergent training
process. Experiments across six benchmarks demonstrate that MOAT outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines, achieving average improvements of 3.1% on held-in
tasks and 4.4% on held-out tasks.

TL;DR: 这篇论文通过CAMA和ABP技术发现了大语言模型中的"All-for-One"子图结构，证明在心算数学任务中，有意义的计算仅在最后一个token的深层中进行，且该子图对模型性能至关重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大语言模型在心算数学任务中的内部运作机制，探索模型是否真正利用了全部前置token进行计算。

Method: 使用Context-Aware Mean Ablation (CAMA)和Attention-Based Peeking (ABP)两种新方法，逐步抑制初始层token计算、限制中间层信息传递、强制末层计算仅在最后token进行。

Result: 发现了高准确率的All-for-One子图(AF1)，其中有意义计算仅在最后token的深层进行，通过特定中间层获取其他token信息。该子图对模型性能必需且充分，可跨模型转移。

Conclusion: 大语言模型在心算任务中存在特定的计算模式，关键计算集中在最后token的深层，CAMA和ABP技术有独特优势。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate proficiency across numerous
computational tasks, yet their inner workings remain unclear. In theory, the
combination of causal self-attention and multilayer perceptron layers allows
every token to access and compute information based on all preceding tokens. In
practice, to what extent are such operations present? In this paper, on mental
math tasks (i.e., direct math calculation via next-token prediction without
explicit reasoning), we investigate this question in three steps: inhibiting
input-specific token computations in the initial layers, restricting the routes
of information transfer across token positions in the next few layers, and
forcing all computation to happen at the last token in the remaining layers.
With two proposed techniques, Context-Aware Mean Ablation (CAMA) and
Attention-Based Peeking (ABP), we identify an All-for-One subgraph (AF1) with
high accuracy on a wide variety of mental math tasks, where meaningful
computation occurs very late (in terms of layer depth) and only at the last
token, which receives information of other tokens in few specific middle
layers. Experiments on a variety of models and arithmetic expressions show that
this subgraph is sufficient and necessary for high model performance, transfers
across different models, and works on a variety of input styles. Ablations on
different CAMA and ABP alternatives reveal their unique advantages over other
methods, which may be of independent interest.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的MoE模型在大型语言模型中通过专家路由机制处理token，但缺乏对专家行为控制的有效方法，需要开发无需重新训练就能控制模型行为的技术。

Method: 提出SteerMoE框架，通过检测在对比行为输入对中表现出不同激活模式的专家，在推理过程中选择性地激活或停用这些专家来控制模型行为。

Result: 在11个基准测试和6个LLM上，安全性提升最高达+20%，忠实性提升+27%；在对抗攻击模式下，单独使用可降低安全性-41%，与现有越狱方法结合可完全绕过所有安全防护(-100%)。

Conclusion: SteerMoE提供了一种无需重新训练就能有效控制MoE模型行为的方法，同时揭示了专家内部存在的对齐伪装风险，为模型安全研究提供了新的维度。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) in Large Language Models (LLMs) routes each token
through a subset of specialized Feed-Forward Networks (FFN), known as experts.
We present SteerMoE, a framework for steering MoE models by detecting and
controlling behavior-linked experts. Our detection method identifies experts
with distinct activation patterns across paired inputs exhibiting contrasting
behaviors. By selectively (de)activating such experts during inference, we
control behaviors like faithfulness and safety without retraining or modifying
weights. Across 11 benchmarks and 6 LLMs, our steering raises safety by up to
+20% and faithfulness by +27%. In adversarial attack mode, it drops safety by
-41% alone, and -100% when combined with existing jailbreak methods, bypassing
all safety guardrails and exposing a new dimension of alignment faking hidden
within experts.

Motivation: 当前RLVR方法存在探索不足、过早收敛和熵崩溃的问题，需要更好的探索机制来增强大语言模型的推理能力

Method: 使用演员生成响应的困惑度和多头架构评论家的价值估计方差作为好奇心信号，作为探索奖励融入RLVR框架

Result: 在AIME基准上相比标准RLVR(GRPO/PPO)获得约3分的提升，并揭示了RLVR中的校准崩溃机制

Conclusion: CDE框架通过内在好奇心信号有效解决了RLVR的探索问题，理论分析显示该方法惩罚过度自信错误并促进回答多样性，为理解LLM失败模式提供了新视角

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is a powerful paradigm
for enhancing the reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs). Yet
current RLVR methods often explore poorly, leading to premature convergence and
entropy collapse. To address this challenge, we introduce Curiosity-Driven
Exploration (CDE), a framework that leverages the model's own intrinsic sense
of curiosity to guide exploration. We formalize curiosity with signals from
both the actor and the critic: for the actor, we use perplexity over its
generated response, and for the critic, we use the variance of value estimates
from a multi-head architecture. Both signals serve as an exploration bonus
within the RLVR framework to guide the model. Our theoretical analysis shows
that the actor-wise bonus inherently penalizes overconfident errors and
promotes diversity among correct responses; moreover, we connect the
critic-wise bonus to the well-established count-based exploration bonus in RL.
Empirically, our method achieves an approximate +3 point improvement over
standard RLVR using GRPO/PPO on AIME benchmarks. Further analysis identifies a
calibration collapse mechanism within RLVR, shedding light on common LLM
failure modes.

Result: 实验表明基于计数的嵌入在活动分布相似性方面提供了高效且有效的解决方案，与现有技术相比表现优异

Conclusion: 基于计数的简单嵌入方法在流程挖掘中具有显著优势，为分布相似性建模提供了高效、可解释的替代方案

Abstract: To obtain insights from event data, advanced process mining methods assess
the similarity of activities to incorporate their semantic relations into the
analysis. Here, distributional similarity that captures similarity from
activity co-occurrences is commonly employed. However, existing work for
distributional similarity in process mining adopt neural network-based
approaches as developed for natural language processing, e.g., word2vec and
autoencoders. While these approaches have been shown to be effective, their
downsides are high computational costs and limited interpretability of the
learned representations.
  In this work, we argue for simplicity in the modeling of distributional
similarity of activities. We introduce count-based embeddings that avoid a
complex training process and offer a direct interpretable representation. To
underpin our call for simple embeddings, we contribute a comprehensive
benchmarking framework, which includes means to assess the intrinsic quality of
embeddings, their performance in downstream applications, and their
computational efficiency. In experiments that compare against the state of the
art, we demonstrate that count-based embeddings provide a highly effective and
efficient basis for distributional similarity between activities in event data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 异质图神经网络等深度学习模型在关系数据库上的应用趋于复杂化，导致模型预测过程难以理解和解释，需要一种人类可理解的解释方法来说明模型如何利用数据进行预测。

Result: 在RelBench数据集上进行了涉及多个领域和不同记录级任务的广泛实验研究，结果证明了所提出解释方法的有用性和生成效率。

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效地为基于关系数据库的深度学习模型提供可解释的全局汇溜解释，通过控制决定性与简洁性的交换以及采用不同粒度级别的视图定义来实现灵活的解释控制。

Abstract: In recent years, there has been significant progress in the development of
deep learning models over relational databases, including architectures based
on heterogeneous graph neural networks (hetero-GNNs) and heterogeneous graph
transformers. In effect, such architectures state how the database records and
links (e.g., foreign-key references) translate into a large, complex numerical
expression, involving numerous learnable parameters. This complexity makes it
hard to explain, in human-understandable terms, how a model uses the available
data to arrive at a given prediction. We present a novel framework for
explaining machine-learning models over relational databases, where
explanations are view definitions that highlight focused parts of the database
that mostly contribute to the model's prediction. We establish such global
abductive explanations by adapting the classic notion of determinacy by Nash,
Segoufin, and Vianu (2010). In addition to tuning the tradeoff between
determinacy and conciseness, the framework allows controlling the level of
granularity by adopting different fragments of view definitions, such as ones
highlighting whole columns, foreign keys between tables, relevant groups of
tuples, and so on. We investigate the realization of the framework in the case
of hetero-GNNs. We develop heuristic algorithms that avoid the exhaustive
search over the space of all databases. We propose techniques that are
model-agnostic, and others that are tailored to hetero-GNNs via the notion of
learnable masking. Our approach is evaluated through an extensive empirical
study on the RelBench collection, covering a variety of domains and different
record-level tasks. The results demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed
explanations, as well as the efficiency of their generation.

Conclusion: 该方法扩展了贝叶斯定理的应用范围，使其能够更好地处理现实世界中专家提供的区间估计信息，提高了贝叶斯推断在实际应用中的实用性。

Abstract: Bayesian inference is widely used in many different fields to test hypotheses
against observations. In most such applications, an assumption is made of
precise input values to produce a precise output value. However, this is
unrealistic for real-world applications. Often the best available information
from subject matter experts (SMEs) in a given field is interval range estimates
of the input probabilities involved in Bayes Theorem. This paper provides two
key contributions to extend Bayes Theorem to an interval type-2 (IT2) version.
First, we develop an IT2 version of Bayes Theorem that uses a novel and
conservative method to avoid potential inconsistencies in the input IT2 MFs
that otherwise might produce invalid output results. We then describe a novel
and flexible algorithm for encoding SME-provided intervals into IT2 fuzzy
membership functions (MFs), which we can use to specify the input probabilities
in Bayes Theorem. Our algorithm generalizes and extends previous work on this
problem that primarily addressed the encoding of intervals into word MFs for
Computing with Words applications.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for automated game template generation
by transforming Game Design Documents (GDDs) into functional Unity game
prototypes using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and multi-modal Large

extracts structured game specifications, and synthesizes Unity-compatible C#
code that implements the core mechanics, systems, and architecture defined in
the design documentation. Our approach combines a fine-tuned LLaMA-3 model
specialized for Unity code generation with a custom Unity integration package
that streamlines the implementation process. Evaluation results demonstrate
significant improvements over baseline models, with our fine-tuned model
achieving superior performance (4.8/5.0 average score) compared to
state-of-the-art LLMs across compilation success, GDD adherence, best practices
adoption, and code modularity metrics. The generated templates demonstrate high
adherence to GDD specifications across multiple game genres. Our system
effectively addresses critical gaps in AI-assisted game development,
positioning LLMs as valuable tools in streamlining the transition from game

Motivation: 自然语言描述向MiniZinc模型的转换需要逻辑推理和约束编程专业知识，这个过程很具挑战性。

Method: 采用多代理模式，每个LLM代理专门检测和生成特定类型的全局约束代码，最后由一个组装代理整合成完整的MiniZinc模型。

Conclusion: 通过任务分解和专门化的代理模式，可以有效处理复杂的建模任务，并为未来工作提供了完整的发展路线图。

Abstract: Natural language descriptions of optimization or satisfaction problems are
challenging to translate into correct MiniZinc models, as this process demands
both logical reasoning and constraint programming expertise. We introduce a
framework that addresses this challenge with an agentic approach: multiple
specialized large language model (LLM) agents decompose the modeling task by
global constraint type. Each agent is dedicated to detecting and generating
code for a specific class of global constraint, while a final assembler agent
integrates these constraint snippets into a complete MiniZinc model. By
dividing the problem into smaller, well-defined sub-tasks, each LLM handles a
simpler reasoning challenge, potentially reducing overall complexity. We
conduct initial experiments with several LLMs and show better performance
against baselines such as one-shot prompting and chain-of-thought prompting.
Finally, we outline a comprehensive roadmap for future work, highlighting
potential enhancements and directions for improvement.

Conclusion: 损失函数的设计提供了一种简单但强大的工具，可以在合成数据日益增长的时代保持生成式模型的质量。

Abstract: The increasing reliance on generative AI models has accelerated the
generation rate of synthetic data, with some projections suggesting that most
available new data for training could be machine-generated by 2030. This shift
to a mainly synthetic content presents a critical challenge: repeated training
in synthetic data leads to a phenomenon known as model collapse, where model
performance degrades over generations of training, eventually rendering the
models ineffective. Although prior studies have explored the causes and
detection of model collapse, existing mitigation strategies remain limited.
  In this paper, we identify model overconfidence in their self-generated data
as a key driver of collapse. Building on this observation, we propose a
confidence-aware loss function that downweights high-confidence predictions
during training. We introduce a novel loss function we call Truncated Cross
Entropy (TCE). We demonstrate that TCE significantly delays model collapse in
recursive training.
  We provide a model-agnostic framework that links the loss function design to
model collapse mitigation and validate our approach both theoretically and
empirically, showing that it can extend the model's fidelity interval before
collapse by more than 2.3x. Finally, we show that our method generalizes across
modalities. These findings suggest that the design of loss functions provides a
simple yet powerful tool for preserving the quality of generative models in the
era of increasing synthetic data.

Abstract: Explainable AI has become a common term in the literature, scrutinized by
computer scientists and statisticians and highlighted by psychological or
philosophical researchers. One major effort many researchers tackle is
constructing general guidelines for XAI schemes, which we derived from our
study. While some areas of XAI are well studied, we focus on uncertainty
explanations and consider global explanations, which are often left out. We
chose an algorithm that covers various concepts simultaneously, such as
uncertainty, robustness, and global XAI, and tested its ability to calibrate
trust. We then checked whether an algorithm that aims to provide more of an
intuitive visual understanding, despite being complicated to understand, can
provide higher user satisfaction and human interpretability.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于上下文条件提示的方法来优化大型语言模型在冷启动推荐任务中的性能，通过最优示例注入和指令结构化显著提升了few-shot设置下的推荐精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决推荐系统中冷启动用户因缺乏历史行为信息而导致的性能下降问题，探索如何通过提示工程优化LLM在推荐任务中的表现。

Method: 提出上下文条件提示公式P(u, Ds)→R̂，其中u是冷启动用户档案，Ds是精选支持集，R̂是预测的项目排名列表。使用基于transformer的自回归LLM（BioGPT、LLaMA-2、GPT-4），采用token级对齐和嵌入空间正则化技术。

Result: 实验证明最优示例注入和指令结构化能显著提高precision@k和NDCG分数，特别是在低数据设置下。提示的及时组合不仅影响语法结构，还直接控制注意力尺度和解码器行为。

Conclusion: 基于提示的适应方法可以视为解决LLM管道中冷启动推荐问题的一种有效途径，展示了提示工程在推荐系统中的重要价值。

Abstract: The cold-start user issue further compromises the effectiveness of
recommender systems in limiting access to the historical behavioral
information. It is an effective pipeline to optimize instructional prompts on a
few-shot large language model (LLM) used in recommender tasks. We introduce a
context-conditioned prompt formulation method P(u,\ Ds)\ \rightarrow\
R\widehat, where u is a cold-start user profile, Ds is a curated support set,
and R\widehat is the predicted ranked list of items. Based on systematic
experimentation with transformer-based autoregressive LLMs (BioGPT, LLaMA-2,
GPT-4), we provide empirical evidence that optimal exemplar injection and
instruction structuring can significantly improve the precision@k and NDCG
scores of such models in low-data settings. The pipeline uses token-level
alignments and embedding space regularization with a greater semantic fidelity.
Our findings not only show that timely composition is not merely syntactic but
also functional as it is in direct control of attention scales and decoder
conduct through inference. This paper shows that prompt-based adaptation may be
considered one of the ways to address cold-start recommendation issues in
LLM-based pipelines.

Method: 在动态协商环境中对人类（N=216）、LLM（GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro）和贝叶斯代理进行直接对比，捕获结果和行为动态数据

Conclusion: 纯粹的性能平等指标可能隐藏了代理协商过程和对齐性的根本差异，这对实际部署至关重要

Abstract: Coordination tasks traditionally performed by humans are increasingly being
delegated to autonomous agents. As this pattern progresses, it becomes critical
to evaluate not only these agents' performance but also the processes through
which they negotiate in dynamic, multi-agent environments. Furthermore,
different agents exhibit distinct advantages: traditional statistical agents,
such as Bayesian models, may excel under well-specified conditions, whereas
large language models (LLMs) can generalize across contexts. In this work, we
compare humans (N = 216), LLMs (GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro), and Bayesian agents in
a dynamic negotiation setting that enables direct, identical-condition
comparisons across populations, capturing both outcomes and behavioral
dynamics. Bayesian agents extract the highest surplus through aggressive
optimization, at the cost of frequent trade rejections. Humans and LLMs can
achieve similar overall surplus, but through distinct behaviors: LLMs favor
conservative, concessionary trades with few rejections, while humans employ
more strategic, risk-taking, and fairness-oriented behaviors. Thus, we find
that performance parity -- a common benchmark in agent evaluation -- can
conceal fundamental differences in process and alignment, which are critical
for practical deployment in real-world coordination tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in agentic AI have led to systems capable of autonomous task
execution and language-based reasoning, yet their spatial reasoning abilities
remain limited and underexplored, largely constrained to symbolic and
sequential processing. In contrast, human spatial intelligence, rooted in
integrated multisensory perception, spatial memory, and cognitive maps, enables
flexible, context-aware decision-making in unstructured environments.
Therefore, bridging this gap is critical for advancing Agentic Spatial
Intelligence toward better interaction with the physical 3D world. To this end,
we first start from scrutinizing the spatial neural models as studied in
computational neuroscience, and accordingly introduce a novel computational
framework grounded in neuroscience principles. This framework maps core
biological functions to six essential computation modules: bio-inspired
multimodal sensing, multi-sensory integration, egocentric-allocentric
conversion, an artificial cognitive map, spatial memory, and spatial reasoning.
Together, these modules form a perspective landscape for agentic spatial
reasoning capability across both virtual and physical environments. On top, we
conduct a framework-guided analysis of recent methods, evaluating their
relevance to each module and identifying critical gaps that hinder the
development of more neuroscience-grounded spatial reasoning modules. We further
examine emerging benchmarks and datasets and explore potential application
domains ranging from virtual to embodied systems, such as robotics. Finally, we
outline potential research directions, emphasizing the promising roadmap that
can generalize spatial reasoning across dynamic or unstructured environments.
We hope this work will benefit the research community with a
neuroscience-grounded perspective and a structured pathway. Our project page

Conclusion: ProgD方法通过显式建模动态交互关系和多尺度渐进解码，显著提升了多智能体运动预测的准确性和一致性

Abstract: Accurate motion prediction of surrounding agents is crucial for the safe
planning of autonomous vehicles. Recent advancements have extended prediction
techniques from individual agents to joint predictions of multiple interacting
agents, with various strategies to address complex interactions within future
motions of agents. However, these methods overlook the evolving nature of these
interactions. To address this limitation, we propose a novel progressive
multi-scale decoding strategy, termed ProgD, with the help of dynamic
heterogeneous graph-based scenario modeling. In particular, to explicitly and
comprehensively capture the evolving social interactions in future scenarios,
given their inherent uncertainty, we design a progressive modeling of scenarios
with dynamic heterogeneous graphs. With the unfolding of such dynamic
heterogeneous graphs, a factorized architecture is designed to process the
spatio-temporal dependencies within future scenarios and progressively
eliminate uncertainty in future motions of multiple agents. Furthermore, a
multi-scale decoding procedure is incorporated to improve on the future
scenario modeling and consistent prediction of agents' future motion. The
proposed ProgD achieves state-of-the-art performance on the INTERACTION
multi-agent prediction benchmark, ranking $1^{st}$, and the Argoverse 2
multi-world forecasting benchmark.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs)-empowered autonomous agents are transforming
both digital and physical environments by enabling adaptive, multi-agent
collaboration. While these agents offer significant opportunities across
domains such as finance, healthcare, and smart manufacturing, their
unpredictable behaviors and heterogeneous capabilities pose substantial
governance and accountability challenges. In this paper, we propose a
blockchain-enabled layered architecture for regulatory agent collaboration,
comprising an agent layer, a blockchain data layer, and a regulatory
application layer. Within this framework, we design three key modules: (i) an
agent behavior tracing and arbitration module for automated accountability,
(ii) a dynamic reputation evaluation module for trust assessment in
collaborative scenarios, and (iii) a malicious behavior forecasting module for
early detection of adversarial activities. Our approach establishes a
systematic foundation for trustworthy, resilient, and scalable regulatory
mechanisms in large-scale agent ecosystems. Finally, we discuss the future
research directions for blockchain-enabled regulatory frameworks in multi-agent
systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown great promise in automating data
science workflows, but existing models still struggle with multi-step reasoning
and tool use, which limits their effectiveness on complex data analysis tasks.
To address this, we propose a scalable pipeline that extracts high-quality,
tool-based data analysis tasks and their executable multi-step solutions from
real-world Jupyter notebooks and associated data files. Using this pipeline, we
introduce NbQA, a large-scale dataset of standardized task-solution pairs that
reflect authentic tool-use patterns in practical data science scenarios. To
further enhance multi-step reasoning, we present Jupiter, a framework that
formulates data analysis as a search problem and applies Monte Carlo Tree
Search (MCTS) to generate diverse solution trajectories for value model
learning. During inference, Jupiter combines the value model and node visit
counts to efficiently collect executable multi-step plans with minimal search
steps. Experimental results show that Qwen2.5-7B and 14B-Instruct models on
NbQA solve 77.82% and 86.38% of tasks on InfiAgent-DABench,
respectively-matching or surpassing GPT-4o and advanced agent frameworks.
Further evaluations demonstrate improved generalization and stronger tool-use

Abstract: Knowledge graphs, a powerful tool for structuring information through
relational triplets, have recently become the new front-runner in enhancing
question-answering systems. While traditional Retrieval Augmented Generation
(RAG) approaches are proficient in fact-based and local context-based
extraction from concise texts, they encounter limitations when addressing the
thematic and holistic understanding of complex, extensive texts, requiring a
deeper analysis of both text and context. This paper presents a comprehensive
technical comparative study of three different methodologies for constructing
knowledge graph triplets and integrating them with Large Language Models (LLMs)
for question answering: spaCy, Stanford CoreNLP-OpenIE, and GraphRAG, all
leveraging open source technologies. We evaluate the effectiveness,
feasibility, and adaptability of these methods by analyzing their capabilities,
state of development, and their impact on the performance of LLM-based question
answering. Experimental results indicate that while OpenIE provides the most
comprehensive coverage of triplets, GraphRAG demonstrates superior reasoning
abilities among the three. We conclude with a discussion on the strengths and
limitations of each method and provide insights into future directions for
improving knowledge graph-based question answering.

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning with large language models (LLMs) have shown the
effectiveness of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for generating high-quality
intermediate trajectories, particularly in math and symbolic domains. Inspired
by this, we explore how MCTS-derived trajectories, traditionally used for
training value or reward models, can be repurposed to improve policy
optimization in preference-based reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, we
focus on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a recent algorithm that
enables preference-consistent policy learning without value networks. We
propose a staged GRPO training paradigm where completions are derived from
partially revealed MCTS rollouts, introducing a novel tree-structured setting
for advantage estimation. This leads to a rich class of prefix-conditioned
reward signals, which we analyze theoretically and empirically. Our initial
results indicate that while structured advantage estimation can stabilize
updates and better reflect compositional reasoning quality, challenges such as
advantage saturation and reward signal collapse remain. We propose heuristic
and statistical solutions to mitigate these issues and discuss open challenges
for learning under staged or tree-like reward structures.

Abstract: Tournaments are widely used models to represent pairwise dominance between
candidates, alternatives, or teams. We study the problem of providing certified
explanations for why a candidate appears among the winners under various
tournament rules. To this end, we identify minimal supports, minimal
sub-tournaments in which the candidate is guaranteed to win regardless of how
the rest of the tournament is completed (that is, the candidate is a necessary
winner of the sub-tournament). This notion corresponds to an abductive
explanation for the question,"Why does the winner win the tournament", a
central concept in formal explainable AI. We focus on common tournament
solutions: the top cycle, the uncovered set, the Copeland rule, the Borda rule,
the maximin rule, and the weighted uncovered set. For each rule we determine
the size of the smallest minimal supports, and we present polynomial-time
algorithms to compute them for all but the weighted uncovered set, for which
the problem is NP-complete. Finally, we show how minimal supports can serve to
produce compact, certified, and intuitive explanations.

Abstract: Coordinated teamwork is essential in fast-paced decision-making environments
that require dynamic adaptation, often without an opportunity for explicit
communication. Although implicit coordination has been extensively considered
in the existing literature, the majority of work has focused on co-located,
synchronous teamwork (such as sports teams) or, in distributed teams, primarily
on coordination of knowledge work. However, many teams (firefighters, military,
law enforcement, emergency response) must coordinate their movements in
physical space without the benefit of visual cues or extensive explicit
communication. This paper investigates how three dimensions of spatial
coordination, namely exploration diversity, movement specialization, and
adaptive spatial proximity, influence team performance in a collaborative
online search and rescue task where explicit communication is restricted and
team members rely on movement patterns to infer others' intentions and
coordinate actions. Our metrics capture the relational aspects of teamwork by
measuring spatial proximity, distribution patterns, and alignment of movements
within shared environments. We analyze data from 34 four-person teams (136
participants) assigned to specialized roles in a search and rescue task.
Results show that spatial specialization positively predicts performance, while
adaptive spatial proximity exhibits a marginal inverted U-shaped relationship,
suggesting moderate levels of adaptation are optimal. Furthermore, the temporal
dynamics of these metrics differentiate high- from low-performing teams over
time. These findings provide insights into implicit spatial coordination in
role-based teamwork and highlight the importance of balanced adaptive
strategies, with implications for training and AI-assisted team support
systems.

Conclusion: TAM Bench为评估LLM-based代理在端到端机器学习工作流中的能力提供了一个全面、可扩展且客观的基准测试解决方案

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled the emergence of
general-purpose agents for automating end-to-end machine learning (ML)
workflows, including data analysis, feature engineering, model training, and
competition solving. However, existing benchmarks remain limited in task
coverage, domain diversity, difficulty modeling, and evaluation rigor, failing
to capture the full capabilities of such agents in realistic settings. We
present TAM Bench, a diverse, realistic, and structured benchmark for
evaluating LLM-based agents on end-to-end ML tasks. TAM Bench features three
key innovations: (1) A browser automation and LLM-based task acquisition system
that automatically collects and structures ML challenges from platforms such as
Kaggle, AIcrowd, and Biendata, spanning multiple task types and data modalities
(e.g., tabular, text, image, graph, audio); (2) A leaderboard-driven difficulty
modeling mechanism that estimates task complexity using participant counts and
score dispersion, enabling scalable and objective task calibration; (3) A
multi-dimensional evaluation framework incorporating performance, format
compliance, constraint adherence, and task generalization. Based on 150 curated
AutoML tasks, we construct three benchmark subsets of different sizes -- Lite,
Medium, and Full -- designed for varying evaluation scenarios. The Lite
version, with 18 tasks and balanced coverage across modalities and difficulty
levels, serves as a practical testbed for daily benchmarking and comparative
studies.

Conclusion: 提供了一种将常识性语义推理嵌入自主代理的实用可扩展方法，为实现完全智能自主探索的机器人提供了新方向

Abstract: Navigating and understanding complex and unknown environments autonomously
demands more than just basic perception and movement from embodied agents.
Truly effective exploration requires agents to possess higher-level cognitive
abilities, the ability to reason about their surroundings, and make more
informed decisions regarding exploration strategies. However, traditional RL
approaches struggle to balance efficient exploration and semantic understanding
due to limited cognitive capabilities embedded in the small policies for the
agents, leading often to human drivers when dealing with semantic exploration.
In this paper, we address this challenge by presenting a novel Deep
Reinforcement Learning (DRL) architecture that is specifically designed for
resource efficient semantic exploration. A key methodological contribution is
the integration of a Vision-Language Model (VLM) common-sense through a layered
reward function. The VLM query is modeled as a dedicated action, allowing the
agent to strategically query the VLM only when deemed necessary for gaining
external guidance, thereby conserving resources. This mechanism is combined
with a curriculum learning strategy designed to guide learning at different
levels of complexity to ensure robust and stable learning. Our experimental
evaluation results convincingly demonstrate that our agent achieves
significantly enhanced object discovery rates and develops a learned capability
to effectively navigate towards semantically rich regions. Furthermore, it also
shows a strategic mastery of when to prompt for external environmental
information. By demonstrating a practical and scalable method for embedding
common-sense semantic reasoning with autonomous agents, this research provides
a novel approach to pursuing a fully intelligent and self-guided exploration in
robotics.

TL;DR: TORSO方法无需人工构建few-shot示例，通过引导LLM利用内部推理能力生成合理响应，在多个基准测试中表现优异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有few-shot提示方法过度依赖提供的示例，限制了模型固有推理能力的发挥，且构建任务特定的few-shot提示成本高且在不同任务间存在不一致性

Method: 提出Template-Oriented Reasoning (TORSO)方法，激发模型利用内部推理能力在各种任务中生成适当响应，无需手动构建few-shot示例

Result: 实验结果表明TORSO在多样化的LLM基准测试中取得了强劲性能，并生成合理的推理过程

Conclusion: TORSO提供了一种有效的方法来引导LLM发挥其内在推理能力，无需依赖成本高昂的人工few-shot示例构建

Abstract: The approaches that guide Large Language Models (LLMs) to emulate human
reasoning during response generation have emerged as an effective method for
enabling them to solve complex problems in a step-by-step manner, thereby
achieving superior performance. However, most existing approaches using
few-shot prompts to generate responses heavily depend on the provided examples,
limiting the utilization of the model's inherent reasoning capabilities.
Moreover, constructing task-specific few-shot prompts is often costly and may
lead to inconsistencies across different tasks. In this work, we introduce
Template-Oriented Reasoning (TORSO), which elicits the model to utilize
internal reasoning abilities to generate proper responses across various tasks
without the need for manually crafted few-shot examples. Our experimental
results demonstrate that TORSO achieves strong performance on diverse LLMs
benchmarks with reasonable rationales.

TL;DR: SEDM是一个自演化分布式记忆框架，通过可验证写入、动态记忆调度和跨域知识扩散，解决了多智能体系统中记忆管理的噪声积累、内存膨胀和泛化限制问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长期多智能体系统产生大量轨迹和交互数据，现有记忆管理方法存在噪声积累、内存膨胀和跨域泛化能力有限的问题，需要更高效可扩展的记忆管理框架。

Method: SEDM框架包含三个核心组件：基于可重现回放的可验证写入准入、根据经验效用动态排序和整合条目的自调度记忆控制器、以及抽象可重用见解支持跨异构任务迁移的跨域知识扩散。

Result: 在基准数据集上的评估显示，SEDM相比强记忆基线提高了推理准确性，同时降低了token开销，并且能够将从事实验证中提取的知识增强多跳推理能力。

Conclusion: SEDM作为一个可扩展且可持续的记忆机制，为开放式多智能体协作提供了有效的解决方案，代码将在项目后期发布。

Abstract: Long-term multi-agent systems inevitably generate vast amounts of
trajectories and historical interactions, which makes efficient memory
management essential for both performance and scalability. Existing methods
typically depend on vector retrieval and hierarchical storage, yet they are
prone to noise accumulation, uncontrolled memory expansion, and limited
generalization across domains. To address these challenges, we present SEDM,
Self-Evolving Distributed Memory, a verifiable and adaptive framework that
transforms memory from a passive repository into an active, self-optimizing
component. SEDM integrates verifiable write admission based on reproducible
replay, a self-scheduling memory controller that dynamically ranks and
consolidates entries according to empirical utility, and cross-domain knowledge
diffusion that abstracts reusable insights to support transfer across
heterogeneous tasks. Evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SEDM
improves reasoning accuracy while reducing token overhead compared with strong
memory baselines, and further enables knowledge distilled from fact
verification to enhance multi-hop reasoning. The results highlight SEDM as a
scalable and sustainable memory mechanism for open-ended multi-agent
collaboration. The code will be released in the later stage of this project.

Motivation: 解决当前AI工具（如视觉语言模型）缺乏组合泛化能力的问题，探索量子模型在组合语义表示学习中的潜力

Method: 使用变分量子电路在希尔伯特空间中学习组合张量模型的表示，采用两种图像编码技术：多热编码和CLIP模型的角/幅度编码

Result: 在多热编码上获得良好的概念验证结果，在CLIP图像向量上表现参差不齐但仍优于经典组合模型

Conclusion: 量子模型在组合泛化任务中显示出潜力，特别是在特定编码方式下能够超越经典方法

Abstract: Compositional generalization is a key facet of human cognition, but lacking
in current AI tools such as vision-language models. Previous work examined
whether a compositional tensor-based sentence semantics can overcome the
challenge, but led to negative results. We conjecture that the increased
training efficiency of quantum models will improve performance in these tasks.
We interpret the representations of compositional tensor-based models in
Hilbert spaces and train Variational Quantum Circuits to learn these
representations on an image captioning task requiring compositional
generalization. We used two image encoding techniques: a multi-hot encoding
(MHE) on binary image vectors and an angle/amplitude encoding on image vectors
taken from the vision-language model CLIP. We achieve good proof-of-concept
results using noisy MHE encodings. Performance on CLIP image vectors was more
mixed, but still outperformed classical compositional models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统顺序计算模式虽然能确保准确性，但无法满足具身AI系统在动态环境中对高频输入输出处理的需求，限制了实时应用性能。

Method: 将感知和生成模块解耦，提供受控的流水线并行化，建立共享的公共上下文来解决数据陈旧性问题，保证准确性。

Result: 实验结果显示Auras平均提升吞吐量2.54倍，同时达到原始准确性的102.7%，证明其能有效克服顺序计算限制。

Conclusion: Auras框架成功解决了具身AI系统的高频推理需求，在保持准确性的同时显著提升了系统吞吐量，为实时应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Embodied AI systems operate in dynamic environments, requiring seamless
integration of perception and generation modules to process high-frequency
input and output demands. Traditional sequential computation patterns, while
effective in ensuring accuracy, face significant limitations in achieving the
necessary "thinking" frequency for real-world applications. In this work, we
present Auras, an algorithm-system co-designed inference framework to optimize
the inference frequency of embodied AI agents. Auras disaggregates the
perception and generation and provides controlled pipeline parallelism for them
to achieve high and stable throughput. Faced with the data staleness problem
that appears when the parallelism is increased, Auras establishes a public
context for perception and generation to share, thereby promising the accuracy
of embodied agents. Experimental results show that Auras improves throughput by
2.54x on average while achieving 102.7% of the original accuracy, demonstrating
its efficacy in overcoming the constraints of sequential computation and
providing high throughput.

TL;DR: 论文研究发现，大语言模型在长任务执行中存在自我条件效应，模型规模扩大并不能解决执行错误累积问题，而思维模型能够执行更长的单步任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大语言模型在长任务执行中的表现，探讨模型规模扩展是否带来边际收益递减，以及为什么模型在简单任务变长时会失败。

Method: 通过隔离执行能力，明确提供解决长视野任务所需的知识和计划，测试不同规模模型在多步任务中的执行准确性。

Result: 发现大模型能正确执行更多步骤，但每步准确性随步骤增加而下降；存在自我条件效应（模型在包含先前错误的上下文中更容易犯错）；思维模型不会自我条件化且能执行更长的单步任务。

Conclusion: 通过关注执行能力，可以解释LLMs在复杂推理和简单长任务中的表现差异，并强调模型规模和顺序测试时计算对长视野任务的重要价值。

Abstract: Does continued scaling of large language models (LLMs) yield diminishing
returns? Real-world value often stems from the length of task an agent can
complete. We start this work by observing the simple but counterintuitive fact
that marginal gains in single-step accuracy can compound into exponential
improvements in the length of a task a model can successfully complete. Then,
we argue that failures of LLMs when simple tasks are made longer arise from
mistakes in execution, rather than an inability to reason. We propose isolating
execution capability, by explicitly providing the knowledge and plan needed to
solve a long-horizon task. We find that larger models can correctly execute
significantly more turns even when small models have 100\% single-turn
accuracy. We observe that the per-step accuracy of models degrades as the
number of steps increases. This is not just due to long-context limitations --
curiously, we observe a self-conditioning effect -- models become more likely
to make mistakes when the context contains their errors from prior turns.
Self-conditioning does not reduce by just scaling the model size. In contrast,
recent thinking models do not self-condition, and can also execute much longer
tasks in a single turn. We conclude by benchmarking frontier thinking models on
the length of task they can execute in a single turn. Overall, by focusing on
the ability to execute, we hope to reconcile debates on how LLMs can solve
complex reasoning problems yet fail at simple tasks when made longer, and
highlight the massive benefits of scaling model size and sequential test-time
compute for long-horizon tasks.
