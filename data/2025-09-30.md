### [1] [Pathological Truth Bias in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22674)
*Yash Thube*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了MATS行为审计框架来评估视觉语言模型拒绝视觉矛盾陈述的能力，发现指令调优的生成式VLMs表现很差，而对比编码器模型更稳健。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准基准测试可能掩盖系统性失败，影响实际应用中的可信度，需要更全面的评估方法。

Method: 引入MATS行为审计框架，包含空间一致性评分(SCS)和错误同意率(IAR)两个指标，并使用激活修补技术定位失败原因。

Result: 指令调优的生成式VLMs(如LLaVA 1.5、QwenVLchat)SCS极低且IAR很高，而对比编码器(如CLIP、SigLIP)表现更稳健。

Conclusion: 通过激活修补技术定位了模型失败的具体位置，为模型修复提供了具体路径。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) are improving quickly, but standard benchmarks
can hide systematic failures that reduce real world trust. We introduce MATS
(Multimodal Audit for Truthful Spatialization), a compact behavioral audit that
measures whether models reject visually contradicted statements, and two
metrics Spatial Consistency Score (SCS) and Incorrect Agreement Rate (IAR).
Instruction tuned generative VLMs (LLaVA 1.5, QwenVLchat) exhibit very low SCS
and high IAR, while contrastive encoders (CLIP, SigLIP) are far more robust.
Activation patching causally localizes failure loci (mid to late cross
attention for generative models, pooled projection components for contrastive
models) and suggests concrete repair paths.

### [2] [Scale and Rotation Estimation of Similarity-Transformed Images via Cross-Correlation Maximization Based on Auxiliary Function Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22686)
*Shinji Yamashita,Yuma Kinoshita,Hitoshi Kiya*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种高效算法，能够以亚像素精度联合估计两幅图像之间的尺度和旋转变化，相比传统傅里叶变换方法具有更低的估计误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图像配准在医学成像和计算机视觉中至关重要，但传统相位相关技术只能处理平移偏移，无法有效处理相机缩放或旋转引起的尺度和旋转变化。

Method: 结合对数极坐标下的傅里叶变换与互相关最大化策略，利用辅助函数方法，并引入亚像素级互相关来实现精确的尺度和旋转估计。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在尺度和旋转估计上的平均误差低于依赖离散互相关的传统傅里叶变换技术。

Conclusion: 所提出的算法能够有效解决图像配准中的尺度和旋转估计问题，具有较高的精度和实用性。

Abstract: This paper introduces a highly efficient algorithm capable of jointly
estimating scale and rotation between two images with sub-pixel precision.
Image alignment serves as a critical process for spatially registering images
captured from different viewpoints, and finds extensive use in domains such as
medical imaging and computer vision. Traditional phase-correlation techniques
are effective in determining translational shifts; however, they are inadequate
when addressing scale and rotation changes, which often arise due to camera
zooming or rotational movements. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm
that integrates scale and rotation estimation based on the Fourier transform in
log-polar coordinates with a cross-correlation maximization strategy,
leveraging the auxiliary function method. By incorporating sub-pixel-level
cross-correlation our method enables precise estimation of both scale and
rotation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves
lower mean estimation errors for scale and rotation than conventional Fourier
transform-based techniques that rely on discrete cross-correlation.

### [3] [Robust Object Detection for Autonomous Driving via Curriculum-Guided Group Relative Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22688)
*Xu Jia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合课程学习数据调度和难度感知过滤的强化学习框架，用于增强多模态大语言模型在结构化感知任务中的定位精度和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在视觉语言推理方面表现出色，但在需要精确定位和鲁棒性的结构化感知任务中表现不佳。

Method: 基于Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)的强化学习框架，结合课程学习数据调度和难度感知过滤，通过奖励设计、KL正则化和课程进度控制来稳定优化过程。

Result: 在自动驾驶基准测试中，检测精度和鲁棒性得到显著提升，消融研究证实了奖励设计、KL正则化和课程进度对收敛稳定性和泛化能力的重要性。

Conclusion: 基于强化驱动的优化和结构化数据课程学习是通往鲁棒且可解释的多模态检测的可扩展路径。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel in vision-language reasoning
but often struggle with structured perception tasks requiring precise
localization and robustness. We propose a reinforcement learning framework that
augments Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with curriculum-based data
scheduling and difficulty-aware filtering. This approach stabilizes
optimization under sparse, noisy rewards and enables progressive adaptation to
complex samples. Evaluations on autonomous driving benchmarks demonstrate
substantial improvements in detection accuracy and robustness. Ablation studies
confirm the importance of reward design, KL regularization, and curriculum
pacing for convergence stability and generalization. Our findings highlight
reinforcement-driven optimization with structured data curricula as a scalable
path toward robust and interpretable multimodal detection.

### [4] [Graph-Theoretic Consistency for Robust and Topology-Aware Semi-Supervised Histopathology Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22689)
*Ha-Hieu Pham,Minh Le,Han Huynh,Nguyen Quoc Khanh Le,Huy-Hieu Pham*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出拓扑图一致性(TGC)框架，通过图论约束改进半监督语义分割，在病理图像上仅需5-10%标注即可达到接近全监督的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 病理图像中密集标注成本高且有限，现有方法依赖像素级一致性会产生噪声伪标签和拓扑无效的分割结果

Method: 集成图论约束，通过对齐预测图和参考图的拉普拉斯谱、组件数量和邻接统计来强制全局拓扑一致性

Result: 在GlaS和CRAG数据集上达到最先进性能，显著缩小与全监督方法的差距

Conclusion: TGC框架有效提升半监督语义分割质量，特别适用于病理图像分析

Abstract: Semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SSSS) is vital in computational
pathology, where dense annotations are costly and limited. Existing methods
often rely on pixel-level consistency, which propagates noisy pseudo-labels and
produces fragmented or topologically invalid masks. We propose Topology Graph
Consistency (TGC), a framework that integrates graph-theoretic constraints by
aligning Laplacian spectra, component counts, and adjacency statistics between
prediction graphs and references. This enforces global topology and improves
segmentation accuracy. Experiments on GlaS and CRAG demonstrate that TGC
achieves state-of-the-art performance under 5-10% supervision and significantly
narrows the gap to full supervision. Code is available at
https://github.com/hieuphamha19/TGC.

### [5] [A review of Recent Techniques for Person Re-Identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22690)
*Andrea Asperti,Salvatore Fiorilla,Simone Nardi,Lorenzo Orsini*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文是一篇关于行人重识别(ReID)的综述，重点比较了监督学习和无监督学习方法的发展现状，特别关注了近年来无监督方法缩小与监督方法性能差距的趋势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 监督学习方法虽然性能优越但依赖大量标注数据，存在可扩展性问题。无监督方法利用大量未标注数据，近年来显示出与监督方法性能差距缩小的趋势，值得系统研究。

Method: 采用双焦点综述方法：一方面回顾监督学习方法的现状和局限性，另一方面深入分析过去三年无监督学习方法的最新进展。

Result: 监督学习方法已接近性能天花板，改进空间有限；无监督学习方法在近年来取得显著进展，性能与监督方法的差距正在缩小。

Conclusion: 行人重识别领域正经历从监督学习向无监督学习的转变，无监督方法显示出巨大潜力，有望在未来实现与监督方法相当的性能。

Abstract: Person re-identification (ReId), a crucial task in surveillance, involves
matching individuals across different camera views. The advent of Deep
Learning, especially supervised techniques like Convolutional Neural Networks
and Attention Mechanisms, has significantly enhanced person Re-ID. However, the
success of supervised approaches hinges on vast amounts of annotated data,
posing scalability challenges in data labeling and computational costs. To
address these limitations, recent research has shifted towards unsupervised
person re-identification. Leveraging abundant unlabeled data, unsupervised
methods aim to overcome the need for pairwise labelled data. Although
traditionally trailing behind supervised approaches, unsupervised techniques
have shown promising developments in recent years, signalling a narrowing
performance gap. Motivated by this evolving landscape, our survey pursues two
primary objectives. First, we review and categorize significant publications in
supervised person re-identification, providing an in-depth overview of the
current state-of-the-art and emphasizing little room for further improvement in
this domain. Second, we explore the latest advancements in unsupervised person
re-identification over the past three years, offering insights into emerging
trends and shedding light on the potential convergence of performance between
supervised and unsupervised paradigms. This dual-focus survey aims to
contribute to the evolving narrative of person re-identification, capturing
both the mature landscape of supervised techniques and the promising outcomes
in the realm of unsupervised learning.

### [6] [Sequential Token Merging: Revisiting Hidden States](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22691)
*Yan Wen,Peng Ye,Lin Zhang,Baopu Li,Jiakang Yuan,Yaoxin Yang,Tao Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Sequential Token Merging (STM)方法，通过双向最近邻合并和隐藏状态保护机制，在保持Vision Mamba模型性能的同时显著减少计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Mamba模型虽然具有次二次复杂度，但token数量随图像分辨率呈二次增长限制了效率。现有方法忽视了ViM固有的有限方向序列依赖(LDSD)这一关键信息流机制。

Method: 1) 双向最近邻合并：通过对称空间聚合保持序列依赖；2) 隐藏状态保护：稳定类别token周围的隐藏状态。利用Mamba层间损失收敛特性将时间遗忘转化为稳定性。

Result: 在20% token减少下ViM-Ti仅下降1.0%准确率，40%减少下ViM-S仅下降1.4%准确率。实现了最先进的效率，同时提供了状态空间模型动态的新见解。

Conclusion: STM方法在Vision Mamba模型中实现了高效的token压缩，在显著减少计算复杂度的同时保持了模型性能，为状态空间模型提供了新的理解视角。

Abstract: Vision Mambas (ViMs) achieve remarkable success with sub-quadratic
complexity, but their efficiency remains constrained by quadratic token scaling
with image resolution. While existing methods address token redundancy, they
overlook ViMs' intrinsic Limited Directional Sequential Dependence (LDSD) - a
critical information flow mechanism revealed in our analysis. We further
identify Mamba's selective scan enables gradual information aggregation in
hidden states. Based on these insights, we propose Sequential Token Merging
(STM), featuring: 1) Bidirectional nearest neighbor merging to preserve
sequential dependencies through symmetric spatial aggregation, and 2) Hidden
states protection to stabilize the hidden states around the class token. STM
strategically leverages Mamba's layer-wise loss convergence to convert temporal
forgetfulness into stability. Experiments demonstrate STM's superiority: 1.0%
accuracy drop for ViM-Ti at 20% token reduction, and only 1.4% degradation for
ViM-S at 40% reduction. Our method achieves state-of-the-art efficiency with
minimal complexity, while providing new insights into state-space model
dynamics. Codes will be released soon.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这是一篇关于超分辨率技术的全面综述论文，涵盖了单图像超分辨率、视频超分辨率、立体超分辨率和光场超分辨率等多个领域，分析了超过150种方法，提供了方法论、数据集、评估协议和复杂度的综合分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着深度学习技术的发展和对高质量视觉应用需求的增长，超分辨率领域快速发展，但现有综述大多局限于特定领域，缺乏对该领域的全面概述。

Method: 作者对超分辨率领域进行了深入综述，包括单图像超分辨率（SISR）、视频超分辨率（VSR）、立体超分辨率（SSR）和光场超分辨率（LFSR），并根据不同的骨干结构进行了分类分析。

Conclusion: 这项工作为超分辨率领域提供了宝贵的资源库和指导，并创建了一个专门的GitHub仓库来促进相关工作的访问，同时探讨了该领域中尚未充分研究的开放性问题。

Abstract: Super-resolution (SR) has garnered significant attention within the computer
vision community, driven by advances in deep learning (DL) techniques and the
growing demand for high-quality visual applications. With the expansion of this
field, numerous surveys have emerged. Most existing surveys focus on specific
domains, lacking a comprehensive overview of this field. Here, we present an
in-depth review of diverse SR methods, encompassing single image
super-resolution (SISR), video super-resolution (VSR), stereo super-resolution
(SSR), and light field super-resolution (LFSR). We extensively cover over 150
SISR methods, nearly 70 VSR approaches, and approximately 30 techniques for SSR
and LFSR. We analyze methodologies, datasets, evaluation protocols, empirical
results, and complexity. In addition, we conducted a taxonomy based on each
backbone structure according to the diverse purposes. We also explore valuable
yet under-studied open issues in the field. We believe that this work will
serve as a valuable resource and offer guidance to researchers in this domain.
To facilitate access to related work, we created a dedicated repository

### [8] [Learning Hyperspectral Images with Curated Text Prompts for Efficient Multimodal Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22697)
*Abhiroop Chatterjee,Susmita Ghosh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于CLIP风格对比学习框架的视觉语言模型优化方法，用于高光谱图像场景理解，仅需更新0.07%参数即可实现最先进性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着数据需求增长，高效学习越来越依赖于高质量数据的筛选和提炼，而非模型规模的暴力扩展。高光谱图像具有高维3D体素结构，其跨模态对齐问题尚未充分探索

Method: 使用CLIP风格对比训练框架，将视觉主干提取的体素级嵌入映射到冻结大型嵌入模型的潜在空间，通过可训练探针对齐视觉特征与文本标记表示，使用硬负例和半硬负例的对比损失，并引入描述性提示作为结构化锚点

Result: 在Indian Pines数据集上OA提升+0.92，Kappa提升+1.60；在Pavia University数据集上OA提升+0.69，Kappa提升+0.90；参数量比DCTN小50倍，比SS-TMNet小90倍

Conclusion: 该方法通过高效的参数更新和精心设计的对比学习框架，在高光谱图像场景理解任务中实现了卓越的性能，证明了数据筛选和跨模态对齐的重要性

Abstract: As data requirements continue to grow, efficient learning increasingly
depends on the curation and distillation of high-value data rather than
brute-force scaling of model sizes. In the case of a hyperspectral image (HSI),
the challenge is amplified by the high-dimensional 3D voxel structure, where
each spatial location is associated with hundreds of contiguous spectral
channels. While vision and language models have been optimized effectively for
natural image or text tasks, their cross-modal alignment in the hyperspectral
domain remains an open and underexplored problem. In this article, we make an
attempt to optimize a Vision-Language Model (VLM) for hyperspectral scene
understanding by exploiting a CLIP-style contrastive training framework. Our
framework maps voxel-level embeddings from a vision backbone onto the latent
space of a frozen large embedding model (LEM), where a trainable probe aligns
vision features with the model's textual token representations. The two
modalities are aligned via a contrastive loss restricted to a curated set of
hard (closest wrong classes) and semi-hard (random distractors) negatives,
along with positive pairs. To further enhance alignment, descriptive prompts
that encode class semantics are introduced and act as structured anchors for
the HSI embeddings. It is seen that the proposed method updates only 0.07
percent of the total parameters, yet yields state-of-the-art performance. For
example, on Indian Pines (IP) the model produces better results over unimodal
and multimodal baselines by +0.92 Overall Accuracy (OA) and +1.60 Kappa
($\kappa$), while on Pavia University (PU) data it provides gains of +0.69 OA
and +0.90 $\kappa$. Moreover, this is achieved with the set of parameters,
nearly 50$\times$ smaller than DCTN and 90$\times$ smaller than SS-TMNet.

### [9] [Global Prompt Refinement with Non-Interfering Attention Masking for One-Shot Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22700)
*Zhuang Qi,Pan Yu,Lei Meng,Sijin Zhou,Han Yu,Xiaoxiao Li,Xiangxu Meng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出GPR-NIAM方法，通过注意力隔离和跨客户端协作精炼模块，实现一次性联邦提示学习，在保持跨任务泛化能力的同时减少通信轮次需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦提示学习方法依赖多轮通信获取全局信息，且一次性联邦学习方法缺乏跨任务泛化能力。需要解决通信效率与泛化能力之间的矛盾。

Method: GPR-NIAM包含两个关键模块：注意力隔离模块限制可学习提示嵌入与原始文本嵌入的过度交互；跨客户端协作精炼模块整合分散的视觉知识并校准全局提示。

Result: 在10个基准数据集上的实验表明，GPR-NIAM在类别级和领域级泛化方面优于8种最先进方法。

Conclusion: GPR-NIAM通过创新的注意力屏蔽机制和跨模态知识对齐，实现了高效的一次性联邦提示学习，同时保持了优秀的跨任务泛化性能。

Abstract: Federated Prompt Learning (FPL) enables communication-efficient adaptation by
tuning lightweight prompts on top of frozen pre-trained models. Existing FPL
methods typically rely on global information, which is only available after the
second training round, to facilitate collaboration among client models.
Therefore, they are inherently dependent on multi-round communication to fully
exhibit their strengths. Moreover, existing one-shot federated learning methods
typically focus on fitting seen tasks, but lack cross-task generalization. To
bridge this gap, we propose the Global Prompt Refinement with Non-Interfering
Attention Masking (GPR-NIAM) method for one-shot FPL. The core idea is to
design a masking mechanism that restricts excessive interaction between the
original text embeddings and the learnable prompt embeddings. GPR-NIAM achieves
this through the collaboration of two key modules. Firstly, the attention
isolation module suppresses attention from the learnable prompt tokens to the
original text tokens, and reweights the reverse attention which preserves
generalization across tasks. Secondly, the cross-silo collaborative refinement
module integrates decentralized visual knowledge into a unified base and
calibrates the global prompt through multi-source cross-modal knowledge
alignment, further mitigating the inconsistency caused by data heterogeneity.
Extensive experiments conducted on ten benchmark datasets under two tasks show
that GPR-NIAM outperforms eight state-of-the-art methods in both class-level
and domain-level generalization.

TL;DR: 提出GZSL-MoE模型，将混合专家层集成到生成式零样本学习框架中，用于3D点云语义分割，在COVERED数据集上提升了对可见和不可见类别的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决3D点云语义分割中缺乏所有类别训练数据的问题，特别是在人机协作环境中，需要模型能够识别训练时未见过的物体类别。

Method: 将混合专家层集成到生成式零样本学习的生成器和判别器中，使用预训练的KPConv模型提取特征，生成逼真的不可见类别特征。

Result: GZSL-MoE模型在COVERED数据集上表现出色，能够同时提升对可见和不可见类别的分割性能。

Conclusion: 结合生成式零样本学习和混合专家的GZSL-MoE模型为复杂3D环境理解提供了有前景的解决方案，特别是在训练数据不完整的情况下。

Abstract: Generative Zero-Shot Learning approach (GZSL) has demonstrated significant
potential in 3D point cloud semantic segmentation tasks. GZSL leverages
generative models like GANs or VAEs to synthesize realistic features (real
features) of unseen classes. This allows the model to label unseen classes
during testing, despite being trained only on seen classes. In this context, we
introduce the Generalized Zero-Shot Learning based-upon Mixture-of-Experts
(GZSL-MoE) model. This model incorporates Mixture-of-Experts layers (MoE) to
generate fake features that closely resemble real features extracted using a
pre-trained KPConv (Kernel Point Convolution) model on seen classes. The main
contribution of this paper is the integration of Mixture-of-Experts into the
Generator and Discriminator components of the Generative Zero-Shot Learning
model for 3D point cloud semantic segmentation, applied to the COVERED dataset
(CollabOratiVE Robot Environment Dataset) for Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC)
environments. By combining the Generative Zero-Shot Learning model with
Mixture-of- Experts, GZSL-MoE for 3D point cloud semantic segmentation provides
a promising solution for understanding complex 3D environments, especially when
comprehensive training data for all object classes is unavailable. The
performance evaluation of the GZSL-MoE model highlights its ability to enhance
performance on both seen and unseen classes. Keywords Generalized Zero-Shot

*Adithya Giri*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过引入学习掩码为视觉Transformer添加归纳偏置，使其能在小数据集上有效学习，无需知识蒸馏


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer在计算机视觉中占主导地位，但缺乏卷积神经网络的归纳偏置，这在大数据集上可以学习，但在小数据集上表现不佳

Method: 提出IBiT方法，通过学习的掩码为视觉Transformer引入归纳偏置

Result: IBiT在小数据集上显著更准确，同时保持了Transformer的可解释性

Conclusion: 通过学习掩码引入归纳偏置是使视觉Transformer在小数据集上有效学习的有前景方法

Abstract: In recent years, Transformer-based architectures have become the dominant
method for Computer Vision applications. While Transformers are explainable and
scale well with dataset size, they lack the inductive biases of Convolutional
Neural Networks. While these biases may be learned on large datasets, we show
that introducing these inductive biases through learned masks allow Vision
Transformers to learn on much smaller datasets without Knowledge Distillation.
These Transformers, which we call Inductively Biased Image Transformers (IBiT),
are significantly more accurate on small datasets, while retaining the
explainability Transformers.

*Zezhong Fan,Xiaohan Li,Luyi Ma,Kai Zhao,Liang Peng,Topojoy Biswas,Evren Korpeoglu,Kaushiki Nag,Kannan Achan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LayoutAgent是一个结合视觉语言推理和组合扩散的智能框架，用于生成符合语义关系和物理合理性的多对象场景布局。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型缺乏显式空间推理能力，导致对象布局不真实；而传统机器人空间规划方法难以捕捉视觉场景的语义丰富性，需要桥接这一差距。

Method: 使用视觉语言模型进行输入预处理（分割、对象尺寸估计、场景图构建、提示重写），然后利用组合扩散方法合成符合场景图对象关系的边界框，最后通过前景条件图像生成器在规划布局中渲染对象。

Result: 实验表明LayoutAgent在布局连贯性、空间真实性和美学对齐方面优于其他最先进的布局生成模型。

Conclusion: LayoutAgent成功地将视觉语言推理与组合扩散相结合，实现了更真实和语义一致的多对象场景布局生成。

Abstract: Designing realistic multi-object scenes requires not only generating images,
but also planning spatial layouts that respect semantic relations and physical
plausibility. On one hand, while recent advances in diffusion models have
enabled high-quality image generation, they lack explicit spatial reasoning,
leading to unrealistic object layouts. On the other hand, traditional spatial
planning methods in robotics emphasize geometric and relational consistency,
but they struggle to capture semantic richness in visual scenes. To bridge this
gap, in this paper, we propose LayoutAgent, an agentic framework that unifies
vision-language reasoning with compositional diffusion for layout generation.
Given multiple input images with target objects in them, our method first
employs visual-language model to preprocess the inputs through segmentation,
object size estimation, scene graph construction, and prompt rewriting. Then we
leverage compositional diffusion-a method traditionally used in robotics-to
synthesize bounding boxes that respect object relations encoded in the scene
graph for spatial layouts. In the end, a foreground-conditioned image generator
composes the complete scene by rendering the objects into the planned layout
guided by designed prompts. Experiments demonstrate that LayoutAgent
outperforms other state-of-the-art layout generation models in layout
coherence, spatial realism and aesthetic alignment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CompareBench是一个评估视觉语言模型视觉比较推理能力的基准，包含1000个QA对，涵盖数量、时间、几何和空间四个任务。评估发现当前最强模型在时间排序和空间关系方面仍存在系统性缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉比较推理是视觉语言模型的基本但研究不足的能力，需要专门的基准来评估和诊断模型在这方面的表现。

Method: 构建了CompareBench基准，包含1000个QA对，分为数量(600)、时间(100)、几何(200)和空间(100)四个任务。基于两个辅助数据集TallyBench(2000张计数图像)和HistCaps(515张历史图像)构建。评估了闭源API(OpenAI、Gemini、Claude)和开源模型(Qwen2.5-VL和Qwen3-VL系列)。

Result: 结果显示明显的扩展趋势，但也揭示了关键限制：即使最强的模型在时间排序和空间关系方面持续失败，在基本计数和几何比较中经常犯对人类来说很简单的错误。

Conclusion: 视觉比较仍然是当前VLMs的系统性盲点。CompareBench通过提供受控、多样化和诊断性评估，为推进更可靠的多模态推理奠定了基础。

Abstract: We introduce CompareBench, a benchmark for evaluating visual comparison
reasoning in vision-language models (VLMs), a fundamental yet understudied
skill. CompareBench consists of 1000 QA pairs across four tasks: quantity
(600), temporal (100), geometric (200), and spatial (100). It is derived from
two auxiliary datasets that we constructed: TallyBench (2000 counting images
with QA) and HistCaps (515 historical images with bilingual captions). We
evaluate both closed-source APIs (OpenAI, Gemini, Claude) and open-source
models (Qwen2.5-VL and Qwen3-VL series). Results show clear scaling trends but
also reveal critical limitations: even the strongest models consistently fail
at temporal ordering and spatial relations, and they often make mistakes in
basic counting and geometric comparisons that are trivial for humans. These
findings demonstrate that visual comparison remains a systematic blind spot for
current VLMs. By providing controlled, diverse, and diagnostic evaluation,
CompareBench establishes a foundation for advancing more reliable multimodal
reasoning.

TL;DR: MILR是一种在测试时联合推理图像和文本的方法，通过在统一潜在向量空间中搜索离散标记的向量表示来实现跨模态推理，无需微调即可显著提升图像生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于推理的图像生成方法要么局限于单模态推理（仅图像或文本），要么依赖高质量推理数据进行微调。为了解决这些限制，需要开发能够在测试时联合推理图像和文本的方法。

Method: 提出MILR方法，在统一多模态理解和生成（MUG）框架内实现跨模态推理。通过在统一潜在空间中搜索离散图像和文本标记的向量表示，使用策略梯度方法进行推理，并由图像质量评估器指导。

Result: 在GenEval、T2I-CompBench和WISE基准测试中均达到最先进水平。特别是在知识密集的WISE数据集上，总体得分达到0.63，比基线提高80%。分析表明统一潜在空间中的联合推理是性能提升的关键。

Conclusion: MILR展示了在测试时进行跨模态推理的有效性，无需额外微调即可显著提升图像生成质量。该方法在时间和文化推理方面表现出非平凡的能力，验证了所提推理方法的有效性。

Abstract: Reasoning-augmented machine learning systems have shown improved performance
in various domains, including image generation. However, existing
reasoning-based methods for image generation either restrict reasoning to a
single modality (image or text) or rely on high-quality reasoning data for
fine-tuning. To tackle these limitations, we propose MILR, a test-time method
that jointly reasons over image and text in a unified latent vector space.
Reasoning in MILR is performed by searching through vector representations of
discrete image and text tokens. Practically, this is implemented via the policy
gradient method, guided by an image quality critic. We instantiate MILR within
the unified multimodal understanding and generation (MUG) framework that
natively supports language reasoning before image synthesis and thus
facilitates cross-modal reasoning. The intermediate model outputs, which are to
be optimized, serve as the unified latent space, enabling MILR to operate
entirely at test time. We evaluate MILR on GenEval, T2I-CompBench, and WISE,
achieving state-of-the-art results on all benchmarks. Notably, on
knowledge-intensive WISE, MILR attains an overall score of 0.63, improving over
the baseline by 80%. Our further analysis indicates that joint reasoning in the
unified latent space is the key to its strong performance. Moreover, our
qualitative studies reveal MILR's non-trivial ability in temporal and cultural
reasoning, highlighting the efficacy of our reasoning method.

*Tangqi Shi,Pietro Lio*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出UESA-Net网络，通过多方向收缩注意力机制解决超声图像分割中全局上下文与局部细节的语义鸿沟问题，在乳腺和甲状腺超声图像分割上取得优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超声图像存在斑点噪声、结构重叠和全局-局部特征交互弱的问题，现有网络难以同时兼顾高级语义和低级空间细节，需要开发能够弥合全局上下文与局部细节语义鸿沟的分割框架。

Method: 采用U形网络结构，编码器-解码器架构捕获长程依赖和细粒度结构。编码块中沿水平、垂直和深度方向的多方向注意力模块利用空间细节，收缩策略整合先验知识和局部特征。解码器采用成对收缩机制，结合低级物理线索和编码器特征增强上下文建模。

Result: 在TN3K（3493张图像）和BUSI（780张图像）两个公开数据集上，UESA-Net分别达到0.8487和0.6495的交并比（IoU）分数，取得最先进性能。

Conclusion: UESA-Net通过聚合多方向空间信息和先验知识，有效提高了乳腺和甲状腺超声分割的鲁棒性和准确性，在多个基准测试中表现出优于现有方法的性能。

Abstract: Background: Breast and thyroid cancers pose an increasing public-health
burden. Ultrasound imaging is a cost-effective, real-time modality for lesion
detection and segmentation, yet suffers from speckle noise, overlapping
structures, and weak global-local feature interactions. Existing networks
struggle to reconcile high-level semantics with low-level spatial details. We
aim to develop a segmentation framework that bridges the semantic gap between
global context and local detail in noisy ultrasound images.
  Methods: We propose UESA-Net, a U-shaped network with multidirectional
shrinkage attention. The encoder-decoder architecture captures long-range
dependencies and fine-grained structures of lesions. Within each encoding
block, attention modules operate along horizontal, vertical, and depth
directions to exploit spatial details, while a shrinkage (threshold) strategy
integrates prior knowledge and local features. The decoder mirrors the encoder
but applies a pairwise shrinkage mechanism, combining prior low-level physical
cues with corresponding encoder features to enhance context modeling.
  Results: On two public datasets - TN3K (3493 images) and BUSI (780 images) -
UESA-Net achieved state-of-the-art performance with intersection-over-union
(IoU) scores of 0.8487 and 0.6495, respectively.
  Conclusions: UESA-Net effectively aggregates multidirectional spatial
information and prior knowledge to improve robustness and accuracy in breast
and thyroid ultrasound segmentation, demonstrating superior performance to
existing methods on multiple benchmarks.

*Fernando Julio Cendra,Kai Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PartCo是一个新的广义类别发现框架，通过引入部分级视觉特征对应关系来增强类别发现能力，能够在不显著修改现有方法的情况下提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的GCD方法主要依赖语义标签和全局图像表示，忽略了区分密切相关类别所需的关键部分级线索。

Method: PartCo框架通过利用部分级关系来捕捉更细粒度的语义结构，从而更细致地理解类别关系。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，PartCo显著提升了当前GCD方法的性能，达到了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: PartCo通过在语义标签和部分级视觉组合之间架起桥梁，为GCD设定了新的基准。

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to identify both known and novel
categories within unlabeled data by leveraging a set of labeled examples from
known categories. Existing GCD methods primarily depend on semantic labels and
global image representations, often overlooking the detailed part-level cues
that are crucial for distinguishing closely related categories. In this paper,
we introduce PartCo, short for Part-Level Correspondence Prior, a novel
framework that enhances category discovery by incorporating part-level visual
feature correspondences. By leveraging part-level relationships, PartCo
captures finer-grained semantic structures, enabling a more nuanced
understanding of category relationships. Importantly, PartCo seamlessly
integrates with existing GCD methods without requiring significant
modifications. Our extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets
demonstrate that PartCo significantly improves the performance of current GCD
approaches, achieving state-of-the-art results by bridging the gap between
semantic labels and part-level visual compositions, thereby setting new
benchmarks for GCD. Project page: https://visual-ai.github.io/partco

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DEFT是一种分解式高效微调框架，通过将权重矩阵更新分解为两个可训练矩阵：一个在低秩子空间补集上的投影和一个低秩更新，实现了在个性化、多任务统一和可编辑性之间的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文本到图像模型高效微调中面临的关键挑战：在有限图像中学习新概念、保留多任务指令能力、保持可编辑性之间的权衡问题。

Method: 提出分解式高效微调框架DEFT，将预训练权重矩阵更新分解为两个组件：使用低秩矩阵定义子空间，并在该子空间内进行灵活参数适配。

Result: 在Dreambooth、Dreambench Plus、InsDet和VisualCloze数据集上的实验表明，DEFT在个性化、对象场景适应和视觉上下文学习方面实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: DEFT框架展示了高效微调的新兴特性，在多个任务上表现出色，为文本到图像模型的适应性优化提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Efficient fine-tuning of pre-trained Text-to-Image (T2I) models involves
adjusting the model to suit a particular task or dataset while minimizing
computational resources and limiting the number of trainable parameters.
However, it often faces challenges in striking a trade-off between aligning
with the target distribution: learning a novel concept from a limited image for
personalization and retaining the instruction ability needed for unifying
multiple tasks, all while maintaining editability (aligning with a variety of
prompts or in-context generation). In this work, we introduce DEFT,
Decompositional Efficient Fine-Tuning, an efficient fine-tuning framework that
adapts a pre-trained weight matrix by decomposing its update into two
components with two trainable matrices: (1) a projection onto the complement of
a low-rank subspace spanned by a low-rank matrix, and (2) a low-rank update.
The single trainable low-rank matrix defines the subspace, while the other
trainable low-rank matrix enables flexible parameter adaptation within that
subspace. We conducted extensive experiments on the Dreambooth and Dreambench
Plus datasets for personalization, the InsDet dataset for object and scene
adaptation, and the VisualCloze dataset for a universal image generation
framework through visual in-context learning with both Stable Diffusion and a
unified model. Our results demonstrated state-of-the-art performance,
highlighting the emergent properties of efficient fine-tuning. Our code is

TL;DR: VideoScore2是一个多维度、可解释的视频评估框架，通过三个维度（视觉质量、文本-视频对齐、物理/常识一致性）和详细推理过程来评估文本到视频生成的质量，在多个基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频评估方法局限于单一不透明分数，缺乏可解释性，无法全面捕捉视频质量评估的多方面特性。

Method: 使用包含27,168个人工标注视频的大规模数据集VideoFeedback2，采用两阶段训练流程：监督微调后使用GRPO强化学习增强分析鲁棒性。

Result: 在VideoScore-Bench-v2基准上达到44.35准确率（提升5.94），在四个外部基准上平均性能达到50.37（提升4.32）。

Conclusion: VideoScore2提供了可解释的评估，通过有效的奖励建模弥合了评估与可控生成之间的差距。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-video generation have produced increasingly
realistic and diverse content, yet evaluating such videos remains a fundamental
challenge due to their multi-faceted nature encompassing visual quality,
semantic alignment, and physical consistency. Existing evaluators and reward
models are limited to single opaque scores, lack interpretability, or provide
only coarse analysis, making them insufficient for capturing the comprehensive
nature of video quality assessment. We present VideoScore2, a
multi-dimensional, interpretable, and human-aligned framework that explicitly
evaluates visual quality, text-to-video alignment, and physical/common-sense
consistency while producing detailed chain-of-thought rationales. Our model is
trained on a large-scale dataset VideoFeedback2 containing 27,168
human-annotated videos with both scores and reasoning traces across three
dimensions, using a two-stage pipeline of supervised fine-tuning followed by
reinforcement learning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to
enhance analytical robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
VideoScore2 achieves superior performance with 44.35 (+5.94) accuracy on our
in-domain benchmark VideoScore-Bench-v2 and 50.37 (+4.32) average performance
across four out-of-domain benchmarks (VideoGenReward-Bench, VideoPhy2, etc),
while providing interpretable assessments that bridge the gap between
evaluation and controllable generation through effective reward modeling for
Best-of-N sampling. Project Page: https://tiger-ai-lab.github.io/VideoScore2/

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TRUST是一种针对状态空间模型(SSMs)的测试时自适应方法，通过利用多样化的遍历排列生成多个因果视角，使用模型预测作为伪标签来更新Mamba特定参数，从而提高在分布偏移下的泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 状态空间模型(SSMs)作为视觉Transformer的高效替代方案，在分布偏移下泛化性能显著下降，需要专门的自适应方法来提升其鲁棒性。

Method: 提出TRUST方法，利用多样化的遍历排列生成输入图像的多个因果视角，使用模型预测作为伪标签指导Mamba特定参数的更新，并通过平均适应权重来整合不同遍历扫描中学到的信息。

Result: 在七个基准测试上的实验表明，TRUST持续提升鲁棒性，并优于现有的测试时自适应方法。

Conclusion: TRUST是首个明确利用SSMs独特架构特性进行自适应的方法，有效解决了状态空间模型在分布偏移下的泛化问题。

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs) have emerged as efficient alternatives to Vision
Transformers (ViTs), with VMamba standing out as a pioneering architecture
designed for vision tasks. However, their generalization performance degrades
significantly under distribution shifts. To address this limitation, we propose
TRUST (Test-Time Refinement using Uncertainty-Guided SSM Traverses), a novel
test-time adaptation (TTA) method that leverages diverse traversal permutations
to generate multiple causal perspectives of the input image. Model predictions
serve as pseudo-labels to guide updates of the Mamba-specific parameters, and
the adapted weights are averaged to integrate the learned information across
traversal scans. Altogether, TRUST is the first approach that explicitly
leverages the unique architectural properties of SSMs for adaptation.
Experiments on seven benchmarks show that TRUST consistently improves
robustness and outperforms existing TTA methods.

TL;DR: MMPB是首个用于评估视觉语言模型个性化能力的大规模基准测试，包含10k图像-查询对和111个可个性化概念，涵盖人类、动物、物体和角色四类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大型视觉语言模型应用广泛，但其适应个体用户的能力仍未被充分探索，而视觉个性化在面向用户的AI系统中至关重要。

Method: 构建包含10k图像-查询对的基准测试，将个性化分为三种任务类型，使用23个开源和闭源模型通过三阶段协议（概念注入、多轮对话、个性化查询）进行评估。

Result: 大多数视觉语言模型在个性化方面表现不佳，特别是在对话一致性、处理用户偏好和适应视觉线索方面存在困难，存在拒绝行为和长上下文遗忘等问题。

Conclusion: MMPB揭示了视觉语言模型在个性化方面的显著改进空间，为未来真正个性化的多模态AI研究提供了有价值的见解和坚实基础。

Abstract: Visual personalization is essential in user-facing AI systems such as smart
homes and healthcare, where aligning model behavior with user-centric concepts
is critical. However, recent large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), despite their
broad applicability, remain underexplored in their ability to adapt to
individual users. In this paper, we introduce MMPB, the first extensive
benchmark for evaluating VLMs on personalization. MMPB comprises 10k
image-query pairs and includes 111 personalizable concepts across four
categories: humans, animals, objects, and characters, with the human category
enriched with preference-grounded queries. We structure personalization into
three main task types, each highlighting a different key property of VLMs.
Using 23 widely used VLMs including both open- and closed-source models, we
evaluate personalization performance via a three-stage protocol: concept
injection, multi-turn dialogue, and personalized querying. Our findings
indicate that most VLMs (including some closed-source models) struggle with
personalization, particularly in maintaining consistency over dialogue,
handling user preferences, and adapting to visual cues. Our analysis reveals
that the challenges in VLM personalization (such as refusal behaviors and
long-context forgetting) highlight substantial room for improvement. By
identifying these limitations and offering a scalable benchmark, MMPB offers
valuable insights and a solid foundation for future research toward truly
personalized multi-modal AI. Project Page: aidaslab.github.io/MMPB

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种完全可控的对抗性补丁生成框架，允许攻击者自由选择输入图像和目标类别，实现精确的错误分类控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗性补丁方法存在白盒假设不现实、非目标攻击或视觉明显等限制，难以在实际场景中应用。

Method: 结合生成式U-Net设计和Grad-CAM引导的补丁放置，实现语义感知定位，在保持视觉真实性的同时最大化攻击效果。

Result: 在卷积网络和视觉变换器上均达到最先进性能，攻击成功率和目标类别成功率均超过99%，优于现有白盒攻击和非现实方法。

Conclusion: 该框架在真实性、目标控制和黑盒适用性三个最具挑战性的维度上同时取得突破，为对抗性鲁棒性研究设立了新基准。

Abstract: Adversarial patch attacks pose a severe threat to deep neural networks, yet
most existing approaches rely on unrealistic white-box assumptions, untargeted
objectives, or produce visually conspicuous patches that limit real-world
applicability. In this work, we introduce a novel framework for fully
controllable adversarial patch generation, where the attacker can freely choose
both the input image x and the target class y target, thereby dictating the
exact misclassification outcome. Our method combines a generative U-Net design
with Grad-CAM-guided patch placement, enabling semantic-aware localization that
maximizes attack effectiveness while preserving visual realism. Extensive
experiments across convolutional networks (DenseNet-121, ResNet-50) and vision
transformers (ViT-B/16, Swin-B/16, among others) demonstrate that our approach
achieves state-of-the-art performance across all settings, with attack success
rates (ASR) and target-class success (TCS) consistently exceeding 99%.
  Importantly, we show that our method not only outperforms prior white-box
attacks and untargeted baselines, but also surpasses existing non-realistic
approaches that produce detectable artifacts. By simultaneously ensuring
realism, targeted control, and black-box applicability-the three most
challenging dimensions of patch-based attacks-our framework establishes a new
benchmark for adversarial robustness research, bridging the gap between
theoretical attack strength and practical stealthiness.

TL;DR: CrossScaleNet是一个结合跨注意力机制和多尺度处理的时间序列预测架构，既能实现高性能又能提供时间可解释性，在预测精度和时间显著性检测方面都表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列预测中的可解释性对于提高模型透明度和支持明智决策至关重要。传统的事后时间显著性检测方法计算成本高，而现有声称具有可解释性的模型往往无法在标准基准测试中保持强劲性能。

Method: 提出CrossScaleNet架构，结合基于补丁的跨注意力机制和多尺度处理，在训练过程中嵌入注意力机制，为时间显著性提供内在可解释性。

Result: 在具有已知显著性真值的合成数据集和已建立的公共基准测试上验证了CrossScaleNet的鲁棒性。在真实世界数据集上的实验表明，该方法在保持预测精度的同时，一致优于大多数基于Transformer的模型，并在时间显著性检测和预测准确性方面都表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: CrossScaleNet填补了现有模型的空白，提供了一种平衡的方法，既能有效捕捉时间显著性，又能在不同复杂度的数据集上提供最先进的预测性能。

Abstract: Explainability in time series forecasting is essential for improving model
transparency and supporting informed decision-making. In this work, we present
CrossScaleNet, an innovative architecture that combines a patch-based
cross-attention mechanism with multi-scale processing to achieve both high
performance and enhanced temporal explainability. By embedding attention
mechanisms into the training process, our model provides intrinsic
explainability for temporal saliency, making its decision-making process more
transparent. Traditional post-hoc methods for temporal saliency detection are
computationally expensive, particularly when compared to feature importance
detection. While ablation techniques may suffice for datasets with fewer
features, identifying temporal saliency poses greater challenges due to its
complexity. We validate CrossScaleNet on synthetic datasets with known saliency
ground truth and on established public benchmarks, demonstrating the robustness
of our method in identifying temporal saliency. Experiments on real-world
datasets for forecasting task show that our approach consistently outperforms
most transformer-based models, offering better explainability without
sacrificing predictive accuracy. Our evaluations demonstrate superior
performance in both temporal saliency detection and forecasting accuracy.
Moreover, we highlight that existing models claiming explainability often fail
to maintain strong performance on standard benchmarks. CrossScaleNet addresses
this gap, offering a balanced approach that captures temporal saliency
effectively while delivering state-of-the-art forecasting performance across
datasets of varying complexity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 肺癌是全球癌症相关死亡的主要原因，准确分割PET/CT图像中的IGTV对移动肿瘤的放射治疗至关重要，但面临标注数据有限和肿瘤边界PET信号衰减的挑战。

Method: 使用基于MAMBA的多模态交互感知网络，在大量GTV数据集上预训练后在私有IGTV数据集上微调；引入切片交互模块(SIM)在2.5D分割框架中建模切片间关系，集成通道和空间注意力分支。

Result: 在私有IGTV数据集上达到Dice系数0.609，显著优于传统基线方法的0.385。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了迁移学习结合先进多模态技术和SIM模块在提高IGTV分割可靠性和临床相关性方面的潜力。

Abstract: Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancerrelated deaths globally.
Accurate delineation of internal gross tumor volume (IGTV) in PET/CT imaging is
pivotal for optimal radiation therapy in mobile tumors such as lung cancer to
account for tumor motion, yet is hindered by the limited availability of
annotated IGTV datasets and attenuated PET signal intensity at tumor
boundaries. In this study, we present a transfer learningbased methodology
utilizing a multimodal interactive perception network with MAMBA, pre-trained
on extensive gross tumor volume (GTV) datasets and subsequently fine-tuned on a
private IGTV cohort. This cohort constitutes the PET/CT subset of the
Lung-cancer Unified Cross-modal Imaging Dataset (LUCID). To further address the
challenge of weak PET intensities in IGTV peripheral slices, we introduce a
slice interaction module (SIM) within a 2.5D segmentation framework to
effectively model inter-slice relationships. Our proposed module integrates
channel and spatial attention branches with depthwise convolutions, enabling
more robust learning of slice-to-slice dependencies and thereby improving
overall segmentation performance. A comprehensive experimental evaluation
demonstrates that our approach achieves a Dice of 0.609 on the private IGTV
dataset, substantially surpassing the conventional baseline score of 0.385.
This work highlights the potential of transfer learning, coupled with advanced
multimodal techniques and a SIM to enhance the reliability and clinical
relevance of IGTV segmentation for lung cancer radiation therapy planning.

Abstract: In recent years, event cameras have gained significant attention due to their
bio-inspired properties, such as high temporal resolution and high dynamic
range. However, obtaining large-scale labeled ground-truth data for event-based
vision tasks remains challenging and costly. In this paper, we present
ControlEvents, a diffusion-based generative model designed to synthesize
high-quality event data guided by diverse control signals such as class text
labels, 2D skeletons, and 3D body poses. Our key insight is to leverage the
diffusion prior from foundation models, such as Stable Diffusion, enabling
high-quality event data generation with minimal fine-tuning and limited labeled
data. Our method streamlines the data generation process and significantly
reduces the cost of producing labeled event datasets. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach by synthesizing event data for visual
recognition, 2D skeleton estimation, and 3D body pose estimation. Our
experiments show that the synthesized labeled event data enhances model
performance in all tasks. Additionally, our approach can generate events based
on unseen text labels during training, illustrating the powerful text-based

TL;DR: 提出了KAN-IDIR和RandKAN-IDIR方法，首次将Kolmogorov-Arnold网络集成到基于隐式神经表示的可变形图像配准中，通过随机基函数采样策略降低计算成本，在多个医学影像数据集上实现了最佳配准精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统学习型方法需要大量训练数据且在某些器官类型和成像模态上精度不足，而隐式神经表示方法虽然精度高但需要实例特定优化，计算效率和稳定性是关键挑战。

Method: 将Kolmogorov-Arnold网络集成到隐式神经表示的可变形图像配准框架中，提出随机基函数采样策略减少所需基函数数量，同时保持配准质量。

Result: 在肺CT、脑MRI、心脏MRI三个数据集上评估，KAN-IDIR和RandKAN-IDIR在所有评估模态和解剖结构中均达到INR方法中的最高精度，计算开销最小且学习稳定性最佳。

Conclusion: RandKAN-IDIR通过随机基函数采样在略微优于可学习基函数索引模型的同时，消除了额外的训练时间复杂性，为医学图像配准提供了高效稳定的解决方案。

Abstract: Deformable image registration (DIR) is a cornerstone of medical image
analysis, enabling spatial alignment for tasks like comparative studies and
multi-modal fusion. While learning-based methods (e.g., CNNs, transformers)
offer fast inference, they often require large training datasets and struggle
to match the precision of classical iterative approaches on some organ types
and imaging modalities. Implicit neural representations (INRs) have emerged as
a promising alternative, parameterizing deformations as continuous mappings
from coordinates to displacement vectors. However, this comes at the cost of
requiring instance-specific optimization, making computational efficiency and
seed-dependent learning stability critical factors for these methods. In this
work, we propose KAN-IDIR and RandKAN-IDIR, the first integration of
Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) into deformable image registration with
implicit neural representations (INRs). Our proposed randomized basis sampling
strategy reduces the required number of basis functions in KAN while
maintaining registration quality, thereby significantly lowering computational
costs. We evaluated our approach on three diverse datasets (lung CT, brain MRI,
cardiac MRI) and compared it with competing instance-specific learning-based
approaches, dataset-trained deep learning models, and classical registration
approaches. KAN-IDIR and RandKAN-IDIR achieved the highest accuracy among
INR-based methods across all evaluated modalities and anatomies, with minimal
computational overhead and superior learning stability across multiple random
seeds. Additionally, we discovered that our RandKAN-IDIR model with randomized
basis sampling slightly outperforms the model with learnable basis function
indices, while eliminating its additional training-time complexity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有集合输入网络（如Deep Sets和Set Transformer）只能处理向量输入，无法直接处理3D图像张量，需要与CNN特征提取器级联使用，限制了性能。

Method: CST直接在3D图像张量上操作，同时执行特征提取和上下文建模，支持CNN可解释性方法如Grad-CAM，并可通过标准迁移学习方案进行预训练和适配。

Result: 在集合分类和集合异常检测任务中表现优于现有方法，提供了更好的可解释性，并发布了在ImageNet上预训练的CST-15骨干网络。

Conclusion: CST是一种有效的集合图像处理架构，能够直接处理3D图像张量，实现特征提取和上下文建模的协同作用，具有优异的性能和可解释性。

Abstract: We introduce the Convolutional Set Transformer (CST), a novel neural
architecture designed to process image sets of arbitrary cardinality that are
visually heterogeneous yet share high-level semantics - such as a common
category, scene, or concept. Existing set-input networks, e.g., Deep Sets and
Set Transformer, are limited to vector inputs and cannot directly handle 3D
image tensors. As a result, they must be cascaded with a feature extractor,
typically a CNN, which encodes images into embeddings before the set-input
network can model inter-image relationships. In contrast, CST operates directly
on 3D image tensors, performing feature extraction and contextual modeling
simultaneously, thereby enabling synergies between the two processes. This
design yields superior performance in tasks such as Set Classification and Set
Anomaly Detection and further provides native compatibility with CNN
explainability methods such as Grad-CAM, unlike competing approaches that
remain opaque. Finally, we show that CSTs can be pre-trained on large-scale
datasets and subsequently adapted to new domains and tasks through standard
Transfer Learning schemes. To support further research, we release CST-15, a
CST backbone pre-trained on ImageNet
(https://github.com/chinefed/convolutional-set-transformer).

surveillance but remains challenging due to (1) target loss from minimal
features, (2) false alarms in cluttered environments, (3) missed detections
from low saliency, and (4) high computational costs. To address these issues,
we propose TY-RIST, an optimized YOLOv12n architecture that integrates (1) a
stride-aware backbone with fine-grained receptive fields, (2) a high-resolution
detection head, (3) cascaded coordinate attention blocks, and (4) a branch
pruning strategy that reduces computational cost by about 25.5% while
marginally improving accuracy and enabling real-time inference. We also
incorporate the Normalized Gaussian Wasserstein Distance (NWD) to enhance
regression stability. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks and across 20
different models demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, improving mAP at 0.5
IoU by +7.9%, Precision by +3%, and Recall by +10.2%, while achieving up to 123
FPS on a single GPU. Cross-dataset validation on a fifth dataset further
confirms strong generalization capability. Additional results and resources are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯溅射的参数化表示难以作为特征被神经网络学习，原始高斯参数存在非唯一性和异构性问题，导致模型高度依赖数据

Method: 基于连续子流形场构建3D高斯溅射的嵌入表示，封装高斯基元的内在信息，保持颜色和几何结构，同时强制唯一映射和通道同质性

Result: 该方法能够更好地保留3D高斯溅射的底层结构，有利于3DGS的学习

Conclusion: 提出的嵌入表示方法为基于3D高斯溅射的学习系统提供了更原则性的表示方案

Abstract: A well-designed vectorized representation is crucial for the learning systems
natively based on 3D Gaussian Splatting. While 3DGS enables efficient and
explicit 3D reconstruction, its parameter-based representation remains hard to
learn as features, especially for neural-network-based models. Directly feeding
raw Gaussian parameters into learning frameworks fails to address the
non-unique and heterogeneous nature of the Gaussian parameterization, yielding
highly data-dependent models. This challenge motivates us to explore a more
principled approach to represent 3D Gaussian Splatting in neural networks that
preserves the underlying color and geometric structure while enforcing unique
mapping and channel homogeneity. In this paper, we propose an embedding
representation of 3DGS based on continuous submanifold fields that encapsulate
the intrinsic information of Gaussian primitives, thereby benefiting the
learning of 3DGS.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了soft embeddings方法，通过将离散token替换为生成器输出分布的期望嵌入，解决了一步生成器的梯度流阻塞问题，使模型可微分且兼容后续优化技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决一步生成器的两个关键限制：继承教师模型的建模偏差，以及离散token输出阻止梯度流动，无法进行对抗训练、奖励微调等后蒸馏优化。

Method: 引入soft embeddings作为连续代理，集成到Di[M]O蒸馏框架中（称为Soft-Di[M]O），使一步生成器可端到端训练，支持GAN优化、奖励微调和测试时嵌入优化。

Result: 在多个MDM教师模型上，Soft-Di[M]O实现最先进的一步生成结果：ImageNet-256上FID达1.56，文本到图像任务中GenEval和HPS分数更高，并通过TTEO获得进一步增益。

Conclusion: soft embeddings方法有效解决了一步生成器的可微性问题，为后续优化技术提供了兼容性，显著提升了一步生成的性能。

Abstract: One-step generators distilled from Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) compress
multiple sampling steps into a single forward pass, enabling efficient text and
image synthesis. However, they suffer two key limitations: they inherit
modeling bias from the teacher, and their discrete token outputs block gradient
flow, preventing post-distillation refinements such as adversarial training,
reward-based fine-tuning, and Test-Time Embedding Optimization (TTEO). In this
work, we introduce soft embeddings, a simple relaxation that replaces discrete
tokens with the expected embeddings under the generator's output distribution.
Soft embeddings preserve representation fidelity for one-step discrete
generator while providing a fully differentiable continuous surrogate that is
compatible with teacher backbones and tokenizer decoders. Integrating soft
embeddings into the Di[M]O distillation framework (denoted Soft-Di[M]O) makes
one-step generators end-to-end trainable and enables straightforward
application of GAN-based refinement, differentiable reward fine-tuning, and
TTEO. Empirically, across multiple MDM teachers (e.g., MaskBit, MaskGen),
Soft-Di[M]O achieves state-of-the-art one-step results: improved class-to-image
performance, a one-step FID of 1.56 on ImageNet-256 with GAN-based refinement,
along with higher GenEval and HPS scores on text-to-image with reward
fine-tuning, and further gains from TTEO.

Abstract: Traditional marine biological image recognition faces challenges of
incomplete datasets and unsatisfactory model accuracy, particularly for
few-shot conditions of rare species where data scarcity significantly hampers
the performance. To address these issues, this study proposes an intelligent
marine fish recognition framework, FishAI 2.0, integrating multimodal few-shot
deep learning techniques with image generation for data augmentation. First, a
hierarchical marine fish benchmark dataset, which provides a comprehensive data
foundation for subsequent model training, is utilized to train the FishAI 2.0
model. To address the data scarcity of rare classes, the large language model
DeepSeek was employed to generate high-quality textual descriptions, which are
input into Stable Diffusion 2 for image augmentation through a hierarchical
diffusion strategy that extracts latent encoding to construct a multimodal
feature space. The enhanced visual-textual datasets were then fed into a
Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) based model, enabling robust
few-shot image recognition. Experimental results demonstrate that FishAI 2.0
achieves a Top-1 accuracy of 91.67 percent and Top-5 accuracy of 97.97 percent
at the family level, outperforming baseline CLIP and ViT models with a
substantial margin for the minority classes with fewer than 10 training
samples. To better apply FishAI 2.0 to real-world scenarios, at the genus and
species level, FishAI 2.0 respectively achieves a Top-1 accuracy of 87.58
percent and 85.42 percent, demonstrating practical utility. In summary, FishAI
2.0 improves the efficiency and accuracy of marine fish identification and
provides a scalable technical solution for marine ecological monitoring and
conservation, highlighting its scientific value and practical applicability.

Abstract: Brain tumors are abnormal cell growths in the central nervous system (CNS),
and their timely detection is critical for improving patient outcomes. This
paper proposes an automatic and efficient deep-learning framework for brain
tumor detection from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. The framework
employs a pre-trained ResNet50 model for feature extraction, followed by Global
Average Pooling (GAP) and linear projection to obtain compact, high-level image
representations. These features are then processed by a novel Dense-Dropout
sequence, a core contribution of this work, which enhances non-linear feature
learning, reduces overfitting, and improves robustness through diverse feature
transformations. Another major contribution is the creation of the Mymensingh
Medical College Brain Tumor (MMCBT) dataset, designed to address the lack of
reliable brain tumor MRI resources. The dataset comprises MRI scans from 209
subjects (ages 9 to 65), including 3671 tumor and 13273 non-tumor images, all
clinically verified under expert supervision. To overcome class imbalance, the
tumor class was augmented, resulting in a balanced dataset well-suited for deep
learning research.

Motivation: 当前ICH的AI解决方案发展受到公共数据碎片化的限制，需要统一、精细标注的数据集来支持稳健AI模型的开发。

Method: 构建包含372个头部CT检查的公开数据集，采用双读工作流程和神经外科医生仲裁来确保标注质量，使用标准卷积和transformer架构进行基准测试。

Result: 轻量级模型MobileViT-XS在二分类中达到87.8%的F1分数，U-Net with DenseNet161在病灶分割中达到85.5%的Dice分数，验证了数据集的质量和样本量充足性。

Conclusion: Hemorica提供了一个统一、细粒度的基准数据集，支持多任务和课程学习，促进AI辅助ICH检测和量化系统的设计。

Abstract: Timely diagnosis of Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) on Computed Tomography (CT)
scans remains a clinical priority, yet the development of robust Artificial
Intelligence (AI) solutions is still hindered by fragmented public data. To
close this gap, we introduce Hemorica, a publicly available collection of 372
head CT examinations acquired between 2012 and 2024. Each scan has been
exhaustively annotated for five ICH subtypes-epidural (EPH), subdural (SDH),
subarachnoid (SAH), intraparenchymal (IPH), and intraventricular (IVH)-yielding
patient-wise and slice-wise classification labels, subtype-specific bounding
boxes, two-dimensional pixel masks and three-dimensional voxel masks. A
double-reading workflow, preceded by a pilot consensus phase and supported by
neurosurgeon adjudication, maintained low inter-rater variability.
Comprehensive statistical analysis confirms the clinical realism of the
dataset. To establish reference baselines, standard convolutional and
transformer architectures were fine-tuned for binary slice classification and
hemorrhage segmentation. With only minimal fine-tuning, lightweight models such
as MobileViT-XS achieved an F1 score of 87.8% in binary classification, whereas
a U-Net with a DenseNet161 encoder reached a Dice score of 85.5% for binary
lesion segmentation that validate both the quality of the annotations and the
sufficiency of the sample size. Hemorica therefore offers a unified,
fine-grained benchmark that supports multi-task and curriculum learning,
facilitates transfer to larger but weakly labelled cohorts, and facilitates the
process of designing an AI-based assistant for ICH detection and quantification
systems.

TL;DR: ARSS是一个基于自回归Transformer的新颖视图生成框架，通过GPT风格的解码器从单张图像生成多视角视图，在保持自回归结构的同时提升生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在生成质量上表现优异，但由于其非因果生成方式，在多视角一致性任务中存在局限性，容易产生扭曲或不一致。相比之下，自回归模型具有因果性，更适合世界建模任务。

Method: 使用视频分词器将连续图像序列映射为离散token，设计相机编码器将相机轨迹转换为3D位置引导，并提出自回归Transformer模块在保持时间顺序的同时随机置换token的空间顺序。

Result: 在公共数据集上的定性和定量实验表明，该方法在性能上可与基于扩散模型的最先进视图合成方法相媲美或更优。

Conclusion: ARSS证明了自回归模型在多视角生成任务中的有效性，为世界建模提供了一种新的解决方案。

Abstract: Despite their exceptional generative quality, diffusion models have limited
applicability to world modeling tasks, such as novel view generation from
sparse inputs. This limitation arises because diffusion models generate outputs
in a non-causal manner, often leading to distortions or inconsistencies across
views, and making it difficult to incrementally adapt accumulated knowledge to
new queries. In contrast, autoregressive (AR) models operate in a causal
fashion, generating each token based on all previously generated tokens. In
this work, we introduce \textbf{ARSS}, a novel framework that leverages a
GPT-style decoder-only AR model to generate novel views from a single image,
conditioned on a predefined camera trajectory. We employ a video tokenizer to
map continuous image sequences into discrete tokens and propose a camera
encoder that converts camera trajectories into 3D positional guidance. Then to
enhance generation quality while preserving the autoregressive structure, we
propose a autoregressive transformer module that randomly permutes the spatial
order of tokens while maintaining their temporal order. Extensive qualitative
and quantitative experiments on public datasets demonstrate that our method
performs comparably to, or better than, state-of-the-art view synthesis
approaches based on diffusion models. Our code will be released upon paper
acceptance.

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过分离时间动态信息和静态场景信息来减少动作识别中静态偏差的方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动作识别模型过度依赖静态线索而非动态人体运动，这种静态偏差导致在现实应用和零样本动作识别中性能较差

Method: 使用偏置流和无偏流之间的统计独立性损失，结合场景预测损失，分离时间动态信息与静态场景信息

Result: 实验证明该方法有效减少了静态偏差，并确认了场景预测损失的重要性

Conclusion: 通过统计独立性损失和场景预测损失的结合，能够有效降低动作识别中的静态偏差问题

Abstract: Action recognition models rely excessively on static cues rather than dynamic
human motion, which is known as static bias. This bias leads to poor
performance in real-world applications and zero-shot action recognition. In
this paper, we propose a method to reduce static bias by separating temporal
dynamic information from static scene information. Our approach uses a
statistical independence loss between biased and unbiased streams, combined
with a scene prediction loss. Our experiments demonstrate that this method
effectively reduces static bias and confirm the importance of scene prediction
loss.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为'去敏感对抗训练'(DesenAT)的方法，通过特征去敏感化生成对抗样本并在自蒸馏框架中进行训练，旨在减轻DNN对点云特征的过度依赖，从而提高模型对损坏点云的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于场景复杂性、传感器不准确性和处理不精确性，点云损坏不可避免。传统方法训练的DNN对点云特征过度依赖是模型脆弱性的根源，但尚不清楚这种问题是否存在于3D点云任务中，以及减少对特征的依赖是否能增强模型对损坏点云的鲁棒性。

Method: 1. 使用Shapley值量化DNN对点云特征的敏感性；2. 提出DesenAT方法：通过消除高贡献成分的数据点，使用空间变换模拟损坏场景生成对抗样本；3. 在自蒸馏框架中进行对抗训练，将干净样本的知识转移到对抗样本中。

Result: 在ModelNet-C和PointCloud-C数据集上的广泛实验表明，所提出的方法能够有效提高模型的鲁棒性，同时不会降低在干净数据集上的性能。

Conclusion: DesenAT方法通过平滑敏感性有效缓解了DNN对点云特征的过度依赖，显著提高了模型对损坏点云的鲁棒性，为3D点云任务的稳健性研究提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Due to scene complexity, sensor inaccuracies, and processing imprecision,
point cloud corruption is inevitable. Over-reliance on input features is the
root cause of DNN vulnerabilities. It remains unclear whether this issue exists
in 3D tasks involving point clouds and whether reducing dependence on these
features can enhance the model's robustness to corrupted point clouds. This
study attempts to answer these questions. Specifically, we quantified the
sensitivity of the DNN to point cloud features using Shapley values and found
that models trained using traditional methods exhibited high sensitivity values
for certain features. Furthermore, under an equal pruning ratio, prioritizing
the pruning of highly sensitive features causes more severe damage to model
performance than random pruning. We propose `Desensitized Adversarial Training'
(DesenAT), generating adversarial samples using feature desensitization and
conducting training within a self-distillation framework, which aims to
alleviate DNN's over-reliance on point clouds features by smoothing
sensitivity. First, data points with high contribution components are
eliminated, and spatial transformation is used to simulate corruption scenes,
generate adversarial samples, and conduct adversarial training on the model.
Next, to compensate for information loss in adversarial samples, we use the
self-distillation method to transfer knowledge from clean samples to
adversarial samples, and perform adversarial training in a distillation
manner.Extensive experiments on ModelNet-C and PointCloud-C demonstrate show
that the propose method can effectively improve the robustness of the model
without reducing the performance of clean data sets. This code is publicly

Abstract: Sign language translation from text to video plays a crucial role in enabling
effective communication for Deaf and hard--of--hearing individuals. A major
challenge lies in generating accurate and natural body poses and movements that
faithfully convey intended meanings. Prior methods often neglect the anatomical
constraints and coordination patterns of human skeletal motion, resulting in
rigid or biomechanically implausible outputs. To address this, we propose a
novel approach that explicitly models the relationships among skeletal
joints--including shoulders, arms, and hands--by incorporating geometric
constraints on joint positions, bone lengths, and movement dynamics. During
training, we introduce a parent-relative reweighting mechanism to enhance
finger flexibility and reduce motion stiffness. Additionally, bone-pose losses
and bone-length constraints enforce anatomically consistent structures. Our
method narrows the performance gap between the previous best and the
ground-truth oracle by 56.51%, and further reduces discrepancies in bone length
and movement variance by 18.76% and 5.48%, respectively, demonstrating
significant gains in anatomical realism and motion naturalness.

Conclusion: 这项工作为未来使用UMMs进行推理和决策的研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: With the powerful reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) and
vision-language models (VLMs), many recent works have explored using them for
decision-making. However, most of these approaches rely solely on
language-based reasoning, which limits their ability to reason and make
informed decisions. Recently, a promising new direction has emerged with
unified multimodal models (UMMs), which support both multimodal inputs and
outputs. We believe such models have greater potential for decision-making by
enabling reasoning through generated visual content. To this end, we propose
Uni-Plan, a planning framework built on UMMs. Within this framework, a single
model simultaneously serves as the policy, dynamics model, and value function.
In addition, to avoid hallucinations in dynamics predictions, we present a
novel approach self-discriminated filtering, where the generative model serves
as a self-discriminator to filter out invalid dynamics predictions. Experiments
on long-horizon planning tasks show that Uni-Plan substantially improves
success rates compared to VLM-based methods, while also showing strong data
scalability, requiring no expert demonstrations and achieving better
performance under the same training-data size. This work lays a foundation for
future research in reasoning and decision-making with UMMs.

Conclusion: DPM框架基于差分隐私理论，通过条件敏感性度量有效量化扩散模型输出偏差，为版权侵权检测提供了理论基础和实用工具。

Abstract: The widespread deployment of large vision models such as Stable Diffusion
raises significant legal and ethical concerns, as these models can memorize and
reproduce copyrighted content without authorization. Existing detection
approaches often lack robustness and fail to provide rigorous theoretical
underpinnings. To address these gaps, we formalize the concept of copyright
infringement and its detection from the perspective of Differential Privacy
(DP), and introduce the conditional sensitivity metric, a concept analogous to
sensitivity in DP, that quantifies the deviation in a diffusion model's output
caused by the inclusion or exclusion of a specific training data point. To
operationalize this metric, we propose D-Plus-Minus (DPM), a novel post-hoc
detection framework that identifies copyright infringement in text-to-image
diffusion models. Specifically, DPM simulates inclusion and exclusion processes
by fine-tuning models in two opposing directions: learning or unlearning.
Besides, to disentangle concept-specific influence from the global parameter
shifts induced by fine-tuning, DPM computes confidence scores over orthogonal
prompt distributions using statistical metrics. Moreover, to facilitate
standardized benchmarking, we also construct the Copyright Infringement
Detection Dataset (CIDD), a comprehensive resource for evaluating detection
across diverse categories. Our results demonstrate that DPM reliably detects
infringement content without requiring access to the original training dataset
or text prompts, offering an interpretable and practical solution for
safeguarding intellectual property in the era of generative AI.

Abstract: Perceptual losses have emerged as powerful tools for training networks to
enhance Low-Dose Computed Tomography (LDCT) images, offering an alternative to
traditional pixel-wise losses such as Mean Squared Error, which often lead to
over-smoothed reconstructions and loss of clinically relevant details in LDCT
images. The perceptual losses operate in a latent feature space defined by a
pretrained encoder and aim to preserve semantic content by comparing high-level
features rather than raw pixel values. However, the design of perceptual losses
involves critical yet underexplored decisions, including the feature
representation level, the dataset used to pretrain the encoder, and the
relative importance assigned to the perceptual component during optimization.
In this work, we introduce the concept of perceptual influence (a metric that
quantifies the relative contribution of the perceptual loss term to the total
loss) and propose a principled framework to assess the impact of the loss
design choices on the model training performance. Through systematic
experimentation, we show that the widely used configurations in the literature
to set up a perceptual loss underperform compared to better-designed
alternatives. Our findings show that better perceptual loss designs lead to
significant improvements in noise reduction and structural fidelity of
reconstructed CT images, without requiring any changes to the network
architecture. We also provide objective guidelines, supported by statistical
analysis, to inform the effective use of perceptual losses in LDCT denoising.

periods, while multi-sensor fusion methods require substantial computational
resources and large-scale labeled datasets. To address these limitations, this
study introduces a novel sensor-flexible flood detection methodology by
fine-tuning Presto, a lightweight ($\sim$0.4M parameters) multi-modal
pre-trained transformer that processes both Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and
multispectral (MS) data at the pixel level. Our approach uniquely enables flood
mapping using SAR-only, MS-only, or combined SAR+MS inputs through a single
model architecture, addressing the critical operational need for rapid response
with whatever sensor data becomes available first during disasters. We
evaluated our method on the Sen1Floods11 dataset against the large-scale
Prithvi-100M baseline ($\sim$100M parameters) across three realistic data
availability scenarios. The proposed model achieved superior performance with
an F1 score of 0.896 and mIoU of 0.886 in the optimal sensor-fusion scenario,
outperforming the established baseline. Crucially, the model demonstrated
robustness by maintaining effective performance in MS-only scenarios (F1:
0.893) and functional capabilities in challenging SAR-only conditions (F1:
0.718), confirming the advantage of multi-modal pre-training for operational
flood mapping. Our parameter-efficient, sensor-flexible approach offers an
accessible and robust solution for real-world disaster scenarios requiring
immediate flood extent assessment regardless of sensor availability
constraints.

### [41] [GeLoc3r: Enhancing Relative Camera Pose Regression with Geometric Consistency Regularization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23038)
*Jingxing Li,Yongjae Lee,Deliang Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeLoc3r通过几何一致性正则化增强相对相机位姿回归方法，在保持ReLoc3R快速推理速度的同时，接近MASt3R的高精度，解决了速度-精度权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ReLoc3R虽然推理速度快但存在几何不一致性，而基于对应点的方法如MASt3R精度高但推理慢。需要一种既能保持快速推理又能达到高精度的方法。

Method: 提出几何一致性正则化(GCR)，在训练时利用真实深度生成密集3D-2D对应点，通过FusionTransformer学习对应点重要性，使用加权RANSAC计算几何一致位姿，创建一致性损失将几何知识转移到回归网络中。

Result: 在多个基准测试中显著优于ReLoc3R：CO3Dv2数据集AUC@5°从34.85%提升到40.45%(16%相对改进)，RealEstate10K从66.70%提升到68.66%，MegaDepth1500从49.60%提升到50.45%。

Conclusion: GeLoc3r通过在训练时教授几何一致性而非推理时强制执行，代表了神经网络学习相机几何的新范式，同时实现了回归方法的速度和对应点方法的几何理解。

Abstract: Prior ReLoc3R achieves breakthrough performance with fast 25ms inference and
state-of-the-art regression accuracy, yet our analysis reveals subtle geometric
inconsistencies in its internal representations that prevent reaching the
precision ceiling of correspondence-based methods like MASt3R (which require
300ms per pair). In this work, we present GeLoc3r, a novel approach to relative
camera pose estimation that enhances pose regression methods through Geometric
Consistency Regularization (GCR). GeLoc3r overcomes the speed-accuracy dilemma
by training regression networks to produce geometrically consistent poses
without inference-time geometric computation. During training, GeLoc3r
leverages ground-truth depth to generate dense 3D-2D correspondences, weights
them using a FusionTransformer that learns correspondence importance, and
computes geometrically-consistent poses via weighted RANSAC. This creates a
consistency loss that transfers geometric knowledge into the regression
network. Unlike FAR method which requires both regression and geometric solving
at inference, GeLoc3r only uses the enhanced regression head at test time,
maintaining ReLoc3R's fast speed and approaching MASt3R's high accuracy. On
challenging benchmarks, GeLoc3r consistently outperforms ReLoc3R, achieving
significant improvements including 40.45% vs. 34.85% AUC@5{\deg} on the CO3Dv2
dataset (16% relative improvement), 68.66% vs. 66.70% AUC@5{\deg} on
RealEstate10K, and 50.45% vs. 49.60% on MegaDepth1500. By teaching geometric
consistency during training rather than enforcing it at inference, GeLoc3r
represents a paradigm shift in how neural networks learn camera geometry,
achieving both the speed of regression and the geometric understanding of
correspondence methods.

Abstract: Rehabilitation therapy for stroke patients faces a supply shortage despite
the increasing demand. To address this issue, remote monitoring systems that
reduce the burden on medical staff are emerging as a viable alternative. A key
component of these remote monitoring systems is Human Action Recognition (HAR)
technology, which classifies actions. However, existing HAR studies have
primarily focused on non-disable individuals, making them unsuitable for
recognizing the actions of stroke patients. HAR research for stroke has largely
concentrated on classifying relatively simple actions using machine learning
rather than deep learning. In this study, we designed a system to monitor the
actions of stroke patients, focusing on domiciliary upper limb Activities of
Daily Living (ADL). Our system utilizes IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) sensors
and an RGB-D camera, which are the most common modalities in HAR. We directly
collected a dataset through this system, investigated an appropriate preprocess
and proposed a deep learning model suitable for processing multimodal data. We
analyzed the collected dataset and found that the action data of stroke
patients is less clustering than that of non-disabled individuals.
Simultaneously, we found that the proposed model learns similar tendencies for
each label in data with features that are difficult to clustering. This study
suggests the possibility of expanding the deep learning model, which has
learned the action features of stroke patients, to not only simple action
recognition but also feedback such as assessment contributing to domiciliary
rehabilitation in future research. The code presented in this study is
available at https://github.com/ye-Kim/MMeViT.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于激活匹配的方法，为预训练分类器在任意图像上的决策生成最小化且忠实的解释。通过训练轻量级自编码器输出二值掩码，使解释图像保留模型预测和中间激活。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要为预训练分类器的决策提供最小化、忠实且可解释的解释，既要保留模型行为，又要剔除不相关输入区域。

Method: 训练轻量级自编码器生成二值掩码，结合多层激活匹配（KL散度和交叉熵）、掩码先验（L1面积、二值化惩罚、总变差）和溯因约束，确保解释的忠实性和必要性。

Result: 该方法能生成小型、人类可解释的掩码，在保留分类器行为的同时丢弃不相关输入区域。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够为底层模型的决策提供实用且忠实的最小化解释。

Abstract: In this paper we introduce an activation-matching--based approach to generate
minimal, faithful explanations for the decision-making of a pretrained
classifier on any given image. Given an input image \(x\) and a frozen model
\(f\), we train a lightweight autoencoder to output a binary mask \(m\) such
that the explanation \(e = m \odot x\) preserves both the model's prediction
and the intermediate activations of \(x\). Our objective combines: (i)
multi-layer activation matching with KL divergence to align distributions and
cross-entropy to retain the top-1 label for both the image and the explanation;
(ii) mask priors -- L1 area for minimality, a binarization penalty for crisp
0/1 masks, and total variation for compactness; and (iii) abductive constraints
for faithfulness and necessity. Together, these objectives yield small,
human-interpretable masks that retain classifier behavior while discarding
irrelevant input regions, providing practical and faithful minimalist
explanations for the decision making of the underlying model.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种可控的文本引导掩码框架Mask What Matters，用于医学图像的自监督学习，通过视觉语言模型定位关键区域，实现差异化掩码，提升语义对齐和表示学习效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像标注数据稀缺，现有自监督掩码图像建模方法依赖随机高比例掩码，导致效率低下和语义对齐不佳，需要更智能的掩码策略。

Method: 利用视觉语言模型进行基于提示的区域定位，对诊断相关区域实施差异化掩码，减少背景冗余，实现可控的文本引导掩码。

Result: 在脑部MRI、胸部CT和肺部X射线等多种医学影像模态上，分类准确率提升达+3.1个百分点，检测任务中BoxAP提升+1.3，MaskAP提升+1.1，且掩码比例显著降低（40% vs 70%）。

Conclusion: 可控的文本驱动掩码能够实现语义对齐的自监督学习，推动医学图像分析中稳健视觉模型的发展。

Abstract: The scarcity of annotated data in specialized domains such as medical imaging
presents significant challenges to training robust vision models. While
self-supervised masked image modeling (MIM) offers a promising solution,
existing approaches largely rely on random high-ratio masking, leading to
inefficiency and poor semantic alignment. Moreover, region-aware variants
typically depend on reconstruction heuristics or supervised signals, limiting
their adaptability across tasks and modalities. We propose Mask What Matters, a
controllable text-guided masking framework for self-supervised medical image
analysis. By leveraging vision-language models for prompt-based region
localization, our method flexibly applies differentiated masking to emphasize
diagnostically relevant regions while reducing redundancy in background areas.
This controllable design enables better semantic alignment, improved
representation learning, and stronger cross-task generalizability.
Comprehensive evaluation across multiple medical imaging modalities, including
brain MRI, chest CT, and lung X-ray, shows that Mask What Matters consistently
outperforms existing MIM methods (e.g., SparK), achieving gains of up to +3.1
percentage points in classification accuracy, +1.3 in box average precision
(BoxAP), and +1.1 in mask average precision (MaskAP) for detection. Notably, it
achieves these improvements with substantially lower overall masking ratios
(e.g., 40\% vs. 70\%). This work demonstrates that controllable, text-driven
masking can enable semantically aligned self-supervised learning, advancing the
development of robust vision models for medical image analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FMC-DETR是一种用于航空视角目标检测的新框架，通过频率解耦融合解决小目标检测难题，在VisDrone数据集上比基线提升6.5% AP和8.2% AP50。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高分辨率航空图像中小目标检测的挑战，包括有限的视觉线索和复杂场景中全局上下文建模困难，现有方法存在上下文融合延迟和非线性建模不足的问题。

Method: 提出FMC-DETR框架：1) WeKat骨干网络使用级联小波变换增强浅层特征的全局低频上下文感知；2) 轻量级跨阶段部分融合模块减少冗余；3) 多域特征协调模块统一空间、频率和结构先验。

Result: 在基准航空视角数据集上实现最先进性能，参数更少。在VisDrone数据集上比基线提升6.5% AP和8.2% AP50。

Conclusion: FMC-DETR通过频率解耦融合有效解决了航空图像小目标检测问题，在保持细节的同时增强全局上下文感知，实现了优越的性能。

Abstract: Aerial-view object detection is a critical technology for real-world
applications such as natural resource monitoring, traffic management, and
UAV-based search and rescue. Detecting tiny objects in high-resolution aerial
imagery presents a long-standing challenge due to their limited visual cues and
the difficulty of modeling global context in complex scenes. Existing methods
are often hampered by delayed contextual fusion and inadequate non-linear
modeling, failing to effectively use global information to refine shallow
features and thus encountering a performance bottleneck. To address these
challenges, we propose FMC-DETR, a novel framework with frequency-decoupled
fusion for aerial-view object detection. First, we introduce the Wavelet
Kolmogorov-Arnold Transformer (WeKat) backbone, which applies cascaded wavelet
transforms to enhance global low-frequency context perception in shallow
features while preserving fine-grained details, and employs Kolmogorov-Arnold
networks to achieve adaptive non-linear modeling of multi-scale dependencies.
Next, a lightweight Cross-stage Partial Fusion (CPF) module reduces redundancy
and improves multi-scale feature interaction. Finally, we introduce the
Multi-Domain Feature Coordination (MDFC) module, which unifies spatial,
frequency, and structural priors to to balance detail preservation and global
enhancement. Extensive experiments on benchmark aerial-view datasets
demonstrate that FMC-DETR achieves state-of-the-art performance with fewer
parameters. On the challenging VisDrone dataset, our model achieves
improvements of 6.5% AP and 8.2% AP50 over the baseline, highlighting its
effectiveness in tiny object detection. The code can be accessed at

TL;DR: 本文研究图像修复中的偏好对齐问题，通过直接偏好优化方法和公共奖励模型构建训练数据集，发现奖励模型存在可观察的偏见，但通过简单集成可以缓解这些偏见，从而显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 回到基础，重新审视图像修复中实现偏好对齐的基本问题，而不是引入新方法。

Method: 利用直接偏好优化方法进行对齐训练，使用公共奖励模型构建偏好训练数据集，在9个奖励模型、2个基准和2个基线模型上进行实验。

Result: 发现奖励模型存在亮度、构图和色彩方案等偏见，容易导致奖励破解，但通过模型集成可以缓解偏见并获得稳健结果。对齐模型在标准指标、GPT-4评估和人工评估中显著优于先前模型。

Conclusion: 通过简单集成奖励模型可以缓解偏见，获得稳健和可泛化的结果，为图像修复偏好对齐领域设定了简单而坚实的基线。

Abstract: This paper investigates image inpainting with preference alignment. Instead
of introducing a novel method, we go back to basics and revisit fundamental
problems in achieving such alignment. We leverage the prominent direct
preference optimization approach for alignment training and employ public
reward models to construct preference training datasets. Experiments are
conducted across nine reward models, two benchmarks, and two baseline models
with varying structures and generative algorithms. Our key findings are as
follows: (1) Most reward models deliver valid reward scores for constructing
preference data, even if some of them are not reliable evaluators. (2)
Preference data demonstrates robust trends in both candidate scaling and sample
scaling across models and benchmarks. (3) Observable biases in reward models,
particularly in brightness, composition, and color scheme, render them
susceptible to cause reward hacking. (4) A simple ensemble of these models
yields robust and generalizable results by mitigating such biases. Built upon
these observations, our alignment models significantly outperform prior models
across standard metrics, GPT-4 assessments, and human evaluations, without any
changes to model structures or the use of new datasets. We hope our work can
set a simple yet solid baseline, pushing this promising frontier. Our code is

TL;DR: XMAG是一个轻量级基础模型，通过跨放大倍数蒸馏技术，将20x放大倍数的教师模型知识转移到5x放大倍数的学生架构，实现11.3倍更少的全切片图像处理需求，在保持诊断准确率接近大型模型的同时达到30倍处理加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基础模型在计算病理学中参数庞大、处理高放大倍数图像需求高，难以在临床环境中部署。需要开发轻量级模型以降低计算需求，实现临床实时应用。

Method: 采用跨放大倍数蒸馏框架，包含双级知识转移（全局图像表示和局部空间令牌映射对齐），使用紧凑骨干网络在5x放大倍数下运行，并在349万张公开数据集图像上训练。

Result: 在六个临床相关组织病理学分析任务中，XMAG的诊断准确率与大型基础模型相差不到1%，同时实现30倍处理加速，达到每分钟8.8个全切片图像的处理速度，跨机构验证显示良好泛化能力。

Conclusion: 跨放大倍数蒸馏是资源受限临床环境中部署基础模型能力的可行方法，有望实现实时病理AI集成。

Abstract: Foundation models (FM) have transformed computational pathology but remain
computationally prohibitive for clinical deployment due to their massive
parameter counts and high-magnification processing requirements. Here, we
introduce XMAG, a lightweight FM developed through corss-magnification
distillation that transfers knowledge from state-of-the-art 20x magnification
teacher to an efficient 5x magnification student architecture. XMAG employs a
compact backbone and operates entirely at 5x, requiring 11.3 times fewer
patches per whole slide image (WSI) compared to existing approaches. Our Novel
distillation framework incorporates dual-level knowledge transfer, aligning
both global image representations and local spatial token mapping. We trained
XMAG on 3.49 million images curated from publicly available datasets and
evaluated performance across six clinically relevant histopathology analysis
tasks spanning multiple cancer types. XMAG achieved diagnostic accuracy within
1% of substantially larger foundation models while delivering 30-fold
processing acceleration, reaching 8.8 WSIs per minute processing speed. Our
cross-institutional validation confirmed robust generalization. Further, we
developed an end-to-end training strategy to further boost our model's
performance to approach the larger FMs' performance. These results establish
cross-magnification distillation as a viable approach for deploying FM
capabilities in resource-constrained clinical environments, potentially
enabling real-time pathology AI integration.

*Na Min An,Inha Kang,Minhyun Lee,Hyunjung Shim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoPatch是一个零样本参考图像分割框架，通过利用模型内部组件增强文本和图像的空间表示，无需额外训练即可显著提升空间定位能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基础视觉语言模型（如CLIP）在图像文本对齐方面表现出色，但在理解空间关系方面存在困难。文本流中现有方法通常只关注主要名词短语，忽略了上下文标记；视觉流中CLIP对具有不同空间布局的图像生成相似特征，导致对空间结构的敏感性有限。

Method: CoPatch框架在语言方面构建包含空间线索上下文标记的混合文本特征；在视觉方面从中间层提取补丁级图像特征，这些层能更好地保留空间结构。增强的特征融合到聚类的图像-文本相似度图CoMap中，实现精确的掩码选择。

Result: CoPatch在RefCOCO、RefCOCO+、RefCOCOg和PhraseCut数据集上显著提升了零样本参考图像分割的空间定位能力（+2-7 mIoU），无需任何额外训练。

Conclusion: 研究强调了恢复和利用视觉语言模型中固有的未开发空间知识的重要性，为零样本参考图像分割开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Spatial grounding is crucial for referring image segmentation (RIS), where
the goal of the task is to localize an object described by language. Current
foundational vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, excel at aligning
images and text but struggle with understanding spatial relationships. Within
the language stream, most existing methods often focus on the primary noun
phrase when extracting local text features, undermining contextual tokens.
Within the vision stream, CLIP generates similar features for images with
different spatial layouts, resulting in limited sensitivity to spatial
structure. To address these limitations, we propose \textsc{CoPatch}, a
zero-shot RIS framework that leverages internal model components to enhance
spatial representations in both text and image modalities. For language,
\textsc{CoPatch} constructs hybrid text features by incorporating context
tokens carrying spatial cues. For vision, it extracts patch-level image
features using our novel path discovered from intermediate layers, where
spatial structure is better preserved. These enhanced features are fused into a
clustered image-text similarity map, \texttt{CoMap}, enabling precise mask
selection. As a result, \textsc{CoPatch} significantly improves spatial
grounding in zero-shot RIS across RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, RefCOCOg, and PhraseCut (+
2--7 mIoU) without requiring any additional training. Our findings underscore
the importance of recovering and leveraging the untapped spatial knowledge
inherently embedded in VLMs, thereby paving the way for opportunities in
zero-shot RIS.

the performance of five state-of-the-art transformer-based architectures -
Vision Transformer (ViT), Data-efficient Image Transformer (DeiT), ConvNeXt,
Swin Transformer, and Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Image

Motivation: 降低乘法运算成本对能效受限的边缘设备部署深度神经网络至关重要，特别是在卷积层中减少乘法操作。

Method: HTMA-Net选择性地用混合哈达玛变换层替换中间卷积层，这些变换层内部的卷积通过免乘法内存操作实现，结合了哈达玛变换和SRAM内存计算技术。

Result: 在ResNet-18、ResNet-20和ResNet-50模型上，HTMA-Net相比基线模型最多减少52%的乘法运算，同时保持相当的准确率，并显著降低计算复杂度和参数数量。

Conclusion: 将结构化哈达玛变换层与SRAM内存计算免乘法算子相结合，是实现高效深度学习架构的有前景路径。

Abstract: Reducing the cost of multiplications is critical for efficient deep neural
network deployment, especially in energy-constrained edge devices. In this
work, we introduce HTMA-Net, a novel framework that integrates the Hadamard
Transform (HT) with multiplication-avoiding (MA) SRAM-based in-memory computing
to reduce arithmetic complexity while maintaining accuracy. Unlike prior
methods that only target multiplications in convolutional layers or focus
solely on in-memory acceleration, HTMA-Net selectively replaces intermediate
convolutions with Hybrid Hadamard-based transform layers whose internal
convolutions are implemented via multiplication-avoiding in-memory operations.
We evaluate HTMA-Net on ResNet-18 using CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny ImageNet,
and provide a detailed comparison against regular, MF-only, and HT-only
variants. Results show that HTMA-Net eliminates up to 52\% of multiplications
compared to baseline ResNet-18, ResNet-20, and ResNet-50 models, while
achieving comparable accuracy in evaluation and significantly reducing
computational complexity and the number of parameters. Our results demonstrate
that combining structured Hadamard transform layers with SRAM-based in-memory
computing multiplication-avoiding operators is a promising path towards
efficient deep learning architectures.

Abstract: Remote sensing change understanding (RSCU) is essential for analyzing remote
sensing images and understanding how human activities affect the environment.
However, existing datasets lack deep understanding and interactions in the
diverse change captioning, counting, and localization tasks. To tackle these
gaps, we construct ChangeIMTI, a new large-scale interactive multi-task
instruction dataset that encompasses four complementary tasks including change
captioning, binary change classification, change counting, and change
localization. Building upon this new dataset, we further design a novel
vision-guided vision-language model (ChangeVG) with dual-granularity awareness
for bi-temporal remote sensing images (i.e., two remote sensing images of the
same area at different times). The introduced vision-guided module is a
dual-branch architecture that synergistically combines fine-grained spatial
feature extraction with high-level semantic summarization. These enriched
representations further serve as the auxiliary prompts to guide large
vision-language models (VLMs) (e.g., Qwen2.5-VL-7B) during instruction tuning,
thereby facilitating the hierarchical cross-modal learning. We extensively
conduct experiments across four tasks to demonstrate the superiority of our
approach. Remarkably, on the change captioning task, our method outperforms the
strongest method Semantic-CC by 1.39 points on the comprehensive S*m metric,
which integrates the semantic similarity and descriptive accuracy to provide an
overall evaluation of change caption. Moreover, we also perform a series of
ablation studies to examine the critical components of our method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像生成模型在计算量和保真度之间存在权衡问题：基于预训练VAE的模型存在信息丢失、细节有限且无法端到端训练；直接在像素空间操作的模型计算成本过高；级联模型虽然能降低计算成本，但阶段分离阻碍了端到端优化和知识共享。

Method: 采用条件依赖耦合策略，将生成过程分解为多阶段插值轨迹，整个过程建模为单一的统一扩散Transformer，消除了分离模块的需求并支持知识共享。

Result: 大量实验表明，该方法在多个分辨率下同时实现了高保真度和高效率。

Conclusion: 提出的统一多阶段生成框架成功解决了图像生成中计算效率与保真度之间的权衡问题，通过端到端优化和知识共享实现了更好的性能。

Abstract: Existing image generation models face critical challenges regarding the
trade-off between computation and fidelity. Specifically, models relying on a
pretrained Variational Autoencoder (VAE) suffer from information loss, limited
detail, and the inability to support end-to-end training. In contrast, models
operating directly in the pixel space incur prohibitive computational cost.
Although cascade models can mitigate computational cost, stage-wise separation
prevents effective end-to-end optimization, hampers knowledge sharing, and
often results in inaccurate distribution learning within each stage. To address
these challenges, we introduce a unified multistage generative framework based
on our proposed Conditional Dependent Coupling strategy. It decomposes the
generative process into interpolant trajectories at multiple stages, ensuring
accurate distribution learning while enabling end-to-end optimization.
Importantly, the entire process is modeled as a single unified Diffusion
Transformer, eliminating the need for disjoint modules and also enabling
knowledge sharing. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves
both high fidelity and efficiency across multiple resolutions.

Abstract: Non-contrast computed tomography (NCCT) is essential for rapid stroke
diagnosis but is limited by low image contrast and signal to noise ratio. We
address this challenge by leveraging DINOv3, a state-of-the-art self-supervised
vision transformer, to generate powerful feature representations for a
comprehensive set of stroke analysis tasks. Our evaluation encompasses infarct
and hemorrhage segmentation, anomaly classification (normal vs. stroke and
normal vs. infarct vs. hemorrhage), hemorrhage subtype classification (EDH,
SDH, SAH, IPH, IVH), and dichotomized ASPECTS classification (<=6 vs. >6) on
multiple public and private datasets. This study establishes strong benchmarks
for these tasks and demonstrates the potential of advanced self-supervised
models to improve automated stroke diagnosis from NCCT, providing a clear
analysis of both the advantages and current constraints of the approach. The

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前MLLMs在处理需要多步骤推理和领域特定工具的复杂地球观测任务时能力不足，现有基于代理的方法局限于RGB感知、浅层推理且缺乏系统评估协议。

Method: 构建Earth-Agent框架，在MCP基础上统一RGB和光谱EO数据，动态调用跨模态的专家工具和模型，支持地球物理参数检索和定量时空分析等复杂科学任务。

Result: 开发了Earth-Bench基准测试，包含248个专家策划任务和13,729张图像，涵盖光谱、产品和RGB模态，采用双级评估协议评估推理轨迹和最终结果。实验验证了Earth-Agent在不同LLM骨干、与通用代理框架和MLLMs比较中的有效性。

Conclusion: Earth-Agent为地球观测分析建立了新范式，推动该领域向科学基础扎实的下一代LLMs应用发展。

Abstract: Earth observation (EO) is essential for understanding the evolving states of
the Earth system. Although recent MLLMs have advanced EO research, they still
lack the capability to tackle complex tasks that require multi-step reasoning
and the use of domain-specific tools. Agent-based methods offer a promising
direction, but current attempts remain in their infancy, confined to RGB
perception, shallow reasoning, and lacking systematic evaluation protocols. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce Earth-Agent, the first agentic
framework that unifies RGB and spectral EO data within an MCP-based tool
ecosystem, enabling cross-modal, multi-step, and quantitative spatiotemporal
reasoning beyond pretrained MLLMs. Earth-Agent supports complex scientific
tasks such as geophysical parameter retrieval and quantitative spatiotemporal
analysis by dynamically invoking expert tools and models across modalities. To
support comprehensive evaluation, we further propose Earth-Bench, a benchmark
of 248 expert-curated tasks with 13,729 images, spanning spectrum, products and
RGB modalities, and equipped with a dual-level evaluation protocol that
assesses both reasoning trajectories and final outcomes. We conduct
comprehensive experiments varying different LLM backbones, comparisons with
general agent frameworks, and comparisons with MLLMs on remote sensing
benchmarks, demonstrating both the effectiveness and potential of Earth-Agent.
Earth-Agent establishes a new paradigm for EO analysis, moving the field toward
scientifically grounded, next-generation applications of LLMs in Earth
observation. Our code and dataset will be publicly released.

TL;DR: WeatherCycle是一个统一的非配对框架，通过双向退化-内容转换循环和退化感知课程正则化来解决多天气条件下的图像恢复问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图像恢复方法通常依赖特定任务的物理先验，其狭窄的焦点限制了在多样化真实世界天气场景中的可扩展性和泛化能力。

Method: 采用亮度-色度分解策略分离退化与内容，提出Lumina退化引导模块(LDGM)学习亮度退化先验，并通过难度感知对比正则化(DACR)模块增强语义一致性。

Result: 在多个多天气数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在无监督方法中实现了最先进的性能，对复杂天气退化具有强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: WeatherCycle通过统一的非配对框架成功解决了多天气条件下的图像恢复问题，无需建模复杂天气即可实现退化与内容的解耦。

Abstract: Unsupervised image restoration under multi-weather conditions remains a
fundamental yet underexplored challenge. While existing methods often rely on
task-specific physical priors, their narrow focus limits scalability and
generalization to diverse real-world weather scenarios. In this work, we
propose \textbf{WeatherCycle}, a unified unpaired framework that reformulates
weather restoration as a bidirectional degradation-content translation cycle,
guided by degradation-aware curriculum regularization. At its core,
WeatherCycle employs a \textit{lumina-chroma decomposition} strategy to
decouple degradation from content without modeling complex weather, enabling
domain conversion between degraded and clean images. To model diverse and
complex degradations, we propose a \textit{Lumina Degradation Guidance Module}
(LDGM), which learns luminance degradation priors from a degraded image pool
and injects them into clean images via frequency-domain amplitude modulation,
enabling controllable and realistic degradation modeling. Additionally, we
incorporate a \textit{Difficulty-Aware Contrastive Regularization (DACR)}
module that identifies hard samples via a CLIP-based classifier and enforces
contrastive alignment between hard samples and restored features to enhance
semantic consistency and robustness. Extensive experiments across serve
multi-weather datasets, demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance among unsupervised approaches, with strong generalization to
complex weather degradations.

TL;DR: Sparse2Dense是一个基于关键点的生成框架，使用稀疏3D关键点作为传输符号，实现超低码率人体视频压缩和精确顶点预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决带宽受限多媒体应用中同时实现超低码率人体视频压缩和准确顶点预测的挑战，需要协调动态运动建模、细节外观合成和几何一致性。

Method: 提出多任务学习和关键点感知的深度生成模型，通过紧凑3D关键点编码复杂人体运动，并利用这些稀疏关键点估计密集运动以实现时间一致性和真实纹理的视频合成，同时集成顶点预测器学习人体顶点几何。

Conclusion: Sparse2Dense有望促进带宽高效的人体中心媒体传输，如实时运动分析、虚拟人动画和沉浸式娱乐。

Abstract: For bandwidth-constrained multimedia applications, simultaneously achieving
ultra-low bitrate human video compression and accurate vertex prediction
remains a critical challenge, as it demands the harmonization of dynamic motion
modeling, detailed appearance synthesis, and geometric consistency. To address
this challenge, we propose Sparse2Dense, a keypoint-driven generative framework
that leverages extremely sparse 3D keypoints as compact transmitted symbols to
enable ultra-low bitrate human video compression and precise human vertex
prediction. The key innovation is the multi-task learning-based and
keypoint-aware deep generative model, which could encode complex human motion
via compact 3D keypoints and leverage these sparse keypoints to estimate dense
motion for video synthesis with temporal coherence and realistic textures.
Additionally, a vertex predictor is integrated to learn human vertex geometry
through joint optimization with video generation, ensuring alignment between
visual content and geometric structure. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
the proposed Sparse2Dense framework achieves competitive compression
performance for human video over traditional/generative video codecs, whilst
enabling precise human vertex prediction for downstream geometry applications.
As such, Sparse2Dense is expected to facilitate bandwidth-efficient
human-centric media transmission, such as real-time motion analysis, virtual
human animation, and immersive entertainment.

Conclusion: 这项工作为实现可扩展的AI驱动车轴计数系统迈出重要一步，为机器视觉替代传统路边基础设施铺平道路。

Abstract: Accurate counting of vehicle axles is essential for traffic control, toll
collection, and infrastructure development. We present an end-to-end,
video-based pipeline for axle counting that tackles limitations of previous
works in dense environments. Our system leverages a combination of YOLO-OBB to
detect and categorize vehicles, and YOLO to detect tires. Detected tires are
intelligently associated to their respective parent vehicles, enabling accurate
axle prediction even in complex scenarios. However, there are a few challenges
in detection when it comes to scenarios with longer and occluded vehicles. We
mitigate vehicular occlusions and partial detections for longer vehicles by
proposing a novel TRAX (Tire and Axle Tracking) Algorithm to successfully track
axle-related features between frames. Our method stands out by significantly
reducing false positives and improving the accuracy of axle-counting for long
vehicles, demonstrating strong robustness in real-world traffic videos. This
work represents a significant step toward scalable, AI-driven axle counting
systems, paving the way for machine vision to replace legacy roadside
infrastructure.

*Behraj Khan,Tahir Qasim Syed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CalSAM是一个轻量级适配框架，通过特征Fisher信息惩罚和置信度错位惩罚来提升SAM模型在医学图像分割中的域泛化能力和校准性能，同时保持编码器冻结。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM模型在自然图像上表现出强大的零样本性能，但在医学体积图像上存在域偏移和过度自信的问题，需要改进其域泛化能力和不确定性校准。

Method: 提出CalSAM框架：(1) 使用特征Fisher信息惩罚减少编码器对域偏移的敏感性；(2) 使用置信度错位惩罚惩罚过度自信的体素级错误；(3) 仅微调掩码解码器，保持SAM编码器冻结。

Result: 在跨中心和扫描仪偏移评估中，CalSAM显著提升准确性和校准：BraTS扫描仪分割上DSC相对提升7.4%，HD95减少26.9%，ECE减少39.5%；ATLAS-C上DSC相对提升5.3%，ECE减少32.6%。

Conclusion: CalSAM在脑MRI分割中实现了改进的域泛化和更好的不确定性校准，同时保留了冻结SAM编码器的计算优势，FIP和CMP贡献互补性增益。

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model (SAM) exhibits strong zero-shot performance on
natural images but suffers from domain shift and overconfidence when applied to
medical volumes. We propose \textbf{CalSAM}, a lightweight adaptation framework
that (i) reduces encoder sensitivity to domain shift via a \emph{Feature Fisher
Information Penalty} (FIP) computed on 3D feature maps and (ii) penalizes
overconfident voxel-wise errors through a \emph{Confidence Misalignment
Penalty} (CMP). The combined loss, \(\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{CalSAM}}\) fine-tunes
only the mask decoder while keeping SAM's encoders frozen. On cross-center and
scanner-shift evaluations, CalSAM substantially improves accuracy and
calibration: e.g., on the BraTS scanner split (Siemens$\to$GE) CalSAM shows a
$+7.4\%$ relative improvement in $\mathrm{DSC}$ (80.1\% vs.\ 74.6\%), a
$-26.9\%$ reduction in $\mathrm{HD95}$ (4.6 mm vs.\ 6.3 mm), and a $-39.5\%$
reduction in $\mathrm{ECE}$ (5.2\% vs.\ 8.6\%). On ATLAS-C (motion
corruptions), CalSAM achieves a $+5.3\%$ relative improvement in $\mathrm{DSC}$
(75.9\%) and a $-32.6\%$ reduction in $\mathrm{ECE}$ (5.8\%). Ablations show
FIP and CMP contribute complementary gains ($p<0.01$), and the Fisher penalty
incurs a modest $\sim$15\% training-time overhead. CalSAM therefore delivers
improved domain generalization and better-calibrated uncertainty estimates for
brain MRI segmentation, while retaining the computational benefits of freezing
SAM's encoder.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无监督在线3D实例分割方法（如UNIT）存在训练多样性有限、时间采样僵化、对噪声伪标签依赖严重等问题，需要改进以提升分割精度和时间关联鲁棒性。

Method: 1）合成点云序列生成增强训练分布多样性；2）灵活采样策略结合相邻和非相邻帧捕捉长短期依赖；3）动态加权损失强调置信度高和信息丰富的样本。

Result: 在SemanticKITTI、nuScenes和PandaSet数据集上均优于UNIT和其他无监督基线方法，获得了更高的分割精度和更鲁棒的时间关联。

Conclusion: 所提出的框架通过增强训练多样性、改进时间建模和优化损失函数，显著提升了无监督在线3D实例分割的性能，代码将开源。

Abstract: Unsupervised online 3D instance segmentation is a fundamental yet challenging
task, as it requires maintaining consistent object identities across LiDAR
scans without relying on annotated training data. Existing methods, such as
UNIT, have made progress in this direction but remain constrained by limited
training diversity, rigid temporal sampling, and heavy dependence on noisy
pseudo-labels. We propose a new framework that enriches the training
distribution through synthetic point cloud sequence generation, enabling
greater diversity without relying on manual labels or simulation engines. To
better capture temporal dynamics, our method incorporates a flexible sampling
strategy that leverages both adjacent and non-adjacent frames, allowing the
model to learn from long-range dependencies as well as short-term variations.
In addition, a dynamic-weighting loss emphasizes confident and informative
samples, guiding the network toward more robust representations. Through
extensive experiments on SemanticKITTI, nuScenes, and PandaSet, our method
consistently outperforms UNIT and other unsupervised baselines, achieving
higher segmentation accuracy and more robust temporal associations. The code
will be publicly available at github.com/Eaphan/SFT3D.

Method: 使用查询高效的零阶贪婪算法，通过逐步添加高斯斑点来优化额头上的对称灰度补丁，仅依赖代理FR模型的余弦相似度分数

Result: 仅需约10,000次查询即可在黑盒ArcFace模型上实现高攻击成功率，在数字和现实物理测试中均有效，并能成功欺骗未见过的FaceNet模型

Conclusion: 这项工作揭示了人脸识别系统的严重漏洞，证明即使对目标系统了解有限，也能构建出鲁棒且可转移的对抗攻击

Abstract: Adversarial attacks on face recognition (FR) systems pose a significant
security threat, yet most are confined to the digital domain or require
white-box access. We introduce GaP (Gaussian Patch), a novel method to generate
a universal, physically transferable adversarial patch under a strict black-box
setting. Our approach uses a query-efficient, zero-order greedy algorithm to
iteratively construct a symmetric, grayscale pattern for the forehead. The
patch is optimized by successively adding Gaussian blobs, guided only by the
cosine similarity scores from a surrogate FR model to maximally degrade
identity recognition. We demonstrate that with approximately 10,000 queries to
a black-box ArcFace model, the resulting GaP achieves a high attack success
rate in both digital and real-world physical tests. Critically, the attack
shows strong transferability, successfully deceiving an entirely unseen FaceNet
model. Our work highlights a practical and severe vulnerability, proving that
robust, transferable attacks can be crafted with limited knowledge of the
target system.

Abstract: Ultrasound tongue imaging (UTI) is a non-invasive and cost-effective tool for

real-time tongue contour segmentation remains challenging due to low

*Seongsoo Heo,Dong-Wan Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Patch Rebirth Inversion (PRI)方法，通过渐进式分离重要patch来构建稀疏合成图像，同时让剩余patch继续演化，解决了ViT模型反演的计算效率问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Sparse Model Inversion (SMI)方法过早丢弃看似不重要的patch，但研究发现这些patch实际上能通过持续反演获得可转移知识，丢弃它们会抑制类无关特征的提取。

Method: PRI在反演过程中逐步分离最重要的patch来构建稀疏图像，同时允许剩余patch继续演化以供未来选择，实现渐进式稀疏化。

Result: PRI比标准Dense Model Inversion (DMI)快10倍，比SMI快2倍，在准确率上持续优于SMI并与DMI相当。

Conclusion: PRI通过Rebirth效应有效平衡了类无关和类特定知识，在保持性能的同时显著提升了ViT模型反演效率。

Abstract: Model inversion is a widely adopted technique in data-free learning that
reconstructs synthetic inputs from a pretrained model through iterative
optimization, without access to original training data. Unfortunately, its
application to state-of-the-art Vision Transformers (ViTs) poses a major
computational challenge, due to their expensive self-attention mechanisms. To
address this, Sparse Model Inversion (SMI) was proposed to improve efficiency
by pruning and discarding seemingly unimportant patches, which were even
claimed to be obstacles to knowledge transfer. However, our empirical findings
suggest the opposite: even randomly selected patches can eventually acquire
transferable knowledge through continued inversion. This reveals that
discarding any prematurely inverted patches is inefficient, as it suppresses
the extraction of class-agnostic features essential for knowledge transfer,
along with class-specific features. In this paper, we propose Patch Rebirth
Inversion (PRI), a novel approach that incrementally detaches the most
important patches during the inversion process to construct sparse synthetic
images, while allowing the remaining patches to continue evolving for future
selection. This progressive strategy not only improves efficiency, but also
encourages initially less informative patches to gradually accumulate more
class-relevant knowledge, a phenomenon we refer to as the Re-Birth effect,
thereby effectively balancing class-agnostic and class-specific knowledge.
Experimental results show that PRI achieves up to 10x faster inversion than
standard Dense Model Inversion (DMI) and 2x faster than SMI, while consistently
outperforming SMI in accuracy and matching the performance of DMI.

Motivation: 视觉语言模型经常产生幻觉细节，生成不存在对象或不准确属性，影响输出可靠性。现有方法依赖大量人工标注或更强大模型的外部监督。

Method: 设计自反思管道，将详细模型回答与简洁二元答案进行比较，利用不一致信号自动筛选高质量训练数据。基于短二元问题通常产生可靠回答的观察，通过自一致性评估和排序生成回答。

Result: 在多个基准测试（AMBER、MultiObject-Hal、Object HalBench、MMHal-Bench）上显著改善事实基础和可靠性，同时在LLaVA-Bench和MMBench上保持强大的指令遵循能力。

Conclusion: 该方法仅依赖自一致性而非外部监督，提供了一种可扩展且高效的解决方案，能够有效利用未标记数据减少幻觉，同时保持模型性能。

Abstract: Vision-language models often hallucinate details, generating non-existent
objects or inaccurate attributes that compromise output reliability. Existing
methods typically address these issues via extensive human annotations or
external supervision from more powerful models. In this work, we present a
novel framework that leverages the model's self-consistency between long
responses and short answers to generate preference pairs for training. We
observe that short binary questions tend to yield highly reliable responses,
which can be used to query the target model to evaluate and rank its generated
responses. Specifically, we design a self-reflection pipeline where detailed
model responses are compared against concise binary answers, and inconsistency
signals are utilized to automatically curate high-quality training data without
human annotations or external model-based supervision. By relying solely on
self-consistency rather than external supervision, our method offers a scalable
and efficient solution that effectively reduces hallucinations using unlabeled
data. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks, i.e., AMBER,
MultiObject-Hal (ROPE), Object HalBench, and MMHal-Bench, demonstrate
significant improvements in factual grounding and reliability. Moreover, our
approach maintains robust instruction-following ability, as evidenced by
enhanced performance on LLaVA-Bench and MMBench.

Motivation: 传统时尚搭配推荐方法需要昂贵的大规模标注数据和任务特定训练，且缺乏明确的人类美学指导。在MLLM时代，可以将传统训练流程简化为无需训练的模式。

Method: 使用MLLMs生成目标物品描述，通过美学链式思维将图像提炼为结构化美学档案，包括颜色、风格、场合、季节、材料和平衡度，采用动态熵门控机制融合视觉摘要、文本描述和美学向量。

Conclusion: TATTOO证明了在MLLM时代，传统基于训练的方法可以简化为无需训练的范式，获得更好的推荐分数和增强的美学感知能力。

Abstract: The global fashion e-commerce market relies significantly on intelligent and
aesthetic-aware outfit-completion tools to promote sales. While previous
studies have approached the problem of fashion outfit-completion and
compatible-item retrieval, most of them require expensive, task-specific
training on large-scale labeled data, and no effort is made to guide outfit
recommendation with explicit human aesthetics. In the era of Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs), we show that the conventional training-based pipeline
could be streamlined to a training-free paradigm, with better recommendation
scores and enhanced aesthetic awareness. We achieve this with TATTOO, a
Training-free AesTheTic-aware Outfit recommendation approach. It first
generates a target-item description using MLLMs, followed by an aesthetic
chain-of-thought used to distill the images into a structured aesthetic profile
including color, style, occasion, season, material, and balance. By fusing the
visual summary of the outfit with the textual description and aesthetics
vectors using a dynamic entropy-gated mechanism, candidate items can be
represented in a shared embedding space and be ranked accordingly. Experiments
on a real-world evaluation set Aesthetic-100 show that TATTOO achieves
state-of-the-art performance compared with existing training-based methods.
Another standard Polyvore dataset is also used to measure the advanced
zero-shot retrieval capability of our training-free method.

Abstract: Thermal imaging in Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) improves road
safety with superior perception in low-light and harsh weather conditions
compared to traditional RGB cameras. However, research in this area faces
challenges due to limited dataset availability and poor representation in
driving simulators. RGB-to-thermal image translation offers a potential
solution, but existing methods focus on one-to-one mappings. We propose a
one-to-many mapping using a multi-modal translation framework enhanced with our
Component-aware Adaptive Instance Normalization (CoAdaIN). Unlike the original
AdaIN, which applies styles globally, CoAdaIN adapts styles to different image
components individually. The result, as we show, is more realistic and diverse
thermal image translations. This is the accepted author manuscript of the paper

*Sasan Sharifipour,Constantino Álvarez Casado,Le Nguyen,Tharindu Ekanayake,Manuel Lage Cañellas,Nhi Nguyen,Miguel Bordallo López*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于图谱分析的人体活动识别方法，使用LiDAR点云构建邻近图并计算拉普拉斯谱，通过特征值和特征向量统计形成姿态描述符，在MM-Fi数据集上达到94.4%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LiDAR点云提供隐私保护且对光照鲁棒，可作为摄像头的替代方案用于人体活动识别，需要开发基于点云几何的紧凑可解释特征集。

Method: 将LiDAR帧映射为邻近图（ε-图），计算拉普拉斯谱，使用特征值和特征向量统计形成姿态描述符，通过滑动窗口的时序统计生成固定向量，使用支持向量机和随机森林进行分类。

Result: 在MM-Fi数据集（40个受试者，27种活动）的严格受试者独立协议下，在13类康复活动上达到94.4%准确率，在所有27种活动上达到90.3%准确率，超越了基于骨架的基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法直接从点云几何中提取紧凑可解释的特征集，为端到端深度学习提供了准确高效的替代方案。

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition supports applications in healthcare,
manufacturing, and human-machine interaction. LiDAR point clouds offer a
privacy-preserving alternative to cameras and are robust to illumination. We
propose a HAR method based on graph spectral analysis. Each LiDAR frame is
mapped to a proximity graph (epsilon-graph) and the Laplacian spectrum is
computed. Eigenvalues and statistics of eigenvectors form pose descriptors, and
temporal statistics over sliding windows yield fixed vectors for classification
with support vector machines and random forests. On the MM-Fi dataset with 40
subjects and 27 activities, under a strict subject-independent protocol, the
method reaches 94.4% accuracy on a 13-class rehabilitation set and 90.3% on all
27 activities. It also surpasses the skeleton-based baselines reported for
MM-Fi. The contribution is a compact and interpretable feature set derived
directly from point cloud geometry that provides an accurate and efficient
alternative to end-to-end deep learning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OracleGS是一个新颖的稀疏视图合成框架，通过"提议-验证"机制结合生成模型的完整性和回归模型的几何保真度，使用3D感知扩散模型生成完整场景，再利用多视图立体模型作为3D感知预言机验证生成视图的不确定性，指导3D高斯溅射优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏视图新视角合成存在严重的几何模糊性，现有方法陷入两难：回归模型几何保真但不完整，生成模型能补全场景但常引入结构不一致性。需要一种能同时兼顾生成完整性和回归保真度的方法。

Method: 提出"提议-验证"框架：1）使用预训练的3D感知扩散模型合成新视图来提议完整场景；2）将多视图立体模型重新用作3D感知预言机，通过注意力图验证生成视图的3D不确定性；3）利用不确定性信号通过不确定性加权损失指导3D高斯溅射模型优化。

Result: 该方法在Mip-NeRF 360和NeRF Synthetic等数据集上优于现有最先进方法，能够过滤幻觉伪影，同时在约束不足区域保留合理的补全结果。

Conclusion: OracleGS成功地将强大的生成先验条件化于多视图几何证据，在稀疏视图高斯溅射中实现了生成完整性与回归保真度的调和，为几何模糊场景的视图合成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Sparse-view novel view synthesis is fundamentally ill-posed due to severe
geometric ambiguity. Current methods are caught in a trade-off: regressive
models are geometrically faithful but incomplete, whereas generative models can
complete scenes but often introduce structural inconsistencies. We propose
OracleGS, a novel framework that reconciles generative completeness with
regressive fidelity for sparse view Gaussian Splatting. Instead of using
generative models to patch incomplete reconstructions, our
"propose-and-validate" framework first leverages a pre-trained 3D-aware
diffusion model to synthesize novel views to propose a complete scene. We then
repurpose a multi-view stereo (MVS) model as a 3D-aware oracle to validate the
3D uncertainties of generated views, using its attention maps to reveal regions
where the generated views are well-supported by multi-view evidence versus
where they fall into regions of high uncertainty due to occlusion, lack of
texture, or direct inconsistency. This uncertainty signal directly guides the
optimization of a 3D Gaussian Splatting model via an uncertainty-weighted loss.
Our approach conditions the powerful generative prior on multi-view geometric
evidence, filtering hallucinatory artifacts while preserving plausible
completions in under-constrained regions, outperforming state-of-the-art
methods on datasets including Mip-NeRF 360 and NeRF Synthetic.

Abstract: Accurate monsoon rainfall prediction is vital for India's agriculture, water
management, and climate risk planning, yet remains challenging due to sparse
ground observations and complex regional variability. We present a multimodal
deep learning framework for high-resolution precipitation classification that
leverages satellite and Earth observation data. Unlike previous rainfall
prediction models based on coarse 5-50 km grids, we curate a new 1 km
resolution dataset for five Indian states, integrating seven key geospatial
modalities: land surface temperature, vegetation (NDVI), soil moisture,
relative humidity, wind speed, elevation, and land use, covering the
June-September 2024 monsoon season. Our approach uses an attention-guided U-Net
architecture to capture spatial patterns and temporal dependencies across
modalities, combined with focal and dice loss functions to handle rainfall
class imbalance defined by the India Meteorological Department (IMD).
Experiments demonstrate that our multimodal framework consistently outperforms
unimodal baselines and existing deep learning methods, especially in extreme
rainfall categories. This work contributes a scalable framework, benchmark
dataset, and state-of-the-art results for regional monsoon forecasting, climate
resilience, and geospatial AI applications in India.

Abstract: Domain-specific Visually Rich Document Understanding (VRDU) presents
significant challenges due to the complexity and sensitivity of documents in
fields such as medicine, finance, and material science. Existing Large
(Multimodal) Language Models (LLMs/MLLMs) achieve promising results but face
limitations such as hallucinations, inadequate domain adaptation, and reliance
on extensive fine-tuning datasets. This paper introduces SynDoc, a novel
framework that combines discriminative and generative models to address these
challenges. SynDoc employs a robust synthetic data generation workflow, using
structural information extraction and domain-specific query generation to
produce high-quality annotations. Through adaptive instruction tuning, SynDoc
improves the discriminative model's ability to extract domain-specific
knowledge. At the same time, a recursive inferencing mechanism iteratively
refines the output of both models for stable and accurate predictions. This
framework demonstrates scalable, efficient, and precise document understanding
and bridges the gap between domain-specific adaptation and general world
knowledge for document key information extraction tasks.

Motivation: 随着图像到视频生成模型的快速发展，从静态图像合成视频带来了显著风险，可能被用于创建欺骗性或恶意内容。现有防御方法如I2VGuard试图免疫图像，但有效且原理性的阻止运动的保护方法仍有待探索。

Method: 提出Vid-Freeze方法，通过添加精心设计的对抗扰动来明确针对I2V模型的注意力机制，完全破坏运动合成，同时保持输入图像的语义保真度。

Result: 实验证明该方法提供了令人印象深刻的保护效果，免疫后的图像生成静止或接近静态的视频，有效阻止恶意内容创建。

Conclusion: 注意力攻击作为对抗I2V生成模型滥用的稳健和主动防御方向具有重要前景。

Abstract: The rapid progress of image-to-video (I2V) generation models has introduced
significant risks, enabling video synthesis from static images and facilitating
deceptive or malicious content creation. While prior defenses such as I2VGuard
attempt to immunize images, effective and principled protection to block motion
remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce Vid-Freeze - a novel
attention-suppressing adversarial attack that adds carefully crafted
adversarial perturbations to images. Our method explicitly targets the
attention mechanism of I2V models, completely disrupting motion synthesis while
preserving semantic fidelity of the input image. The resulting immunized images
generate stand-still or near-static videos, effectively blocking malicious
content creation. Our experiments demonstrate the impressive protection
provided by the proposed approach, highlighting the importance of attention
attacks as a promising direction for robust and proactive defenses against
misuse of I2V generation models.

Result: 实验证明散焦模糊提供了可靠且可解释的线索来识别合成图像，支持了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 散焦模糊作为源于光学成像原理的通用特征，为媒体取证研究提供了稳健且可泛化的检测方法。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative AI has enabled the mass production of
photorealistic synthetic images, blurring the boundary between authentic and
fabricated visual content. This challenge is particularly evident in deepfake
scenarios involving facial manipulation, but also extends to broader
AI-generated content (AIGC) cases involving fully synthesized scenes. As such
content becomes increasingly difficult to distinguish from reality, the
integrity of visual media is under threat. To address this issue, we propose a
physically interpretable deepfake detection framework and demonstrate that
defocus blur can serve as an effective forensic signal. Defocus blur is a
depth-dependent optical phenomenon that naturally occurs in camera-captured
images due to lens focus and scene geometry. In contrast, synthetic images
often lack realistic depth-of-field (DoF) characteristics. To capture these
discrepancies, we construct a defocus blur map and use it as a discriminative
feature for detecting manipulated content. Unlike RGB textures or
frequency-domain signals, defocus blur arises universally from optical imaging
principles and encodes physical scene structure. This makes it a robust and
generalizable forensic cue. Our approach is supported by three in-depth feature
analyses, and experimental results confirm that defocus blur provides a
reliable and interpretable cue for identifying synthetic images. We aim for our
defocus-based detection pipeline and interpretability tools to contribute
meaningfully to ongoing research in media forensics. The implementation is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统脉冲相机重建方法在低光照高速场景下难以处理严重噪声和稀疏信息，需要新的解决方案

Method: 使用ETFI从低光照脉冲流中聚合稀疏信息，然后作为ControlNet的条件输入生成高速场景，并引入ETFI特征融合模块提升质量

Result: 在真实低光照脉冲流上表现出优越性能，建立了首个低光照脉冲流重建基准数据集

Conclusion: Diff-SPK通过利用生成先验有效补充低光照条件下的纹理信息，在低光照高速场景下具有显著优势

Abstract: Spike camera, a type of neuromorphic sensor with high-temporal resolution,
shows great promise for high-speed visual tasks. Unlike traditional cameras,
spike camera continuously accumulates photons and fires asynchronous spike
streams. Due to unique data modality, spike streams require reconstruction
methods to become perceptible to the human eye.
  However, lots of methods struggle to handle spike streams in low-light
high-speed scenarios due to severe noise and sparse information. In this work,
we propose Diff-SPK, the first diffusion-based reconstruction method for spike
camera. Diff-SPK effectively leverages generative priors to supplement texture
information in low-light conditions. Specifically, it first employs an
\textbf{E}nhanced \textbf{T}exture \textbf{f}rom Inter-spike \textbf{I}nterval
(ETFI) to aggregate sparse information from low-light spike streams. Then, ETFI
serves as a conditioning input for ControlNet to generate the high-speed
scenes. To improve the quality of results, we introduce an ETFI-based feature
fusion module during the generation process.
  Moreover, we establish the first bona fide benchmark for the low-light spike
stream reconstruction task. It significantly surpasses existing reconstruction
datasets in scale and provides quantitative illumination information. The
performance on real low-light spike streams demonstrates the superiority of
Diff-SPK.

Conclusion: 提出的BDGF框架通过平衡扩散引导和多分支协作，有效提升了多模态遥感数据的土地覆盖分类性能

Abstract: Deep learning-based techniques for the analysis of multimodal remote sensing
data have become popular due to their ability to effectively integrate
complementary spatial, spectral, and structural information from different
sensors. Recently, denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) have
attracted attention in the remote sensing community due to their powerful
ability to capture robust and complex spatial-spectral distributions. However,
pre-training multimodal DDPMs may result in modality imbalance, and effectively
leveraging diffusion features to guide complementary diversity feature
extraction remains an open question. To address these issues, this paper
proposes a balanced diffusion-guided fusion (BDGF) framework that leverages
multimodal diffusion features to guide a multi-branch network for land-cover
classification. Specifically, we propose an adaptive modality masking strategy
to encourage the DDPMs to obtain a modality-balanced rather than spectral
image-dominated data distribution. Subsequently, these diffusion features
hierarchically guide feature extraction among CNN, Mamba, and transformer
networks by integrating feature fusion, group channel attention, and
cross-attention mechanisms. Finally, a mutual learning strategy is developed to
enhance inter-branch collaboration by aligning the probability entropy and
feature similarity of individual subnetworks. Extensive experiments on four
multimodal remote sensing datasets demonstrate that the proposed method
achieves superior classification performance. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型表面上看起来具备文化能力，但实际上依赖表面的模式匹配而非真正的文化理解。作者旨在揭示这种表面能力的局限性，并评估模型在文化图像推理上的真实表现。

Method: 引入一个诊断框架，通过分类和解释分析来探测视觉语言模型对火主题文化图像的理解。测试多个模型在西方节日、非西方传统和紧急场景上的表现。

Result: 模型显示出系统性偏见：能正确识别突出的西方节日，但在代表性不足的文化事件上表现不佳，经常提供模糊标签或危险地将紧急情况误分类为庆祝活动。

Conclusion: 这些失败暴露了符号捷径的风险，强调需要超越准确性指标的文化评估，以确保可解释和公平的多模态系统。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often appear culturally competent but rely on
superficial pattern matching rather than genuine cultural understanding. We
introduce a diagnostic framework to probe VLM reasoning on fire-themed cultural
imagery through both classification and explanation analysis. Testing multiple
models on Western festivals, non-Western traditions, and emergency scenes
reveals systematic biases: models correctly identify prominent Western
festivals but struggle with underrepresented cultural events, frequently
offering vague labels or dangerously misclassifying emergencies as
celebrations. These failures expose the risks of symbolic shortcuts and
highlight the need for cultural evaluation beyond accuracy metrics to ensure
interpretable and fair multimodal systems.

Motivation: 现有方法在目标检测中面临两个独立问题：可见-红外检测提升鲁棒性但缺乏泛化能力，开放世界检测利用视觉-语言对齐实现类别多样性但在极端环境下表现不佳。需要同时实现鲁棒性和多样性。

Method: 两阶段课程学习框架：第一阶段使用RGBT数据预训练增强鲁棒性，第二阶段通过视觉-语言对齐提升泛化能力。引入指数移动平均机制防止阶段间灾难性遗忘。

Conclusion: C3-OWD成功统一了鲁棒性和多样性优势，通过理论保证的EMA机制有效防止了阶段间性能退化，在多个基准测试中建立了有竞争力的性能。

Abstract: Object detection has advanced significantly in the closed-set setting, but
real-world deployment remains limited by two challenges: poor generalization to
unseen categories and insufficient robustness under adverse conditions. Prior
research has explored these issues separately: visible-infrared detection
improves robustness but lacks generalization, while open-world detection
leverages vision-language alignment strategy for category diversity but
struggles under extreme environments. This trade-off leaves robustness and
diversity difficult to achieve simultaneously. To mitigate these issues, we
propose \textbf{C3-OWD}, a curriculum cross-modal contrastive learning
framework that unifies both strengths. Stage~1 enhances robustness by
pretraining with RGBT data, while Stage~2 improves generalization via
vision-language alignment. To prevent catastrophic forgetting between two
stages, we introduce an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) mechanism that
theoretically guarantees preservation of pre-stage performance with bounded
parameter lag and function consistency. Experiments on FLIR, OV-COCO, and
OV-LVIS demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach: C3-OWD achieves $80.1$
AP$^{50}$ on FLIR, $48.6$ AP$^{50}_{\text{Novel}}$ on OV-COCO, and $35.7$
mAP$_r$ on OV-LVIS, establishing competitive performance across both robustness
and diversity evaluations. Code available at:

Abstract: Remote sensing pansharpening aims to reconstruct spatial-spectral properties
during the fusion of panchromatic (PAN) images and low-resolution
multi-spectral (LR-MS) images, finally generating the high-resolution
multi-spectral (HR-MS) images. Although deep learning-based models have
achieved excellent performance, they often come with high computational
complexity, which hinder their applications on resource-limited devices. In
this paper, we explore the feasibility of applying the binary neural network
(BNN) to pan-sharpening. Nevertheless, there are two main issues with
binarizing pan-sharpening models: (i) the binarization will cause serious
spectral distortion due to the inconsistent spectral distribution of the
PAN/LR-MS images; (ii) the common binary convolution kernel is difficult to
adapt to the multi-scale and anisotropic spatial features of remote sensing
objects, resulting in serious degradation of contours. To address the above
issues, we design the customized spatial-spectral binarized convolution
(S2B-Conv), which is composed of the Spectral-Redistribution Mechanism (SRM)
and Gabor Spatial Feature Amplifier (GSFA). Specifically, SRM employs an affine
transformation, generating its scaling and bias parameters through a dynamic
learning process. GSFA, which randomly selects different frequencies and angles
within a preset range, enables to better handle multi-scale and-directional
spatial features. A series of S2B-Conv form a brand-new binary network for
pan-sharpening, dubbed as S2BNet. Extensive quantitative and qualitative
experiments have shown our high-efficiency binarized pan-sharpening method can
attain a promising performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型多模态模型在扩展推理链时过度依赖文本逻辑，逐渐脱离视觉信息基础，导致推理路径偏离图像内容而产生错误结论。

Method: 训练免费的视觉推理流水线，核心思想是解耦推理和感知过程：强大的LLM负责高层推理策略，通过询问LMM来提取所需的视觉信息；LMM专门作为视觉问答引擎，按需提供感知细节。

Result: 综合评估验证该框架能有效控制视觉推理过程，显著减少视觉无根据的推理步骤，大幅提高推理保真度。

Conclusion: 这种轻量级即插即用方法无需额外训练或架构修改，成功解决了LMMs在长推理链中视觉基础丢失的问题。

Abstract: Significant advancements in the reasoning capabilities of Large Language
Models (LLMs) are now driven by test-time scaling laws, particularly those
leveraging extended Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. Inspired by these
breakthroughs, researchers have extended these paradigms to Large Multimodal
Models (LMMs). However, a critical limitation emerges: as their reasoning
chains extend, LMMs increasingly rely on textual logic, progressively losing
grounding in the underlying visual information. This leads to reasoning paths
that diverge from the image content, culminating in erroneous conclusions. To
address this, we introduce a strikingly simple yet effective training-free
visual-reasoning pipeline. The core concept is to decouple the reasoning and
perception processes. A powerful LLM orchestrates the high-level reasoning,
strategically interrogating a LMM to extract specific visual information
required for its logical chain. The LMM, in turn, functions exclusively as a
visual question-answering engine, supplying the necessary perceptual details on
demand. This lightweight, plug-and-play approach requires no additional
training or architectural changes. Comprehensive evaluations validate that our
framework effectively governs the visual reasoning process, leading to a
significant reduction in visually-unfounded reasoning steps and a substantial
improvement in reasoning fidelity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于提示的单标签类增量学习方法直接扩展到多标签类增量学习(MLCIL)效果不佳，主要面临两个内在挑战：共现类别导致的语义混淆，以及部分标注引起的真负-假正混淆。

Method: DDP框架包含类特定的正负提示来解耦语义，以及渐进置信度解耦(PCD)策略来抑制假正例。过去提示被冻结作为知识锚点，层间提示提高了效率。

Result: 在MS-COCO和PASCAL VOC上，DDP持续优于先前方法，是首个在标准MS-COCO B40-C10基准下超过80% mAP和70% F1的无回放MLCIL方法。

Conclusion: DDP通过显式解决多标签类增量学习中的关键挑战，实现了高效且无需回放的学习，为多标签增量学习提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Prompt-based methods have shown strong effectiveness in single-label
class-incremental learning, but their direct extension to multi-label
class-incremental learning (MLCIL) performs poorly due to two intrinsic
challenges: semantic confusion from co-occurring categories and
true-negative-false-positive confusion caused by partial labeling. We propose
Dual-Decoupled Prompting (DDP), a replay-free and parameter-efficient framework
that explicitly addresses both issues. DDP assigns class-specific
positive-negative prompts to disentangle semantics and introduces Progressive
Confidence Decoupling (PCD), a curriculum-inspired decoupling strategy that
suppresses false positives. Past prompts are frozen as knowledge anchors, and
interlayer prompting enhances efficiency. On MS-COCO and PASCAL VOC, DDP
consistently outperforms prior methods and is the first replay-free MLCIL
approach to exceed 80% mAP and 70% F1 under the standard MS-COCO B40-C10
benchmark.

Method: LRPO框架：1) 针对人脸恢复评估的复合奖励函数 2) 真实值引导的似然正则化 3) 噪声级优势分配，利用采样候选的奖励优化策略网络

Result: 大量实验表明LRPO显著优于基线方法，在人脸恢复质量上达到最先进性能

Conclusion: LRPO是首个将在线强化学习应用于盲人脸恢复的框架，通过精心设计的奖励机制和正则化策略，有效解决了该领域的关键挑战

Abstract: Blind Face Restoration (BFR) encounters inherent challenges in exploring its
large solution space, leading to common artifacts like missing details and
identity ambiguity in the restored images. To tackle these challenges, we
propose a Likelihood-Regularized Policy Optimization (LRPO) framework, the
first to apply online reinforcement learning (RL) to the BFR task. LRPO
leverages rewards from sampled candidates to refine the policy network,
increasing the likelihood of high-quality outputs while improving restoration
performance on low-quality inputs. However, directly applying RL to BFR creates
incompatibility issues, producing restoration results that deviate
significantly from the ground truth. To balance perceptual quality and
fidelity, we propose three key strategies: 1) a composite reward function
tailored for face restoration assessment, 2) ground-truth guided likelihood
regularization, and 3) noise-level advantage assignment. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our proposed LRPO significantly improves the face restoration
quality over baseline methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI模型在处理口腔疾病复杂的多模态需求方面存在不足，无法满足全面临床牙科实践的需求。

Method: 使用包含110,447张图像和246万视觉问答对的双语大规模数据集开发，能够解读7种2D口腔成像模态。

Result: 在口腔疾病诊断准确率上比领先模型高19.6%，错颌畸形诊断高27.9%；临床研究中超越了13名初级牙医在21/36任务中的表现，以及12名高级牙医在12/36任务中的表现。

Conclusion: DentVLM是一个强大的临床决策支持工具，能够增强初级牙科护理，缓解医患不平衡，并在牙科领域普及专业医疗知识。

Abstract: Diagnosing and managing oral diseases necessitate advanced visual
interpretation across diverse imaging modalities and integrated information
synthesis. While current AI models excel at isolated tasks, they often fall
short in addressing the complex, multimodal requirements of comprehensive
clinical dental practice. Here we introduce DentVLM, a multimodal
vision-language model engineered for expert-level oral disease diagnosis.
DentVLM was developed using a comprehensive, large-scale, bilingual dataset of
110,447 images and 2.46 million visual question-answering (VQA) pairs. The
model is capable of interpreting seven 2D oral imaging modalities across 36
diagnostic tasks, significantly outperforming leading proprietary and
open-source models by 19.6% higher accuracy for oral diseases and 27.9% for
malocclusions. In a clinical study involving 25 dentists, evaluating 1,946
patients and encompassing 3,105 QA pairs, DentVLM surpassed the diagnostic
performance of 13 junior dentists on 21 of 36 tasks and exceeded that of 12
senior dentists on 12 of 36 tasks. When integrated into a collaborative
workflow, DentVLM elevated junior dentists' performance to senior levels and
reduced diagnostic time for all practitioners by 15-22%. Furthermore, DentVLM
exhibited promising performance across three practical utility scenarios,
including home-based dental health management, hospital-based intelligent
diagnosis and multi-agent collaborative interaction. These findings establish
DentVLM as a robust clinical decision support tool, poised to enhance primary
dental care, mitigate provider-patient imbalances, and democratize access to
specialized medical expertise within the field of dentistry.

TL;DR: 提出Dynamic-TreeRPO方法，通过树状结构搜索和动态噪声强度提升文本到图像生成的探索效率，结合LayerTuning-RL范式实现监督微调与强化学习的无缝集成，在多个基准测试中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习在文本到图像生成中虽然提升了生成质量，但存在探索效率低、采样策略低效的问题，特别是采样组中微小变化导致的计算开销。

Method: 采用滑动窗口采样策略构建树状结构搜索，在树结构内执行GRPO引导优化和约束SDE采样；将SFT损失函数重构为动态加权的进度奖励模型，并与动态自适应裁剪边界关联。

Result: 在HPS-v2.1、PickScore和ImageReward基准测试中分别比现有最佳方法提升4.9%、5.91%和8.66%，同时训练效率提升近50%。

Conclusion: 树状结构采样和LayerTuning-RL范式能够动态探索多样化的搜索空间，在语义一致性、视觉保真度和人类偏好对齐方面显著优于现有基线方法。

Abstract: The integration of Reinforcement Learning (RL) into flow matching models for
text-to-image (T2I) generation has driven substantial advances in generation
quality. However, these gains often come at the cost of exhaustive exploration
and inefficient sampling strategies due to slight variation in the sampling
group. Building on this insight, we propose Dynamic-TreeRPO, which implements
the sliding-window sampling strategy as a tree-structured search with dynamic
noise intensities along depth. We perform GRPO-guided optimization and
constrained Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) sampling within this tree
structure. By sharing prefix paths of the tree, our design effectively
amortizes the computational overhead of trajectory search. With well-designed
noise intensities for each tree layer, Dynamic-TreeRPO can enhance the
variation of exploration without any extra computational cost. Furthermore, we
seamlessly integrate Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and RL paradigm within
Dynamic-TreeRPO to construct our proposed LayerTuning-RL, reformulating the
loss function of SFT as a dynamically weighted Progress Reward Model (PRM)
rather than a separate pretraining method. By associating this weighted PRM
with dynamic-adaptive clipping bounds, the disruption of exploration process in
Dynamic-TreeRPO is avoided. Benefiting from the tree-structured sampling and
the LayerTuning-RL paradigm, our model dynamically explores a diverse search
space along effective directions. Compared to existing baselines, our approach
demonstrates significant superiority in terms of semantic consistency, visual
fidelity, and human preference alignment on established benchmarks, including
HPS-v2.1, PickScore, and ImageReward. In particular, our model outperforms SoTA
by $4.9\%$, $5.91\%$, and $8.66\%$ on those benchmarks, respectively, while
improving the training efficiency by nearly $50\%$.

*Lin Tian,Xiaoling Hu,Juan Eugenio Iglesias*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种与任何预训练配准网络兼容的测试时不确定性估计框架，通过分析空间扰动下网络预测的方差来评估配准可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度配准网络缺乏对其预测可靠性的指示，现有不确定性估计方法需要架构更改或重新训练，限制了在预训练网络中的应用。

Method: 基于配准的变换等变性原理，通过空间扰动输入图像并分析网络预测的方差，将不确定性分解为内在扩散和偏差抖动两个分量。

Result: 在四个解剖结构（脑、心脏、腹部、肺）和多个配准模型上的实验表明，不确定性图与配准误差一致相关，能识别需要谨慎处理的区域。

Conclusion: 该框架可将任何预训练配准网络转变为风险感知工具，推动医学图像配准在临床和大规模研究环境中的安全部署。

Abstract: Accurate image registration is essential for downstream applications, yet
current deep registration networks provide limited indications of whether and
when their predictions are reliable. Existing uncertainty estimation
strategies, such as Bayesian methods, ensembles, or MC dropout, require
architectural changes or retraining, limiting their applicability to pretrained
registration networks. Instead, we propose a test-time uncertainty estimation
framework that is compatible with any pretrained networks. Our framework is
grounded in the transformation equivariance property of registration, which
states that the true mapping between two images should remain consistent under
spatial perturbations of the input. By analyzing the variance of network
predictions under such perturbations, we derive a theoretical decomposition of
perturbation-based uncertainty in registration. This decomposition separates
into two terms: (i) an intrinsic spread, reflecting epistemic noise, and (ii) a
bias jitter, capturing how systematic error drifts under perturbations. Across
four anatomical structures (brain, cardiac, abdominal, and lung) and multiple
registration models (uniGradICON, SynthMorph), the uncertainty maps correlate
consistently with registration errors and highlight regions requiring caution.
Our framework turns any pretrained registration network into a risk-aware tool
at test time, placing medical image registration one step closer to safe
deployment in clinical and large-scale research settings.

TL;DR: GRAPE是一种即插即用的增强方法，通过将排序信号融入基于LLM的查询重写，解决CLIP模型在分布偏移下的检索性能问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP模型在大规模检索中表现优异，但在输入分布与训练语料不同的任务中表现不佳。现有方法使用LLM进行查询重写，但缺乏监督信号无法生成最优重写。

Method: 提出GRAPE方法，使用GRPO将排序信号融入检索引导的查询重写，采用语料相对排序奖励来抑制分数膨胀问题。

Result: 在多语言差异、长度差异和多模态差异等多种分布偏移场景下，GRAPE在Recall@10指标上平均提升4.9%。

Conclusion: GRAPE通过排序感知的策略优化，有效提升了CLIP模型在分布偏移下的检索性能，是一种有效的即插即用增强方案。

Abstract: The CLIP model has become a cornerstone of large-scale retrieval systems by
aligning text and image data in a unified embedding space. Despite its
simplicity and efficiency, CLIP struggles when applied to tasks whose input
distributions diverge from its training corpus, such as queries with
multilingual, long-form, or multimodal differences. To avoid costly retraining,
existing methods mainly adopt query-rewriting strategies with large language
models (LLMs), aiming to mitigate distribution gaps at the query level.
However, due to the lack of supervision signals, LLMs fail to generate the
optimal one that fits the training distribution. We address this challenge with
GRAPE (Grouped Ranking-Aware Policy Optimization Enhancement), a plug-and-play
enhancement approach that incorporates ranking signals into retrieval-guided
query rewriting with LLMs. Intuitively, GRAPE proposes to leverage GRPO to
bridge distributional differences -- including length, multilingual, and
modality shifts -- by transforming queries into forms better aligned with the
retriever's training distribution. However, our preliminary experiment finds
that naively finetuning LLM with similarity scores can lead to score inflation,
where nearly all candidates are assigned unexpectedly high scores regardless of
their true relevance. To address score inflation, we propose a corpus-relative
ranking-based reward, which explicitly aligns optimization with ranking metrics
while suppressing spurious score inflation. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that GRAPE consistently improves retrieval performance under distributional
shifts -- including multilingual differences (Flickr30k-CN, CVLUE, XM3600),
length differences (Wikipedia), and multimodal differences (CIRR) -- achieving
an average improvement of 4.9\% in Recall\@10. The code is available at

TL;DR: CasPoinTr是一个新颖的点云补全框架，使用级联网络和知识蒸馏来解决不完整点云的形状预测和缺失区域重建问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实环境中采集的点云通常由于传感器分辨率限制、单一视角、遮挡和噪声等因素而不完整，这使得点云补全对于各种应用至关重要。

Method: CasPoinTr将补全任务分解为两个协同阶段：形状重建（生成辅助信息）和融合补全（利用辅助信息和知识蒸馏生成最终输出）。通过知识蒸馏，在更密集点云上训练的教师模型将不完整-完整关联知识传递给学生模型。

Result: 在ShapeNet-55数据集上不同难度设置下的实验表明，CasPoinTr在形状恢复和细节保留方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 级联结构和蒸馏策略有效增强了模型捕捉全局形状上下文和细化局部细节的能力，成功弥合了不完整输入和完整目标之间的差距。

Abstract: Point clouds collected from real-world environments are often incomplete due
to factors such as limited sensor resolution, single viewpoints, occlusions,
and noise. These challenges make point cloud completion essential for various
applications. A key difficulty in this task is predicting the overall shape and
reconstructing missing regions from highly incomplete point clouds. To address
this, we introduce CasPoinTr, a novel point cloud completion framework using
cascaded networks and knowledge distillation. CasPoinTr decomposes the
completion task into two synergistic stages: Shape Reconstruction, which
generates auxiliary information, and Fused Completion, which leverages this
information alongside knowledge distillation to generate the final output.
Through knowledge distillation, a teacher model trained on denser point clouds
transfers incomplete-complete associative knowledge to the student model,
enhancing its ability to estimate the overall shape and predict missing
regions. Together, the cascaded networks and knowledge distillation enhance the
model's ability to capture global shape context while refining local details,
effectively bridging the gap between incomplete inputs and complete targets.
Experiments on ShapeNet-55 under different difficulty settings demonstrate that
CasPoinTr outperforms existing methods in shape recovery and detail
preservation, highlighting the effectiveness of our cascaded structure and
distillation strategy.

TL;DR: UniPose是一种统一的跨模态姿态先验传播方法，通过自监督学习将2D人体姿态估计标注迁移到3D领域，无需3D关键点标注，在RGB-D序列上实现弱监督3D人体姿态估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决3D人体姿态估计需要大量人工标注3D关键点的问题，利用易获取的RGB-D序列和现有2D姿态标注，避免多视角相机标定和合成-真实数据偏移问题。

Method: 使用现成的2D姿态估计作为点云网络的弱监督，结合时空约束（身体对称性和关节运动）、2D到3D反投影损失和跨模态交互，通过锚点到关节预测方法在RGB和深度网络上进行3D提升。

Result: 在CMU Panoptic和ITOP数据集上的实验表明，UniPose实现了与全监督方法相当的性能，结合大规模无标签数据（如NTU RGB+D 60）在挑战性条件下性能进一步提升。

Conclusion: UniPose展示了在无需3D标注的情况下实现高质量3D人体姿态估计的潜力，其提出的3D提升方法达到了最先进的结果。

Abstract: In this paper, we present UniPose, a unified cross-modality pose prior
propagation method for weakly supervised 3D human pose estimation (HPE) using
unannotated single-view RGB-D sequences (RGB, depth, and point cloud data).
UniPose transfers 2D HPE annotations from large-scale RGB datasets (e.g., MS
COCO) to the 3D domain via self-supervised learning on easily acquired RGB-D
sequences, eliminating the need for labor-intensive 3D keypoint annotations.
This approach bridges the gap between 2D and 3D domains without suffering from
issues related to multi-view camera calibration or synthetic-to-real data
shifts. During training, UniPose leverages off-the-shelf 2D pose estimations as
weak supervision for point cloud networks, incorporating spatial-temporal
constraints like body symmetry and joint motion. The 2D-to-3D back-projection
loss and cross-modality interaction further enhance this process. By treating
the point cloud network's 3D HPE results as pseudo ground truth, our
anchor-to-joint prediction method performs 3D lifting on RGB and depth
networks, making it more robust against inaccuracies in 2D HPE results compared
to state-of-the-art methods. Experiments on CMU Panoptic and ITOP datasets show
that UniPose achieves comparable performance to fully supervised methods.
Incorporating large-scale unlabeled data (e.g., NTU RGB+D 60) enhances its
performance under challenging conditions, demonstrating its potential for
practical applications. Our proposed 3D lifting method also achieves
state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: 身体形状条件在自接触姿态建模中具有关键作用，所提出的方法能够有效提升自接触场景下的人体姿态估计精度。

Abstract: One can hardly model self-contact of human poses without considering
underlying body shapes. For example, the pose of rubbing a belly for a person
with a low BMI leads to penetration of the hand into the belly for a person
with a high BMI. Despite its relevance, existing self-contact datasets lack the
variety of self-contact poses and precise body shapes, limiting conclusive
analysis between self-contact poses and shapes. To address this, we begin by
introducing the first extensive self-contact dataset with precise body shape
registration, Goliath-SC, consisting of 383K self-contact poses across 130
subjects. Using this dataset, we propose generative modeling of self-contact
prior conditioned by body shape parameters, based on a body-part-wise latent
diffusion with self-attention. We further incorporate this prior into
single-view human pose estimation while refining estimated poses to be in
contact. Our experiments suggest that shape conditioning is vital to the
successful modeling of self-contact pose distribution, hence improving
single-view pose estimation in self-contact.

Motivation: 现有的驾驶场景生成方法主要关注合成多样化和高保真度的驾驶视频，但缺乏3D一致性和稀疏视角覆盖，难以支持高质量的新视角合成。而3D/4D重建方法虽然改进了新视角合成，但缺乏生成能力。

Method: 采用前馈框架，包含两个关键步骤：(i) 引入4D感知的潜在扩散模型，集成多模态信息以前馈方式生成像素对齐的4D高斯分布；(ii) 使用增强的视频扩散模型对从这些高斯分布渲染的新视角视频进行细化。

Result: 在基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，WorldSplat能够有效生成高保真度、时空一致的多视角驾驶视频。

Conclusion: WorldSplat成功解决了场景生成与重建之间的困境，为自动驾驶系统提供了可扩展和可控的训练数据生成方法。

Abstract: Recent advances in driving-scene generation and reconstruction have
demonstrated significant potential for enhancing autonomous driving systems by
producing scalable and controllable training data. Existing generation methods
primarily focus on synthesizing diverse and high-fidelity driving videos;
however, due to limited 3D consistency and sparse viewpoint coverage, they
struggle to support convenient and high-quality novel-view synthesis (NVS).
Conversely, recent 3D/4D reconstruction approaches have significantly improved
NVS for real-world driving scenes, yet inherently lack generative capabilities.
To overcome this dilemma between scene generation and reconstruction, we
propose \textbf{WorldSplat}, a novel feed-forward framework for 4D
driving-scene generation. Our approach effectively generates consistent
multi-track videos through two key steps: ((i)) We introduce a 4D-aware latent
diffusion model integrating multi-modal information to produce pixel-aligned 4D
Gaussians in a feed-forward manner. ((ii)) Subsequently, we refine the novel
view videos rendered from these Gaussians using a enhanced video diffusion
model. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets demonstrate that
\textbf{WorldSplat} effectively generates high-fidelity, temporally and
spatially consistent multi-track novel view driving videos.

Abstract: Fracture detection plays a critical role in medical imaging analysis,
traditional fracture diagnosis relies on visual assessment by experienced
physicians, however the speed and accuracy of this approach are constrained by
the expertise. With the rapid advancements in artificial intelligence, deep
learning models based on the YOLO framework have been widely employed for
fracture detection, demonstrating significant potential in improving diagnostic
efficiency and accuracy. This study proposes an improved YOLO-based model,

information to focus on critical features of fracture regions. Meanwhile, the
ScA module dynamically adjusts the weights of features at different scales,
enhancing the model's capacity to identify fracture targets at multiple scales.
Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to the baseline model,

Abstract: In this paper, an advanced fracture detection framework, FracDetNet, is
proposed to address challenges in medical imaging, as accurate fracture
detection is essential for enhancing diagnostic efficiency in clinical
practice. Despite recent advancements, existing methods still struggle with
detecting subtle and morphologically diverse fractures due to variable imaging
angles and suboptimal image quality. To overcome these limitations, FracDetNet
integrates Dual-Focus Attention (DFA) and Multi-scale Calibration (MC).
Specifically, the DFA module effectively captures detailed local features and
comprehensive global context through combined global and local attention
mechanisms. Additionally, the MC adaptively refines feature representations to
enhance detection performance. Experimental evaluations on the publicly
available GRAZPEDWRI-DX dataset demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with
FracDetNet achieving a mAP$_{50-95}$ of 40.0\%, reflecting a \textbf{7.5\%}
improvement over the baseline model. Furthermore, the mAP$_{50}$ reaches

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPIKE是一个推理时框架，通过量化贝叶斯惊喜来识别视频中的关键时刻，并基于惊喜权重进行帧采样，提升Video-LLMs在下游任务上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界视频通常包含常规活动和令人难忘的惊喜事件，但现有的Video-LLMs通过均匀采样帧处理视频，可能会错过定义视频叙事的关键时刻。

Method: 引入SPIKE框架量化贝叶斯惊喜作为视频流中新视觉证据触发的信念更新，识别新视觉证据与先前信念冲突的时刻。还开发了SPIKE-RL，利用GRPO基于视频字幕的奖励信号优化信念假设。

Result: SPIKE能有效定位视频中的惊喜，与人类在正面（FunQA）和负面（Oops!）惊喜基准上高度相关。通过惊喜加权帧采样策略，在五个下游基准上相比均匀采样获得一致的性能提升。

Conclusion: 通过让Video-LLMs跟踪信念并注册惊喜，这项工作为更强大的模型铺平了道路，这些模型能够根据新信息修正其理解。

Abstract: Real-world videos often show routine activities punctuated by memorable,
surprising events. However, most Video-LLMs process videos by sampling frames
uniformly, likely missing critical moments that define a video's narrative. We
introduce SPIKE, an inference-time framework that quantifies Bayesian Surprise
as the belief update triggered by new visual evidence in the video stream,
identifying moments where new visual evidence conflicts with prior beliefs.
SPIKE effectively localizes surprise in videos, strongly correlated with humans
on positive (FunQA) and negative (Oops!) surprise benchmarks. Since the beliefs
of zero-shot Video-LLMs are often suboptimal, we develop SPIKE-RL, which
leverages GRPO to optimize belief hypotheses based on a reward signal from the
video caption. SPIKE and SPIKE-RL guide query-agnostic surprise-weighted frame
sampling, which allocates more frames to interesting moments in the video. With
this strategy, we achieve consistent performance gains on five downstream
benchmarks over uniform sampling. By enabling Video-LLMs to track beliefs and
register surprise, our work paves the way for more robust models that can
revise their understanding in response to new information.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的周期性激活隐式神经表示网络（如SIREN和FINER）存在隐藏特征冗余问题，由于使用固定频率乘子导致层内神经元捕获重叠的频率分量，限制了多层感知机的表达能力。

Method: 受离散正弦变换等经典信号处理方法启发，为周期性激活函数分配基于奈奎斯特频率的神经元特定频率乘子，在不增加网络深度或超参数调优的情况下引入频率多样性。

Result: 该方法将特征冗余减少近50%，在1D音频、2D图像、3D形状拟合和神经辐射场合成等多种INR任务中持续改善信号重建效果，优于基线方法且保持效率。

Conclusion: 通过简单而原则性的修改，提出的FM-SIREN和FM-FINER方法有效解决了周期性激活INR网络中的特征冗余问题，显著提升了表达能力和重建性能。

Abstract: Existing periodic activation-based implicit neural representation (INR)
networks, such as SIREN and FINER, suffer from hidden feature redundancy, where
neurons within a layer capture overlapping frequency components due to the use
of a fixed frequency multiplier. This redundancy limits the expressive capacity
of multilayer perceptrons (MLPs). Drawing inspiration from classical signal
processing methods such as the Discrete Sine Transform (DST), we propose
FM-SIREN and FM-FINER, which assign Nyquist-informed, neuron-specific frequency
multipliers to periodic activations. Unlike existing approaches, our design
introduces frequency diversity without requiring hyperparameter tuning or
additional network depth. This simple yet principled modification reduces the
redundancy of features by nearly 50% and consistently improves signal
reconstruction across diverse INR tasks, including fitting 1D audio, 2D image
and 3D shape, and synthesis of neural radiance fields (NeRF), outperforming
their baseline counterparts while maintaining efficiency.

*Tanawan Premsri,Parisa Kordjamshidi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出FoR-SALE框架，通过引入参考坐标系概念来改进文本到图像生成中的空间理解能力，在现有SLD框架基础上增加了基于FoR的空间对齐评估和校正功能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的文本到图像生成模型在处理非相机视角的空间描述时存在显著性能差距，需要将长期被忽视的参考坐标系概念整合到多模态模型中。

Method: 扩展SLD框架，使用视觉模块提取图像空间配置，将空间表达式映射到相机视角，检测语言与视觉的对齐情况，应用新颖的潜在空间操作来调整生成图像的朝向和深度。

Result: 在两个专门评估FoR空间理解的基准测试中，仅通过单轮校正就将最先进T2I模型的性能提升了最高5.3%。

Conclusion: FoR-SALE框架成功地将参考坐标系概念整合到文本到图像生成中，显著提升了模型对空间描述的理解和生成能力。

Abstract: Frame of Reference (FoR) is a fundamental concept in spatial reasoning that
humans utilize to comprehend and describe space. With the rapid progress in
Multimodal Language models, the moment has come to integrate this
long-overlooked dimension into these models. In particular, in text-to-image
(T2I) generation, even state-of-the-art models exhibit a significant
performance gap when spatial descriptions are provided from perspectives other
than the camera. To address this limitation, we propose Frame of
Reference-guided Spatial Adjustment in LLM-based Diffusion Editing (FoR-SALE),
an extension of the Self-correcting LLM-controlled Diffusion (SLD) framework
for T2I. For-Sale evaluates the alignment between a given text and an initially
generated image, and refines the image based on the Frame of Reference
specified in the spatial expressions. It employs vision modules to extract the
spatial configuration of the image, while simultaneously mapping the spatial
expression to a corresponding camera perspective. This unified perspective
enables direct evaluation of alignment between language and vision. When
misalignment is detected, the required editing operations are generated and
applied. FoR-SALE applies novel latent-space operations to adjust the facing
direction and depth of the generated images. We evaluate FoR-SALE on two
benchmarks specifically designed to assess spatial understanding with FoR. Our
framework improves the performance of state-of-the-art T2I models by up to 5.3%
using only a single round of correction.

*Tharindu Ekanayake,Constantino Álvarez Casado,Miguel Bordallo López*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 3DPCNet是一个紧凑的、与估计器无关的模块，可将单目3D姿态估计器产生的相机中心骨架转换为身体中心规范坐标系，消除视角依赖性，实现一致的姿态分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单目3D姿态估计器产生相机中心的骨架，这些视角相关的运动信号在健康监测和体育科学等应用中使比较分析变得复杂。需要将输入姿态校正到一致的、身体中心的规范坐标系中。

Method: 提出3DPCNet模块，使用混合编码器融合图卷积网络的局部骨骼特征和transformer的全局上下文，通过门控交叉注意力机制预测连续的6D旋转，映射到SO(3)矩阵来对齐姿态。在MM-Fi数据集上使用合成旋转姿态进行自监督训练。

Result: 在MM-Fi基准测试中，3DPCNet将平均旋转误差从超过20°降低到3.4°，平均每关节位置误差从约64mm降低到47mm。在TotalCapture数据集上的定性评估显示，从视频中提取的加速度信号与地面真实IMU传感器数据具有强视觉对应性。

Conclusion: 3DPCNet模块有效消除了视角变异性，实现了物理上合理的运动分析，为基于视频的运动分析提供了可靠的姿态标准化解决方案。

Abstract: Monocular 3D pose estimators produce camera-centered skeletons, creating
view-dependent kinematic signals that complicate comparative analysis in
applications such as health and sports science. We present 3DPCNet, a compact,
estimator-agnostic module that operates directly on 3D joint coordinates to
rectify any input pose into a consistent, body-centered canonical frame. Its
hybrid encoder fuses local skeletal features from a graph convolutional network
with global context from a transformer via a gated cross-attention mechanism.
From this representation, the model predicts a continuous 6D rotation that is
mapped to an $SO(3)$ matrix to align the pose. We train the model in a
self-supervised manner on the MM-Fi dataset using synthetically rotated poses,
guided by a composite loss ensuring both accurate rotation and pose
reconstruction. On the MM-Fi benchmark, 3DPCNet reduces the mean rotation error
from over 20$^{\circ}$ to 3.4$^{\circ}$ and the Mean Per Joint Position Error
from ~64 mm to 47 mm compared to a geometric baseline. Qualitative evaluations
on the TotalCapture dataset further demonstrate that our method produces
acceleration signals from video that show strong visual correspondence to
ground-truth IMU sensor data, confirming that our module removes viewpoint
variability to enable physically plausible motion analysis.

Motivation: 现有的文本到图像模型在处理复杂提示时经常遗漏或错误表示特定对象和属性，测试时优化是解决这一限制的有前景方法。

Method: 将输入提示分解为语义概念，在全局和概念级别评估对齐，使用细粒度CLIP变体计算概念级对应关系，通过迭代提示优化循环改进提示。

Result: 在DrawBench和CompBench提示上的实验表明，该方法在概念覆盖率和人类评判的忠实度方面显著优于标准测试时优化和基础T2I模型。

Conclusion: 提出的细粒度测试时优化框架有效提升了文本到图像生成的组合忠实度，解决了现有模型遗漏或错误表示复杂提示中特定元素的问题。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) models, they often fail to
faithfully render all elements of complex prompts, frequently omitting or
misrepresenting specific objects and attributes. Test-time optimization has
emerged as a promising approach to address this limitation by refining
generation without the need for retraining. In this paper, we propose a
fine-grained test-time optimization framework that enhances compositional
faithfulness in T2I generation. Unlike most of prior approaches that rely
solely on a global image/text similarity score, our method decomposes the input
prompt into semantic concepts and evaluates alignment at both the global and
concept levels. A fine-grained variant of CLIP is used to compute concept-level
correspondence, producing detailed feedback on missing or inaccurate concepts.
This feedback is fed into an iterative prompt refinement loop, enabling the
large language model to propose improved prompts. Experiments on DrawBench and
CompBench prompts demonstrate that our method significantly improves concept
coverage and human-judged faithfulness over both standard test-time
optimization and the base T2I model. Code is available at:

Motivation: 现有的多模态人脸反欺诈模型难以检测来自新目标域的未知攻击，而领域自适应方法在单模态中已有研究，但在多模态中尚未探索。

Method: 提出互补特征提取处理缺失模态，利用多模态预测不确定性生成可靠伪标签，设计自适应损失权重机制防止模型退化。

Result: 大量实验证明MFAS-DANet具有有效性和最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了多模态人脸反欺诈在领域自适应场景下的关键挑战，实现了优异的性能。

Abstract: Recent multi-modal face anti-spoofing (FAS) methods have investigated the
potential of leveraging multiple modalities to distinguish live and spoof
faces. However, pre-adapted multi-modal FAS models often fail to detect unseen
attacks from new target domains. Although a more realistic domain adaptation
(DA) scenario has been proposed for single-modal FAS to learn specific spoof
attacks during inference, DA remains unexplored in multi-modal FAS methods. In
this paper, we propose a novel framework, MFAS-DANet, to address three major
challenges in multi-modal FAS under the DA scenario: missing modalities, noisy
pseudo labels, and model degradation. First, to tackle the issue of missing
modalities, we propose extracting complementary features from other modalities
to substitute missing modality features or enhance existing ones. Next, to
reduce the impact of noisy pseudo labels during model adaptation, we propose
deriving reliable pseudo labels by leveraging prediction uncertainty across
different modalities. Finally, to prevent model degradation, we design an
adaptive mechanism that decreases the loss weight during unstable adaptations
and increasing it during stable ones. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness and state-of-the-art performance of our proposed MFAS-DANet.

TL;DR: RestoRect提出了一种新颖的潜在整流流特征蒸馏方法，通过可学习的潜在空间轨迹让学生网络学习合成教师质量的图像特征，解决了图像恢复中性能与速度的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前图像恢复方法面临关键权衡：高性能模型太慢不实用，而快速模型效果差。现有静态特征匹配方法无法捕捉现代transformer架构动态生成特征的方式。

Method: 应用整流流将特征蒸馏重新表述为生成过程，结合Retinex理论进行物理分解、可学习各向异性扩散约束和三角色彩空间极化，引入特征层提取损失实现跨架构知识迁移。

Result: 在15个图像恢复数据集、4个任务、8个指标上展示了优越结果，实现了更好的训练稳定性、更快的收敛和推理速度，同时保持恢复质量。

Conclusion: RestoRect通过潜在整流流特征蒸馏有效解决了图像恢复中性能与速度的权衡问题，为实际应用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Current approaches for restoration of degraded images face a critical
trade-off: high-performance models are too slow for practical use, while fast
models produce poor results. Knowledge distillation transfers teacher knowledge
to students, but existing static feature matching methods cannot capture how
modern transformer architectures dynamically generate features. We propose
'RestoRect', a novel Latent Rectified Flow Feature Distillation method for
restoring degraded images. We apply rectified flow to reformulate feature
distillation as a generative process where students learn to synthesize
teacher-quality features through learnable trajectories in latent space. Our
framework combines Retinex theory for physics-based decomposition with
learnable anisotropic diffusion constraints, and trigonometric color space
polarization. We introduce a Feature Layer Extraction loss for robust knowledge
transfer between different network architectures through cross-normalized
transformer feature alignment with percentile-based outlier detection.
RestoRect achieves better training stability, and faster convergence and
inference while preserving restoration quality. We demonstrate superior results
across 15 image restoration datasets, covering 4 tasks, on 8 metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法基于低秩假设，难以建模非约束动态场景中复杂的区域特定变形。OriGS旨在通过场景方向提供稳定的结构指导来解决这一问题。

Method: 首先估计全局方向场，传播主要前进方向；然后提出方向感知超高斯，将时间、空间、几何和方向嵌入到统一的概率状态中，通过条件切片推断区域特定变形。

Result: 实验证明OriGS在具有挑战性的真实世界动态场景中，相比主流方法具有更优越的重建保真度。

Conclusion: OriGS通过方向锚定的高斯溅射框架，成功解决了复杂动态场景的4D重建问题，实现了高质量的重建效果。

Abstract: We present Orientation-anchored Gaussian Splatting (OriGS), a novel framework
for high-quality 4D reconstruction from casually captured monocular videos.
While recent advances extend 3D Gaussian Splatting to dynamic scenes via
various motion anchors, such as graph nodes or spline control points, they
often rely on low-rank assumptions and fall short in modeling complex,
region-specific deformations inherent to unconstrained dynamics. OriGS
addresses this by introducing a hyperdimensional representation grounded in
scene orientation. We first estimate a Global Orientation Field that propagates
principal forward directions across space and time, serving as stable
structural guidance for dynamic modeling. Built upon this, we propose
Orientation-aware Hyper-Gaussian, a unified formulation that embeds time,
space, geometry, and orientation into a coherent probabilistic state. This
enables inferring region-specific deformation through principled conditioned
slicing, adaptively capturing diverse local dynamics in alignment with global
motion intent. Experiments demonstrate the superior reconstruction fidelity of
OriGS over mainstream methods in challenging real-world dynamic scenes.

TL;DR: 该论文通过大规模实证研究分析了23个视觉问答基准中模态依赖关系，发现许多旨在减少文本偏见的基准反而放大了图像依赖，且大模型常利用单模态依赖来掩盖多模态推理能力的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解单模态依赖（单个模态对目标任务的贡献）和跨模态依赖（模态间关系与目标任务的关系）之间的相互作用对于推进多模态学习至关重要，但目前基准评估中这些依赖的性质和交互仍缺乏充分表征。

Method: 使用多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在23个视觉问答基准上进行大规模实证研究，涵盖通用知识推理、专家知识推理、光学字符识别和文档理解等领域。

Result: 研究发现对视觉、问题文本及其交互的依赖在不同基准之间和内部存在显著差异；许多旨在缓解文本偏见的基准无意中放大了仅图像依赖；这种特征在不同模型规模中持续存在，大模型常利用单模态依赖实现高性能，掩盖多模态推理能力的不足。

Conclusion: 提供了多模态数据集的量化表征，为多模态基准设计和评估提供了原则性方法。

Abstract: Understanding the interplay between intra-modality dependencies (the
contribution of an individual modality to a target task) and inter-modality
dependencies (the relationships between modalities and the target task) is
fundamental to advancing multi-modal learning. However, the nature of and
interaction between these dependencies within current benchmark evaluations
remains poorly characterized. In this work, we present a large-scale empirical
study to quantify these dependencies across 23 visual question-answering
benchmarks using multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) covering domains
such as general and expert knowledge reasoning, optical character recognition,
and document understanding. Our findings show that the reliance on vision,
question (text), and their interaction varies significantly, both across and
within benchmarks. We discover that numerous benchmarks intended to mitigate
text-only biases have inadvertently amplified image-only dependencies. This
characterization persists across model sizes, as larger models often use these
intra-modality dependencies to achieve high performance that mask an underlying
lack of multi-modal reasoning. We provide a quantitative characterization of
multi-modal datasets, enabling a principled approach to multi-modal benchmark
design and evaluation.

Motivation: 息肉分割在结直肠癌检测中至关重要，但由于息肉形状多样、尺寸不一以及医学图像中边界对比度低，该任务仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 集成动态核机制与全局编码器注意力模块，动态核通过EA模块的全局上下文向量初始化，在解码阶段迭代优化分割预测；使用统一通道适应标准化特征维度。

Result: 在KvasirSEG和CVC ClinicDB基准数据集上，模型在Dice和IoU指标上优于多种最先进的分割方法，同时UCA简化了解码器结构并降低了计算成本。

Conclusion: 该方法为息肉分割提供了稳健且适应性强的解决方案，在临床和自动化诊断系统中具有广阔应用前景。

Abstract: Polyp segmentation is a critical step in colorectal cancer detection, yet it
remains challenging due to the diverse shapes, sizes, and low contrast
boundaries of polyps in medical imaging. In this work, we propose a novel
framework that improves segmentation accuracy and efficiency by integrating a
Dynamic Kernel (DK) mechanism with a global Encoder Attention module. The DK
mechanism, initialized by a global context vector from the EA module,
iteratively refines segmentation predictions across decoding stages, enabling
the model to focus on and accurately delineate complex polyp boundaries. The EA
module enhances the network's ability to capture critical lesion features by
aggregating multi scale information from all encoder layers. In addition, we
employ Unified Channel Adaptation (UCA) in the decoder to standardize feature
dimensions across stages, ensuring consistent and computationally efficient
information fusion. Our approach extends the lesion-aware kernel framework by
introducing a more flexible, attention driven kernel initialization and a
unified decoder design. Extensive experiments on the KvasirSEG and CVC ClinicDB
benchmark datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms several state of the
art segmentation methods, achieving superior Dice and Intersection over Union
scores. Moreover, UCA simplifies the decoder structure, reducing computational
cost without compromising accuracy. Overall, the proposed method provides a
robust and adaptable solution for polyp segmentation, with promising
applications in clinical and automated diagnostic systems.

Method: 创建ActPLD基准测试，评估包括最先进的专有和开源系统在内的模型在单人和社交互动点光源显示上的表现。

Result: 所有测试模型在动作理解方面表现一致较差，揭示了模型在动作和时空理解方面存在根本性差距。

Conclusion: 当前的多模态大语言模型在从点光源显示中理解人类动作方面存在显著不足，表明需要改进模型的具身理解和时空推理能力。

Abstract: Humans can extract rich semantic information from minimal visual cues, as
demonstrated by point-light displays (PLDs), which consist of sparse sets of
dots localized to key joints of the human body. This ability emerges early in
development and is largely attributed to human embodied experience. Since PLDs
isolate body motion as the sole source of meaning, they represent key stimuli
for testing the constraints of action understanding in these systems. Here we
introduce ActPLD, the first benchmark to evaluate action processing in MLLMs
from human PLDs. Tested models include state-of-the-art proprietary and
open-source systems on single-actor and socially interacting PLDs. Our results
reveal consistently low performance across models, introducing fundamental gaps
in action and spatiotemporal understanding.

Abstract: Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality
in systemic sclerosis (SSc). Chest computed tomography (CT) is the primary
imaging modality for diagnosing and monitoring lung complications in SSc
patients. However, its role in disease progression and mortality prediction has
not yet been fully clarified. This study introduces a novel, large-scale
longitudinal chest CT analysis framework that utilizes radiomics and deep
learning to predict mortality associated with lung complications of SSc. We
collected and analyzed 2,125 CT scans from SSc patients enrolled in the
Northwestern Scleroderma Registry, conducting mortality analyses at one, three,
and five years using advanced imaging analysis techniques. Death labels were
assigned based on recorded deaths over the one-, three-, and five-year
intervals, confirmed by expert physicians. In our dataset, 181, 326, and 428 of
the 2,125 CT scans were from patients who died within one, three, and five
years, respectively. Using ResNet-18, DenseNet-121, and Swin Transformer we use
pre-trained models, and fine-tuned on 2,125 images of SSc patients. Models
achieved an AUC of 0.769, 0.801, 0.709 for predicting mortality within one-,
three-, and five-years, respectively. Our findings highlight the potential of
both radiomics and deep learning computational methods to improve early
detection and risk assessment of SSc-related interstitial lung disease, marking
a significant advancement in the literature.

Motivation: 驾驶员监控系统不仅需要高准确率，更需要可靠、校准良好的置信度分数，以确保在安全关键场景中的安全性。直接低分辨率训练虽然整体准确率高，但会产生校准不良的预测，这在安全关键场景中可能很危险。

Abstract: Driver monitoring systems require not just high accuracy but reliable,
well-calibrated confidence scores for safety-critical deployment. While direct
low-resolution training yields high overall accuracy, it produces poorly
calibrated predictions that can be dangerous in safety-critical scenarios. We
propose a resource-aware adaptive super-resolution framework that optimizes for
model calibration and high precision-recall on critical events. Our approach
achieves state-of-the-art performance on safety-centric metrics: best
calibration (ECE of 5.8\% vs 6.2\% for LR-trained baselines), highest AUPR for
drowsiness detection (0.78 vs 0.74), and superior precision-recall for phone
use detection (0.74 vs 0.71). A lightweight artifact detector (0.3M parameters,
5.2ms overhead) provides additional safety by filtering SR-induced

TL;DR: OVSeg3R是一种从2D感知模型学习开放词汇3D实例分割的训练方案，利用3D重建技术将2D实例掩码投影到3D空间生成标注，通过视图级实例划分和2D实例边界感知超点聚类解决部分标注和几何细节丢失问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D实例分割方法需要大量人工标注且词汇量有限，而2D开放词汇模型已取得显著进展。本文旨在利用2D模型的优势，通过3D重建技术实现开放词汇的3D实例分割，避免昂贵的人工标注。

Method: 1) 使用3D重建模型从2D视频重建场景，建立2D-3D对应关系；2) 将2D开放词汇模型的实例掩码预测投影到3D空间生成标注；3) 提出视图级实例划分算法，将预测分配到各自视图进行监督；4) 引入2D实例边界感知超点聚类，利用2D掩码约束超点生成。

Result: 在ScanNet200基准测试上整体提升+2.3 mAP，显著缩小尾类和头类之间的性能差距。在标准开放词汇设置下，新类别上超越先前方法约+7.1 mAP。

Conclusion: OVSeg3R成功将最先进的封闭词汇3D实例分割模型扩展到开放词汇，通过利用2D模型的优势和创新的训练策略，在减少人工标注成本的同时显著提升了性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a training scheme called OVSeg3R to learn
open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation from well-studied 2D perception models
with the aid of 3D reconstruction. OVSeg3R directly adopts reconstructed scenes
from 2D videos as input, avoiding costly manual adjustment while aligning input
with real-world applications. By exploiting the 2D to 3D correspondences
provided by 3D reconstruction models, OVSeg3R projects each view's 2D instance
mask predictions, obtained from an open-vocabulary 2D model, onto 3D to
generate annotations for the view's corresponding sub-scene. To avoid
incorrectly introduced false positives as supervision due to partial
annotations from 2D to 3D, we propose a View-wise Instance Partition algorithm,
which partitions predictions to their respective views for supervision,
stabilizing the training process. Furthermore, since 3D reconstruction models
tend to over-smooth geometric details, clustering reconstructed points into
representative super-points based solely on geometry, as commonly done in
mainstream 3D segmentation methods, may overlook geometrically non-salient
objects. We therefore introduce 2D Instance Boundary-aware Superpoint, which
leverages 2D masks to constrain the superpoint clustering, preventing
superpoints from violating instance boundaries. With these designs, OVSeg3R not
only extends a state-of-the-art closed-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation
model to open-vocabulary, but also substantially narrows the performance gap
between tail and head classes, ultimately leading to an overall improvement of
+2.3 mAP on the ScanNet200 benchmark. Furthermore, under the standard
open-vocabulary setting, OVSeg3R surpasses previous methods by about +7.1 mAP
on the novel classes, further validating its effectiveness.

Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have transformed how 3D environments are modeled,
rendered, and interpreted. NeRF introduced view-consistent photorealism via
volumetric rendering; 3DGS has rapidly emerged as an explicit, efficient
alternative that supports high-quality rendering, faster optimization, and
integration into hybrid pipelines for enhanced photorealism and task-driven
scene understanding. This survey examines how 3DGS is being adopted across
SLAM, telepresence and teleoperation, robotic manipulation, and 3D content
generation. Despite their differences, these domains share common goals:
photorealistic rendering, meaningful 3D structure, and accurate downstream
tasks. We organize the review around unified research questions that explain
why 3DGS is increasingly displacing NeRF-based approaches: What technical
advantages drive its adoption? How does it adapt to different input modalities
and domain-specific constraints? What limitations remain? By systematically
comparing domain-specific pipelines, we show that 3DGS balances photorealism,
geometric fidelity, and computational efficiency. The survey offers a roadmap
for leveraging neural rendering not only for image synthesis but also for
perception, interaction, and content creation across real and virtual
environments.

TL;DR: 首个用于MRI胰腺分区（头、体、尾）分割的联邦学习方法，解决了胰腺疾病区域异质性和数据稀缺问题，在保护隐私的前提下实现了多机构协作训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胰腺疾病具有显著的区域异质性（癌症多发生在头部，慢性胰腺炎导致尾部组织损失），准确分割胰腺区域对精确诊断和治疗规划至关重要，但MRI中的分割任务因形态多变、软组织对比度差和个体解剖差异而极具挑战性。

Method: 提出隐私保护的联邦学习框架，在7家医疗机构间协作训练而不共享数据，使用711个T1W和726个T2W MRI扫描。创新包括：系统评估三种分割架构（U-Net、Attention U-Net、Swin UNETR）与两种FL算法（FedAvg、FedProx），发现Attention U-Net与FedAvg组合最优；提出基于解剖知识的损失函数，优先考虑MRI中区域特异性纹理对比度。

Result: 综合评估表明，该方法在分布式、异质数据集上训练仍能达到临床可行的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了胰腺分区分割的技术挑战和数据稀缺问题，为胰腺疾病的精确诊断和治疗规划提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We present the first federated learning (FL) approach for pancreas part(head,
body and tail) segmentation in MRI, addressing a critical clinical challenge as
a significant innovation. Pancreatic diseases exhibit marked regional
heterogeneity cancers predominantly occur in the head region while chronic
pancreatitis causes tissue loss in the tail, making accurate segmentation of
the organ into head, body, and tail regions essential for precise diagnosis and
treatment planning. This segmentation task remains exceptionally challenging in
MRI due to variable morphology, poor soft-tissue contrast, and anatomical
variations across patients. Our novel contribution tackles two fundamental
challenges: first, the technical complexity of pancreas part delineation in
MRI, and second the data scarcity problem that has hindered prior approaches.
We introduce a privacy-preserving FL framework that enables collaborative model
training across seven medical institutions without direct data sharing,
leveraging a diverse dataset of 711 T1W and 726 T2W MRI scans. Our key
innovations include: (1) a systematic evaluation of three state-of-the-art
segmentation architectures (U-Net, Attention U-Net,Swin UNETR) paired with two
FL algorithms (FedAvg, FedProx), revealing Attention U-Net with FedAvg as
optimal for pancreatic heterogeneity, which was never been done before; (2) a
novel anatomically-informed loss function prioritizing region-specific texture
contrasts in MRI. Comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that our approach
achieves clinically viable performance despite training on distributed,
heterogeneous datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通过将大脑信号映射到中间图像或文本特征空间来指导生成过程，这掩盖了不同大脑区域对最终重建输出的贡献

Method: 开发NeuroAdapter视觉解码框架，直接条件化潜在扩散模型于大脑表征；提出IBBI双向可解释性框架，通过分析扩散去噪步骤中的交叉注意力机制来揭示不同皮层区域如何影响生成轨迹

Result: 在公共fMRI数据集上展示了与先前工作相当的视觉重建质量，同时提供了大脑信号如何塑造生成过程的更大透明度

Conclusion: 端到端脑到图像解码具有潜力，并为通过视觉神经科学视角解释扩散模型建立了路径

Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated that complex visual stimuli can be decoded from
human brain activity using deep generative models, helping brain science
researchers interpret how the brain represents real-world scenes. However, most
current approaches leverage mapping brain signals into intermediate image or
text feature spaces before guiding the generative process, masking the effect
of contributions from different brain areas on the final reconstruction output.
In this work, we propose NeuroAdapter, a visual decoding framework that
directly conditions a latent diffusion model on brain representations,
bypassing the need for intermediate feature spaces. Our method demonstrates
competitive visual reconstruction quality on public fMRI datasets compared to
prior work, while providing greater transparency into how brain signals shape
the generation process. To this end, we contribute an Image-Brain
BI-directional interpretability framework (IBBI) which investigates
cross-attention mechanisms across diffusion denoising steps to reveal how
different cortical areas influence the unfolding generative trajectory. Our
results highlight the potential of end-to-end brain-to-image decoding and
establish a path toward interpreting diffusion models through the lens of
visual neuroscience.

<details>

Motivation: 扩散变换器(DiTs)在图像生成中表现出优越性能，但其计算和内存成本阻碍了实际部署。现有量化方法面临激活分布复杂和敏感性的挑战。

Method: 建立强三元权重基线，提出RobustQuantizer进行鲁棒激活量化，利用Hadamard变换将未知分布转换为正态分布，并提出首个仅激活混合精度网络(AMPN)管道。

Result: 在无条件/条件图像生成任务中，RobuQ在亚4位量化配置下实现了最先进的DiT量化性能，首次在ImageNet-1K上实现平均2位激活量化的稳定竞争性图像生成。

Conclusion: RobuQ框架成功解决了DiTs在极低位量化中的激活量化瓶颈，为DiTs的实际部署提供了可行的量化解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have recently emerged as a powerful backbone
for image generation, demonstrating superior scalability and performance over
U-Net architectures. However, their practical deployment is hindered by
substantial computational and memory costs. While Quantization-Aware Training
(QAT) has shown promise for U-Nets, its application to DiTs faces unique
challenges, primarily due to the sensitivity and distributional complexity of
activations. In this work, we identify activation quantization as the primary
bottleneck for pushing DiTs to extremely low-bit settings. To address this, we
propose a systematic QAT framework for DiTs, named RobuQ. We start by
establishing a strong ternary weight (W1.58A4) DiT baseline. Building upon
this, we propose RobustQuantizer to achieve robust activation quantization. Our
theoretical analyses show that the Hadamard transform can convert unknown
per-token distributions into per-token normal distributions, providing a strong
foundation for this method. Furthermore, we propose AMPN, the first
Activation-only Mixed-Precision Network pipeline for DiTs. This method applies
ternary weights across the entire network while allocating different activation
precisions to each layer to eliminate information bottlenecks. Through
extensive experiments on unconditional and conditional image generation, our
RobuQ framework achieves state-of-the-art performance for DiT quantization in
sub-4-bit quantization configuration. To the best of our knowledge, RobuQ is
the first achieving stable and competitive image generation on large datasets
like ImageNet-1K with activations quantized to average 2 bits. The code and
models will be available at https://github.com/racoonykc/RobuQ .

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频人脸增强方法面临三个主要挑战：难以精确建模复杂面部纹理并保持时间一致性；由于缺乏高质量训练数据导致模型泛化能力受限；推理过程中重复去噪步骤导致效率低下。

Method: 基于预训练的WANX视频生成模型，采用单步流匹配范式，利用强大的时空先验实现从退化输入到高质量输出的直接映射。提出联合潜在-像素人脸聚焦训练策略，通过随机切换面部区域优化和全局重建，在潜在空间和像素空间提供显式监督。

Result: VividFace在感知质量、身份保持和时间稳定性方面达到了最先进水平，同时显著减少了推理时间。

Conclusion: VividFace通过创新的单步扩散框架和训练策略，有效解决了视频人脸增强的关键挑战，为研究社区提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Video Face Enhancement (VFE) seeks to reconstruct high-quality facial regions
from degraded video sequences, a capability that underpins numerous
applications including video conferencing, film restoration, and surveillance.
Despite substantial progress in the field, current methods that primarily rely
on video super-resolution and generative frameworks continue to face three
fundamental challenges: (1) faithfully modeling intricate facial textures while
preserving temporal consistency; (2) restricted model generalization due to the
lack of high-quality face video training data; and (3) low efficiency caused by
repeated denoising steps during inference. To address these challenges, we
propose VividFace, a novel and efficient one-step diffusion framework for video
face enhancement. Built upon the pretrained WANX video generation model, our
method leverages powerful spatiotemporal priors through a single-step flow
matching paradigm, enabling direct mapping from degraded inputs to high-quality
outputs with significantly reduced inference time. To further boost efficiency,
we propose a Joint Latent-Pixel Face-Focused Training strategy that employs
stochastic switching between facial region optimization and global
reconstruction, providing explicit supervision in both latent and pixel spaces
through a progressive two-stage training process. Additionally, we introduce an
MLLM-driven data curation pipeline for automated selection of high-quality
video face datasets, enhancing model generalization. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that VividFace achieves state-of-the-art results in perceptual
quality, identity preservation, and temporal stability, while offering
practical resources for the research community.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于前向散射中心模型的多层次异构知识迁移网络，用于解决SAR目标识别中样本不足的问题，通过特征、分布和类别三个层次迁移更纯净的目标知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的模拟数据辅助方法主要围绕模拟图像，但图像中嵌入的大量无关信息（如背景、噪声等）严重影响了迁移信息的质量。本文探索使用具有强物理意义和可解释性的前向散射中心模型来迁移更纯净和关键的目标知识。

Method: 提出了多层次异构知识迁移网络，包括：1）任务关联信息选择器分离非信息知识；2）目标通用知识迁移模块使用最大判别散度进行分布对齐；3）类别关系知识迁移模块利用类别关系一致性约束解决模拟与实测数据不平衡导致的优化偏差问题。

Result: 在两个由FSCM数据和实测SAR图像组成的新数据集上进行了广泛实验，证明了该方法的优越性能。

Conclusion: 通过逐步的知识选择和迁移，确保了迁移的FSCM知识的完整性，为SAR目标识别提供了一种有效的模拟数据辅助方法。

Abstract: Simulated data-assisted SAR target recognition methods are the research
hotspot currently, devoted to solving the problem of limited samples. Existing
works revolve around simulated images, but the large amount of irrelevant
information embedded in the images, such as background, noise, etc., seriously
affects the quality of the migrated information. Our work explores a new
simulated data to migrate purer and key target knowledge, i.e., forward
scattering center model (FSCM) which models the actual local structure of the
target with strong physical meaning and interpretability. To achieve this
purpose, multi-level heterogeneous knowledge transfer (MHKT) network is
proposed, which fully migrates FSCM knowledge from the feature, distribution
and category levels, respectively. Specifically, we permit the more suitable
feature representations for the heterogeneous data and separate non-informative
knowledge by task-associated information selector (TAIS), to complete purer
target feature migration. In the distribution alignment, the new metric
function maximum discrimination divergence (MDD) in target generic knowledge
transfer (TGKT) module perceives transferable knowledge efficiently while
preserving discriminative structure about classes. Moreover, category relation
knowledge transfer (CRKT) module leverages the category relation consistency
constraint to break the dilemma of optimization bias towards simulation data
due to imbalance between simulated and measured data. Such stepwise knowledge
selection and migration will ensure the integrity of the migrated FSCM
knowledge. Notably, extensive experiments on two new datasets formed by FSCM
data and measured SAR images demonstrate the superior performance of our
method.

Motivation: 传统Mamba架构依赖预定义的扫描路径，无法适应不同的图像退化情况，限制了修复性能和计算效率。

Method: 提出VAMamba框架，包含QCLAM（基于队列缓存的低秩自适应记忆）和GPS-SS2D（贪婪路径扫描SS2D）。QCLAM通过FIFO缓存存储历史表示并智能融合特征，GPS-SS2D使用Vision Transformer生成得分图来估计像素重要性，并通过贪婪策略确定最优扫描路径。

Conclusion: VAMamba通过自适应特征学习和扫描路径，能够有针对性地关注退化区域，同时保持高计算效率，为图像修复任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent Mamba-based image restoration methods have achieved promising results
but remain
  limited by fixed scanning patterns and inefficient feature utilization.
Conventional Mamba
  architectures rely on predetermined paths that cannot adapt to diverse
degradations, constraining
  both restoration performance and computational efficiency. To overcome these
limitations, we
  propose VAMamba, a Visual Adaptive Mamba framework with two key innovations.
First,
  QCLAM(Queue-basedCacheLow-rankAdaptiveMemory)enhancesfeaturelearningthrougha
  FIFO cache that stores historical representations. Similarity between current
LoRA-adapted and
  cached features guides intelligent fusion, enabling dynamic reuse while
effectively controlling
  memorygrowth.Second, GPS-SS2D(GreedyPathScanSS2D)introducesadaptive scanning.
A
  Vision Transformer generates score maps to estimate pixel importance, and a
greedy strategy de termines optimal forward and backward scanning paths. These
learned trajectories replace rigid
  patterns, enabling SS2D to perform targeted feature extraction. The
integration of QCLAM and
  GPS-SS2D allows VAMamba to adaptively focus on degraded regions while
maintaining high
  computational efficiency. Extensive experiments across diverse restoration
tasks demonstrate
  that VAMamba consistently outperforms existing approaches in both restoration
quality and
  efficiency, establishing new benchmarks for adaptive image restoration. Our

Abstract: Inspired by the human ability to learn and organize knowledge into
hierarchical taxonomies with prototypes, this paper addresses key limitations
in current deep hierarchical clustering methods. Existing methods often tie the
structure to the number of classes and underutilize the rich prototype
information available at intermediate hierarchical levels. We introduce deep
taxonomic networks, a novel deep latent variable approach designed to bridge
these gaps. Our method optimizes a large latent taxonomic hierarchy,
specifically a complete binary tree structured mixture-of-Gaussian prior within
a variational inference framework, to automatically discover taxonomic
structures and associated prototype clusters directly from unlabeled data
without assuming true label sizes. We analytically show that optimizing the
ELBO of our method encourages the discovery of hierarchical relationships among
prototypes. Empirically, our learned models demonstrate strong hierarchical
clustering performance, outperforming baselines across diverse image
classification datasets using our novel evaluation mechanism that leverages
prototype clusters discovered at all hierarchical levels. Qualitative results
further reveal that deep taxonomic networks discover rich and interpretable
hierarchical taxonomies, capturing both coarse-grained semantic categories and
fine-grained visual distinctions.

Motivation: 扩散模型在低剂量CT去噪中表现出色，但计算成本极高，推理时间超过千秒，阻碍了临床采用。需要开发高效且高质量的替代方案。

Method: 在压缩潜在空间中操作，使用感知优化的自编码器，通过基于注意力的条件U-Net进行快速、确定性的条件去噪扩散过程，大幅降低计算开销。

Conclusion: 通过弥合高保真度和临床可行性之间的差距，为医学成像中先进生成模型提供了实用路径。

Abstract: While diffusion models have set a new benchmark for quality in Low-Dose
Computed Tomography (LDCT) denoising, their clinical adoption is critically
hindered by extreme computational costs, with inference times often exceeding
thousands of seconds per scan. To overcome this barrier, we introduce MAN, a
Latent Diffusion Enhanced Multistage Anti-Noise Network for Efficient and
High-Quality Low-Dose CT Image Denoising task. Our method operates in a
compressed latent space via a perceptually-optimized autoencoder, enabling an
attention-based conditional U-Net to perform the fast, deterministic
conditional denoising diffusion process with drastically reduced overhead. On
the LDCT and Projection dataset, our model achieves superior perceptual
quality, surpassing CNN/GAN-based methods while rivaling the reconstruction
fidelity of computationally heavy diffusion models like DDPM and Dn-Dp. Most
critically, in the inference stage, our model is over 60x faster than
representative pixel space diffusion denoisers, while remaining competitive on
PSNR/SSIM scores. By bridging the gap between high fidelity and clinical
viability, our work demonstrates a practical path forward for advanced
generative models in medical imaging.

Result: 在780个概念对基准测试中，在视觉质量、语义一致性和人类评分创造力方面优于强基线方法

Conclusion: VMDiff能够有效合成单一连贯对象，实现结构感知融合并克服语义偏差

Abstract: Creating novel images by fusing visual cues from multiple sources is a
fundamental yet underexplored problem in image-to-image generation, with broad
applications in artistic creation, virtual reality and visual media. Existing
methods often face two key challenges: coexistent generation, where multiple
objects are simply juxtaposed without true integration, and bias generation,
where one object dominates the output due to semantic imbalance. To address
these issues, we propose Visual Mixing Diffusion (VMDiff), a simple yet
effective diffusion-based framework that synthesizes a single, coherent object
by integrating two input images at both noise and latent levels. Our approach
comprises: (1) a hybrid sampling process that combines guided denoising,
inversion, and spherical interpolation with adjustable parameters to achieve
structure-aware fusion, mitigating coexistent generation; and (2) an efficient
adaptive adjustment module, which introduces a novel similarity-based score to
automatically and adaptively search for optimal parameters, countering semantic
bias. Experiments on a curated benchmark of 780 concept pairs demonstrate that
our method outperforms strong baselines in visual quality, semantic
consistency, and human-rated creativity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度学习图像增强方法在计算效率与表示能力之间的权衡问题，传统3D LUT虽然实时但缺乏表示灵活性且依赖固定先验。

Result: 在三个基准测试上的广泛实验证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: FlowLUT成功整合了LUT的高效性、多先验知识和流匹配重建的优势，实现了实时高质量的图像增强。

Abstract: Deep learning-based image enhancement methods face a fundamental trade-off
between computational efficiency and representational capacity. For example,
although a conventional three-dimensional Look-Up Table (3D LUT) can process a
degraded image in real time, it lacks representational flexibility and depends
solely on a fixed prior. To address this problem, we introduce FlowLUT, a novel
end-to-end model that integrates the efficiency of LUTs, multiple priors, and
the parameter-independent characteristic of flow-matched reconstructed images.
Specifically, firstly, the input image is transformed in color space by a
collection of differentiable 3D LUTs (containing a large number of 3D LUTs with
different priors). Subsequently, a lightweight content-aware dynamically
predicts fusion weights, enabling scene-adaptive color correction with
$\mathcal{O}(1)$ complexity. Next, a lightweight fusion prediction network runs
on multiple 3D LUTs, with $\mathcal{O}(1)$ complexity for scene-adaptive color
correction.Furthermore, to address the inherent representation limitations of
LUTs, we design an innovative iterative flow matching method to restore local
structural details and eliminate artifacts. Finally, the entire model is
jointly optimized under a composite loss function enforcing perceptual and
structural fidelity. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method on three benchmarks.

Conclusion: 提出的任务和解决方案能够有效处理3D场景中与可移动物体的文本控制交互生成，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: We propose a novel task of text-controlled human object interaction
generation in 3D scenes with movable objects. Existing human-scene interaction
datasets suffer from insufficient interaction categories and typically only
consider interactions with static objects (do not change object positions), and
the collection of such datasets with movable objects is difficult and costly.
To address this problem, we construct the InteractMove dataset for Movable
Human-Object Interaction in 3D Scenes by aligning existing human object
interaction data with scene contexts, featuring three key characteristics: 1)
scenes containing multiple movable objects with text-controlled interaction
specifications (including same-category distractors requiring spatial and 3D
scene context understanding), 2) diverse object types and sizes with varied
interaction patterns (one-hand, two-hand, etc.), and 3) physically plausible
object manipulation trajectories. With the introduction of various movable
objects, this task becomes more challenging, as the model needs to identify
objects to be interacted with accurately, learn to interact with objects of
different sizes and categories, and avoid collisions between movable objects
and the scene. To tackle such challenges, we propose a novel pipeline solution.
We first use 3D visual grounding models to identify the interaction object.
Then, we propose a hand-object joint affordance learning to predict contact
regions for different hand joints and object parts, enabling accurate grasping
and manipulation of diverse objects. Finally, we optimize interactions with
local-scene modeling and collision avoidance constraints, ensuring physically
plausible motions and avoiding collisions between objects and the scene.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate our method's superiority in generating
physically plausible, text-compliant interactions compared to existing
approaches.

Abstract: Structural changes in retinal blood vessels are critical biomarkers for the
onset and progression of glaucoma and other ocular diseases. However, current
vessel segmentation approaches largely rely on supervised learning and
extensive manual annotations, which are costly, error-prone, and difficult to
obtain in optical coherence tomography angiography. Here we present
BioVessel-Net, an unsupervised generative framework that integrates vessel
biostatistics with adversarial refinement and a radius-guided segmentation
strategy. Unlike pixel-based methods, BioVessel-Net directly models vascular
structures with biostatistical coherence, achieving accurate and explainable
vessel extraction without labeled data or high-performance computing. To
support training and evaluation, we introduce RetinaMix, a new benchmark
dataset of 2D and 3D OCTA images with high-resolution vessel details from
diverse populations. Experimental results demonstrate that BioVessel-Net
achieves near-perfect segmentation accuracy across RetinaMix and existing
datasets, substantially outperforming state-of-the-art supervised and
semi-supervised methods. Together, BioVessel-Net and RetinaMix provide a
label-free, computationally efficient, and clinically interpretable solution
for retinal vessel analysis, with broad potential for glaucoma monitoring,
blood flow modeling, and progression prediction. Code and dataset are

Motivation: 现有文本到手写生成方法主要关注字符或单词级别，在应用到完整文本行时效率低下且缺乏整体结构建模，需要解决这些问题。

Method: 提出DiffInk框架：1) InkVAE序列变分自编码器，使用OCR损失和风格分类损失进行双重正则化；2) InkDiT潜在扩散Transformer，整合目标文本和参考风格生成连贯的笔迹轨迹。

Result: 实验结果表明DiffInk在字形准确性和风格保真度方面优于现有最先进方法，同时显著提高了生成效率。

Abstract: Deep generative models have advanced text-to-online handwriting generation
(TOHG), which aims to synthesize realistic pen trajectories conditioned on
textual input and style references. However, most existing methods still
primarily focus on character- or word-level generation, resulting in
inefficiency and a lack of holistic structural modeling when applied to full
text lines. To address these issues, we propose DiffInk, the first latent
diffusion Transformer framework for full-line handwriting generation. We first
introduce InkVAE, a novel sequential variational autoencoder enhanced with two
complementary latent-space regularization losses: (1) an OCR-based loss
enforcing glyph-level accuracy, and (2) a style-classification loss preserving
writing style. This dual regularization yields a semantically structured latent
space where character content and writer styles are effectively disentangled.
We then introduce InkDiT, a novel latent diffusion Transformer that integrates
target text and reference styles to generate coherent pen trajectories.
Experimental results demonstrate that DiffInk outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods in both glyph accuracy and style fidelity, while
significantly improving generation efficiency. Code will be made publicly
available.

*YuQian Li,Limeng Qiao,Lin Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出RIV模型，通过自省训练和递归推理机制为掩码扩散视觉语言模型添加自校正能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有掩码扩散视觉语言模型缺乏自校正能力，无法纠正生成token中的错误

Method: 引入自省模型识别生成序列中的错误（包括语法、拼写和逻辑错误），通过递归推理过程（解掩码→自省→重新掩码）循环优化输出

Result: 在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能，优于大多数现有MDVLMs

Conclusion: RIV模型成功为MDVLMs添加了自校正能力，显著提升了模型性能

Abstract: Mask Diffusion-based Vision Language Models (MDVLMs) have achieved remarkable
progress in multimodal understanding tasks. However, these models are unable to
correct errors in generated tokens, meaning they lack self-correction
capability. In this paper, we propose Recursive Introspection Mask Diffusion
Vision Language Model (RIV), which equips the model with self-correction
ability through two novel mechanisms. The first is Introspection Training,
where an Introspection Model is introduced to identify errors within generated
sequences. Introspection Training enables the model to detect not only
grammatical and spelling mistakes, but more importantly, logical errors. The
second is Recursive Inference. Beginning with the standard unmasking step, the
learned Introspection Model helps to identify errors in the output sequence and
remask them. This alternating
($\text{unmask}\rightarrow\text{introspection}\rightarrow\text{remask}$)
process is repeated recursively until reliable results are obtained.
Experimental results on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed RIV
achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming most existing MDVLMs.

Motivation: 解决多任务密集预测在机器人应用中面临的领域偏移问题，现有方法主要依赖对抗学习，效果不如自训练技术。

Method: 集成分割和深度基础模型到自训练范式，为目标域生成高质量伪标签，将鲁棒泛化能力蒸馏到单个高效学生网络中。

Conclusion: FAMDA适合为资源受限的机器人应用创建领域自适应和高效的模型。

Abstract: Multi-task dense prediction, which aims to jointly solve tasks like semantic
segmentation and depth estimation, is crucial for robotics applications but
suffers from domain shift when deploying models in new environments. While
unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) addresses this challenge for single tasks,
existing multi-task UDA methods primarily rely on adversarial learning
approaches that are less effective than recent self-training techniques. In
this paper, we introduce FAMDA, a simple yet effective UDA framework that
bridges this gap by leveraging Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) as powerful
teachers. Our approach integrates Segmentation and Depth foundation models into
a self-training paradigm to generate high-quality pseudo-labels for the target
domain, effectively distilling their robust generalization capabilities into a
single, efficient student network. Extensive experiments show that FAMDA
achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on standard synthetic-to-real UDA
multi-task learning (MTL) benchmarks and a challenging new day-to-night
adaptation task. Our framework enables the training of highly efficient models;
a lightweight variant achieves SOTA accuracy while being more than 10$\times$
smaller than foundation models, highlighting FAMDA's suitability for creating
domain-adaptive and efficient models for resource-constrained robotics
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在统一处理单人和多人运动任务方面存在局限，需要更有效的运动表示和模态集成方法。

Method: 使用残差量化的运动分词器将连续运动序列转换为多流离散标记；提出延迟并行建模策略，在时间上错开残差标记流的编码；采用双塔架构分离运动和语言模态参数。

Result: 消融研究验证了各组件有效性，广泛实验表明在多种运动相关任务上表现优异。

Conclusion: MotionVerse通过创新的运动表示和建模策略，成功实现了基于LLM的统一运动理解和生成框架。

Abstract: This paper proposes MotionVerse, a unified framework that harnesses the
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to comprehend, generate, and edit
human motion in both single-person and multi-person scenarios. To efficiently
represent motion data, we employ a motion tokenizer with residual quantization,
which converts continuous motion sequences into multi-stream discrete tokens.
Furthermore, we introduce a \textit{Delay Parallel} Modeling strategy, which
temporally staggers the encoding of residual token streams. This design enables
LLMs to effectively capture inter-stream dependencies while maintaining
computational efficiency comparable to single-stream modeling. Moreover, to
alleviate modality interference between motion and language, we design a
\textit{dual-tower architecture} with modality-specific parameters, ensuring
stable integration of motion information for both comprehension and generation
tasks. Comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of each
component in MotionVerse, and extensive experiments showcase its superior
performance across a wide range of motion-relevant tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LightFair是一种轻量级方法，通过微调文本编码器的嵌入来提升文本到图像扩散模型的公平性，采用距离约束去偏策略和两阶段采样策略，在保持生成质量的同时显著降低训练负担。

Motivation: 现有方法要么需要全参数训练，要么依赖辅助网络进行校正，导致训练或采样负担重且性能不佳。本文关注文本编码器这一最易微调的前端模块，通过解决文本编码器的不利影响来实现公平性。

Method: 提出协作距离约束去偏策略，平衡嵌入距离以改善公平性；引入两阶段文本引导采样策略，限制去偏文本编码器的干预时机，以保护原始生成质量。

Result: 在Stable Diffusion v1.5上，该方法仅需1/4的训练负担即可实现最先进的去偏效果，采样负担几乎没有增加。

Conclusion: LightFair是一种有效且高效的轻量级方法，通过微调文本嵌入显著提升了文本到图像扩散模型的公平性，同时保持了生成质量。

Abstract: This paper explores a novel lightweight approach LightFair to achieve fair
text-to-image diffusion models (T2I DMs) by addressing the adverse effects of
the text encoder. Most existing methods either couple different parts of the
diffusion model for full-parameter training or rely on auxiliary networks for
correction. They incur heavy training or sampling burden and unsatisfactory
performance. Since T2I DMs consist of multiple components, with the text
encoder being the most fine-tunable and front-end module, this paper focuses on
mitigating bias by fine-tuning text embeddings. To validate feasibility, we
observe that the text encoder's neutral embedding output shows substantial
skewness across image embeddings of various attributes in the CLIP space. More
importantly, the noise prediction network further amplifies this imbalance. To
finetune the text embedding, we propose a collaborative distance-constrained
debiasing strategy that balances embedding distances to improve fairness
without auxiliary references. However, mitigating bias can compromise the
original generation quality. To address this, we introduce a two-stage
text-guided sampling strategy to limit when the debiased text encoder
intervenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LightFair is effective and
efficient. Notably, on Stable Diffusion v1.5, our method achieves SOTA
debiasing at just $1/4$ of the training burden, with virtually no increase in
sampling burden. The code is available at https://github.com/boyuh/LightFair.

Motivation: 当前最先进的多实例学习方法依赖注意力机制，在处理数十万个补丁时由于二次复杂度需要大量计算资源，存在计算瓶颈问题。

Method: 设计了自适应补丁选择器(APS)，用基于RNN的GRU、LSTM和状态空间模型Mamba等高效序列模型替代Transformer中二次复杂度的自注意力机制。

Result: 在TCGA-Lung数据集上，EfficientMIL-Mamba达到AUC 0.976和准确率0.933；在CAMELYON16数据集上，EfficientMIL-GRU达到AUC 0.990和准确率0.975，超越之前最先进方法。

Conclusion: EfficientMIL在显著提升计算效率的同时，在多个组织病理学数据集上优于其他多实例学习方法，且APS比传统补丁选择策略更有效。

Abstract: Whole slide images (WSIs) classification represents a fundamental challenge
in computational pathology, where multiple instance learning (MIL) has emerged
as the dominant paradigm. Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) MIL methods rely on
attention mechanisms, achieving good performance but requiring substantial
computational resources due to quadratic complexity when processing hundreds of
thousands of patches. To address this computational bottleneck, we introduce
EfficientMIL, a novel linear-complexity MIL approach for WSIs classification
with the patches selection module Adaptive Patch Selector (APS) that we
designed, replacing the quadratic-complexity self-attention mechanisms in
Transformer-based MIL methods with efficient sequence models including
RNN-based GRU, LSTM, and State Space Model (SSM) Mamba. EfficientMIL achieves
significant computational efficiency improvements while outperforming other MIL
methods across multiple histopathology datasets. On TCGA-Lung dataset,
EfficientMIL-Mamba achieved AUC of 0.976 and accuracy of 0.933, while on
CAMELYON16 dataset, EfficientMIL-GRU achieved AUC of 0.990 and accuracy of
0.975, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that APS is also more effective for patches selection than
conventional selection strategies.

Motivation: 传统静态地图构建成本高、难以实时更新且缺乏跨区域泛化能力，限制了自动驾驶系统的可扩展性。需要转向动态的传感器驱动感知方法来实现更适应、可扩展和可解释的自动驾驶系统。

Method: 通过四个核心研究方向：1) 矢量化地图构建实现紧凑空间建模；2) 拓扑结构建模进行语义关系推理；3) 先验知识融合实现鲁棒领域知识集成；4) 基于语言模型的感知支持多模态场景理解。

Result: 这些研究方向共同推动了从静态预建地图到动态传感器驱动感知的范式转变，使自动驾驶系统能够实时构建地图和进行拓扑推理。

Conclusion: 拓扑感知感知的四个研究方向为构建更适应、可扩展和可解释的自动驾驶系统铺平了道路，实现了从静态地图到动态感知的根本性转变。

Abstract: The key to achieving autonomous driving lies in topology-aware perception,
the structured understanding of the driving environment with an emphasis on
lane topology and road semantics. This survey systematically reviews four core
research directions under this theme: vectorized map construction, topological
structure modeling, prior knowledge fusion, and language model-based
perception. Across these directions, we observe a unifying trend: a paradigm
shift from static, pre-built maps to dynamic, sensor-driven perception.
Specifically, traditional static maps have provided semantic context for
autonomous systems. However, they are costly to construct, difficult to update
in real time, and lack generalization across regions, limiting their
scalability. In contrast, dynamic representations leverage on-board sensor data
for real-time map construction and topology reasoning. Each of the four
research directions contributes to this shift through compact spatial modeling,
semantic relational reasoning, robust domain knowledge integration, and
multimodal scene understanding powered by pre-trained language models.
Together, they pave the way for more adaptive, scalable, and explainable
autonomous driving systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到图像模型虽然能生成逼真图像，但文本控制限制了更精确的指导需求，需要明确定义内容和精确位置以实现更精细控制

Method: 训练免费的方法，每个参考只需单张图像，通过图像指定所需内容并指导模型放置每个元素的位置

Result: 在各种图像组合任务中展示了方法的有效性

Conclusion: 该方法为多图像布局控制提供了简单而显式的控制机制，实现了对象和部件级别的精确组合

Abstract: Text-to-image models have achieved a level of realism that enables the
generation of highly convincing images. However, text-based control can be a
limiting factor when more explicit guidance is needed. Defining both the
content and its precise placement within an image is crucial for achieving
finer control. In this work, we address the challenge of multi-image layout
control, where the desired content is specified through images rather than
text, and the model is guided on where to place each element. Our approach is
training-free, requires a single image per reference, and provides explicit and
simple control for object and part-level composition. We demonstrate its
effectiveness across various image composition tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Sparse-Up框架，通过稀疏体素引导纹理重建，结合表面锚定和视域分割技术，在保证多视角一致性的同时突破分辨率限制，有效保留高频细节并显著降低内存消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D资产创建方法存在高频细节丢失问题，要么牺牲跨视角一致性导致纹理撕裂或漂移，要么受限于显式体素的分辨率上限而丢失精细纹理细节。

Method: 使用稀疏体素指导纹理重建，结合表面锚定（通过可学习上采样策略将体素约束到网格表面）和视域分割（图像块引导的体素分割方案），仅对可见局部块进行梯度监督和反向传播。

Result: 表面锚定消除了传统体素上采样中70%以上的冗余体素；视域分割显著降低了高分辨率体素训练时的内存消耗；在保持几何一致性的同时有效保留了纹理中的高频细节。

Conclusion: Sparse-Up是一个内存高效的高保真纹理建模框架，通过稀疏体素、表面锚定和视域分割的组合策略，成功解决了3D资产创建中的高频细节保留问题。

Abstract: The creation of high-fidelity 3D assets is often hindered by a 'pixel-level
pain point': the loss of high-frequency details. Existing methods often trade
off one aspect for another: either sacrificing cross-view consistency,
resulting in torn or drifting textures, or remaining trapped by the resolution
ceiling of explicit voxels, forfeiting fine texture detail. In this work, we
propose Sparse-Up, a memory-efficient, high-fidelity texture modeling framework
that effectively preserves high-frequency details. We use sparse voxels to
guide texture reconstruction and ensure multi-view consistency, while
leveraging surface anchoring and view-domain partitioning to break through
resolution constraints. Surface anchoring employs a learnable upsampling
strategy to constrain voxels to the mesh surface, eliminating over 70% of
redundant voxels present in traditional voxel upsampling. View-domain
partitioning introduces an image patch-guided voxel partitioning scheme,
supervising and back-propagating gradients only on visible local patches.
Through these two strategies, we can significantly reduce memory consumption
during high-resolution voxel training without sacrificing geometric
consistency, while preserving high-frequency details in textures.

Motivation: 解决在挑战性光照条件下新颖物体6D姿态估计的难题，需要在准确初始姿态估计和高效实时跟踪之间取得平衡。

Method: 使用共享的光照不变颜色对特征表示，该特征既用于初始估计阶段的RGB-D视图与3D网格的配准，也用于跟踪阶段的时间对应关系验证，通过轻量级模型回归物体运动。

Result: 在基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法既有效又鲁棒，在保持高保真跟踪的同时提供有竞争力的姿态估计精度，即使在突然姿态变化下也能稳定工作。

Conclusion: 该集成方法通过共享特征表示成功实现了准确初始估计和高效跟踪的统一，为边缘设备上的6D姿态估计提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Robust 6D pose estimation of novel objects under challenging illumination
remains a significant challenge, often requiring a trade-off between accurate
initial pose estimation and efficient real-time tracking. We present a unified
framework explicitly designed for efficient execution on edge devices, which
synergizes a robust initial estimation module with a fast motion-based tracker.
The key to our approach is a shared, lighting-invariant color-pair feature
representation that forms a consistent foundation for both stages. For initial
estimation, this feature facilitates robust registration between the live RGB-D
view and the object's 3D mesh. For tracking, the same feature logic validates
temporal correspondences, enabling a lightweight model to reliably regress the
object's motion. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that
our integrated approach is both effective and robust, providing competitive
pose estimation accuracy while maintaining high-fidelity tracking even through
abrupt pose changes.

Conclusion: ReWatch数据集和ReWatch-R1模型有效解决了视频推理中的数据瓶颈问题，显著提升了复杂视频推理能力。

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) significantly
advances image reasoning in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), its
application to complex video reasoning remains underdeveloped. This gap stems
primarily from a critical data bottleneck: existing datasets lack the
challenging, multi-hop questions and high-quality, video-grounded
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data necessary to effectively bootstrap RLVR. To address
this, we introduce ReWatch, a large-scale dataset built to foster advanced
video reasoning. We propose a novel multi-stage synthesis pipeline to
synthesize its three components: ReWatch-Caption, ReWatch-QA, and ReWatch-CoT.
A core innovation is our Multi-Agent ReAct framework for CoT synthesis, which
simulates a human-like "re-watching" process to generate video-grounded
reasoning traces by explicitly modeling information retrieval and verification.
Building on this dataset, we develop ReWatch-R1 by post-training a strong
baseline LVLM with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and our RLVR framework. This
framework incorporates a novel Observation \& Reasoning (O\&R) reward mechanism
that evaluates both the final answer's correctness and the reasoning's
alignment with video content, directly penalizing hallucination. Our
experiments show that ReWatch-R1 achieves state-of-the-art average performance
on five challenging video reasoning benchmarks.

TL;DR: 提出HIVTP方法，通过分层视觉令牌剪枝提高视觉语言模型的推理效率，无需训练即可显著减少推理时间并提升吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉编码器输出的视觉令牌数量庞大严重阻碍推理效率，且许多令牌并不重要可以安全剪枝。

Method: 使用视觉编码器中间层注意力图估计令牌重要性，采用分层剪枝方法：全局保留阶段按区域保留重要令牌，局部保留阶段在小窗口中保留最重要令牌。

Result: LLaVA-v1.5-7B和LLaVA-Next-7B的首次令牌时间分别减少50.0%和55.1%，令牌生成吞吐量提升60.9%和47.3%，精度无损甚至在某些基准上有所提升。

Conclusion: HIVTP在保持更好精度的同时提供更高的推理效率，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown strong capabilities on diverse
multimodal tasks. However, the large number of visual tokens output by the
vision encoder severely hinders inference efficiency, and prior studies have
shown that many of these tokens are not important and can therefore be safely
pruned. In this work, we propose HIVTP, a training-free method to improve VLMs
efficiency via hierarchical visual token pruning using a novel
middle-layer-based importance score. Specifically, we utilize attention maps
extracted from the middle layers of the vision encoder, which better reflect
fine-grained and object-level attention, to estimate visual token importance.
Based on this, we propose a hierarchical visual token pruning method to retain
both globally and locally important visual tokens. Specifically, we reshape the
1-D visual token sequence output by the vision encoder into a 2-D spatial
layout. In the global retaining stage, we divide the image into regions and
retain tokens with higher importance scores in each region; in the local
retaining stage, we then divide the image into small windows and retain the
most important token in each local window. Experimental results show that our
proposed method, HIVTP, can reduce the time-to-first-token (TTFT) of
LLaVA-v1.5-7B and LLaVA-Next-7B by up to 50.0% and 55.1%, respectively, and
improve the token generation throughput by up to 60.9% and 47.3%, without
sacrificing accuracy, and even achieving improvements on certain benchmarks.
Compared with prior works, HIVTP achieves better accuracy while offering higher
inference efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理手术视频时计算成本过高，且未能充分考虑视频数据的时空结构和信息分布异质性

Method: 采用时空解耦策略：时间维度通过显著性权重合并连续帧的对应token；空间维度通过时间稳定性分析优先合并静态token，保护动态区域

Result: 在保持竞争力的精度下，实现了超过65%的GFLOPs减少，支持长序列手术视频的高效训练

Conclusion: STIM-TM是首个专门针对手术视频理解的token合并方法，有效解决了手术应用中的计算瓶颈问题

Abstract: Vision Transformer models have shown impressive effectiveness in the surgical
video understanding tasks through long-range dependency modeling. However,
current methods suffer from prohibitive computational costs due to processing
massive spatiotemporal tokens across video frames. While prior work on token
merging has advanced model efficiency, they fail to adequately consider the
inherent spatiotemporal structure of video data and overlook the heterogeneous
nature of information distribution, leading to suboptimal performance. In this
paper, we propose a spatiotemporal information mining token merging (STIM-TM)
method, representing the first dedicated approach for surgical video
understanding. STIM-TM introduces a decoupled strategy that reduces token
redundancy along temporal and spatial dimensions independently. Specifically,
the temporal component merges spatially corresponding tokens from consecutive
frames using saliency weighting, preserving critical sequential information and
maintaining continuity. Meanwhile, the spatial component prioritizes merging
static tokens through temporal stability analysis, protecting dynamic regions
containing essential surgical information. Operating in a training-free manner,
STIM-TM achieves significant efficiency gains with over $65\%$ GFLOPs reduction
while preserving competitive accuracy across comprehensive surgical video
tasks. Our method also supports efficient training of long-sequence surgical
videos, addressing computational bottlenecks in surgical applications.

TL;DR: 提出了区域理解指数(RCI)来量化多模态数据集对全局与局部视觉信息的依赖程度，发现大多数现有基准偏向局部推理并存在空间偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态大语言模型在视觉语言基准上表现优异，但不清楚这些基准是否真正评估全局推理能力，还是仅通过局部视觉线索就能成功。

Method: 引入RCI评分，通过系统比较参考模型在图像块与完整图像上的性能表现，来衡量数据集对全局与局部视觉信息的依赖程度。

Result: 应用于13个常用多模态基准时，发现大多数基准偏向局部推理并存在显著空间偏差，表明在现实应用中存在风险。

Conclusion: RCI为研究人员提供了诊断和缓解这些偏差的可操作工具，有助于构建促进稳健、企业级多模态系统发展的数据集和基准。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive results on
vision-language benchmarks, yet it remains unclear whether these benchmarks
assess genuine global reasoning or allow success via localized visual cues.
Existing evaluation methods do not explicitly measure this distinction,
hindering effective dataset curation and real-world focused model development.
  We introduce Region Comprehension Index (RCI), the first model-based score to
directly quantify a dataset's reliance on global versus local visual
information. RCI systematically compares reference-model performance on image
patches versus full images, revealing if tasks require holistic image
understanding or can be solved with partial or localized visual cues.
  When applying RCI to 13 widely used multimodal benchmarks, we observed that
most of them favor localized reasoning and exhibit significant spatial biases,
indicating potential risks in real-world applications. RCI equips researchers &
practitioners with an actionable tool for diagnosing & mitigating these biases,
enabling the construction of datasets and benchmarks to foster the development
of robust, enterprise-ready multimodal systems.

*Dayu Tan,Ziwei Zhang,Yansan Su,Xin Peng,Yike Dai,Chunhou Zheng,Weimin Zhong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出MSD-KMamba框架，结合双向空间感知和多尺度自蒸馏，解决3D多模态图像分割中全局注意力机制计算复杂度高的问题，在保持高计算效率的同时提升分割精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CNN-Transformer混合模型依赖高复杂度全局注意力机制捕获长程依赖，导致非线性计算复杂度和资源消耗。知识蒸馏和稀疏注意力机制虽能提高效率，但难以在复杂任务中达到高分割精度。平衡模型性能与计算效率是重要挑战。

Method: 提出MSD-KMamba框架：1）双向空间感知分支捕获脑区长程空间上下文依赖，集成强大非线性特征提取机制；2）多尺度自蒸馏融合策略增强分层特征表示，改善不同分辨率级别的语义信息传递。

Result: 在多个标准基准数据集上的实验表明，MSD-KMamba在分割精度、鲁棒性和泛化能力方面持续优于最先进方法，同时保持高计算效率和良好可扩展性。

Conclusion: MSD-KMamba通过联合利用双向空间感知分支和多尺度自蒸馏融合策略，有效缓解体积分割中的二次计算复杂度瓶颈，同时解决全局感知不足的限制。

Abstract: Numerous CNN-Transformer hybrid models rely on high-complexity global
attention mechanisms to capture long-range dependencies, which introduces
non-linear computational complexity and leads to significant resource
consumption. Although knowledge distillation and sparse attention mechanisms
can improve efficiency, they often fall short of delivering the high
segmentation accuracy necessary for complex tasks. Balancing model performance
with computational efficiency remains a critical challenge. In this work, we
propose a novel 3D multi-modal image segmentation framework, termed MSD-KMamba,
which integrates bidirectional spatial perception with multi-scale
self-distillation. The bidirectional spatial aware branch effectively captures
long-range spatial context dependencies across brain regions, while also
incorporating a powerful nonlinear feature extraction mechanism that further
enhances the model's ability to learn complex and heterogeneous patterns. In
addition, the proposed multi-scale self-distilled fusion strategy strengthens
hierarchical feature representations and improves the transfer of semantic
information at different resolution levels. By jointly leveraging the
bidirectional spatial perception branch and the multi-scale self-distilled
fusion strategy, our framework effectively mitigates the bottleneck of
quadratic computational complexity in volumetric segmentation, while
simultaneously addressing the limitation of insufficient global perception.
Extensive experiments on multiple standard benchmark datasets demonstrate that
MSD-KMamba consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in segmentation
accuracy, robustness, and generalization, while maintaining high computational
efficiency and favorable scalability. The source code of MSD-KMamba is publicly
available at https://github.com/daimao-zhang/MSD-KMamba.

TL;DR: QuantSparse是一个统一框架，将模型量化与注意力稀疏化相结合，显著提升了扩散变换器的视频生成效率，同时保持高质量输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散变换器在视频生成方面表现出色，但计算和内存成本过高阻碍了实际部署。单独使用模型量化或注意力稀疏化在激进压缩下会导致严重的性能下降。

Method: 提出QuantSparse框架：1）多尺度显著注意力蒸馏，利用全局结构指导和局部显著监督缓解量化偏差；2）二阶稀疏注意力重参数化，利用二阶残差的时间稳定性高效恢复稀疏化丢失的信息。

Result: 在HunyuanVideo-13B上的实验显示，QuantSparse达到20.88 PSNR，显著优于最先进的量化基线Q-VDiT（16.85 PSNR），同时存储减少3.68倍，端到端推理加速1.88倍。

Conclusion: QuantSparse成功解决了量化与稀疏化结合的挑战，在保持视频生成质量的同时大幅提升了效率，为扩散变换器的实际部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Diffusion transformers exhibit remarkable video generation capability, yet
their prohibitive computational and memory costs hinder practical deployment.
Model quantization and attention sparsification are two promising directions
for compression, but each alone suffers severe performance degradation under
aggressive compression. Combining them promises compounded efficiency gains,
but naive integration is ineffective. The sparsity-induced information loss
exacerbates quantization noise, leading to amplified attention shifts. To
address this, we propose \textbf{QuantSparse}, a unified framework that
integrates model quantization with attention sparsification. Specifically, we
introduce \textit{Multi-Scale Salient Attention Distillation}, which leverages
both global structural guidance and local salient supervision to mitigate
quantization-induced bias. In addition, we develop \textit{Second-Order Sparse
Attention Reparameterization}, which exploits the temporal stability of
second-order residuals to efficiently recover information lost under sparsity.
Experiments on HunyuanVideo-13B demonstrate that QuantSparse achieves 20.88
PSNR, substantially outperforming the state-of-the-art quantization baseline
Q-VDiT (16.85 PSNR), while simultaneously delivering a \textbf{3.68$\times$}
reduction in storage and \textbf{1.88$\times$} acceleration in end-to-end
inference. Our code will be released in

TL;DR: 提出了HomeSafeBench基准，用于评估具身代理在家庭安全检查任务中的能力，包含12,900个数据点，涵盖五种常见家庭安全隐患。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准存在两个关键局限：使用文本描述而非视觉信息，以及使用静态单一视角观察环境，这限制了基于视觉语言模型的具身代理的准确评估。

Method: 提供动态第一人称视角图像，允许代理自由探索房间，在复杂环境中提供多个动态视角进行更全面的检查。

Result: 对主流视觉语言模型的综合评估显示，即使表现最佳的模型F1分数也仅为10.23%，表明当前模型在识别安全隐患和选择有效探索策略方面存在显著局限性。

Conclusion: HomeSafeBench将为未来家庭安全检查相关研究提供有价值的参考和支持，数据集和代码将公开。

Abstract: Embodied agents can identify and report safety hazards in the home
environments. Accurately evaluating their capabilities in home safety
inspection tasks is curcial, but existing benchmarks suffer from two key
limitations. First, they oversimplify safety inspection tasks by using textual
descriptions of the environment instead of direct visual information, which
hinders the accurate evaluation of embodied agents based on Vision-Language
Models (VLMs). Second, they use a single, static viewpoint for environmental
observation, which restricts the agents' free exploration and cause the
omission of certain safety hazards, especially those that are occluded from a
fixed viewpoint. To alleviate these issues, we propose HomeSafeBench, a
benchmark with 12,900 data points covering five common home safety hazards:
fire, electric shock, falling object, trips, and child safety. HomeSafeBench
provides dynamic first-person perspective images from simulated home
environments, enabling the evaluation of VLM capabilities for home safety
inspection. By allowing the embodied agents to freely explore the room,
HomeSafeBench provides multiple dynamic perspectives in complex environments
for a more thorough inspection. Our comprehensive evaluation of mainstream VLMs
on HomeSafeBench reveals that even the best-performing model achieves an
F1-score of only 10.23%, demonstrating significant limitations in current VLMs.
The models particularly struggle with identifying safety hazards and selecting
effective exploration strategies. We hope HomeSafeBench will provide valuable
reference and support for future research related to home security inspections.
Our dataset and code will be publicly available soon.

TL;DR: 通过集成多种特征提取骨干网络的SSD模型，并使用加权框融合(WBF)方法，显著提升了武器检测在复杂环境下的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 公共空间安全监控需要准确检测武器，但现有单模型检测器在遮挡、光照变化和复杂背景等挑战性条件下鲁棒性不足。

Method: 使用VGG16、ResNet50、EfficientNet和MobileNetV3等不同骨干网络训练多个SSD模型，然后通过加权框融合(WBF)方法集成这些模型的预测结果。

Result: 采用'max'置信度评分策略的WBF方法实现了0.838的平均精度(mAP)，相比最佳单模型提升了2.948%，且优于其他融合启发式方法。

Conclusion: 研究表明融合策略与集成多样性同等重要，置信度感知融合是提升集成模型准确性的关键机制，为实时武器检测提供了鲁棒解决方案。

Abstract: The safety and security of public spaces is of vital importance, driving the
need for sophisticated surveillance systems capable of accurately detecting
weapons, which are often hampered by issues like partial occlusion, varying
lighting, and cluttered backgrounds. While single-model detectors are advanced,
they often lack robustness in these challenging conditions. This paper presents
the hypothesis that ensemble of Single Shot Multibox Detector (SSD) models with
diverse feature extraction backbones can significantly enhance detection
robustness. To leverage diverse feature representations, individual SSD models
were trained using a selection of backbone networks: VGG16, ResNet50,
EfficientNet, and MobileNetV3. The study is conducted on a dataset consisting
of images of three distinct weapon classes: guns, heavy weapons and knives. The
predictions from these models are combined using the Weighted Boxes Fusion
(WBF) method, an ensemble technique designed to optimize bounding box accuracy.
Our key finding is that the fusion strategy is as critical as the ensemble's
diversity, a WBF approach using a 'max' confidence scoring strategy achieved a
mean Average Precision (mAP) of 0.838. This represents a 2.948% relative
improvement over the best-performing single model and consistently outperforms
other fusion heuristics. This research offers a robust approach to enhancing
real-time weapon detection capabilities in surveillance applications by
demonstrating that confidence-aware fusion is a key mechanism for improving
accuracy metrics of ensembles.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决协作感知系统中频繁合作交互和实时需求带来的严格带宽限制问题，同时弥补LiDAR聚焦实现中性能落后于最先进方法的不足。

Method: 提出INSTINCT框架，包含三个核心组件：质量感知过滤机制选择高质量实例特征；双分支检测路由方案解耦协作相关和无关实例；跨代理本地实例融合模块聚合本地混合实例特征。

Result: 在DAIR-V2X和V2V4Real数据集上，精度分别提升13.23%和33.08%，同时通信带宽降至最先进方法的1/281和1/264。

Conclusion: INSTINCT通过实例级交互实现了在显著降低通信带宽需求的同时提升协作感知性能，为实际部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Collaborative perception systems overcome single-vehicle limitations in
long-range detection and occlusion scenarios by integrating multi-agent sensory
data, improving accuracy and safety. However, frequent cooperative interactions
and real-time requirements impose stringent bandwidth constraints. Previous
works proves that query-based instance-level interaction reduces bandwidth
demands and manual priors, however, LiDAR-focused implementations in
collaborative perception remain underdeveloped, with performance still trailing
state-of-the-art approaches. To bridge this gap, we propose INSTINCT
(INSTance-level INteraCtion ArchiTecture), a novel collaborative perception
framework featuring three core components: 1) a quality-aware filtering
mechanism for high-quality instance feature selection; 2) a dual-branch
detection routing scheme to decouple collaboration-irrelevant and
collaboration-relevant instances; and 3) a Cross Agent Local Instance Fusion
module to aggregate local hybrid instance features. Additionally, we enhance
the ground truth (GT) sampling technique to facilitate training with diverse
hybrid instance features. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets
demonstrate that INSTINCT achieves superior performance. Specifically, our
method achieves an improvement in accuracy 13.23%/33.08% in DAIR-V2X and
V2V4Real while reducing the communication bandwidth to 1/281 and 1/264 compared
to state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at

TL;DR: CrimEdit是一个统一的扩散模型，通过联合训练移除和插入任务嵌入，利用分类器无关引导方案来增强对象及其效果的移除，并在插入时可控合成对象效果，还能在单步去噪中实现对象移动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法使用在反事实数据集上训练的扩散模型来处理对象效果，但分类器无关引导在处理对象效果方面的性能影响在统一模型中尚未充分探索。为了填补这一空白并提高复合编辑效率，提出了CrimEdit。

Method: 联合训练移除和插入的任务嵌入到单一模型中，在分类器无关引导方案中利用这些嵌入，增强对象及其效果的移除，并实现插入时对象效果的可控合成。还将这两个任务提示扩展到空间不同区域，实现单步去噪中的对象移动。

Result: 广泛实验表明，CrimEdit实现了卓越的对象移除、可控效果插入和高效对象移动，无需额外训练或单独的移除和插入阶段。

Conclusion: CrimEdit通过联合训练任务嵌入和分类器无关引导，在统一模型中有效处理对象移除、插入和移动任务，提高了复合编辑的效率和性能。

Abstract: Recent works on object removal and insertion have enhanced their performance
by handling object effects such as shadows and reflections, using diffusion
models trained on counterfactual datasets. However, the performance impact of
applying classifier-free guidance to handle object effects across removal and
insertion tasks within a unified model remains largely unexplored. To address
this gap and improve efficiency in composite editing, we propose CrimEdit,
which jointly trains the task embeddings for removal and insertion within a
single model and leverages them in a classifier-free guidance scheme --
enhancing the removal of both objects and their effects, and enabling
controllable synthesis of object effects during insertion. CrimEdit also
extends these two task prompts to be applied to spatially distinct regions,
enabling object movement (repositioning) within a single denoising step. By
employing both guidance techniques, extensive experiments show that CrimEdit
achieves superior object removal, controllable effect insertion, and efficient
object movement without requiring additional training or separate removal and
insertion stages.

Conclusion: PD-Diag-Net通过整合临床先验知识，实现了高精度的帕金森病自动化诊断，具有重要的临床应用价值。

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder that severely
diminishes patients' quality of life. Its global prevalence has increased
markedly in recent decades. Current diagnostic workflows are complex and
heavily reliant on neurologists' expertise, often resulting in delays in early
detection and missed opportunities for timely intervention. To address these
issues, we propose an end-to-end automated diagnostic method for PD, termed
PD-Diag-Net, which performs risk assessment and auxiliary diagnosis directly
from raw MRI scans. This framework first introduces an MRI Pre-processing
Module (MRI-Processor) to mitigate inter-subject and inter-scanner variability
by flexibly integrating established medical imaging preprocessing tools. It
then incorporates two forms of clinical prior knowledge: (1)
Brain-Region-Relevance-Prior (Relevance-Prior), which specifies brain regions
strongly associated with PD; and (2) Brain-Region-Aging-Prior (Aging-Prior),
which reflects the accelerated aging typically observed in PD-associated
regions. Building on these priors, we design two dedicated modules: the
Relevance-Prior Guided Feature Aggregation Module (Aggregator), which guides
the model to focus on PD-associated regions at the inter-subject level, and the
Age-Prior Guided Diagnosis Module (Diagnoser), which leverages brain age gaps
as auxiliary constraints at the intra-subject level to enhance diagnostic
accuracy and clinical interpretability. Furthermore, we collected external test
data from our collaborating hospital. Experimental results show that
PD-Diag-Net achieves 86\% accuracy on external tests and over 96% accuracy in
early-stage diagnosis, outperforming existing advanced methods by more than
20%.

Motivation: 潜在扩散模型在低层视觉任务中表现出色，但由于点云的无结构和不规则特性，其在点云补全中的应用尚未充分探索

Method: 两阶段框架：1) 将部分点云投影为深度图像，使用DepthLDM生成完整多视角深度图像形成粗点云；2) 设计点去噪网络去除伪影，使用关联感知点上采样器生成密集高保真输出

Conclusion: DiffPCN通过结合扩散模型的强大生成能力和点云处理技术，有效解决了点云补全问题，为不规则数据的生成任务提供了新思路

Abstract: Latent diffusion models (LDMs) have demonstrated remarkable generative
capabilities across various low-level vision tasks. However, their potential
for point cloud completion remains underexplored due to the unstructured and
irregular nature of point clouds. In this work, we propose DiffPCN, a novel
diffusion-based coarse-to-fine framework for point cloud completion. Our
approach comprises two stages: an initial stage for generating coarse point
clouds, and a refinement stage that improves their quality through point
denoising and upsampling. Specifically, we first project the unordered and
irregular partial point cloud into structured depth images, which serve as
conditions for a well-designed DepthLDM to synthesize completed multi-view
depth images that are used to form coarse point clouds. In this way, our
DiffPCN can yield high-quality and high-completeness coarse point clouds by
leveraging LDM' s powerful generation and comprehension capabilities. Then,
since LDMs inevitably introduce outliers into the generated depth maps, we
design a Point Denoising Network to remove artifacts from the coarse point
cloud by predicting a per-point distance score. Finally, we devise an
Association-Aware Point Upsampler, which guides the upsampling process by
leveraging local association features between the input point cloud and the
corresponding coarse points, further yielding a dense and high-fidelity output.
Experimental results demonstrate that our DiffPCN achieves state-of-the-art
performance in geometric accuracy and shape completeness, significantly
improving the robustness and consistency of point cloud completion.

Abstract: Recent Video-Language Models (VLMs) achieve promising results on long-video
understanding, but their performance still lags behind that achieved on tasks
involving images or short videos. This has led to great interest in improving
the long context modeling of VLMs by introducing novel modules and additional
complexity. % additional training time. In this paper, we take a different
approach: rather than fine-tuning VLMs with the limited data available, we
attempt to maximize the performance of existing models. To this end, we propose
a novel visual prompting strategy specifically designed for long-video
understanding. By combining multiple frames as panels into one image, we
effectively trade off spatial details for temporal resolution. Our approach is
training-free, parameter-free, and model-agnostic, and can be seamlessly
integrated into existing VLMs. Extensive experiments on five established
benchmarks across a wide range of model architectures, sizes, and context
windows confirm the consistency of our approach. For the TimeScope (Long)
dataset, which has the longest videos, the accuracy for video question
answering is improved by up to 19.4\%. Overall, our method raises the bar for
long video understanding models. We will make our code available upon

Motivation: 当前3D室内布局生成模型受限于现有数据集的规模小、多样性不足和标注质量差，无法充分学习复杂的空间和语义模式。

Method: 构建了包含真实世界扫描、专业CAD设计和程序生成场景的多源数据集M3DLayout，每个布局都配有详细的结构化文本描述，包括全局场景摘要、大型家具的关系放置和小型物品的细粒度排列。

Result: 使用文本条件扩散模型建立基准测试，实验结果表明M3DLayout为训练布局生成模型提供了坚实基础，其多源组成增强了多样性，特别是Inf3DLayout子集提供了丰富的小物体信息，能够生成更复杂和详细的场景。

Conclusion: M3DLayout可以作为推进文本驱动3D场景合成研究的宝贵资源。

Abstract: In text-driven 3D scene generation, object layout serves as a crucial
intermediate representation that bridges high-level language instructions with
detailed geometric output. It not only provides a structural blueprint for
ensuring physical plausibility but also supports semantic controllability and
interactive editing. However, the learning capabilities of current 3D indoor
layout generation models are constrained by the limited scale, diversity, and
annotation quality of existing datasets. To address this, we introduce
M3DLayout, a large-scale, multi-source dataset for 3D indoor layout generation.
M3DLayout comprises 15,080 layouts and over 258k object instances, integrating
three distinct sources: real-world scans, professional CAD designs, and
procedurally generated scenes. Each layout is paired with detailed structured
text describing global scene summaries, relational placements of large
furniture, and fine-grained arrangements of smaller items. This diverse and
richly annotated resource enables models to learn complex spatial and semantic
patterns across a wide variety of indoor environments. To assess the potential
of M3DLayout, we establish a benchmark using a text-conditioned diffusion
model. Experimental results demonstrate that our dataset provides a solid
foundation for training layout generation models. Its multi-source composition
enhances diversity, notably through the Inf3DLayout subset which provides rich
small-object information, enabling the generation of more complex and detailed
scenes. We hope that M3DLayout can serve as a valuable resource for advancing
research in text-driven 3D scene synthesis.

*Shubhang Bhatnagar,Andy Xu,Kar-Han Tan,Narendra Ahuja*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了LUQ（Layerwise Ultra-Low Bit Quantization）方法，针对多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）进行超低比特量化，通过选择性对量化容忍度高的层应用超低比特量化，显著减少内存使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型部署需要大量内存和计算资源，虽然语言模型的后训练量化已成功压缩至1比特，但多模态模型的量化效果尚未充分探索，特别是多模态token比文本token具有更高的统计方差和熵，对超低比特量化更敏感。

Method: 提出LUQ方法：分析发现不同层的激活分布差异显著，某些层具有较低熵的激活分布，对这些层选择性应用超低比特量化；同时使用混合多模态token（图像和文本）进行PTQ以提升VQA性能。

Result: 在LLaVA-1.5和Qwen-2.5-VL上评估，LUQ模型比4位量化模型分别减少40%和31%内存使用，在MME基准测试中性能下降小于10%。

Conclusion: LUQ方法有效解决了多模态大语言模型超低比特量化的挑战，通过层间选择性量化和混合token策略，在显著减少内存占用的同时保持了良好的性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with multimodal capabilities have revolutionized
vision-language tasks, but their deployment often requires huge memory and
computational resources. While post-training quantization (PTQ) has
successfully compressed language models to as low as 1-bit precision without
significant performance loss, its effectiveness for multimodal LLMs (MLLMs)
remains relatively unexplored. In this paper, we present the first study on
ultra-low bit (<4-bit) quantization for multimodal LLMs. Our analysis reveals
that multimodal tokens and intermediate layer activations produced by them
exhibit significantly higher statistical variance and entropy compared to text
tokens, making them less tolerant to ultra-low bit quantization. However, the
activation distributions of multimodal tokens varies significantly over
different layers, with some layers having lower entropy activation
distributions. We empirically show that such layers in these models can better
tolerate ultra-low bit quantization. Building on these insights, we propose a
novel strategy for MLLM quantization, LUQ: Layerwise Ultra-Low Bit
Quantization, which selectively applies ultra-low bit quantization to layers
that are more resilient to it. Additionally, we also show that using a mix of
multimodal tokens (image and text) for PTQ boosts VQA performance in the
ultra-low bit regime. We evaluate our method on LLaVA-1.5 and Qwen-2.5-VL
across 9 popular VQA benchmarks. The resulting LUQ models use 40% and 31% less
memory than their 4-bit counterparts, respectively, while exhibiting a
performance degradation of less than 10% on the MME benchmark.

### [144] [HieraTok: Multi-Scale Visual Tokenizer Improves Image Reconstruction and Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23736)

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HieraTok是一种新颖的多尺度ViT标记器，通过多尺度下采样和尺度因果注意力机制，在图像重建和生成任务中显著优于单尺度方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 克服单尺度表示建模的固有局限性，实现从低分辨率全局语义特征到高分辨率结构细节的信息渐进流动。

Method: 采用多尺度下采样生成多尺度标记序列，并结合尺度因果注意力机制。

Result: 相比单尺度方法，rFID提升27.2%(1.47→1.07)，下游生成任务收敛速度加快1.38倍，gFID提升18.9%(16.4→13.3)，最终达到ViT标记器中最佳的rFID 0.45和gFID 1.82。

Conclusion: 这是首个在图像重建和生成中引入多尺度ViT标记器的工作，其设计和发现将推动ViT标记器在视觉生成任务中的发展。

Abstract: In this work, we present HieraTok, a novel multi-scale Vision Transformer
(ViT)-based tokenizer that overcomes the inherent limitation of modeling
single-scale representations. This is realized through two key designs: (1)
multi-scale downsampling applied to the token map generated by the tokenizer
encoder, producing a sequence of multi-scale tokens, and (2) a scale-causal
attention mechanism that enables the progressive flow of information from
low-resolution global semantic features to high-resolution structural details.
Coupling these designs, HieraTok achieves significant improvements in both
image reconstruction and generation tasks. Under identical settings, the
multi-scale visual tokenizer outperforms its single-scale counterpart by a
27.2\% improvement in rFID ($1.47 \rightarrow 1.07$). When integrated into
downstream generation frameworks, it achieves a $1.38\times$ faster convergence
rate and an 18.9\% boost in gFID ($16.4 \rightarrow 13.3$), which may be
attributed to the smoother and more uniformly distributed latent space.
Furthermore, by scaling up the tokenizer's training, we demonstrate its
potential by a sota rFID of 0.45 and a gFID of 1.82 among ViT tokenizers. To
the best of our knowledge, we are the first to introduce multi-scale ViT-based
tokenizer in image reconstruction and image generation. We hope our findings
and designs advance the ViT-based tokenizers in visual generation tasks.

Motivation: 现有DUSt3R方法仅使用图像对估计点云图，忽略了空间记忆和全局一致性，导致重建结果缺乏全局一致性。

Method: 使用潜在状态作为空间记忆，设计基于transformer的门控更新模块；将场景划分为子图，在子图内进行局部对齐，然后使用相对约束将所有子图注册到共同的世界坐标系。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，该框架实现了优越的重建精度，同时保持实时性能。

Conclusion: 提出的GRS-SLAM3R框架通过空间记忆和子图策略有效解决了全局一致性问题，在保持实时性的同时显著提升了重建精度。

Abstract: DUSt3R-based end-to-end scene reconstruction has recently shown promising
results in dense visual SLAM. However, most existing methods only use image
pairs to estimate pointmaps, overlooking spatial memory and global
consistency.To this end, we introduce GRS-SLAM3R, an end-to-end SLAM framework
for dense scene reconstruction and pose estimation from RGB images without any
prior knowledge of the scene or camera parameters. Unlike existing DUSt3R-based
frameworks, which operate on all image pairs and predict per-pair point maps in
local coordinate frames, our method supports sequentialized input and
incrementally estimates metric-scale point clouds in the global coordinate. In
order to improve consistent spatial correlation, we use a latent state for
spatial memory and design a transformer-based gated update module to reset and
update the spatial memory that continuously aggregates and tracks relevant 3D
information across frames. Furthermore, we partition the scene into submaps,
apply local alignment within each submap, and register all submaps into a
common world frame using relative constraints, producing a globally consistent
map. Experiments on various datasets show that our framework achieves superior
reconstruction accuracy while maintaining real-time performance.

Conclusion: ResAD++通过残差特征和特征解相关技术有效解决了类别无关异常检测问题，实现了优异的泛化性能

Abstract: This paper explores the problem of class-agnostic anomaly detection (AD),
where the objective is to train one class-agnostic AD model that can generalize
to detect anomalies in diverse new classes from different domains without any
retraining or fine-tuning on the target data. When applied for new classes, the
performance of current single- and multi-class AD methods is still
unsatisfactory. One fundamental reason is that representation learning in
existing methods is still class-related, namely, feature correlation. To
address this issue, we propose residual features and construct a simple but
effective framework, termed ResAD. Our core insight is to learn the residual
feature distribution rather than the initial feature distribution. Residual
features are formed by matching and then subtracting normal reference features.
In this way, we can effectively realize feature decorrelation. Even in new
classes, the distribution of normal residual features would not remarkably
shift from the learned distribution. In addition, we think that residual
features still have one issue: scale correlation. To this end, we propose a
feature hypersphere constraining approach, which learns to constrain initial
normal residual features into a spatial hypersphere for enabling the feature
scales of different classes as consistent as possible. Furthermore, we propose
a novel logbarrier bidirectional contraction OCC loss and vector quantization
based feature distribution matching module to enhance ResAD, leading to the
improved version of ResAD (ResAD++). Comprehensive experiments on eight
real-world AD datasets demonstrate that our ResAD++ can achieve remarkable AD
results when directly used in new classes, outperforming state-of-the-art
competing methods and also surpassing ResAD. The code is available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在视觉指向任务中表现远低于人类水平，主要限制是需要单步完成指向任务，类似于要求人类不看手指直接指向目标。

Method: 提出Point, Visualize, then Refine (Poivre)自我精炼过程，使用强化学习训练模型先标记估计点，然后迭代精炼坐标，设计了有效的过程奖励机制。

Result: Poivre-7B在Point-Bench上创下新记录，超越Gemini-2.5-Pro和Molmo-72B等模型超过3%。

Conclusion: Poivre方法通过自我精炼过程显著提升了视觉指向任务的性能，证明了迭代精炼策略的有效性，并发布了训练代码、数据集和模型检查点。

Abstract: Visual pointing, which aims to localize a target by predicting its
coordinates on an image, has emerged as an important problem in the realm of
vision-language models (VLMs). Despite its broad applicability, recent
benchmarks show that current VLMs still fall far behind human performance on
this task. A key limitation is that VLMs are typically required to complete the
pointing task in a single step, akin to asking humans to point at an object
without seeing their own fingers. To address this issue, we propose a simple
yet effective self-refining procedure: Point, Visualize, then Refine (Poivre).
This procedure enables a VLM to first mark its estimated point, then
iteratively refine the coordinates if necessary. Inspired by advances of
reasoning models in the natural language domain, we employ reinforcement
learning (RL) to incentivize this self-refining ability. For the RL training,
we design a neat process reward that is not only empirically effective but also
grounded in appealing properties. Our trained model, Poivre-7B, sets a new
state of the art on Point-Bench, outperforming both proprietary models such as
Gemini-2.5-Pro and large open-source models such as Molmo-72B by over 3%. To
support future research, we release our training and inference code, dataset,
and the Poivre-7B checkpoint.

Abstract: Colorectal cancer ranks among the most common and deadly cancers, emphasizing
the need for effective early detection and treatment. To address the
limitations of traditional colonoscopy, including high miss rates due to polyp
variability, we introduce the Pyramid Vision Transformer Adapter Residual
Network (PVTAdpNet). This model integrates a U-Net-style encoder-decoder
structure with a Pyramid Vision Transformer backbone, novel residual blocks,
and adapter-based skip connections. The design enhances feature extraction,
dense prediction, and gradient flow, supported by squeeze-and-excitation
attention for improved channel-wise feature refinement. PVTAdpNet achieves
real-time, accurate polyp segmentation, demonstrating superior performance on
benchmark datasets with high mDice and mIoU scores, making it highly suitable
for clinical applications. PVTAdpNet obtains a high Dice coefficient of 0.8851
and a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 0.8167 on out-of-distribution
polyp datasets. Evaluation of the PolypGen dataset demonstrates PVTAdpNet's

Conclusion: 扩散模型在统一多模态生成方面具有显著潜力，UniAlignment为多模态语义理解提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The remarkable success of diffusion models in text-to-image generation has
sparked growing interest in expanding their capabilities to a variety of
multi-modal tasks, including image understanding, manipulation, and perception.
These tasks require advanced semantic comprehension across both visual and
textual modalities, especially in scenarios involving complex semantic
instructions. However, existing approaches often rely heavily on
vision-language models (VLMs) or modular designs for semantic guidance, leading
to fragmented architectures and computational inefficiency. To address these
challenges, we propose UniAlignment, a unified multimodal generation framework
within a single diffusion transformer. UniAlignment introduces a dual-stream
diffusion training strategy that incorporates both intrinsic-modal semantic
alignment and cross-modal semantic alignment, thereby enhancing the model's
cross-modal consistency and instruction-following robustness. Additionally, we
present SemGen-Bench, a new benchmark specifically designed to evaluate
multimodal semantic consistency under complex textual instructions. Extensive
experiments across multiple tasks and benchmarks demonstrate that UniAlignment
outperforms existing baselines, underscoring the significant potential of
diffusion models in unified multimodal generation.

TL;DR: GenView++是一个统一的对比学习框架，通过多源自适应视图生成和质量驱动的对比学习机制，解决了正样本对构建质量差和训练中缺乏质量评估的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对比学习方法在正样本对构建方面存在多样性不足和语义损坏风险，在学习方面缺乏质量评估机制导致所有样本对被同等对待，影响学习效果。

Method: 提出多源自适应视图生成机制，通过动态调制图像条件、文本条件和图像-文本条件策略来合成多样且语义一致的视图；引入质量驱动的对比学习机制，评估每对样本的语义对齐和多样性，动态重新加权其训练贡献。

Result: 在视觉表示学习中，将MoCov2在ImageNet线性分类上的性能提升2.5%；在视觉-语言学习中，零样本分类准确率比CLIP平均提高12.31%，比SLIP提高5.31%，Flickr30k文本检索R@5提升3.2%。

Conclusion: GenView++通过协同创新的视图生成和质量评估机制，显著提升了对比学习在视觉和视觉-语言任务中的性能，证明了其在构建高质量正样本对方面的有效性。

Abstract: The success of contrastive learning depends on the construction and
utilization of high-quality positive pairs. However, current methods face
critical limitations on two fronts: on the construction side, both handcrafted
and generative augmentations often suffer from limited diversity and risk
semantic corruption; on the learning side, the absence of a quality assessment
mechanism leads to suboptimal supervision where all pairs are treated equally.
To tackle these challenges, we propose GenView++, a unified framework that
addresses both fronts by introducing two synergistic innovations. To improve
pair construction, GenView++ introduces a multi-source adaptive view generation
mechanism to synthesize diverse yet semantically coherent views by dynamically
modulating generative parameters across image-conditioned, text-conditioned,
and image-text-conditioned strategies. Second, a quality-driven contrastive
learning mechanism assesses each pair's semantic alignment and diversity to
dynamically reweight their training contribution, prioritizing high-quality
pairs while suppressing redundant or misaligned pairs. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of GenView++ across both vision and
vision-language tasks. For vision representation learning, it improves MoCov2
by +2.5% on ImageNet linear classification. For vision-language learning, it
raises the average zero-shot classification accuracy by +12.31% over CLIP and
+5.31% over SLIP across ten datasets, and further improves Flickr30k text
retrieval R@5 by +3.2%. The code is available at

TL;DR: MTGRR是一个针对多模态城市数据的图建模框架，通过模态定制化图架构和空间感知融合机制，解决了现有方法在模态特定特征捕获和空间异质性处理方面的局限性。


<details>

Motivation: 现有图模型在多模态城市数据建模中存在两个主要问题：(1) 对所有模态使用相同的图神经网络架构，无法捕捉模态特定的结构和特征；(2) 融合阶段忽视空间异质性，假设不同模态的聚合权重在所有区域保持不变，导致次优表示。

Method: 1. 将模态按空间密度和数据特征分为聚合级和点级两类；2. 对聚合级模态采用专家混合图架构，每个模态由专用GNN处理；3. 对点级模态构建双级GNN提取细粒度视觉语义特征；4. 设计空间感知多模态融合机制动态推断区域特定的模态融合权重；5. 采用联合对比学习策略整合三个级别的目标优化区域表示。

Result: 在两个真实世界数据集上，针对六种模态和三个任务的实验表明，MTGRR始终优于最先进的基线方法，验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: MTGRR通过模态定制化图建模和空间感知融合机制，能够有效捕捉多模态城市数据的复杂特性，为下游任务提供更优的区域表示。

Abstract: Graph-based models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for modeling
multimodal urban data and learning region representations for various
downstream tasks. However, existing approaches face two major limitations. (1)
They typically employ identical graph neural network architectures across all
modalities, failing to capture modality-specific structures and
characteristics. (2) During the fusion stage, they often neglect spatial
heterogeneity by assuming that the aggregation weights of different modalities
remain invariant across regions, resulting in suboptimal representations. To
address these issues, we propose MTGRR, a modality-tailored graph modeling
framework for urban region representation, built upon a multimodal dataset
comprising point of interest (POI), taxi mobility, land use, road element,
remote sensing, and street view images. (1) MTGRR categorizes modalities into
two groups based on spatial density and data characteristics: aggregated-level
and point-level modalities. For aggregated-level modalities, MTGRR employs a
mixture-of-experts (MoE) graph architecture, where each modality is processed
by a dedicated expert GNN to capture distinct modality-specific
characteristics. For the point-level modality, a dual-level GNN is constructed
to extract fine-grained visual semantic features. (2) To obtain effective
region representations under spatial heterogeneity, a spatially-aware
multimodal fusion mechanism is designed to dynamically infer region-specific
modality fusion weights. Building on this graph modeling framework, MTGRR
further employs a joint contrastive learning strategy that integrates region
aggregated-level, point-level, and fusion-level objectives to optimize region
representations. Experiments on two real-world datasets across six modalities
and three tasks demonstrate that MTGRR consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines, validating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: 通过纹理向量量化和重建感知预测策略，有效解决了VQ方法的量化误差和训练监督问题，实现了高质量的超分辨率重建。

Abstract: Vector-quantized based models have recently demonstrated strong potential for
visual prior modeling. However, existing VQ-based methods simply encode visual
features with nearest codebook items and train index predictor with code-level
supervision. Due to the richness of visual signal, VQ encoding often leads to
large quantization error. Furthermore, training predictor with code-level
supervision can not take the final reconstruction errors into consideration,
result in sub-optimal prior modeling accuracy. In this paper we address the
above two issues and propose a Texture Vector-Quantization and a Reconstruction
Aware Prediction strategy. The texture vector-quantization strategy leverages
the task character of super-resolution and only introduce codebook to model the
prior of missing textures. While the reconstruction aware prediction strategy
makes use of the straight-through estimator to directly train index predictor
with image-level supervision. Our proposed generative SR model (TVQ&RAP) is
able to deliver photo-realistic SR results with small computational cost.

Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型参数高效微调方法容易受到微调数据中子群不平衡导致的虚假相关性的影响，这会影响模型的群体鲁棒性。

Method: 采用组特定文本提示作为组代表，为每个目标类提供多个分类器。利用VLM文本编码器的丰富语义知识，即使对于训练样本较少的组也能发现有效的组提示。

Conclusion: GroupCoOp是一种简单有效的去偏微调算法，能够显著提升微调视觉语言模型的群体鲁棒性，且参数效率极高。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) of vision-language models (VLMs)
excels in various vision tasks thanks to the rich knowledge and generalization
ability of VLMs. However, recent studies revealed that such fine-tuned VLMs are
vulnerable to spurious correlations stemming from the subgroup imbalance in the
fine-tuning datasets. To resolve this issue, we propose Group Context
Optimization (GroupCoOp), a simple and effective debiased fine-tuning algorithm
that enhances the group robustness of fine-tuned VLMs. Its key idea is to
employ group-specific text prompts as group representatives serving as multiple
classifiers for their target class. The rich semantic knowledge of the text
encoder of VLM enables the discovery of effective group prompts even for groups
with a small number of training samples. Leveraging the group prompts for each
class addresses the issues caused by the group-imbalanced training set, such as
the neglect of minority groups and the scattered distribution of each class in
the embedding space. GroupCoOp achieved the best results on five benchmarks
across five CLIP architectures and occasionally outperformed prior methods that
fine-tune the entire network, despite training only 0.016\% of the network's
parameters.

Abstract: Procedural Content Generation (PCG) techniques enable automatic creation of
diverse and complex environments. While PCG facilitates more efficient content
creation, ensuring consistently high-quality, industry-standard content remains
a significant challenge. In this research, we propose a method to identify and
repair unstable levels generated by existing PCG models. We use Angry Birds as
a case study, demonstrating our method on game levels produced by established
PCG approaches. Our method leverages object segmentation and visual analysis of
level images to detect structural gaps and perform targeted repairs. We
evaluate multiple object segmentation models and select the most effective one
as the basis for our repair pipeline. Experimental results show that our method
improves the stability and playability of AI-generated levels. Although our
evaluation is specific to Angry Birds, our image-based approach is designed to
be applicable to a wide range of 2D games with similar level structures.

Abstract: Urban modeling is essential for city planning, scene synthesis, and gaming.
Existing image-based methods generate diverse layouts but often lack geometric
continuity and scalability, while graph-based methods capture structural
relations yet overlook parcel semantics. We present a controllable framework
for large-scale 3D vector urban layout generation, conditioned on both geometry
and semantics. By fusing geometric and semantic attributes, introducing edge
weights, and embedding building height in the graph, our method extends 2D
layouts to realistic 3D structures. It also enables users to directly control
the output by modifying semantic attributes. Experiments show that it produces
valid, large-scale urban models, offering an effective tool for data-driven

solutions often rely on single-view imaging or manual inspection, which are
prone to errors due to occlusions, restricted perspectives, or lighting
inconsistencies. These limitations require the installation of additional
inspection stations, which could disrupt the assembly line and lead to
increased downtime and costs. This paper introduces a novel multi-view quality
control module designed to address these challenges, integrating a multi-camera
imaging system with advanced object detection algorithms. By capturing images
from three camera views, the system provides comprehensive visual coverage of
components of an assembly process. A tailored image fusion methodology combines
results from multiple views, effectively resolving ambiguities and enhancing
detection reliability. To support this system, we developed a unique dataset
comprising annotated images across diverse scenarios, including varied lighting
conditions, occlusions, and angles, to enhance applicability in real-world
manufacturing environments. Experimental results show that our approach
significantly outperforms single-view methods, achieving high precision and
recall rates in the identification of improperly fastened small assembly parts
such as screws. This work contributes to industrial automation by overcoming
single-view limitations, and providing a scalable, cost-effective, and accurate
quality control mechanism that ensures the reliability and safety of the
assembly line. The dataset used in this study is publicly available to
facilitate further research in this domain.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个视觉隐私分类法，并评估了当前视觉语言模型在隐私理解方面的局限性，强调了开发更强大隐私感知AI系统的必要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型和视觉语言模型在推理和模式识别方面表现出色，但在隐私概念理解方面存在严重不足，需要测试资源来评估和改进这些模型的隐私能力。

Method: 引入了一个全面的多级视觉隐私分类法，并评估了多个最先进的视觉语言模型在上下文隐私理解方面的能力。

Result: 评估揭示了视觉语言模型在理解上下文隐私方面存在显著不一致性，表明当前模型在隐私感知方面存在严重缺陷。

Conclusion: 研究为未来研究提供了基础分类法，并指出了当前模型的局限性，证明了开发更强大隐私感知AI系统的紧迫性。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence have profoundly transformed the technological
landscape in recent years. Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated
impressive abilities in reasoning, text comprehension, contextual pattern
recognition, and integrating language with visual understanding. While these
advances offer significant benefits, they also reveal critical limitations in
the models' ability to grasp the notion of privacy. There is hence substantial
interest in determining if and how these models can understand and enforce
privacy principles, particularly given the lack of supporting resources to test
such a task. In this work, we address these challenges by examining how legal
frameworks can inform the capabilities of these emerging technologies. To this
end, we introduce a comprehensive, multi-level Visual Privacy Taxonomy that
captures a wide range of privacy issues, designed to be scalable and adaptable
to existing and future research needs. Furthermore, we evaluate the
capabilities of several state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs),
revealing significant inconsistencies in their understanding of contextual
privacy. Our work contributes both a foundational taxonomy for future research
and a critical benchmark of current model limitations, demonstrating the urgent
need for more robust, privacy-aware AI systems.

TL;DR: Uni4D-LLM是首个统一的4D场景理解和生成视觉语言模型，通过共享表示和架构实现时空感知的4D场景处理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D和4D方法在场景理解和生成任务上存在范式差距，无法在动态4D设置中实现统一处理，特别是时空建模方面存在挑战。

Method: 提取语义特征用于理解，注入噪声的外观特征用于生成，结合4D几何线索，通过自适应交叉注意力融合成时空感知的视觉表示；在单一LLM中集成自回归和扩散模型。

Result: 在多个基准测试中取得竞争性或优于现有最先进模型的结果，首次真正实现了4D场景理解和生成的统一。

Conclusion: Uni4D-LLM通过共享表示和架构设计，成功实现了4D场景理解和生成任务的统一，为物理世界的视觉语言建模提供了新范式。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in 2D
scene understanding and generation, but extending this unification to the
physical world remains an open challenge. Existing 3D and 4D approaches
typically embed scene geometry into autoregressive model for semantic
understanding and diffusion model for content generation. This paradigm gap
prevents a single model from jointly handling both tasks, especially in dynamic
4D settings where spatiotemporal modeling is critical. We propose Uni4D-LLM,
the first unified VLM framework with spatiotemporal awareness for 4D scene
understanding and generation. Our design is guided by two key insights: 1)
Unification requires a shared representation. We extract semantic features for
understanding and noisy-injected appearance features for generation,
incorporate 4D geometric cues, and fuse them into a spatiotemporal-aware visual
representation through adaptive cross-attention. 2) Unification requires a
shared architecture. Both autoregression and diffusion are built on Transformer
backbones, and this enables integration into a single LLM with task-specific
heads. By aligning visual and linguistic representations, our Uni4D-LLM
produces predictions for both understanding and generation within one
Transformer-based framework. We further apply instruction fine-tuning on
diverse 4D vision-language datasets to improve generalization across tasks.
Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that Uni4D-LLM
achieves competitive or superior results compared to state-of-the-art models
and offers the first true unification of 4D scene understanding and generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文评估了Segment Concept (SeC)框架在MOSEv2数据集上的零样本性能，该框架使用大型视觉语言模型建立目标对象的深度语义理解，在复杂视频对象分割挑战中取得了第二名。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的半监督视频对象分割方法主要依赖外观模式匹配，在面对剧烈视觉变化、遮挡和场景转换等挑战时鲁棒性有限，缺乏对目标对象的高层次概念理解。

Method: 使用Segment Concept (SeC)框架，该框架利用大型视觉语言模型建立目标对象的深度语义理解，实现更持久的视频对象分割。

Result: 在未对训练集进行微调的情况下，SeC在MOSEv2测试集上取得了39.7的JFn分数，在第七届大规模视频对象分割挑战的复杂VOS赛道中排名第二。

Conclusion: SeC框架通过引入大型视觉语言模型提供的深度语义理解，显著提升了半监督视频对象分割在复杂场景下的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: Semi-supervised Video Object Segmentation aims to segment a specified target
throughout a video sequence, initialized by a first-frame mask. Previous
methods rely heavily on appearance-based pattern matching and thus exhibit
limited robustness against challenges such as drastic visual changes,
occlusions, and scene shifts. This failure is often attributed to a lack of
high-level conceptual understanding of the target. The recently proposed
Segment Concept (SeC) framework mitigated this limitation by using a Large
Vision-Language Model (LVLM) to establish a deep semantic understanding of the
object for more persistent segmentation. In this work, we evaluate its
zero-shot performance on the challenging coMplex video Object SEgmentation v2
(MOSEv2) dataset. Without any fine-tuning on the training set, SeC achieved
39.7 \JFn on the test set and ranked 2nd place in the Complex VOS track of the
7th Large-scale Video Object Segmentation Challenge.

TL;DR: 提出了T23D-CompBench基准和Rank2Score评估器，用于解决文本到3D生成质量评估的挑战。


<details>

Motivation: 现有文本到3D质量评估存在基准过时、分散、粒度粗，以及客观指标设计局限导致特征提取不具代表性和鲁棒性差的问题。

Method: 构建包含5个组件12个子组件的组合提示基准，生成3600个纹理网格；提出Rank2Score两阶段训练评估器，第一阶段通过监督对比回归和课程学习增强成对训练，第二阶段使用平均意见分数优化预测。

Result: 收集了129,600个可靠的人类评分；Rank2Score在多个维度上持续优于现有指标，并能作为奖励函数优化生成模型。

Conclusion: T23D-CompBench和Rank2Score为文本到3D质量评估提供了全面基准和有效评估器，显著提升了与人类判断的一致性。

Abstract: Recent advances in Text-to-3D (T23D) generative models have enabled the
synthesis of diverse, high-fidelity 3D assets from textual prompts. However,
existing challenges restrict the development of reliable T23D quality
assessment (T23DQA). First, existing benchmarks are outdated, fragmented, and
coarse-grained, making fine-grained metric training infeasible. Moreover,
current objective metrics exhibit inherent design limitations, resulting in
non-representative feature extraction and diminished metric robustness. To
address these limitations, we introduce T23D-CompBench, a comprehensive
benchmark for compositional T23D generation. We define five components with
twelve sub-components for compositional prompts, which are used to generate
3,600 textured meshes from ten state-of-the-art generative models. A
large-scale subjective experiment is conducted to collect 129,600 reliable
human ratings across different perspectives. Based on T23D-CompBench, we
further propose Rank2Score, an effective evaluator with two-stage training for
T23DQA. Rank2Score enhances pairwise training via supervised contrastive
regression and curriculum learning in the first stage, and subsequently refines
predictions using mean opinion scores to achieve closer alignment with human
judgments in the second stage. Extensive experiments and downstream
applications demonstrate that Rank2Score consistently outperforms existing
metrics across multiple dimensions and can additionally serve as a reward
function to optimize generative models. The project is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的基于概念的解释方法CE-FAM，通过融合激活映射来同时揭示图像分类器学习的概念、相关区域及其对预测的贡献。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的显著性映射只能突出重要区域但需要用户自行解释含义，而基于概念的解释方法虽然能分解AI预测为可理解概念，但很少有方法能同时揭示学习的概念、相关区域及其贡献。

Method: 使用分支网络共享图像分类器的激活映射，学习模仿视觉语言模型的嵌入。通过概念预测分数的梯度加权激活映射来表示概念区域，并基于对图像分类分数的影响量化其贡献。

Result: 该方法在定性和定量评估中优于现有方法，在未见概念的零样本推理方面表现出色。

Conclusion: CE-FAM提供了一个通用框架，能够识别概念区域及其贡献，同时利用VLM知识处理任意概念而无需标注数据集。

Abstract: Although saliency maps can highlight important regions to explain the
reasoning behind image classification in artificial intelligence (AI), the
meaning of these regions is left to the user's interpretation. In contrast,
conceptbased explanations decompose AI predictions into humanunderstandable
concepts, clarifying their contributions. However, few methods can
simultaneously reveal what concepts an image classifier learns, which regions
are associated with them, and how they contribute to predictions. We propose a
novel concept-based explanation method, Concept-based Explanation via Fusion of
Activation Maps (CE-FAM). It employs a branched network that shares activation
maps with an image classifier and learns to mimic the embeddings of a Vision
and Language Model (VLM). The branch network predicts concepts in an image, and
their corresponding regions are represented by a weighted sum of activation
maps, with weights given by the gradients of the concept prediction scores.
Their contributions are quantified based on their impact on the image
classification score. Our method provides a general framework for identifying
the concept regions and their contributions while leveraging VLM knowledge to
handle arbitrary concepts without requiring an annotated dataset. Furthermore,
we introduce a novel evaluation metric to assess the accuracy of the concept
regions. Our qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate our method
outperforms existing approaches and excels in zero-shot inference for unseen
concepts.

*Djamel Eddine Boukhari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FairViT-GAN是一个新颖的混合框架，结合CNN和ViT架构，通过对抗性去偏机制解决面部美观预测中的算法偏见问题，在准确性和公平性方面都达到了最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有面部美观预测模型存在架构限制、人口统计偏见和缺乏透明度等问题。CNN擅长捕捉局部纹理但难以处理全局面部协调，ViT能建模长距离依赖但可能忽略细粒度细节，且模型容易学习并延续社会偏见。

Method: 提出FairViT-GAN混合框架：集成CNN分支用于局部特征提取和ViT分支用于全局上下文建模。引入对抗性去偏机制，明确训练特征提取器产生对受保护属性不变的表示，从而主动减轻算法偏见。

Result: 在SCUT-FBP5500基准测试中，FairViT-GAN在预测准确性方面达到新水平（Pearson相关系数0.9230，RMSE降至0.2650），同时在公平性方面表现出色：种族子组间性能差距减少82.9%，对抗者分类准确率降至接近随机水平（52.1%）。

Conclusion: FairViT-GAN为开发负责任的主观视觉评估AI系统提供了一个稳健、透明且显著更公平的蓝图。

Abstract: Facial Beauty Prediction (FBP) has made significant strides with the
application of deep learning, yet state-of-the-art models often exhibit
critical limitations, including architectural constraints, inherent demographic
biases, and a lack of transparency. Existing methods, primarily based on
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), excel at capturing local texture but
struggle with global facial harmony, while Vision Transformers (ViTs)
effectively model long-range dependencies but can miss fine-grained details.
Furthermore, models trained on benchmark datasets can inadvertently learn and
perpetuate societal biases related to protected attributes like ethnicity. To
address these interconnected challenges, we propose \textbf{FairViT-GAN}, a
novel hybrid framework that synergistically integrates a CNN branch for local
feature extraction and a ViT branch for global context modeling. More
significantly, we introduce an adversarial debiasing mechanism where the
feature extractor is explicitly trained to produce representations that are
invariant to protected attributes, thereby actively mitigating algorithmic
bias. Our framework's transparency is enhanced by visualizing the distinct
focus of each architectural branch. Extensive experiments on the SCUT-FBP5500
benchmark demonstrate that FairViT-GAN not only sets a new state-of-the-art in
predictive accuracy, achieving a Pearson Correlation of \textbf{0.9230} and
reducing RMSE to \textbf{0.2650}, but also excels in fairness. Our analysis
reveals a remarkable \textbf{82.9\% reduction in the performance gap} between
ethnic subgroups, with the adversary's classification accuracy dropping to
near-random chance (52.1\%). We believe FairViT-GAN provides a robust,
transparent, and significantly fairer blueprint for developing responsible AI
systems for subjective visual assessment.

TL;DR: Sim-DETR通过限制自注意力机制和添加查询-帧对齐，解决了DETR在时序语句定位中的性能下降问题，提供了一个强大的基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现典型的DETR增强策略在时序语句定位任务中不仅没有提升性能，反而可能降低性能。通过系统分析识别出两个根本原因：相似目标时刻查询之间的冲突，以及全局语义和局部定位之间的内部查询冲突。

Method: 在DETR解码器层中进行了两个小修改：(1) 基于语义和位置重叠约束查询之间的自注意力；(2) 添加查询-帧对齐来桥接全局和局部上下文。

Result: 实验证明Sim-DETR能够充分释放DETR在时序语句定位任务中的潜力。

Conclusion: Sim-DETR为时序语句定位任务提供了一个简单而强大的基线模型，为未来研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Temporal sentence grounding aims to identify exact moments in a video that
correspond to a given textual query, typically addressed with detection
transformer (DETR) solutions. However, we find that typical strategies designed
to enhance DETR do not improve, and may even degrade, its performance in this
task. We systematically analyze and identify the root causes of this abnormal
behavior: (1) conflicts between queries from similar target moments and (2)
internal query conflicts due to the tension between global semantics and local
localization. Building on these insights, we propose a simple yet powerful
baseline, Sim-DETR, which extends the standard DETR with two minor
modifications in the decoder layers: (1) constraining self-attention between
queries based on their semantic and positional overlap and (2) adding
query-to-frame alignment to bridge the global and local contexts. Experiments
demonstrate that Sim-DETR unlocks the full potential of DETR for temporal
sentence grounding, offering a strong baseline for future research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出信息接地引导(IGG)机制，通过注意力机制将引导信号锚定到语义重要区域，解决自回归图像生成模型中因渐进分辨率缩放导致的信息不一致问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归图像生成模型面临关键弱点：渐进分辨率缩放导致跨时间步的补丁间信息不一致，这些不一致会分散引导信号，使其偏离条件信息，留下模糊、不忠实的特征。

Method: 开发信息接地引导(IGG)机制，通过注意力自适应地增强采样过程中的信息丰富补丁，确保引导和内容保持紧密对齐。

Result: 在类别条件和文本到图像生成任务中，IGG能够生成更清晰、更连贯且语义接地的图像，为基于自回归的方法设定了新基准。

Conclusion: IGG机制有效解决了自回归图像生成模型中的信息不一致问题，显著提升了生成图像的质量和语义忠实度。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models based on next-scale prediction are rapidly
emerging as a powerful tool for image generation, but they face a critical
weakness: information inconsistencies between patches across timesteps
introduced by progressive resolution scaling. These inconsistencies scatter
guidance signals, causing them to drift away from conditioning information and
leaving behind ambiguous, unfaithful features. We tackle this challenge with
Information-Grounding Guidance (IGG), a novel mechanism that anchors guidance
to semantically important regions through attention. By adaptively reinforcing
informative patches during sampling, IGG ensures that guidance and content
remain tightly aligned. Across both class-conditioned and text-to-image
generation tasks, IGG delivers sharper, more coherent, and semantically
grounded images, setting a new benchmark for AR-based methods.

Motivation: 现有评估指标无法捕捉多模态大语言模型在真实场景中对无关或干扰性视觉上下文的敏感性，这影响了模型的可靠性。

Method: 引入PCRI指标，通过比较模型在局部图像块和完整图像输入上的性能变化，系统评估模型对视觉上下文粒度变化的鲁棒性。

Result: 在19个先进MLLM和15个视觉语言基准上的测试显示，大多数领先模型对背景噪声脆弱，只有InternVL2-26B和Qwen2VL-72B等少数模型在不同任务中表现出一致的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: PCRI能够对上下文鲁棒性进行严格比较，支持有原则的模型选择，并为开发面向真实世界部署的鲁棒架构和训练策略提供指导。

Abstract: The reliability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in real-world
settings is often undermined by sensitivity to irrelevant or distracting visual
context, an aspect not captured by existing evaluation metrics. We introduce
the \textbf{Patch Context Robustness Index (PCRI)}, the first systematic and
interpretable score for quantifying MLLM robustness to variations in visual
context granularity, measuring performance changes between localized image
patches and full-image input.
  Applying PCRI to 19 state-of-the-art MLLMs across 15 vision-language
benchmarks, we find that most leading models remain brittle to background
noise, with only a few, such as InternVL2-26B and Qwen2VL-72B, demonstrating
consistent robustness across tasks. PCRI analysis also highlights how different
model architectures handle and integrate visual context, offering actionable
diagnostic insight for both researchers and practitioners.
  PCRI enables rigorous comparison of context robustness, supporting principled
model selection and guiding the development of future architectures and
training strategies for robust, real-world deployment.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于半监督3D目标检测的可学习伪标签模块，能够自动自适应地选择高质量伪标签，通过分数融合和上下文自适应阈值来评估伪标签质量，并采用软监督策略在伪标签噪声下进行鲁棒学习。

Method: 在教师网络输出层引入两个网络，通过分数融合可靠评估伪标签质量，并确定上下文自适应阈值，这些阈值通过伪标签与真实边界框的对齐进行监督。同时采用软监督策略，使学生在半监督学习中优先学习更干净的标签。

Result: 在KITTI和Waymo数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法能够选择高精度的伪标签，同时保持更广泛的上下文覆盖和更高的召回率，显著改进了相关的半监督3D目标检测方法。

Conclusion: 提出的可学习伪标签模块能够有效解决半监督3D目标检测中的伪标签选择问题，通过自适应阈值和软监督策略实现了更好的性能表现。

Abstract: Semi-supervised 3D object detection (SS3DOD) aims to reduce costly 3D
annotations utilizing unlabeled data. Recent studies adopt pseudo-label-based
teacher-student frameworks and demonstrate impressive performance. The main
challenge of these frameworks is in selecting high-quality pseudo-labels from
the teacher's predictions. Most previous methods, however, select pseudo-labels
by comparing confidence scores over thresholds manually set. The latest works
tackle the challenge either by dynamic thresholding or refining the quality of
pseudo-labels. Such methods still overlook contextual information e.g. object
distances, classes, and learning states, and inadequately assess the
pseudo-label quality using partial information available from the networks. In
this work, we propose a novel SS3DOD framework featuring a learnable
pseudo-labeling module designed to automatically and adaptively select
high-quality pseudo-labels. Our approach introduces two networks at the teacher
output level. These networks reliably assess the quality of pseudo-labels by
the score fusion and determine context-adaptive thresholds, which are
supervised by the alignment of pseudo-labels over GT bounding boxes.
Additionally, we introduce a soft supervision strategy that can learn robustly
under pseudo-label noises. This helps the student network prioritize cleaner
labels over noisy ones in semi-supervised learning. Extensive experiments on
the KITTI and Waymo datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. The
proposed method selects high-precision pseudo-labels while maintaining a wider
coverage of contexts and a higher recall rate, significantly improving relevant
SS3DOD methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有低剂量CT去噪方法严重依赖配对数据且泛化能力差，扩散模型需要学习干净数据分布，自监督方法在不同剂量间泛化性能显著下降。

Method: 设计上下文子数据相似性自适应感知策略，结合知识蒸馏与潜在扩散模型优化图像细节，采用像素级自校正融合技术增强图像保真度。

Result: 在数据集和真实数据上的定性和定量评估显示，SuperDiff在重建和泛化性能方面始终优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: SuperDiff仅需低剂量CT投影域数据进行训练和测试，通过双域策略级联实现自监督低剂量CT去噪，具有良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Current models based on deep learning for low-dose CT denoising rely heavily
on paired data and generalize poorly. Even the more concerned diffusion models
need to learn the distribution of clean data for reconstruction, which is
difficult to satisfy in medical clinical applications. At the same time,
self-supervised-based methods face the challenge of significant degradation of
generalizability of models pre-trained for the current dose to expand to other
doses. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel method of
tunable-generalization diffusion powered by self-supervised contextual sub-data
for low-dose CT reconstruction, named SuperDiff. Firstly, a contextual subdata
similarity adaptive sensing strategy is designed for denoising centered on the
LDCT projection domain, which provides an initial prior for the subsequent
progress. Subsequently, the initial prior is used to combine knowledge
distillation with a deep combination of latent diffusion models for optimizing
image details. The pre-trained model is used for inference reconstruction, and
the pixel-level self-correcting fusion technique is proposed for fine-grained
reconstruction of the image domain to enhance the image fidelity, using the
initial prior and the LDCT image as a guide. In addition, the technique is
flexibly applied to the generalization of upper and lower doses or even unseen
doses. Dual-domain strategy cascade for self-supervised LDCT denoising,
SuperDiff requires only LDCT projection domain data for training and testing.
Full qualitative and quantitative evaluations on both datasets and real data
show that SuperDiff consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods
in terms of reconstruction and generalization performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了AssemblyHands-X，首个无标记的3D手-身体基准数据集，用于研究双手活动中手-身体协调对动作识别的影响，实验表明联合建模手和身体线索能提高动作识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D活动数据集通常只标注手或身体姿势，而基于标记的运动捕捉系统会引入视觉伪影，限制了模型在自然无标记视频上的泛化能力。双手活动本质上涉及双手和身体的协调运动，但这种协调对活动理解的影响尚未得到系统评估。

Method: 构建了从同步多视角视频进行3D姿势标注的流程，结合多视角三角测量和SMPL-X网格拟合，实现了手和上半身的可靠3D配准。验证了不同输入表示（视频、手姿势、身体姿势或手-身体姿势）在图卷积或时空注意力模型上的表现。

Result: 基于姿势的动作推断比视频基线更高效和准确。联合建模手和身体线索比单独使用手或上半身能提高动作识别性能，突出了建模相互依赖的手-身体动态对于全面理解双手活动的重要性。

Conclusion: 手-身体协调对于双手活动的整体理解至关重要，AssemblyHands-X数据集为研究这种协调效应提供了重要基准，证明了联合建模手和身体动态能显著提升动作识别性能。

Abstract: Bimanual human activities inherently involve coordinated movements of both
hands and body. However, the impact of this coordination in activity
understanding has not been systematically evaluated due to the lack of suitable
datasets. Such evaluation demands kinematic-level annotations (e.g., 3D pose)
for the hands and body, yet existing 3D activity datasets typically annotate
either hand or body pose. Another line of work employs marker-based motion
capture to provide full-body pose, but the physical markers introduce visual
artifacts, thereby limiting models' generalization to natural, markerless
videos. To address these limitations, we present AssemblyHands-X, the first
markerless 3D hand-body benchmark for bimanual activities, designed to study
the effect of hand-body coordination for action recognition. We begin by
constructing a pipeline for 3D pose annotation from synchronized multi-view
videos. Our approach combines multi-view triangulation with SMPL-X mesh
fitting, yielding reliable 3D registration of hands and upper body. We then
validate different input representations (e.g., video, hand pose, body pose, or
hand-body pose) across recent action recognition models based on graph
convolution or spatio-temporal attention. Our extensive experiments show that
pose-based action inference is more efficient and accurate than video
baselines. Moreover, joint modeling of hand and body cues improves action
recognition over using hands or upper body alone, highlighting the importance
of modeling interdependent hand-body dynamics for a holistic understanding of
bimanual activities.

### [170] [Preserving Cross-Modal Stability for Visual Unlearning in Multimodal Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23895)
*Jinghan Xu Yuyang Zhang Qixuan Cai Jiancheng Chen Keqiu Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出跨模态对比遗忘框架CCU，通过选择性视觉遗忘、跨模态知识保留和双集对比分离来解决视觉模态遗忘中的隐私泄露问题，在保持其他模态性能的同时显著提升准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉模态在自动驾驶等实际多模态应用中最容易发生隐私泄露；现有机器遗忘方法在视觉遗忘过程中无法保持跨模态知识和保留数据的类内结构稳定性，导致整体性能和其他模态性能下降。

Method: CCU框架包含三个关键组件：(a)选择性视觉遗忘：使用反向对比学习分离视觉表示与原语义；(b)跨模态知识保留：通过语义一致性保持其他模态的判别能力；(c)双集对比分离：通过隔离遗忘集和保留集的结构扰动来保持模型性能。

Result: 在三个数据集上的广泛实验证明了CCU的优越性，与最佳准确率基线相比，我们的方法仅用7%的遗忘时间就实现了7.12%的准确率提升。

Conclusion: CCU框架有效解决了多模态场景下视觉遗忘的挑战，在保护隐私的同时保持了模型的整体性能和其他模态的判别能力，具有显著的时间和准确率优势。

Abstract: Visual modality is the most vulnerable to privacy leakage in real-world
multimodal applications like autonomous driving with visual and radar data;
Machine unlearning removes specific training data from pre-trained models to
address privacy leakage, however, existing methods fail to preserve cross-modal
knowledge and maintain intra-class structural stability of retain data, leading
to reduced overall and other modalities' performance during visual unlearning;
to address these challenges, we propose a Cross-modal Contrastive Unlearning
(CCU) framework, which integrates three key components: (a) selective visual
unlearning: employing inverse contrastive learning to dissociate visual
representations from their original semantics, (b) cross-modal knowledge
retention: preserving other modalities' discriminability through semantic
consistency, and (c) dual-set contrastive separation: preserving the model
performance via isolation of structural perturbations between the unlearn set
and retain set; extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate the
superiority of CCU, and our method achieves a 7.12% accuracy improvement with
only 7% of the unlearning time compared to the top-accuracy baseline.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Q-FSRU模型，结合频率谱表示融合和量子检索增强生成技术，用于医学视觉问答任务，在VQA-RAD数据集上表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决需要图像和文本理解的临床难题是医疗AI的主要挑战，现有方法在处理复杂医学推理时仍有局限。

Method: 使用快速傅里叶变换将医学图像和文本特征转换到频域以过滤噪声，结合量子检索系统从外部知识源获取医学事实，将检索结果与频域特征融合进行推理。

Result: 在VQA-RAD数据集上的评估显示，Q-FSRU在需要图像文本推理的复杂病例上表现优于早期模型，频率和量子信息的结合提升了性能和可解释性。

Conclusion: 该方法为构建智能、清晰且对医生有帮助的AI工具提供了有前景的途径，频域分析和量子检索的结合增强了医学推理能力。

Abstract: Solving tough clinical questions that require both image and text
understanding is still a major challenge in healthcare AI. In this work, we
propose Q-FSRU, a new model that combines Frequency Spectrum Representation and
Fusion (FSRU) with a method called Quantum Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(Quantum RAG) for medical Visual Question Answering (VQA). The model takes in
features from medical images and related text, then shifts them into the
frequency domain using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). This helps it focus on
more meaningful data and filter out noise or less useful information. To
improve accuracy and ensure that answers are based on real knowledge, we add a
quantum inspired retrieval system. It fetches useful medical facts from
external sources using quantum-based similarity techniques. These details are
then merged with the frequency-based features for stronger reasoning. We
evaluated our model using the VQA-RAD dataset, which includes real radiology
images and questions. The results showed that Q-FSRU outperforms earlier
models, especially on complex cases needing image text reasoning. The mix of
frequency and quantum information improves both performance and explainability.
Overall, this approach offers a promising way to build smart, clear, and
helpful AI tools for doctors.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合类别条件扩散回放和弹性权重巩固的持续学习框架，用于医学影像基础模型，无需存储患者样本，在隐私保护和效率方面表现优异。


<details>

Motivation: 医学影像基础模型需要随时间适应，但完全重新训练受到隐私约束和成本的限制，需要开发不存储患者样本的持续学习方法。

Method: 使用紧凑Vision Transformer骨干网络，结合类别条件扩散回放和弹性权重巩固，在八个MedMNIST v2任务和CheXpert数据集上进行评估。

Result: 在CheXpert上达到0.851 AUROC，相比DER++减少遗忘超过30%，接近联合训练的0.869 AUROC，同时保持高效和隐私保护。

Conclusion: 该框架为临床影像模型的可扩展、隐私感知持续适应提供了一条实用路径，分析表明遗忘与回放保真度和Fisher加权参数漂移两个可测量因素相关。

Abstract: Medical imaging foundation models must adapt over time, yet full retraining
is often blocked by privacy constraints and cost. We present a continual
learning framework that avoids storing patient exemplars by pairing class
conditional diffusion replay with Elastic Weight Consolidation. Using a compact
Vision Transformer backbone, we evaluate across eight MedMNIST v2 tasks and
CheXpert. On CheXpert our approach attains 0.851 AUROC, reduces forgetting by
more than 30\% relative to DER\texttt{++}, and approaches joint training at
0.869 AUROC, while remaining efficient and privacy preserving. Analyses connect
forgetting to two measurable factors: fidelity of replay and Fisher weighted
parameter drift, highlighting the complementary roles of replay diffusion and
synaptic stability. The results indicate a practical route for scalable,
privacy aware continual adaptation of clinical imaging models.

TL;DR: 提出FedDA框架解决联邦学习中医疗图像跨域分割问题，通过特征级对抗学习对齐不同客户端的特征映射，提升模型在多域上的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗领域联邦学习中，不同客户端可能拥有不同模态的医疗图像，这种异质性给跨域医学图像分割带来挑战。

Method: 提出联邦域适应(FedDA)分割训练框架，通过嵌入对抗训练机制在客户端间进行特征级对抗学习，对齐跨客户端的特征映射。

Result: 在三个医疗图像数据集上的实验表明，FedDA实现了跨域联邦聚合，赋予单模态客户端跨模态处理能力，在客观和主观评估中均优于现有联邦聚合算法。

Conclusion: FedDA框架能有效解决联邦学习中医疗图像跨域分割的挑战，提升模型泛化性能并减轻域偏移的负面影响。

Abstract: Federated learning enables collaborative training of machine learning models
among different clients while ensuring data privacy, emerging as the mainstream
for breaking data silos in the healthcare domain. However, the imbalance of
medical resources, data corruption or improper data preservation may lead to a
situation where different clients possess medical images of different modality.
This heterogeneity poses a significant challenge for cross-domain medical image
segmentation within the federated learning framework. To address this
challenge, we propose a new Federated Domain Adaptation (FedDA) segmentation
training framework. Specifically, we propose a feature-level adversarial
learning among clients by aligning feature maps across clients through
embedding an adversarial training mechanism. This design can enhance the
model's generalization on multiple domains and alleviate the negative impact
from domain-shift. Comprehensive experiments on three medical image datasets
demonstrate that our proposed FedDA substantially achieves cross-domain
federated aggregation, endowing single modality client with cross-modality
processing capabilities, and consistently delivers robust performance compared
to state-of-the-art federated aggregation algorithms in objective and
subjective assessment. Our code are available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了EditScore奖励模型系列和EditReward-Bench基准，解决了图像编辑中强化学习缺乏高质量奖励信号的问题，并通过在线RL训练显著提升了指令引导图像编辑的性能。


<details>

Motivation: 当前指令引导图像编辑模型在处理复杂指令时面临挑战，且需要多次尝试才能获得理想结果。强化学习是很有前景的解决方案，但缺乏高保真、高效的奖励信号阻碍了其在图像编辑领域的应用。

Method: 首先构建EditReward-Bench基准系统评估奖励模型；然后开发EditScore系列奖励模型（7B-72B），通过精心数据筛选和自集成策略提升性能；最后将高质量奖励模型应用于在线RL训练，优化图像编辑策略。

Result: EditScore在基准测试中表现优异，最大变体甚至超越了GPT-5；基于EditScore的RL训练能够实现高效稳健的策略优化，在OmniGen2基础模型上实现了显著且一致的性能提升。

Conclusion: 高保真、领域专业化的奖励模型是解锁图像编辑中强化学习全部潜力的关键，本文提供了从基准测试到奖励建模再到RL训练的系统化路径。

Abstract: Instruction-guided image editing has achieved remarkable progress, yet
current models still face challenges with complex instructions and often
require multiple samples to produce a desired result. Reinforcement Learning
(RL) offers a promising solution, but its adoption in image editing has been
severely hindered by the lack of a high-fidelity, efficient reward signal. In
this work, we present a comprehensive methodology to overcome this barrier,
centered on the development of a state-of-the-art, specialized reward model. We
first introduce EditReward-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark to systematically
evaluate reward models on editing quality. Building on this benchmark, we
develop EditScore, a series of reward models (7B-72B) for evaluating the
quality of instruction-guided image editing. Through meticulous data curation
and filtering, EditScore effectively matches the performance of learning
proprietary VLMs. Furthermore, coupled with an effective self-ensemble strategy
tailored for the generative nature of EditScore, our largest variant even
surpasses GPT-5 in the benchmark. We then demonstrate that a high-fidelity
reward model is the key to unlocking online RL for image editing. Our
experiments show that, while even the largest open-source VLMs fail to provide
an effective learning signal, EditScore enables efficient and robust policy
optimization. Applying our framework to a strong base model, OmniGen2, results
in a final model that shows a substantial and consistent performance uplift.
Overall, this work provides the first systematic path from benchmarking to
reward modeling to RL training in image editing, showing that a high-fidelity,
domain-specialized reward model is the key to unlocking the full potential of
RL in this domain.

Motivation: 现有方法要么将多人视为单一实体直接生成交互，要么仅依赖单方运动生成反应，缺乏对丰富语义信息的整合，难以适应多样化的动态交互场景。

Conclusion: MoReact方法在文本驱动的人类反应生成任务中表现出色，能够产生语义上契合交互场景的逼真运动序列。

Abstract: Modeling and generating human reactions poses a significant challenge with
broad applications for computer vision and human-computer interaction. Existing
methods either treat multiple individuals as a single entity, directly
generating interactions, or rely solely on one person's motion to generate the
other's reaction, failing to integrate the rich semantic information that
underpins human interactions. Yet, these methods often fall short in adaptive
responsiveness, i.e., the ability to accurately respond to diverse and dynamic
interaction scenarios. Recognizing this gap, our work introduces an approach
tailored to address the limitations of existing models by focusing on
text-driven human reaction generation. Our model specifically generates
realistic motion sequences for individuals that responding to the other's
actions based on a descriptive text of the interaction scenario. The goal is to
produce motion sequences that not only complement the opponent's movements but
also semantically fit the described interactions. To achieve this, we present
MoReact, a diffusion-based method designed to disentangle the generation of
global trajectories and local motions sequentially. This approach stems from
the observation that generating global trajectories first is crucial for
guiding local motion, ensuring better alignment with given action and text.
Furthermore, we introduce a novel interaction loss to enhance the realism of
generated close interactions. Our experiments, utilizing data adapted from a
two-person motion dataset, demonstrate the efficacy of our approach for this
novel task, which is capable of producing realistic, diverse, and controllable
reactions that not only closely match the movements of the counterpart but also
adhere to the textual guidance. Please find our webpage at

Motivation: 多任务学习潜力常被优化不平衡问题阻碍，即任务干扰导致性能不如单任务模型。本文旨在系统分析造成这一持续问题的因素。

Method: 进行系统实验分析，研究现有优化方法在不同数据集上的表现差异，验证视觉基础模型和数据量增加的效果，并分析优化不平衡与任务特定梯度范数的相关性。

Result: 发现现有优化方法性能在不同数据集上不一致，先进架构仍依赖昂贵的网格搜索损失权重；视觉基础模型虽提供强初始化但无法解决优化不平衡；增加数据量收益有限；优化不平衡与任务特定梯度范数存在强相关性。

Conclusion: 理解和控制梯度动态是通往稳定多任务学习的更直接路径，基于梯度范数缩放任务损失的简单策略可有效替代复杂的网格搜索方法。

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) aims to build general-purpose vision systems by
training a single network to perform multiple tasks jointly. While promising,
its potential is often hindered by "unbalanced optimization", where task
interference leads to subpar performance compared to single-task models. To
facilitate research in MTL, this paper presents a systematic experimental
analysis to dissect the factors contributing to this persistent problem. Our
investigation confirms that the performance of existing optimization methods
varies inconsistently across datasets, and advanced architectures still rely on
costly grid-searched loss weights. Furthermore, we show that while powerful
Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) provide strong initialization, they do not
inherently resolve the optimization imbalance, and merely increasing data
quantity offers limited benefits. A crucial finding emerges from our analysis:
a strong correlation exists between the optimization imbalance and the norm of
task-specific gradients. We demonstrate that this insight is directly
applicable, showing that a straightforward strategy of scaling task losses
according to their gradient norms can achieve performance comparable to that of
an extensive and computationally expensive grid search. Our comprehensive
analysis suggests that understanding and controlling gradient dynamics is a
more direct path to stable MTL than developing increasingly complex methods.

Motivation: CLIP模型在细粒度任务上表现不佳，且其对抗鲁棒性研究不足。理解对抗样本在任务间的迁移行为对评估CLIP的泛化极限和安全风险至关重要。

Method: 提出了MT-AdvCLIP框架，引入任务感知特征聚合损失，生成具有增强跨任务泛化能力的扰动，强化细粒度任务模型对共享CLIP骨干网络的攻击效果。

Result: 在多个公开数据集上的实验表明，MT-AdvCLIP显著提高了对抗迁移成功率（多任务平均攻击成功率提升超过39%），且不增加扰动预算。

Conclusion: 本研究揭示了多任务CLIP模型中对抗样本的迁移机制，为多任务鲁棒性评估和对抗样本设计提供了新见解。

Abstract: As a general-purpose vision-language pretraining model, CLIP demonstrates
strong generalization ability in image-text alignment tasks and has been widely
adopted in downstream applications such as image classification and image-text
retrieval. However, it struggles with fine-grained tasks such as object
detection and semantic segmentation. While many variants aim to improve CLIP on
these tasks, its robustness to adversarial perturbations remains underexplored.
Understanding how adversarial examples transfer across tasks is key to
assessing CLIP's generalization limits and security risks. In this work, we
conduct a systematic empirical analysis of the cross-task transfer behavior of
CLIP-based models on image-text retrieval, object detection, and semantic
segmentation under adversarial perturbations. We find that adversarial examples
generated from fine-grained tasks (e.g., object detection and semantic
segmentation) often exhibit stronger transfer potential than those from
coarse-grained tasks, enabling more effective attacks against the original CLIP
model. Motivated by this observation, we propose a novel framework, Multi-Task
Adversarial CLIP (MT-AdvCLIP), which introduces a task-aware feature
aggregation loss and generates perturbations with enhanced cross-task
generalization capability. This design strengthens the attack effectiveness of
fine-grained task models on the shared CLIP backbone. Experimental results on
multiple public datasets show that MT-AdvCLIP significantly improves the
adversarial transfer success rate (The average attack success rate across
multiple tasks is improved by over 39%.) against various CLIP-derived models,
without increasing the perturbation budget. This study reveals the transfer
mechanism of adversarial examples in multi-task CLIP models, offering new
insights into multi-task robustness evaluation and adversarial example design.

Conclusion: 提出的Token Painter方法有效解决了文本引导图像修复中的文本对齐和背景一致性挑战，展示了掩码自回归模型在此任务中的优势。

Abstract: Text-guided image inpainting aims to inpaint masked image regions based on a
textual prompt while preserving the background. Although diffusion-based
methods have become dominant, their property of modeling the entire image in
latent space makes it challenging for the results to align well with prompt
details and maintain a consistent background. To address these issues, we
explore Mask AutoRegressive (MAR) models for this task. MAR naturally supports
image inpainting by generating latent tokens corresponding to mask regions,
enabling better local controllability without altering the background. However,
directly applying MAR to this task makes the inpainting content either ignore
the prompts or be disharmonious with the background context. Through analysis
of the attention maps from the inpainting images, we identify the impact of
background tokens on text tokens during the MAR generation, and leverage this
to design \textbf{Token Painter}, a training-free text-guided image inpainting
method based on MAR. Our approach introduces two key components: (1)
Dual-Stream Encoder Information Fusion (DEIF), which fuses the semantic and
context information from text and background in frequency domain to produce
novel guidance tokens, allowing MAR to generate text-faithful inpainting
content while keeping harmonious with background context. (2) Adaptive Decoder
Attention Score Enhancing (ADAE), which adaptively enhances attention scores on
guidance tokens and inpainting tokens to further enhance the alignment of
prompt details and the content visual quality. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our training-free method outperforms prior state-of-the-art
methods across almost all metrics and delivers superior visual results. Codes
will be released.

Abstract: Closed-loop evaluation is increasingly critical for end-to-end autonomous
driving. Current closed-loop benchmarks using the CARLA simulator rely on
manually configured traffic scenarios, which can diverge from real-world
conditions, limiting their ability to reflect actual driving performance. To
address these limitations, we introduce a simple yet challenging closed-loop
evaluation framework that closely integrates real-world driving scenarios into
the CARLA simulator with infrastructure cooperation. Our approach involves
extracting 800 dynamic traffic scenarios selected from a comprehensive 100-hour
video dataset captured by high-mounted infrastructure sensors, and creating
static digital twin assets for 15 real-world intersections with consistent
visual appearance. These digital twins accurately replicate the traffic and
environmental characteristics of their real-world counterparts, enabling more
realistic simulations in CARLA. This evaluation is challenging due to the
diversity of driving behaviors, locations, weather conditions, and times of day
at complex urban intersections. In addition, we provide a comprehensive
closed-loop benchmark for evaluating end-to-end autonomous driving models.

Abstract: Empirical evidence shows that deep vision networks represent concepts as
directions in latent space, vectors we call concept embeddings. Each concept
has a latent factor-a scalar-indicating its presence in an input patch. For a
given patch, multiple latent factors are encoded into a compact representation
by linearly combining concept embeddings, with the factors as coefficients.
Since these embeddings enable such encoding, we call them encoding directions.
A latent factor can be recovered via the inner product with a filter, a vector
we call a decoding direction. These encoding-decoding direction pairs are not
directly accessible, but recovering them helps open the black box of deep
networks, enabling understanding, debugging, and improving models. Decoder
directions attribute meaning to latent codes, while encoding directions assess
concept influence on predictions, with both enabling model correction by
unlearning irrelevant concepts. Unlike prior matrix decomposition, autoencoder,
or dictionary learning methods that rely on feature reconstruction, we propose
a new perspective: decoding directions are identified via directional
clustering of activations, and encoding directions are estimated with signal
vectors under a probabilistic view. We further leverage network weights through
a novel technique, Uncertainty Region Alignment, which reveals interpretable
directions affecting predictions. Our analysis shows that (a) on synthetic
data, our method recovers ground-truth direction pairs; (b) on real data,
decoding directions map to monosemantic, interpretable concepts and outperform
unsupervised baselines; and (c) signal vectors faithfully estimate encoding
directions, validated via activation maximization. Finally, we demonstrate
applications in understanding global model behavior, explaining individual
predictions, and intervening to produce counterfactuals or correct errors.

Abstract: Cross-modal artificial intelligence has garnered widespread attention in
recent years, achieving significant progress in the study of natural images.
However, existing methods are mostly designed for RGB imagery, leaving a
significant gap in modeling synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery. SAR, with
its all-day, all-weather imaging capabilities, plays an irreplaceable role in
remote sensing scene understanding. To address this gap, this paper proposes
SAR-KnowLIP, the first universal SAR multimodal foundational model, along with
reusable data and evaluation baselines. Specifically: (1) This work introduces
the critical yet long-overlooked attribute of geographic information into
remote sensing research, constructing SAR-GEOVL-1M (the first large-scale SAR
dataset with complete geographic projection properties), covering multiple
satellite platforms, 120,000 images, and 135 cities. (2) Aligned structured
text is generated through a hierarchical cognitive chain-of-thought (HCoT),
providing more than one million multi-dimensional semantic annotations of
landforms, regional functions, target attributes, and spatial relationships.
(3) We design a Self-Consistent Iterative Optimization mechanism that
continuously enhances cross-modal alignment through a self-supervised closed
loop of contrastive, matching, and reconstruction learning on a transferable
multimodal encoder. (4) A unified evaluation benchmark is established across 11
representative downstream vision and vision-language tasks, with comparisons
against 14 leading foundation models, where SAR-KnowLIP demonstrates leading
performance, particularly in object counting and land-cover classification. We
expect that SAR-KnowLIP's large-scale multimodal data, transferable model
architecture, and comprehensive experimental benchmark will significantly
advance the development of SAR multimodal baseline models.

TL;DR: 提出AutoPrune框架，通过复杂度自适应剪枝策略，在视觉语言模型中动态调整视觉token的剪枝策略，显著降低计算需求同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型存在视觉token冗余，但传统剪枝方法采用固定的层特定剪枝策略，无法适应不同输入样本和任务的复杂度差异。

Method: AutoPrune通过量化视觉和文本token间的互信息，将其映射到预算约束的逻辑保留曲线，为不同复杂度的任务定制剪枝策略。

Result: 在LLaVA-1.5-7B上剪枝89%视觉token，推理FLOPs减少76.8%，平均准确率保持96.7%，比PDrop方法提升9.1%。

Conclusion: 复杂度自适应剪枝能有效平衡计算效率和模型性能，为视觉语言模型的高效部署提供解决方案。

Abstract: The established redundancy in visual tokens within large vision-language
models allows pruning to effectively reduce their substantial computational
demands. Previous methods typically employ heuristic layer-specific pruning
strategies where, although the number of tokens removed may differ across
decoder layers, the overall pruning schedule is fixed and applied uniformly to
all input samples and tasks, failing to align token elimination with the
model's holistic reasoning trajectory. Cognitive science indicates that human
visual processing often begins with broad exploration to accumulate evidence
before narrowing focus as the target becomes distinct. Our experiments reveal
an analogous pattern in these models. This observation suggests that neither a
fixed pruning schedule nor a heuristic layer-wise strategy can optimally
accommodate the diverse complexities inherent in different inputs. To overcome
this limitation, we introduce Complexity-Adaptive Pruning (AutoPrune), a
training-free, plug-and-play framework that tailors pruning policies to varying
sample and task complexities. Specifically, AutoPrune quantifies the mutual
information between visual and textual tokens, then projects this signal to a
budget-constrained logistic retention curve. Each such logistic curve, defined
by its unique shape, corresponds to the specific complexity of different tasks
and can guarantee adherence to predefined computational constraints. We
evaluate AutoPrune on standard vision-language tasks and on
Vision-Language-Action models for autonomous driving. Notably, when applied to
LLaVA-1.5-7B, our method prunes 89% of visual tokens and reduces inference
FLOPs by 76.8% while retaining 96.7% of the original accuracy averaged over all
tasks. This corresponds to a 9.1% improvement over the recent work PDrop,
demonstrating the effectiveness. Code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种自动汽车损伤检测流程，通过将2D掩码提升到3D空间进行损伤分割，并引入无需学习的单视图3D高斯溅射分割方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有汽车损伤检测方法大多局限于2D图像分析，而3D重建方法能提供更全面和几何精确的损伤表示。3D高斯溅射技术能从有限视角生成准确连贯的3D重建，特别适合处理仅在单视图中清晰可见的损伤目标（如划痕、小凹陷）。

Method: 使用结构从运动获取相机参数，将高斯投影到图像平面，通过Z缓冲和深度及不透明度的正态分布模型进行过滤，实现单视图3D高斯溅射分割。

Result: 该方法在具有挑战性的汽车损伤检测场景中特别有效，能够处理仅在单视图中可见的目标对象，解决了多视图一致性方法不适用的问题。

Conclusion: 提出的3D损伤分割流程和单视图3D高斯溅射分割方法为汽车损伤检测提供了更全面的解决方案，代码已公开。

Abstract: Automatic car damage detection has been a topic of significant interest for
the auto insurance industry as it promises faster, accurate, and cost-effective
damage assessments. However, few works have gone beyond 2D image analysis to
leverage 3D reconstruction methods, which have the potential to provide a more
comprehensive and geometrically accurate representation of the damage.
Moreover, recent methods employing 3D representations for novel view synthesis,
particularly 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS), have demonstrated the ability to
generate accurate and coherent 3D reconstructions from a limited number of
views. In this work we introduce an automatic car damage detection pipeline
that performs 3D damage segmentation by up-lifting 2D masks. Additionally, we
propose a simple yet effective learning-free approach for single-view 3D-GS
segmentation. Specifically, Gaussians are projected onto the image plane using
camera parameters obtained via Structure from Motion (SfM). They are then
filtered through an algorithm that utilizes Z-buffering along with a normal
distribution model of depth and opacities. Through experiments we found that
this method is particularly effective for challenging scenarios like car damage
detection, where target objects (e.g., scratches, small dents) may only be
clearly visible in a single view, making multi-view consistency approaches
impractical or impossible. The code is publicly available at:

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提供了核心方法贡献，还在ICCV 2025 MARS2挑战赛的数据生成流程中得到应用，丰富了数据集的多样性和挑战性

Abstract: Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) and Referring Expression Generation
(REG) are fundamental tasks in multimodal understanding, supporting precise
object localization through natural language. However, existing REC and REG
datasets rely heavily on manual annotation, which is labor-intensive and
difficult to scale. In this paper, we propose ColLab, a collaborative spatial
progressive data engine that enables fully automated REC and REG data
generation without human supervision. Specifically, our method introduces a
Collaborative Multimodal Model Interaction (CMMI) strategy, which leverages the
semantic understanding of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and large
language models (LLMs) to generate descriptions. Furthermore, we design a
module termed Spatial Progressive Augmentation (SPA) to enhance spatial
expressiveness among duplicate instances. Experiments demonstrate that ColLab
significantly accelerates the annotation process of REC and REG while improving
the quality and discriminability of the generated expressions. In addition to
the core methodological contribution, our framework was partially adopted in
the data generation pipeline of the ICCV 2025 MARS2 Challenge on Multimodal
Reasoning, enriching the dataset with diverse and challenging samples that
better reflect real-world reasoning demands.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频世界模型在动作跟随能力方面存在不足，但直接应用强化学习后训练方法不切实际，因为大规模偏好标注成本高昂且难以构建基于规则的视频验证器

Method: 使用逆向动力学模型将高维视频模态映射到低维动作空间，通过恢复输入动作来获得可验证的奖励信号，采用Group Relative Policy Optimization进行优化

Result: 在自回归和扩散模型上实验显示，动作跟随能力提升5-10%，视觉质量提升达10%，获得更高的人类偏好评分

Conclusion: RLIR是首个专门设计用于增强视频世界模型动作跟随能力的后训练方法，有效解决了现有方法的局限性

Abstract: World models simulate dynamic environments, enabling agents to interact with
diverse input modalities. Although recent advances have improved the visual
quality and temporal consistency of video world models, their ability of
accurately modeling human-specified actions remains under-explored.
Reinforcement learning presents a promising approach for directly improving the
suboptimal action-following capability of pre-trained models, assuming that an
appropriate reward function can be defined. However, transferring reinforcement
learning post-training methods to world model is impractical due to the
prohibitive cost of large-scale preference annotations and the infeasibility of
constructing rule-based video verifiers. To address this gap, we propose
Reinforcement Learning with Inverse Rewards (RLIR), a post-training framework
that derives verifiable reward signals by recovering input actions from
generated videos using an Inverse Dynamics Model. By mapping high-dimensional
video modality to a low-dimensional action space, RLIR provides an objective
and verifiable reward for optimization via Group Relative Policy Optimization.
Experiments across autoregressive and diffusion paradigms demonstrate 5-10%
gains in action-following, up to 10% improvements in visual quality, and higher
human preference scores, establishing RLIR as the first post-training method
specifically designed to enhance action-following in video world models.

Motivation: 甲状腺癌全球发病率上升，需要及时准确的诊断来改善治疗效果和患者预后。

Method: 将自适应CNN与CDF9/7小波结合，小波细节系数通过n-scroll混沌系统调制以增强判别特征。

Result: 在DDTI数据集上获得98.17%准确率、98.76%灵敏度、97.58%特异性、97.55% F1分数和0.9912 AUC，计算效率高（每图28.7ms）。

Conclusion: 小波-混沌-CNN管道提供了最先进的甲状腺超声分类，具有强大的泛化能力和适合临床集成的实际运行特性。

Abstract: Timely and accurate diagnosis is crucial in addressing the global rise in
thyroid cancer, ensuring effective treatment strategies and improved patient
outcomes. We present an intelligent classification method that couples an
Adaptive Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with Cohen-Daubechies-Feauveau
(CDF9/7) wavelets whose detail coefficients are modulated by an n-scroll
chaotic system to enrich discriminative features. We evaluate on the public
DDTI thyroid ultrasound dataset (n = 1,638 images; 819 malignant / 819 benign)
using 5-fold cross-validation, where the proposed method attains 98.17%
accuracy, 98.76% sensitivity, 97.58% specificity, 97.55% F1-score, and an AUC
of 0.9912. A controlled ablation shows that adding chaotic modulation to CDF9/7
improves accuracy by +8.79 percentage points over a CDF9/7-only CNN (from
89.38% to 98.17%). To objectively position our approach, we trained
state-of-the-art backbones on the same data and splits: EfficientNetV2-S
(96.58% accuracy; AUC 0.987), Swin-T (96.41%; 0.986), ViT-B/16 (95.72%; 0.983),
and ConvNeXt-T (96.94%; 0.987). Our method outperforms the best of these by
+1.23 points in accuracy and +0.0042 in AUC, while remaining computationally
efficient (28.7 ms per image; 1,125 MB peak VRAM). Robustness is further
supported by cross-dataset testing on TCIA (accuracy 95.82%) and transfer to an
ISIC skin-lesion subset (n = 28 unique images, augmented to 2,048; accuracy
97.31%). Explainability analyses (Grad-CAM, SHAP, LIME) highlight clinically
relevant regions. Altogether, the wavelet-chaos-CNN pipeline delivers
state-of-the-art thyroid ultrasound classification with strong generalization
and practical runtime characteristics suitable for clinical integration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型生成的交通仿真虽然逼真但系统性地违反物理约束，50%的轨迹违反基本物理定律，如车辆碰撞、驶离道路、建筑物内生成等

Method: VFSI方法在扩散采样过程中引入基于能量的引导，将碰撞避免和运动学约束作为能量函数，引导去噪过程生成物理有效的轨迹

Result: 在Waymo开放运动数据集的200个城市场景中，VFSI将碰撞率降低67%（从24.6%到8.1%），整体有效性提高87%（从50.3%到94.2%），同时改进真实感指标（ADE从1.34m到1.21m）

Conclusion: 在推理过程中显式执行约束对于物理有效的交通仿真既是必要的也是充分的，模型无关的方法证明了这一点

Abstract: Modern diffusion models generate realistic traffic simulations but
systematically violate physical constraints. In a large-scale evaluation of
SceneDiffuser++, a state-of-the-art traffic simulator, we find that 50% of
generated trajectories violate basic physical laws - vehicles collide, drive
off roads, and spawn inside buildings. This reveals a fundamental limitation:
current models treat physical validity as an emergent property rather than an
architectural requirement. We propose Validity-First Spatial Intelligence
(VFSI), which enforces constraints through energy-based guidance during
diffusion sampling, without model retraining. By incorporating collision
avoidance and kinematic constraints as energy functions, we guide the denoising
process toward physically valid trajectories. Across 200 urban scenarios from
the Waymo Open Motion Dataset, VFSI reduces collision rates by 67% (24.6% to
8.1%) and improves overall validity by 87% (50.3% to 94.2%), while
simultaneously improving realism metrics (ADE: 1.34m to 1.21m). Our
model-agnostic approach demonstrates that explicit constraint enforcement
during inference is both necessary and sufficient for physically valid traffic
simulation.

<details>

Motivation: 直接应用生成式扩散模型到视频超分辨率会导致冗余，因为低质量视频已包含大量内容信息，这会增加计算开销和学习负担

Method: 使用注意力专业化路由将注意力头分配到不同模式，减少冗余同时保留预训练知识；采用渐进式训练策略，从时间一致退化到不一致退化

Result: 在合成和真实世界数据集上达到最先进性能，比SeedVR2等一步扩散基线快6.2倍

Conclusion: OASIS通过注意力专业化有效解决了扩散模型在VSR中的冗余问题，实现了高效且高性能的视频超分辨率

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently shown promising results for video
super-resolution (VSR). However, directly adapting generative diffusion models
to VSR can result in redundancy, since low-quality videos already preserve
substantial content information. Such redundancy leads to increased
computational overhead and learning burden, as the model performs superfluous
operations and must learn to filter out irrelevant information. To address this
problem, we propose OASIS, an efficient $\textbf{o}$ne-step diffusion model
with $\textbf{a}$ttention $\textbf{s}$pecialization for real-world
v$\textbf{i}$deo $\textbf{s}$uper-resolution. OASIS incorporates an attention
specialization routing that assigns attention heads to different patterns
according to their intrinsic behaviors. This routing mitigates redundancy while
effectively preserving pretrained knowledge, allowing diffusion models to
better adapt to VSR and achieve stronger performance. Moreover, we propose a
simple yet effective progressive training strategy, which starts with
temporally consistent degradations and then shifts to inconsistent settings.
This strategy facilitates learning under complex degradations. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that OASIS achieves state-of-the-art performance on
both synthetic and real-world datasets. OASIS also provides superior inference
speed, offering a $\textbf{6.2$\times$}$ speedup over one-step diffusion
baselines such as SeedVR2. The code will be available at

Conclusion: 该方法无需训练，利用基础模型的零样本鲁棒性，在360度深度估计和相关下游任务中取得了卓越性能

Abstract: The increasing use of 360 images across various domains has emphasized the
need for robust depth estimation techniques tailored for omnidirectional
images. However, obtaining large-scale labeled datasets for 360 depth
estimation remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose RPG360, a
training-free robust 360 monocular depth estimation method that leverages
perspective foundation models and graph optimization. Our approach converts 360
images into six-face cubemap representations, where a perspective foundation
model is employed to estimate depth and surface normals. To address depth scale
inconsistencies across different faces of the cubemap, we introduce a novel
depth scale alignment technique using graph-based optimization, which
parameterizes the predicted depth and normal maps while incorporating an
additional per-face scale parameter. This optimization ensures depth scale
consistency across the six-face cubemap while preserving 3D structural
integrity. Furthermore, as foundation models exhibit inherent robustness in
zero-shot settings, our method achieves superior performance across diverse
datasets, including Matterport3D, Stanford2D3D, and 360Loc. We also demonstrate
the versatility of our depth estimation approach by validating its benefits in
downstream tasks such as feature matching 3.2 ~ 5.4% and Structure from Motion
0.2 ~ 9.7% in AUC@5.

Abstract: Scalable and realistic simulation of multi-agent traffic behavior is critical
for advancing autonomous driving technologies. Although existing data-driven
simulators have made significant strides in this domain, they predominantly
rely on supervised learning to align simulated distributions with real-world
driving scenarios. A persistent challenge, however, lies in the distributional
shift that arises between training and testing, which often undermines model
generalization in unseen environments. To address this limitation, we propose
SMART-R1, a novel R1-style reinforcement fine-tuning paradigm tailored for
next-token prediction models to better align agent behavior with human
preferences and evaluation metrics. Our approach introduces a metric-oriented
policy optimization algorithm to improve distribution alignment and an
iterative "SFT-RFT-SFT" training strategy that alternates between Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) to maximize performance
gains. Extensive experiments on the large-scale Waymo Open Motion Dataset

framework in enhancing foundation models. The results on the Waymo Open Sim

patients to procedural risks and diagnostic delays, leading to postponed
treatment initiation. In this work, we introduce TREAT-Net, a multimodal deep

modalities, including echocardiography videos and structured clinical records.
TREAT-Net integrates tabular-guided cross-attention to enhance video

modalities. Trained on a dataset of over 9000 ACS cases, the model outperforms
unimodal and non-fused baselines, achieving a balanced accuracy of 67.6% and an
AUROC of 71.1%. Cross-modality agreement analysis demonstrates 88.6% accuracy

Abstract: This paper evaluates the current gaze estimation methods within an HRI
context of a shared workspace scenario. We introduce a new, annotated dataset
collected with the NICO robotic platform. We evaluate four state-of-the-art
gaze estimation models. The evaluation shows that the angular errors are close
to those reported on general-purpose benchmarks. However, when expressed in
terms of distance in the shared workspace the best median error is 16.48 cm
quantifying the practical limitations of current methods. We conclude by
discussing these limitations and offering recommendations on how to best
integrate gaze estimation as a modality in HRI systems.

Conclusion: SIE3D框架成功实现了从单张图像和文本生成高质量3D头像，提供了精确的表情控制能力。

Abstract: Generating high-fidelity 3D head avatars from a single image is challenging,
as current methods lack fine-grained, intuitive control over expressions via
text. This paper proposes SIE3D, a framework that generates expressive 3D
avatars from a single image and descriptive text. SIE3D fuses identity features
from the image with semantic embedding from text through a novel conditioning
scheme, enabling detailed control. To ensure generated expressions accurately
match the text, it introduces an innovative perceptual expression loss
function. This loss uses a pre-trained expression classifier to regularize the
generation process, guaranteeing expression accuracy. Extensive experiments
show SIE3D significantly improves controllability and realism, outperforming
competitive methods in identity preservation and expression fidelity on a
single consumer-grade GPU. Project page:

TL;DR: FrameMind是一个端到端的视频理解框架，通过强化学习训练模型动态请求视觉信息，在推理过程中交替进行文本推理和主动视觉感知，显著提升了视频理解性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频理解模型采用固定的帧采样策略，无法根据具体问题的推理需求自适应地收集视觉证据，导致在需要广泛时间覆盖或精细空间细节的任务上表现不佳。

Method: 提出FrameMind框架，采用Frame-Interleaved Chain-of-Thought (FiCOT)方法，让模型在多轮交互中交替进行文本推理和主动视觉感知；引入Dynamic Resolution Frame Sampling (DRFS)训练动态采样策略，以及DRFS-GRPO算法从结果奖励中学习。

Result: 在MLVU和VideoMME等具有挑战性的基准测试中，该方法显著优于现有模型，推动了灵活高效视频理解的技术发展。

Conclusion: FrameMind通过动态视觉信息请求和强化学习训练，实现了更灵活高效的自适应视频理解，为视频理解领域带来了重要进展。

Abstract: Current video understanding models rely on fixed frame sampling strategies,
processing predetermined visual inputs regardless of the specific reasoning
requirements of each question. This static approach limits their ability to
adaptively gather visual evidence, leading to suboptimal performance on tasks
that require either broad temporal coverage or fine-grained spatial detail. In
this paper, we introduce FrameMind, an end-to-end framework trained with
reinforcement learning that enables models to dynamically request visual
information during reasoning through Frame-Interleaved Chain-of-Thought
(FiCOT). Unlike traditional approaches, FrameMind operates in multiple turns
where the model alternates between textual reasoning and active visual
perception, using tools to extract targeted frames or video clips based on
identified knowledge gaps. To train effective dynamic sampling policies, we
propose Dynamic Resolution Frame Sampling (DRFS), which exposes models to
diverse temporal-spatial trade-offs during learning, and DRFS-GRPO, a
group-relative policy optimization algorithm that learns from outcome-based
rewards without requiring frame-level annotations. Extensive experiments on
challenging benchmarks like MLVU and VideoMME demonstrate that our method
significantly outperforms existing models, advancing the state of the art in
flexible and efficient video understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GCD方法主要针对RGB图像，其假设和建模策略不适用于高维且具有复杂光谱结构的高光谱图像。

Method: 采用原型子空间建模，每个类别用一组基向量表示形成子空间；施加基正交性约束促进类间分离性，以及重构约束确保基能有效重构对应类样本。

Result: 在真实高光谱图像数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法显著优于现有最先进的GCD方法。

Conclusion: 为高光谱环境下的广义类别发现建立了坚实基础，证明了子空间表示在高维特征空间中的优越表达能力。

Abstract: Generalized category discovery~(GCD) seeks to jointly identify both known and
novel categories in unlabeled data. While prior works have mainly focused on
RGB images, their assumptions and modeling strategies do not generalize well to
hyperspectral images~(HSI), which are inherently high-dimensional and exhibit
complex spectral structures. In this paper, we propose the first GCD framework
tailored for HSI, introducing a prototype subspace modeling model to better
capture class structure. Instead of learning a single prototype vector for each
category as in existing methods such as SimGCD, we model each category using a
set of basis vectors, forming a subspace representation that enables greater
expressiveness and discrimination in a high-dimensional feature space. To guide
the learning of such bases, we enforce two key constraints: (1) a basis
orthogonality constraint that promotes inter-class separability, and (2) a
reconstruction constraint that ensures each prototype basis can effectively
reconstruct its corresponding class samples. Experimental results on real-world
HSI demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art GCD
methods, establishing a strong foundation for generalized category discovery in
hyperspectral settings.

Method: 构建可微分大气散射模型解耦雾霾浓度与光衰减；设计自适应扫描状态空间模型进行特征提取；开发异构图注意力网络建模行人多粒度交互关系。

Result: 在密集雾霾场景下，minADE/minFDE指标分别降低37.2%和41.5%；自适应Mamba变体推理速度比原生Mamba提升78%。

Conclusion: 该方法为恶劣环境下的可靠感知提供了新的建模范式，在雾霾天气行人轨迹预测任务中表现出显著优势。

Abstract: To address the issues of physical information degradation and ineffective
pedestrian interaction modeling in pedestrian trajectory prediction under hazy
weather conditions, we propose a deep learning model that combines physical
priors of atmospheric scattering with topological modeling of pedestrian
relationships. Specifically, we first construct a differentiable atmospheric
scattering model that decouples haze concentration from light degradation
through a network with physical parameter estimation, enabling the learning of
haze-mitigated feature representations. Second, we design an adaptive scanning
state space model for feature extraction. Our adaptive Mamba variant achieves a
78% inference speed increase over native Mamba while preserving long-range
dependency modeling.
  Finally, to efficiently model pedestrian relationships, we develop a
heterogeneous graph attention network, using graph matrices to model
multi-granularity interactions between pedestrians and groups, combined with a
spatio-temporal fusion module to capture the collaborative evolution patterns
of pedestrian movements. Furthermore, we constructed a new pedestrian
trajectory prediction dataset based on ETH/UCY to evaluate the effectiveness of
the proposed method. Experiments show that our method reduces the minADE /
minFDE metrics by 37.2% and 41.5%, respectively, compared to the SOTA models in
dense haze scenarios (visibility < 30m), providing a new modeling paradigm for
reliable perception in intelligent transportation systems in adverse
environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出直接在原始Bayer数据上进行图像重建，相比传统的sRGB后处理流程能获得更好的重建效果，特别是在雨景去噪任务中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图像重建网络在sRGB图像上训练，但图像信号处理(ISP)流程会不可逆地混合颜色、裁剪动态范围和模糊细节。作者希望通过直接在原始Bayer数据上学习来避免这些信息损失。

Method: 使用雨景退化问题作为案例，评估后ISP和Bayer重建流程；创建首个真实雨景数据集Raw-Rain，包含12位Bayer和位深度匹配的sRGB图像；引入信息守恒评分(ICS)作为颜色不变性指标。

Result: 在测试集上，原始域模型将sRGB结果提升了+0.99 dB PSNR和+1.2% ICS，同时运行速度更快，计算量减半。

Conclusion: 研究结果支持低层视觉任务采用"ISP最后"的范式，为端到端可学习相机管线打开了大门。

Abstract: Image reconstruction from corrupted images is crucial across many domains.
Most reconstruction networks are trained on post-ISP sRGB images, even though
the image-signal-processing pipeline irreversibly mixes colors, clips dynamic
range, and blurs fine detail. This paper uses the rain degradation problem as a
use case to show that these losses are avoidable, and demonstrates that
learning directly on raw Bayer mosaics yields superior reconstructions. To
substantiate the claim, we (i) evaluate post-ISP and Bayer reconstruction
pipelines, (ii) curate Raw-Rain, the first public benchmark of real rainy
scenes captured in both 12-bit Bayer and bit-depth-matched sRGB, and (iii)
introduce Information Conservation Score (ICS), a color-invariant metric that
aligns more closely with human opinion than PSNR or SSIM. On the test split,
our raw-domain model improves sRGB results by up to +0.99 dB PSNR and +1.2%
ICS, while running faster with half of the GFLOPs. The results advocate an
ISP-last paradigm for low-level vision and open the door to end-to-end
learnable camera pipelines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种端到端的统一框架，联合优化超像素分割和子空间聚类，通过反馈机制实现聚类感知的分割，在HSI数据集上取得了优越的聚类精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有超像素方法通常独立于聚类任务进行分割，导致分割结果与后续聚类目标不一致；同时子空间聚类计算和内存成本高，限制了可扩展性。

Method: 构建端到端框架，基于展开ADMM的自表示网络提供模型驱动信号，指导可微分超像素模块，联合优化分割和聚类，每个超像素学习独特的紧凑度参数。

Result: 在基准HSI数据集上的大量实验表明，该方法相比最先进的聚类方法始终获得更优越的准确率。

Conclusion: 提出的联合优化框架能够产生聚类感知的分割，同时保持光谱和空间结构，实现了更灵活和自适应的超像素分割。

Abstract: Subspace clustering is a powerful unsupervised approach for hyperspectral
image (HSI) analysis, but its high computational and memory costs limit
scalability. Superpixel segmentation can improve efficiency by reducing the
number of data points to process. However, existing superpixel-based methods
usually perform segmentation independently of the clustering task, often
producing partitions that do not align with the subsequent clustering
objective. To address this, we propose a unified end-to-end framework that
jointly optimizes superpixel segmentation and subspace clustering. Its core is
a feedback mechanism: a self-representation network based on unfolded
Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) provides a model-driven
signal to guide a differentiable superpixel module. This joint optimization
yields clustering-aware partitions that preserve both spectral and spatial
structure. Furthermore, our superpixel network learns a unique compactness
parameter for each superpixel, enabling more flexible and adaptive
segmentation. Extensive experiments on benchmark HSI datasets demonstrate that
our method consistently achieves superior accuracy compared with
state-of-the-art clustering approaches.

Motivation: 预训练视觉模型虽然具有可迁移性，但计算和存储成本限制了实际部署。传统剪枝方法需要任务特定数据，当下游任务未知时存在挑战。

Method: 研究数据如何影响预训练视觉模型的剪枝，探索在一项任务上剪枝对模型在未见任务上性能的影响。

Result: 意外发现：在一项任务上剪枝能保持模型在未见任务上的零样本性能；微调剪枝模型不仅能提升原始任务性能，还能恢复未见任务的性能。

Conclusion: 这种现象归因于在大规模数据集上广泛预训练所诱导的有利损失景观。

Abstract: The widespread availability of pre-trained vision models has enabled numerous
deep learning applications through their transferable representations. However,
their computational and storage costs often limit practical deployment.
Pruning-at-Initialization has emerged as a promising approach to compress
models before training, enabling efficient task-specific adaptation. While
conventional wisdom suggests that effective pruning requires task-specific
data, this creates a challenge when downstream tasks are unknown in advance. In
this paper, we investigate how data influences the pruning of pre-trained
vision models. Surprisingly, pruning on one task retains the model's zero-shot
performance also on unseen tasks. Furthermore, fine-tuning these pruned models
not only improves performance on original seen tasks but can recover held-out
tasks' performance. We attribute this phenomenon to the favorable loss
landscapes induced by extensive pre-training on large-scale datasets.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了大型视觉语言模型中通过外部视觉结构（如分区和标注）提升性能的内部机制，提出了"接地标识"概念，这些标识通过外部线索在多模态间绑定对象与分区，改善跨模态对齐并减少幻觉。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在结构化推理和精确接地方面仍存在局限，虽然添加简单视觉结构能提高准确性，但其内部机制尚不清楚，需要深入探究这些增益背后的原理。

Method: 通过表征分析研究外部视觉结构诱导的潜在标识，使用因果干预验证这些标识在对象与符号线索绑定中的中介作用，分析嵌入空间中的分区内对齐和模态间隙减少。

Result: 研究发现接地标识在嵌入空间中表现为稳健的分区内对齐，减少了图像与文本之间的模态间隙，增强了相关组件间的注意力，改善了跨模态接地并减少了幻觉。

Conclusion: 接地标识是解释外部线索如何增强多模态绑定的关键符号机制，既提供了可解释性，又在实际应用中提高了模型的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) show strong performance across
multimodal benchmarks but remain limited in structured reasoning and precise
grounding. Recent work has demonstrated that adding simple visual structures,
such as partitions and annotations, improves accuracy, yet the internal
mechanisms underlying these gains remain unclear. We investigate this
phenomenon and propose the concept of Grounding IDs, latent identifiers induced
by external cues that bind objects to their designated partitions across
modalities. Through representation analysis, we find that these identifiers
emerge as robust within-partition alignment in embedding space and reduce the
modality gap between image and text. Causal interventions further confirm that
these identifiers mediate binding between objects and symbolic cues. We show
that Grounding IDs strengthen attention between related components, which in
turn improves cross-modal grounding and reduces hallucinations. Taken together,
our results identify Grounding IDs as a key symbolic mechanism explaining how
external cues enhance multimodal binding, offering both interpretability and
practical improvements in robustness.

Motivation: 质疑帧是否是视频自回归的自然原子单元，挑战传统逐帧预测方法。

Method: 提出VideoAR框架，支持多种预测单元，特别采用时空立方体作为预测单元，让自回归模型同时处理空间和时间维度。

Result: 基于立方体的预测在质量、速度和时序一致性方面表现最优，在VBench上超越现有方法，推理更快，能扩展到分钟级序列。

Conclusion: 这项工作将激励重新思考视频和其他时空域中的序列分解方式。

Abstract: Autoregressive models for video generation typically operate frame-by-frame,
extending next-token prediction from language to video's temporal dimension. We
question that unlike word as token is universally agreed in language if frame
is a appropriate prediction unit? To address this, we present VideoAR, a
unified framework that supports a spectrum of prediction units including full
frames, key-detail frames, multiscale refinements, and spatiotemporal cubes.
Among these designs, we find model video generation using
\textit{spatiotemporal} cubes as prediction units, which allows autoregressive
models to operate across both spatial and temporal dimensions simultaneously.
This approach eliminates the assumption that frames are the natural atomic
units for video autoregression. We evaluate VideoAR across diverse prediction
strategies, finding that cube-based prediction consistently delivers superior
quality, speed, and temporal coherence. By removing the frame-by-frame
constraint, our video generator surpasses state-of-the-art baselines on VBench
while achieving faster inference and enabling seamless scaling to minute-long
sequences. We hope this work will motivate rethinking sequence decomposition in
video and other spatiotemporal domains.

Abstract: Generating realistic, context-aware two-person motion conditioned on diverse
modalities remains a central challenge in computer graphics, animation, and
human-computer interaction. We introduce DualFlow, a unified and efficient
framework for multi-modal two-person motion generation. DualFlow conditions 3D
motion synthesis on diverse inputs, including text, music, and prior motion
sequences. Leveraging rectified flow, it achieves deterministic straight-line
sampling paths between noise and data, reducing inference time and mitigating
error accumulation common in diffusion-based models. To enhance semantic
grounding, DualFlow employs a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) module that
retrieves motion exemplars using music features and LLM-based text
decompositions of spatial relations, body movements, and rhythmic patterns. We
use contrastive objective that further strengthens alignment with conditioning
signals and introduce synchronization loss that improves inter-person
coordination. Extensive evaluations across text-to-motion, music-to-motion, and
multi-modal interactive benchmarks show consistent gains in motion quality,
responsiveness, and efficiency. DualFlow produces temporally coherent and
rhythmically synchronized motions, setting state-of-the-art in multi-modal
human motion generation.

Conclusion: SVAC通过扩展输入帧和分割token，结合有效的压缩策略，显著提升了RVOS的性能和效率。

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment target objects in
video sequences based on natural language descriptions. While recent advances
in Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have improved RVOS performance
through enhanced text-video understanding, several challenges remain, including
insufficient exploitation of MLLMs' prior knowledge, prohibitive computational
and memory costs for long-duration videos, and inadequate handling of complex
temporal dynamics. In this work, we propose SVAC, a unified model that improves
RVOS by scaling up input frames and segmentation tokens to enhance
video-language interaction and segmentation precision. To address the resulting
computational challenges, SVAC incorporates the Anchor-Based Spatio-Temporal
Compression (ASTC) module to compress visual tokens while preserving essential
spatio-temporal structure. Moreover, the Clip-Specific Allocation (CSA)
strategy is introduced to better handle dynamic object behaviors across video
clips. Experimental results demonstrate that SVAC achieves state-of-the-art
performance on multiple RVOS benchmarks with competitive efficiency. Our code

Abstract: Grounding natural language queries in graphical user interfaces (GUIs)
presents a challenging task that requires models to comprehend diverse UI
elements across various applications and systems, while also accurately
predicting the spatial coordinates for the intended operation. To tackle this
problem, we propose GMS: Generalist Scanner Meets Specialist Locator, a
synergistic coarse-to-fine framework that effectively improves GUI grounding
performance. GMS leverages the complementary strengths of general
vision-language models (VLMs) and small, task-specific GUI grounding models by
assigning them distinct roles within the framework. Specifically, the general
VLM acts as a 'Scanner' to identify potential regions of interest, while the
fine-tuned grounding model serves as a 'Locator' that outputs precise
coordinates within these regions. This design is inspired by how humans perform
GUI grounding, where the eyes scan the interface and the brain focuses on
interpretation and localization. Our whole framework consists of five stages
and incorporates hierarchical search with cross-modal communication to achieve
promising prediction results. Experimental results on the ScreenSpot-Pro
dataset show that while the 'Scanner' and 'Locator' models achieve only $2.0\%$
and $3.7\%$ accuracy respectively when used independently, their integration
within GMS framework yields an overall accuracy of $35.7\%$, representing a $10
\times$ improvement. Additionally, GMS significantly outperforms other strong
baselines under various settings, demonstrating its robustness and potential
for general-purpose GUI grounding.

Abstract: Retinal disease diagnosis is critical in preventing vision loss and reducing
socioeconomic burdens. Globally, over 2.2 billion people are affected by some
form of vision impairment, resulting in annual productivity losses estimated at
$411 billion. Traditional manual grading of retinal fundus images by
ophthalmologists is time-consuming and subjective. In contrast, deep learning
has revolutionized medical diagnostics by automating retinal image analysis and
achieving expert-level performance. In this study, we present EYE-DEX, an
automated framework for classifying 10 retinal conditions using the large-scale

*Chandon Hamel,Mike Busch*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AI面部审美预测存在基于种族的偏见，即使使用平衡数据集训练的模型也会在不同种族群体间产生显著预测差异，算法反而放大了社会审美偏见而非缓解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示AI系统即使从看似平衡的数据源也会引入偏见，特别是在面部审美预测领域存在基于种族的偏见问题，警告AI在塑造审美规范中的作用。

Method: 使用SCUT-FBP5500和MEBeauty数据集训练模型，通过严格的统计验证（Kruskal-Wallis H检验、Dunn事后分析）和跨数据集验证，分析模型在不同种族群体间的预测差异。

Result: 两个模型在不同种族群体间都表现出显著预测差异（p < 0.001），即使在平衡的FairFace数据集上评估也是如此。只有4.8-9.5%的组间比较满足分布均衡标准，算法放大了社会审美偏见。

Conclusion: 当前AI审美预测方法存在不足，需要制定缓解策略来实现公平的美容技术。

Abstract: Bias can be introduced to AI systems even from seemingly balanced sources,
and AI facial beauty prediction is subject to ethnicity-based bias. This work
sounds warnings about AI's role in shaping aesthetic norms while providing
potential pathways toward equitable beauty technologies through comparative
analysis of models trained on SCUT-FBP5500 and MEBeauty datasets. Employing
rigorous statistical validation (Kruskal-Wallis H-tests, post hoc Dunn
analyses). It is demonstrated that both models exhibit significant prediction
disparities across ethnic groups $(p < 0.001)$, even when evaluated on the
balanced FairFace dataset. Cross-dataset validation shows algorithmic
amplification of societal beauty biases rather than mitigation based on
prediction and error parity. The findings underscore the inadequacy of current
AI beauty prediction approaches, with only 4.8-9.5\% of inter-group comparisons
satisfying distributional parity criteria. Mitigation strategies are proposed
and discussed in detail.

TL;DR: FastVSR是一种高效的视频超分辨率模型，通过高压缩VAE（f16）和新的训练策略，显著降低了计算成本，相比多步模型提速111.9倍，相比现有单步模型提速3.92倍。

Motivation: 现有基于扩散模型的视频超分辨率方法虽然已减少到单步采样，但在推理效率方面仍有很大优化空间，需要进一步降低计算成本。

Method: 提出FastVSR，采用高压缩VAE（空间压缩比16），设计f16 VAE结构并引入稳定训练框架，使用像素重排和通道复制实现额外上采样，并提出下界引导训练策略。

Result: 实验结果显示，FastVSR相比多步模型实现111.9倍加速，相比现有单步模型实现3.92倍加速。

Conclusion: FastVSR通过高压缩VAE和创新的训练策略，在保持性能的同时显著提升了视频超分辨率的推理效率。

Abstract: Diffusion models have significant advantages in the field of real-world video
super-resolution and have demonstrated strong performance in past research. In
recent diffusion-based video super-resolution (VSR) models, the number of
sampling steps has been reduced to just one, yet there remains significant room
for further optimization in inference efficiency. In this paper, we propose
FastVSR, which achieves substantial reductions in computational cost by
implementing a high compression VAE (spatial compression ratio of 16, denoted
as f16). We design the structure of the f16 VAE and introduce a stable training
framework. We employ pixel shuffle and channel replication to achieve
additional upsampling. Furthermore, we propose a lower-bound-guided training
strategy, which introduces a simpler training objective as a lower bound for
the VAE's performance. It makes the training process more stable and easier to
converge. Experimental results show that FastVSR achieves speedups of 111.9
times compared to multi-step models and 3.92 times compared to existing
one-step models. We will release code and models at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 青少年特发性脊柱侧弯(AIS)需要冠状面和矢状面评估，但现有无辐射方法主要关注冠状面，矢状面评估仍依赖电离辐射。

Method: 采用双阶段架构：先估计侧位脊柱结构，再合成X光片。引入基于注意力的FFC模块整合解剖特征，使用SDN建模形态变化，并构建了3,264对RGBD-X光配对数据集。

Result: LatXGen生成的X光片解剖学准确，在视觉保真度和定量指标上均优于现有GAN方法。

Conclusion: 该研究为矢状面脊柱评估提供了有前景的无辐射解决方案，推进了AIS的全面评估。

Abstract: Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis (AIS) is a complex three-dimensional spinal
deformity, and accurate morphological assessment requires evaluating both
coronal and sagittal alignment. While previous research has made significant
progress in developing radiation-free methods for coronal plane assessment,
reliable and accurate evaluation of sagittal alignment without ionizing
radiation remains largely underexplored. To address this gap, we propose
LatXGen, a novel generative framework that synthesizes realistic lateral spinal
radiographs from posterior Red-Green-Blue and Depth (RGBD) images of unclothed
backs. This enables accurate, radiation-free estimation of sagittal spinal
alignment. LatXGen tackles two core challenges: (1) inferring sagittal spinal
morphology changes from a lateral perspective based on posteroanterior surface
geometry, and (2) performing cross-modality translation from RGBD input to the
radiographic domain. The framework adopts a dual-stage architecture that
progressively estimates lateral spinal structure and synthesizes corresponding
radiographs. To enhance anatomical consistency, we introduce an attention-based
Fast Fourier Convolution (FFC) module for integrating anatomical features from
RGBD images and 3D landmarks, and a Spatial Deformation Network (SDN) to model
morphological variations in the lateral view. Additionally, we construct the
first large-scale paired dataset for this task, comprising 3,264 RGBD and
lateral radiograph pairs. Experimental results demonstrate that LatXGen
produces anatomically accurate radiographs and outperforms existing GAN-based
methods in both visual fidelity and quantitative metrics. This study offers a
promising, radiation-free solution for sagittal spine assessment and advances
comprehensive AIS evaluation.

Abstract: Medical image analysis faces significant challenges in data sharing due to
privacy regulations and complex institutional protocols. Dataset distillation
offers a solution to address these challenges by synthesizing compact datasets
that capture essential information from real, large medical datasets.
Trajectory matching has emerged as a promising methodology for dataset
distillation; however, existing methods primarily focus on terminal states,
overlooking crucial information in intermediate optimization states. We address
this limitation by proposing a shape-wise potential that captures the geometric
structure of parameter trajectories, and an easy-to-complex matching strategy
that progressively addresses parameters based on their complexity. Experiments
on medical image classification tasks demonstrate that our method improves
distillation performance while preserving privacy and maintaining model
accuracy comparable to training on the original datasets. Our code is available
at https://github.com/Bian-jh/HoP-TM.

TL;DR: DECERN是一种用于细粒度图像分类的主动学习方法，通过结合差异-混淆不确定性和校准多样性来有效评估样本价值，在有限标注预算下构建高质量标注数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在细粒度图像分类中，由于类间差异细微，评估样本信息量具有挑战性。现有方法难以准确感知细粒度图像间的区别性并评估样本价值。

Method: 引入多面信息量度量，结合差异-混淆不确定性和校准多样性。差异-混淆不确定性量化局部特征融合时的类别方向性和结构稳定性，然后进行不确定性加权聚类以多样化不确定样本，最后校准多样性以最大化全局多样性同时保持局部代表性。

Result: 在7个细粒度图像数据集上的26个不同实验设置中，该方法相比最先进方法取得了优越性能。

Conclusion: DECERN方法通过有效结合不确定性和多样性度量，在细粒度图像分类的主动学习中表现出色，能够准确评估样本价值并构建高质量标注数据集。

Abstract: Active learning (AL) aims to build high-quality labeled datasets by
iteratively selecting the most informative samples from an unlabeled pool under
limited annotation budgets. However, in fine-grained image classification,
assessing this informativeness is especially challenging due to subtle
inter-class differences. In this paper, we introduce a novel method, combining
discrepancy-confusion uncertainty and calibration diversity for active
fine-grained image classification (DECERN), to effectively perceive the
distinctiveness between fine-grained images and evaluate the sample value.
DECERN introduces a multifaceted informativeness measure that combines
discrepancy-confusion uncertainty and calibration diversity. The
discrepancy-confusion uncertainty quantifies the category directionality and
structural stability of fine-grained unlabeled data during local feature
fusion. Subsequently, uncertainty-weighted clustering is performed to diversify
the uncertainty samples. Then we calibrate the diversity to maximize the global
diversity of the selected sample while maintaining its local
representativeness. Extensive experiments conducted on 7 fine-grained image
datasets across 26 distinct experimental settings demonstrate that our method
achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 由于隐私问题，获取大型医学图像数据集具有挑战性，现有生成模型在输出多样性方面存在限制，无法准确表示3D医学图像。

Method: 使用GAN生成肿瘤掩膜，扩散模型生成肿瘤纹理，以放射组学特征作为生成条件。放射组学特征是生物学基础良好的高维手工语义特征。

Result: 在四个不同器官（肾脏、肺、乳腺、脑）的CT和MRI上测试，合成图像有效辅助下游任务训练，专家评估证实其真实性。

Conclusion: 该方法能够生成多样化的肿瘤类型，在治疗规划中具有潜在应用价值，使医生能够根据变化的放射组学特征更好地理解肿瘤。

Abstract: Due to privacy concerns, obtaining large datasets is challenging in medical
image analysis, especially with 3D modalities like Computed Tomography (CT) and
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Existing generative models, developed to
address this issue, often face limitations in output diversity and thus cannot
accurately represent 3D medical images. We propose a tumor-generation model
that utilizes radiomics features as generative conditions. Radiomics features
are high-dimensional handcrafted semantic features that are biologically
well-grounded and thus are good candidates for conditioning. Our model employs
a GAN-based model to generate tumor masks and a diffusion-based approach to
generate tumor texture conditioned on radiomics features. Our method allows the
user to generate tumor images according to user-specified radiomics features
such as size, shape, and texture at an arbitrary location. This enables the
physicians to easily visualize tumor images to better understand tumors
according to changing radiomics features. Our approach allows for the removal,
manipulation, and repositioning of tumors, generating various tumor types in
different scenarios. The model has been tested on tumors in four different
organs (kidney, lung, breast, and brain) across CT and MRI. The synthesized
images are shown to effectively aid in training for downstream tasks and their
authenticity was also evaluated through expert evaluations. Our method has
potential usage in treatment planning with diverse synthesized tumors.

Abstract: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is a common therapy option before the main
surgery for breast cancer. Response to NAC is monitored using follow-up dynamic
contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI). Accurate prediction of
NAC response helps with treatment planning. Here, we adopt maximum intensity
projection images from DCE-MRI to generate post-treatment images (i.e., 3 or 12
weeks after NAC) from pre-treatment images leveraging the emerging diffusion
model. We introduce prompt tuning to account for the known clinical factors
affecting response to NAC. Our model performed better than other generative
models in image quality metrics. Our model was better at generating images that
reflected changes in tumor size according to pCR compared to other models.
Ablation study confirmed the design choices of our method. Our study has the
potential to help with precision medicine.

Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在涉及描述性属性和关系从句的复杂查询中表现有限，主要原因是文本编码器无法有效分离目标对象与其描述属性和关系。

Method: 提出TaSe框架：1）构建层次化合成标注数据集；2）Talk in Pieces模块将文本嵌入解构为三个组件；3）See in Whole模块将解构组件聚合为层次化结构嵌入。

Result: 在OmniLabel基准测试中性能提升了24%，证明了语言组合性的重要性。

Conclusion: 通过层次化语言结构增强归纳偏置，能够产生细粒度的多模态表示，显著提升基于语言的物体检测性能。

Abstract: While vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant progress in
multimodal perception (e.g., open-vocabulary object detection) with simple
language queries, state-of-the-art VLMs still show limited ability to perceive
complex queries involving descriptive attributes and relational clauses. Our
in-depth analysis shows that these limitations mainly stem from text encoders
in VLMs. Such text encoders behave like bags-of-words and fail to separate
target objects from their descriptive attributes and relations in complex
queries, resulting in frequent false positives. To address this, we propose
restructuring linguistic representations according to the hierarchical
relations within sentences for language-based object detection. A key insight
is the necessity of disentangling textual tokens into core components-objects,
attributes, and relations ("talk in pieces")-and subsequently aggregating them
into hierarchically structured sentence-level representations ("see in whole").
Building on this principle, we introduce the TaSe framework with three main
contributions: (1) a hierarchical synthetic captioning dataset spanning three
tiers from category names to descriptive sentences; (2) Talk in Pieces, the
three-component disentanglement module guided by a novel disentanglement loss
function, transforms text embeddings into subspace compositions; and (3) See in
Whole, which learns to aggregate disentangled components into hierarchically
structured embeddings with the guide of proposed hierarchical objectives. The
proposed TaSe framework strengthens the inductive bias of hierarchical
linguistic structures, resulting in fine-grained multimodal representations for
language-based object detection. Experimental results under the OmniLabel
benchmark show a 24% performance improvement, demonstrating the importance of
linguistic compositionality.

TL;DR: 本研究开发了一种高效的3D深度学习框架T1C-RFlow，能够从多参数MRI预对比图像生成T1对比增强图像，避免了钆基对比剂的使用，并显著提高了生成速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 钆基对比剂在T1加权MRI中常用于增强病灶可视化，但对有肾源性系统性纤维化风险的患者存在限制，且对比剂给药变化会导致成像不一致。

Method: 提出3D潜在整流流模型，首先将T1w和T2-FLAIR图像输入预训练自编码器获得潜在空间表示，然后在该潜在空间中训练整流流扩散模型。

Result: T1C-RFlow在各项指标上优于基准3D模型，在胶质瘤、脑膜瘤和转移瘤数据集上均取得优异表现，且去噪时间显著更快（6.9秒/体积）。

Conclusion: 该方法生成的合成T1C图像与真实T1C图像高度相似，且生成时间远少于传统扩散模型，有望实现无对比剂的脑肿瘤MRI成像。

Abstract: Objective: Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) are commonly employed
with T1w MRI to enhance lesion visualization but are restricted in patients at
risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis and variations in GBCA administration can
introduce imaging inconsistencies. This study develops an efficient 3D
deep-learning framework to generate T1-contrast enhanced images (T1C) from
pre-contrast multiparametric MRI. Approach: We propose the 3D latent rectified
flow (T1C-RFlow) model for generating high-quality T1C images. First, T1w and
T2-FLAIR images are input into a pretrained autoencoder to acquire an efficient
latent space representation. A rectified flow diffusion model is then trained
in this latent space representation. The T1C-RFlow model was trained on a
curated dataset comprised of the BraTS 2024 glioma (GLI; 1480 patients),
meningioma (MEN; 1141 patients), and metastases (MET; 1475 patients) datasets.
Selected patients were split into train (N=2860), validation (N=612), and test
(N=614) sets. Results: Both qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate
that the T1C-RFlow model outperforms benchmark 3D models (pix2pix, DDPM,
Diffusion Transformers (DiT-3D)) trained in the same latent space. T1C-RFlow
achieved the following metrics - GLI: NMSE 0.044 +/- 0.047, SSIM 0.935 +/-
0.025; MEN: NMSE 0.046 +/- 0.029, SSIM 0.937 +/- 0.021; MET: NMSE 0.098 +/-
0.088, SSIM 0.905 +/- 0.082. T1C-RFlow had the best tumor reconstruction
performance and significantly faster denoising times (6.9 s/volume, 200 steps)
than conventional DDPM models in both latent space (37.7s, 1000 steps) and
patch-based in image space (4.3 hr/volume). Significance: Our proposed method
generates synthetic T1C images that closely resemble ground truth T1C in much
less time than previous diffusion models. Further development may permit a
practical method for contrast-agent-free MRI for brain tumors.

maintaining semantic faithfulness during flow-based generation due to
text-visual token imbalance and the limitations of uniform cross-modal
attention across the flow trajectory, and efficiently extending image-centric
MLLMs to video without costly retraining. We present UniVid, a unified
architecture that couples an MLLM with a diffusion decoder through a

Motivation: 视觉基础模型如SAM在大规模自然图像数据集上预训练，但在医学图像分割中表现不佳，需要高效的领域特定适配方法。

Method: 结合三个组件：互补细节增强网络(CDEN)捕获边界敏感特征；ViT块中的低秩适配器优化医学特征表示；掩码解码器中的低秩张量注意力机制减少内存使用。

Conclusion: BALR-SAM为医学图像分割提供了一种高效、资源友好的适配方法，在保持强性能的同时显著减少参数和内存需求。

Abstract: Vision foundation models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM), pretrained on
large-scale natural image datasets, often struggle in medical image
segmentation due to a lack of domain-specific adaptation. In clinical practice,
fine-tuning such models efficiently for medical downstream tasks with minimal
resource demands, while maintaining strong performance, is challenging. To
address these issues, we propose BALR-SAM, a boundary-aware low-rank adaptation
framework that enhances SAM for medical imaging. It combines three tailored
components: (1) a Complementary Detail Enhancement Network (CDEN) using
depthwise separable convolutions and multi-scale fusion to capture
boundary-sensitive features essential for accurate segmentation; (2) low-rank
adapters integrated into SAM's Vision Transformer blocks to optimize feature
representation and attention for medical contexts, while simultaneously
significantly reducing the parameter space; and (3) a low-rank tensor attention
mechanism in the mask decoder, cutting memory usage by 75% and boosting
inference speed. Experiments on standard medical segmentation datasets show
that BALR-SAM, without requiring prompts, outperforms several state-of-the-art
(SOTA) methods, including fully fine-tuned MedSAM, while updating just 1.8%
(11.7M) of its parameters.

Abstract: Instant reconstruction of dynamic 3D humans from uncalibrated sparse-view
videos is critical for numerous downstream applications. Existing methods,
however, are either limited by the slow reconstruction speeds or incapable of
generating novel-time representations. To address these challenges, we propose
Forge4D, a feed-forward 4D human reconstruction and interpolation model that
efficiently reconstructs temporally aligned representations from uncalibrated
sparse-view videos, enabling both novel view and novel time synthesis. Our
model simplifies the 4D reconstruction and interpolation problem as a joint
task of streaming 3D Gaussian reconstruction and dense motion prediction. For
the task of streaming 3D Gaussian reconstruction, we first reconstruct static
3D Gaussians from uncalibrated sparse-view images and then introduce learnable
state tokens to enforce temporal consistency in a memory-friendly manner by
interactively updating shared information across different timestamps. For
novel time synthesis, we design a novel motion prediction module to predict
dense motions for each 3D Gaussian between two adjacent frames, coupled with an
occlusion-aware Gaussian fusion process to interpolate 3D Gaussians at
arbitrary timestamps. To overcome the lack of the ground truth for dense motion
supervision, we formulate dense motion prediction as a dense point matching
task and introduce a self-supervised retargeting loss to optimize this module.
An additional occlusion-aware optical flow loss is introduced to ensure motion
consistency with plausible human movement, providing stronger regularization.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on both
in-domain and out-of-domain datasets. Project page and code at:

Conclusion: AVF-MAE++通过创新的设计选择有效解决了AVFA领域的可扩展性和跨模态相关性学习问题，为情感视频面部分析提供了强大的基础模型。

Abstract: Affective video facial analysis (AVFA) has emerged as a key research field
for building emotion-aware intelligent systems, yet this field continues to
suffer from limited data availability. In recent years, the self-supervised
learning (SSL) technique of Masked Autoencoders (MAE) has gained momentum, with
growing adaptations in its audio-visual contexts. While scaling has proven
essential for breakthroughs in general multi-modal learning domains, its
specific impact on AVFA remains largely unexplored. Another core challenge in
this field is capturing both intra- and inter-modal correlations through
scalable audio-visual representations. To tackle these issues, we propose
AVF-MAE++, a family of audio-visual MAE models designed to efficiently
investigate the scaling properties in AVFA while enhancing cross-modal
correlation modeling. Our framework introduces a novel dual masking strategy
across audio and visual modalities and strengthens modality encoders with a
more holistic design to better support scalable pre-training. Additionally, we
present the Iterative Audio-Visual Correlation Learning Module, which improves
correlation learning within the SSL paradigm, bridging the limitations of
previous methods. To support smooth adaptation and reduce overfitting risks, we
further introduce a progressive semantic injection strategy, organizing the
model training into three structured stages. Extensive experiments conducted on
17 datasets, covering three major AVFA tasks, demonstrate that AVF-MAE++
achieves consistent state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks.
Comprehensive ablation studies further highlight the importance of each
proposed component and provide deeper insights into the design choices driving
these improvements. Our code and models have been publicly released at Github.

Method: 采用混合训练策略，结合监督学习和视觉强化微调，开发具有像素级视觉定位和推理能力的多模态视觉语言基础模型。

Result: 在内部验证中，疾病诊断平均准确率0.858、F1分数0.797，视觉定位平均mIOU 0.743、Acc@0.5 0.837，外部验证显示强大的零样本和少样本性能。

Abstract: Despite the promise of foundation models in medical AI, current systems
remain limited - they are modality-specific and lack transparent reasoning
processes, hindering clinical adoption. To address this gap, we present
EVLF-FM, a multimodal vision-language foundation model (VLM) designed to unify
broad diagnostic capability with fine-grain explainability. The development and
testing of EVLF-FM encompassed over 1.3 million total samples from 23 global
datasets across eleven imaging modalities related to six clinical specialties:
dermatology, hepatology, ophthalmology, pathology, pulmonology, and radiology.
External validation employed 8,884 independent test samples from 10 additional
datasets across five imaging modalities. Technically, EVLF-FM is developed to
assist with multiple disease diagnosis and visual question answering with
pixel-level visual grounding and reasoning capabilities. In internal validation
for disease diagnostics, EVLF-FM achieved the highest average accuracy (0.858)
and F1-score (0.797), outperforming leading generalist and specialist models.
In medical visual grounding, EVLF-FM also achieved stellar performance across
nine modalities with average mIOU of 0.743 and Acc@0.5 of 0.837. External
validations further confirmed strong zero-shot and few-shot performance, with
competitive F1-scores despite a smaller model size. Through a hybrid training
strategy combining supervised and visual reinforcement fine-tuning, EVLF-FM not
only achieves state-of-the-art accuracy but also exhibits step-by-step
reasoning, aligning outputs with visual evidence. EVLF-FM is an early
multi-disease VLM model with explainability and reasoning capabilities that
could advance adoption of and trust in foundation models for real-world
clinical deployment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了两种无需训练、在推理时利用显式动作参数的技术，用于基于扩散模型的机器人视频生成，通过主动引导分类器自由指导过程和初始化高斯潜在变量来提升动作连贯性和视觉质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从显式动作轨迹生成逼真的机器人视频是构建有效世界模型和机器人基础模型的关键步骤，需要充分利用动作参数来提升生成质量。

Method: 1) 动作缩放分类器自由指导：根据动作幅度动态调节指导强度，增强对运动强度的控制；2) 动作缩放噪声截断：调整初始采样噪声分布以更好地匹配期望的运动动态。

Result: 在真实机器人操作数据集上的实验表明，这些技术显著提高了不同机器人环境中的动作连贯性和视觉质量。

Conclusion: 通过主动利用显式动作参数来指导扩散过程，可以有效提升机器人视频生成的动作一致性和视觉逼真度。

Abstract: Generating realistic robot videos from explicit action trajectories is a
critical step toward building effective world models and robotics foundation
models. We introduce two training-free, inference-time techniques that fully
exploit explicit action parameters in diffusion-based robot video generation.
Instead of treating action vectors as passive conditioning signals, our methods
actively incorporate them to guide both the classifier-free guidance process
and the initialization of Gaussian latents. First, action-scaled
classifier-free guidance dynamically modulates guidance strength in proportion
to action magnitude, enhancing controllability over motion intensity. Second,
action-scaled noise truncation adjusts the distribution of initially sampled
noise to better align with the desired motion dynamics. Experiments on real
robot manipulation datasets demonstrate that these techniques significantly
improve action coherence and visual quality across diverse robot environments.

TL;DR: 提出Latent Visual Reasoning (LVR)新范式，直接在视觉嵌入空间进行自回归推理，显著提升感知密集型视觉问答任务的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将推理局限在语言空间，视觉信息被当作静态前提条件，存在根本性限制

Method: 使用视觉编码器将图像投影到与语言模型共享的联合语义空间中的视觉token，训练语言模型生成能重建关键视觉token的潜在状态，实现潜在视觉推理

Result: 在MMVP上达到71.67%的准确率，相比Qwen2.5-VL的66.67%有显著提升

Conclusion: LVR显著改善了细粒度视觉理解和感知能力，为多模态推理提供了新方向

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved notable gains in
various tasks by incorporating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in language
spaces. Recent work extends this direction by leveraging external tools for
visual editing, thereby enhancing the visual signal along the reasoning
trajectories. Nevertheless, these approaches remain fundamentally constrained:
reasoning is still confined to the language space, with visual information
treated as static preconditions. We introduce Latent Visual Reasoning (LVR), a
new paradigm that enables autoregressive reasoning directly in the visual
embedding space. A visual encoder first projects images into visual tokens
within a joint semantic space shared with the language model. The language
model is then trained to generate latent states that reconstruct key visual
tokens critical for answering the query, constituting the process of latent
visual reasoning. By interleaving LVR with standard text generation, our model
achieves substantial gains on perception-intensive visual question answering
tasks. In addition, we adapt the GRPO algorithm to conduct reinforcement
learning on latent reasoning, further balancing LVR and textual generation. We
show that LVR substantially improves fine-grained visual understanding and
perception, achieving 71.67% on MMVP compared to 66.67% with Qwen2.5-VL. Code
base and model weights will be released later.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种专为多模态大语言模型设计的图像编码器CoTAM，通过自适应保护多级特征来优化MLLM任务性能，相比传统编解码器节省35.99%比特率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图像编解码器针对人类视觉系统优化，不适合多模态大语言模型的需求，因为MLLM需要处理多种下游任务，且压缩失真对不同层级特征的影响不均。

Method: CoTAM编码器利用CLIP浅层注意力生成重要性图进行比特分配，保护关键语义区域；解码器集成轻量级适配器和多级损失函数，确保低层细节和高层语义的忠实重建。

Result: 实验验证该方法在保持MLLM任务性能的同时，实现了高达35.99%的比特率节省，优于现有最先进的神经编解码器。

Conclusion: CoTAM通过自适应保护多级特征，有效解决了MLLM任务中的压缩失真问题，为边缘设备到云端的图像传输提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The increasing deployment of powerful Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs), typically hosted on cloud platforms, urgently requires effective
compression techniques to efficiently transmit signal inputs (e.g., images,
videos) from edge devices with minimal bandwidth usage. However, conventional
image codecs are optimized for fidelity to serve the Human Visual System (HVS)
and ill-suited for MLLMs, in which diverse downstream tasks are jointly
considered. In this paper, we first systematically analyze the impact of
compression artifacts on several mainstream MLLMs. We find that: Compression
distortion unevenly impacts different-level image features, leading to varying
effects on MLLMs' downstream tasks depending on their feature-level reliance.
Motivated by this discovery, we propose an image Codec TAilored to MLLMs
(CoTAM) designed to adaptively protect multi-level features and suit different
demands of downstream tasks. The encoder leverages CLIP's shallow-layer
attention to generate an importance map for bit allocation, preserving critical
semantic regions. Concurrently, the decoder integrates a lightweight adapter
with a multi-level loss function to ensure the faithful reconstruction both of
low-level details and high-level semantic context for robust synthesis of
cross-level features. Extensive experiments validate that our method achieves
up to 35.99\% bitrate saving while maintaining the same performance on the MLLM
tasks, outperforming previous SOTA neural codecs.

Motivation: 尽管二值SNN在能效方面有优势，但其在大规模网络中的存储和计算需求仍然很大，需要进一步探索压缩和加速潜力。

Method: 1) 利用训练好的二值SNN中核的聚类模式建立S²NN基线；2) 提出异常值感知的亚比特权重量化(OS-Quant)方法，通过识别和自适应缩放异常值来优化码字选择；3) 提出基于膜电位的特征蒸馏(MPFD)方法，通过教师模型提供更精确的指导。

Result: 在视觉和非视觉任务上的广泛结果表明，S²NN在性能和效率方面都优于现有的量化SNN。

Conclusion: S²NN在边缘计算应用中具有很好的前景，能够实现更高的压缩比和更好的性能。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer an energy-efficient paradigm for machine
intelligence, but their continued scaling poses challenges for resource-limited
deployment. Despite recent advances in binary SNNs, the storage and
computational demands remain substantial for large-scale networks. To further
explore the compression and acceleration potential of SNNs, we propose Sub-bit
Spiking Neural Networks (S$^2$NNs) that represent weights with less than one
bit. Specifically, we first establish an S$^2$NN baseline by leveraging the
clustering patterns of kernels in well-trained binary SNNs. This baseline is
highly efficient but suffers from \textit{outlier-induced codeword selection
bias} during training. To mitigate this issue, we propose an
\textit{outlier-aware sub-bit weight quantization} (OS-Quant) method, which
optimizes codeword selection by identifying and adaptively scaling outliers.
Furthermore, we propose a \textit{membrane potential-based feature
distillation} (MPFD) method, improving the performance of highly compressed
S$^2$NN via more precise guidance from a teacher model. Extensive results on
vision and non-vision tasks reveal that S$^2$NN outperforms existing quantized
SNNs in both performance and efficiency, making it promising for edge computing
applications.

Motivation: 深度生成模型在医学图像合成中表现出色，但确保条件忠实度和高质量合成图像（特别是直接和反事实生成）仍具挑战性。

Method: 引入循环训练框架，通过循环约束强制生成图像与原始图像之间的一致性，从而提高条件遵循性和合成图像真实性。

Conclusion: CDM中的循环策略是改进基于扩散的医学图像生成的有效方法，适用于数据增强、反事实和疾病进展建模。

Abstract: Deep generative models have demonstrated remarkable success in medical image
synthesis. However, ensuring conditioning faithfulness and high-quality
synthetic images for direct or counterfactual generation remains a challenge.
In this work, we introduce a cycle training framework to fine-tune diffusion
models for improved conditioning adherence and enhanced synthetic image
realism. Our approach, Cycle Diffusion Model (CDM), enforces consistency
between generated and original images by incorporating cycle constraints,
enabling more reliable direct and counterfactual generation. Experiments on a
combined 3D brain MRI dataset (from ABCD, HCP aging & young adults, ADNI, and
PPMI) show that our method improves conditioning accuracy and enhances image
quality as measured by FID and SSIM. The results suggest that the cycle
strategy used in CDM can be an effective method for refining diffusion-based
medical image generation, with applications in data augmentation,
counterfactual, and disease progression modeling.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于骨架的鲁棒点云配准框架SRRF，通过引入抗干扰的骨架表示来提高配准的鲁棒性和准确性，在各种噪声场景下优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的点云常受传感器限制、环境噪声和预处理误差影响，导致密度失真、噪声污染和几何变形，现有配准方法对此敏感且配准精度下降。

Method: 将骨架结构整合到配准过程中，结合从损坏点云对齐及其骨架对齐获得的变换来实现最优配准，并设计了分布距离损失函数来强制源和目标骨架之间的一致性。

Result: 在多样化损坏数据集上的实验评估表明，SRRF在各种损坏场景（包括密度失真、噪声污染和几何变形）中始终优于最先进的配准方法。

Conclusion: SRRF在处理损坏点云方面具有鲁棒性，使其成为现实场景中3D感知任务的潜在方法。

Abstract: Point cloud registration is fundamental in 3D vision applications, including
autonomous driving, robotics, and medical imaging, where precise alignment of
multiple point clouds is essential for accurate environment reconstruction.
However, real-world point clouds are often affected by sensor limitations,
environmental noise, and preprocessing errors, making registration challenging
due to density distortions, noise contamination, and geometric deformations.
Existing registration methods rely on direct point matching or surface feature
extraction, which are highly susceptible to these corruptions and lead to
reduced alignment accuracy. To address these challenges, a skeleton-based
robust registration framework is presented, which introduces a
corruption-resilient skeletal representation to improve registration robustness
and accuracy. The framework integrates skeletal structures into the
registration process and combines the transformations obtained from both the
corrupted point cloud alignment and its skeleton alignment to achieve optimal
registration. In addition, a distribution distance loss function is designed to
enforce the consistency between the source and target skeletons, which
significantly improves the registration performance. This framework ensures
that the alignment considers both the original local geometric features and the
global stability of the skeleton structure, resulting in robust and accurate
registration results. Experimental evaluations on diverse corrupted datasets
demonstrate that SRRF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art registration
methods across various corruption scenarios, including density distortions,
noise contamination, and geometric deformations. The results confirm the
robustness of SRRF in handling corrupted point clouds, making it a potential
approach for 3D perception tasks in real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: CEGC为具有挑战性条件下的部分点云配准提供了一个可解释且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Partial point cloud registration is essential for autonomous perception and
3D scene understanding, yet it remains challenging owing to structural
ambiguity, partial visibility, and noise. We address these issues by proposing
Confidence Estimation under Global Context (CEGC), a unified, confidence-driven
framework for robust partial 3D registration. CEGC enables accurate alignment
in complex scenes by jointly modeling overlap confidence and correspondence
reliability within a shared global context. Specifically, the hybrid overlap
confidence estimation module integrates semantic descriptors and geometric
similarity to detect overlapping regions and suppress outliers early. The
context-aware matching strategy smitigates ambiguity by employing global
attention to assign soft confidence scores to correspondences, improving
robustness. These scores guide a differentiable weighted singular value
decomposition solver to compute precise transformations. This tightly coupled
pipeline adaptively down-weights uncertain regions and emphasizes contextually
reliable matches. Experiments on ModelNet40, ScanObjectNN, and 7Scenes 3D
vision datasets demonstrate that CEGC outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
accuracy, robustness, and generalization. Overall, CEGC offers an interpretable
and scalable solution to partial point cloud registration under challenging
conditions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的VideoQA训练框架，通过问题重构和问题引导字幕生成两种策略，从孤立的事实问答对中合成更丰富的监督信号，显著提升了模型性能和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统VideoQA模型的监督信号局限于孤立的事实问答对，无法捕捉视频的叙事结构和因果关系，限制了模型对视频内容的深度理解。

Method: 提出两种互补策略：问题重构将多样化的问答对合成为整体叙事段落；问题引导字幕生成细粒度的视觉推理，为每个问题提供具体证据支撑。利用生成模型合成数据，在统一的下一词预测目标下训练VideoQA模型。

Result: 在STAR和NExT-QA数据集上验证，显著提升准确率并创下新SOTA：3B模型在STAR上达到72.5%（+4.9%），7B模型在NExT-QA上达到80.8%。QBP和QBC都大幅提升跨数据集泛化能力，QBP还加速模型收敛2.5倍以上。

Conclusion: 将数据合成从孤立事实转向叙事连贯性和有根据的推理，能够产生更准确、高效和可泛化的训练范式。

Abstract: The performance of Video Question Answering (VideoQA) models is fundamentally
constrained by the nature of their supervision, which typically consists of
isolated, factual question-answer pairs. This "bag-of-facts" approach fails to
capture the underlying narrative and causal structure of events, limiting
models to a shallow understanding of video content. To move beyond this
paradigm, we introduce a framework to synthesize richer supervisory signals. We
propose two complementary strategies: Question-Based Paraphrasing (QBP), which
synthesizes the diverse inquiries (what, how, why) from a video's existing set
of question-answer pairs into a holistic narrative paragraph that reconstructs
the video's event structure; and Question-Based Captioning (QBC), which
generates fine-grained visual rationales, grounding the answer to each question
in specific, relevant evidence. Leveraging powerful generative models, we use
this synthetic data to train VideoQA models under a unified next-token
prediction objective. Extensive experiments on STAR and NExT-QA validate our
approach, demonstrating significant accuracy gains and establishing new
state-of-the-art results, such as improving a 3B model to 72.5\% on STAR
(+4.9\%) and a 7B model to 80.8\% on NExT-QA. Beyond accuracy, our analysis
reveals that both QBP and QBC substantially enhance cross-dataset
generalization, with QBP additionally accelerating model convergence by over
2.5x. These results demonstrate that shifting data synthesis from isolated
facts to narrative coherence and grounded rationales yields a more accurate,
efficient, and generalizable training paradigm.

Conclusion: ASIA框架通过少量图像标注实现了高效准确的3D分割，在几何或结构差异较大的对象间也能成功迁移分割效果。

Abstract: We introduce ASIA (Adaptive 3D Segmentation using few Image Annotations), a
novel framework that enables segmentation of possibly non-semantic and
non-text-describable "parts" in 3D. Our segmentation is controllable through a
few user-annotated in-the-wild images, which are easier to collect than
multi-view images, less demanding to annotate than 3D models, and more precise
than potentially ambiguous text descriptions. Our method leverages the rich
priors of text-to-image diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion (SD), to
transfer segmentations from image space to 3D, even when the annotated and
target objects differ significantly in geometry or structure. During training,
we optimize a text token for each segment and fine-tune our model with a novel
cross-view part correspondence loss. At inference, we segment multi-view
renderings of the 3D mesh, fuse the labels in UV-space via voting, refine them
with our novel Noise Optimization technique, and finally map the UV-labels back
onto the mesh. ASIA provides a practical and generalizable solution for both
semantic and non-semantic 3D segmentation tasks, outperforming existing methods
by a noticeable margin in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

TL;DR: 该论文提出将欧几里得几何问题解决作为提升多模态大语言模型空间智能的代理任务，通过构建Euclid30K数据集并使用GRPO方法微调模型，显著提升了模型在多个空间推理基准上的零样本性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 空间智能（包括形状可视化、物体旋转、位置关系判断等）是多模态大语言模型尚未解决的关键挑战，需要开发有效方法来提升模型的空间推理能力。

Method: 构建包含约30K平面和立体几何问题的Euclid30K数据集，使用Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)方法微调Qwen2.5VL和RoboBrain2.0系列模型，使模型能够识别形状、计数、关联实体并进行多步演绎推理。

Result: 经过Euclid30K训练后，所有评估模型在VSI-Bench上的平均准确率从34.5%提升到40.5%，提高了5.5个百分点。其中RoboBrain2.0-Euclid-7B达到49.6%的准确率，超越了之前的SOTA模型Spatial-MLLM。

Abstract: Spatial intelligence spans a rich suite of abilities, including visualising
and transforming shapes, mentally rotating objects, judging relational
positions and containment, and estimating numerosity. However, it still remains
a critical unresolved challenge for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs).To
fill this gap, we propose to treat Euclidean geometry problem-solving as a
surrogate task. Specifically, we meticulously constructed a curated multimodal
dataset, called Euclid30K, comprising approximately 30K plane and solid
geometry problems. To enable the model to acquire and apply Euclidean
principles from these geometry problems, we employed Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) to finetune the Qwen2.5VL family and RoboBrain2.0 family,
inspiring the models to identify shapes, count, and relate entities, and
perform multi-step deductive reasoning using Euclidean principles. Our
experiments demonstrate that the resulting models achieve substantial zero-shot
gains across four spatial reasoning benchmarks (Super-CLEVR, Omni3DBench,
VSI-Bench, and MindCube) without any task-specific adaptations. Notably, after
training on the Euclid30K, the mean VSI-Bench accuracy of all evaluated models
rose from 34.5% to 40.5%, improving by 5.5 percentage points. Among them,
RoboBrain2.0-Euclid-7B achieves 49.6\% accuracy, surpassing the previous
state-of-the-art model, Spatial-MLLM.To our knowledge, this is the first
systematic study showing that geometry-centric fine-tuning can confer
vision-language models with broadly transferable spatial skills. Code and
Euclid30K dataset can be found in https://zgca-ai4edu.github.io/Euclids_Gift.

Conclusion: 该方法为设计、内容创作和自动化图形生成开辟了新方向，支持精确和分层编辑，优于基于图像的方法。

Abstract: Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is a code-based representation for 2D visuals.
Leveraging recent advances in large language models (LLMs), we study
text-to-SVG generation and address two persistent gaps: weak generalization and
poor adherence to input instructions. We present SVGThinker, a reasoning-driven
framework that aligns the production of SVG code with the visualization process
and supports the full set of SVG primitives. Our pipeline first renders each
primitive in sequence and uses a multimodal model to annotate the image and
code; we then build stepwise updates that mirror the incremental addition of
primitives. On this data, we train an LLM with supervised fine-tuning that
exposes its chain-of-thought as intermediate reasoning, improving robustness
and reducing errors and hallucinations. Experiments against state-of-the-art
baselines show that SVGThinker produces more stable, editable, and
higher-quality SVGs while preserving the structural advantages of vector
graphics. Unlike image-based methods, our outputs enable precise and
hierarchical editing, opening new directions for design, content creation, and
automated graphics generation.

*Zefeng He,Xiaoye Qu,Yafu Li,Siyuan Huang,Daizong Liu,Yu Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FrameThinker是一个用于长视频推理的新框架，通过迭代式视频内容查询和两阶段训练策略，显著提升了大型视觉语言模型在长视频理解任务中的效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型视觉语言模型在长视频推理中存在两个主要问题：均匀帧采样效率低下，静态文本推理难以处理视觉密集型视频任务。

Method: 提出FrameThinker框架，采用两阶段训练策略：首先使用监督微调建立基本动作能力，然后通过强化学习优化策略决策，并对每个动作和格式奖励进行深入设计探索。

Result: 在多个推理基准测试中，FrameThinker相比基线平均提升10.4%，同时大幅减少处理帧数。7B模型在LongVideo-Reason上达到76.1%准确率，仅使用20.6帧，比LongVILA-R1性能更好且帧数减少20倍以上。

Conclusion: FrameThinker在长视频推理中实现了前所未有的效率和效果，为处理视觉密集型长视频任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved substantial progress
in video understanding, their application to long video reasoning is hindered
by uniform frame sampling and static textual reasoning, which are inefficient
and struggle to handle visually intensive video tasks. To overcome these
challenges, in this paper, we introduce the concept of thinking with long
videos and propose a novel framework FrameThinker. Within this framework, LVLMs
are able to iteratively interrogate video content. Developing such video
reasoning capabilities in LVLMs presents notable challenges, particularly in
adapting the model to new video actions (e.g. select frame), and designing
reward functions to guide LVLMs to adopt the newly introduced action. To solve
these challenges, we propose a two-phase training strategy, first employing
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to instill fundamental action capabilities,
followed by Reinforcement Learning (RL) to optimize a strategic decision-making
policy.Notably, in this RL phase, we conduct an in-depth and comprehensive
exploration of the reward design for each action and format reward. Extensive
experiments on reasoning benchmarks like Video-Holmes, LongVideo-Reason, and
long-video understanding benchmarks such as LongVideoBench, MLVU, VideoMME, and
LVBench, demonstrate that FrameThinker achieves a significant average
improvement of +10.4% over baselines while drastically reducing the number of
processed frames. Most notably, our 7B model, FrameThinker establishes a new
state-of-the-art on LongVideo-Reason, achieving 76.1% accuracy using an average
of only 20.6 frames. This not only outperforms the competitive LongVILA-R1
(72.0%) but does so with over 20x fewer frames (vs. 512), demonstrating
unparalleled efficiency and effectiveness.

Abstract: Recent advances in video large language models (VideoLLMs) call for new
evaluation protocols and benchmarks for complex temporal reasoning in
video-language understanding. Inspired by the needle in a haystack test widely
used by LLMs, we introduce a novel task of Needle in a Montage (NeMo), designed

recall and temporal grounding. To generate video question answering data for
our task, we develop a scalable automated data generation pipeline that

TL;DR: OMeGa是一个端到端框架，联合优化三角形网格和2D高斯溅射，通过网格约束和法线监督解决室内无纹理区域重建不准确的问题，在室内重建基准上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在两个局限：(i) 在无纹理室内区域几何重建不准确；(ii) 网格提取与优化分离，无法利用网格几何指导溅射优化。

Method: 提出端到端框架，通过灵活的绑定策略联合优化三角形网格和2D高斯溅射，集成网格约束和单目法线监督，并提出启发式迭代网格细化策略。

Result: 在挑战性室内重建基准上达到最先进性能，Chamfer-L1距离比2DGS基线减少47.3%，同时保持竞争力的新视角渲染质量。

Conclusion: OMeGa有效解决了先前室内无纹理重建的局限性，证明了联合优化网格和溅射的有效性。

Abstract: Neural rendering with Gaussian splatting has advanced novel view synthesis,
and most methods reconstruct surfaces via post-hoc mesh extraction. However,
existing methods suffer from two limitations: (i) inaccurate geometry in
texture-less indoor regions, and (ii) the decoupling of mesh extraction from
optimization, thereby missing the opportunity to leverage mesh geometry to
guide splat optimization. In this paper, we present OMeGa, an end-to-end
framework that jointly optimizes an explicit triangle mesh and 2D Gaussian
splats via a flexible binding strategy, where spatial attributes of Gaussian
Splats are expressed in the mesh frame and texture attributes are retained on
splats. To further improve reconstruction accuracy, we integrate mesh
constraints and monocular normal supervision into the optimization, thereby
regularizing geometry learning. In addition, we propose a heuristic, iterative
mesh-refinement strategy that splits high-error faces and prunes unreliable
ones to further improve the detail and accuracy of the reconstructed mesh.
OMeGa achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging indoor
reconstruction benchmarks, reducing Chamfer-$L_1$ by 47.3\% over the 2DGS
baseline while maintaining competitive novel-view rendering quality. The
experimental results demonstrate that OMeGa effectively addresses prior
limitations in indoor texture-less reconstruction.

Abstract: Cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) enables in situ visualization of
macromolecular structures, where subtomogram analysis tasks such as
classification, alignment, and averaging are critical for structural
determination. However, effective analysis is hindered by scarce annotations,
severe noise, and poor generalization. To address these challenges, we take the
first step towards foundation models for cryo-ET subtomograms. First, we
introduce CryoEngine, a large-scale synthetic data generator that produces over
904k subtomograms from 452 particle classes for pretraining. Second, we design
an Adaptive Phase Tokenization-enhanced Vision Transformer (APT-ViT), which
incorporates adaptive phase tokenization as an equivariance-enhancing module
that improves robustness to both geometric and semantic variations. Third, we
introduce a Noise-Resilient Contrastive Learning (NRCL) strategy to stabilize
representation learning under severe noise conditions. Evaluations across 24
synthetic and real datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on
all three major subtomogram tasks and strong generalization to unseen datasets,
advancing scalable and robust subtomogram analysis in cryo-ET.

Motivation: 传统特征度量方法可能遗漏复杂的互相关关系，而相关度量方法由于处理4D相关图导致计算成本过高，需要一种能克服这些限制的高效方法。

Method: 采用选择性状态空间模型，实现相似性感知的选择性扫描机制，基于Mamba的线性复杂度算法有效细化4D相关图，同时保持特征图分辨率和感受野。

Result: 在标准语义对应基准测试中，MambaMatcher实现了最先进的性能表现。

Conclusion: MambaMatcher通过选择性状态空间模型成功克服了传统方法的局限性，为语义对应任务提供了一种高效且高性能的解决方案。

Abstract: Establishing semantic correspondences between images is a fundamental yet
challenging task in computer vision. Traditional feature-metric methods enhance
visual features but may miss complex inter-correlation relationships, while
recent correlation-metric approaches are hindered by high computational costs
due to processing 4D correlation maps. We introduce MambaMatcher, a novel
method that overcomes these limitations by efficiently modeling
high-dimensional correlations using selective state-space models (SSMs). By
implementing a similarity-aware selective scan mechanism adapted from Mamba's
linear-complexity algorithm, MambaMatcher refines the 4D correlation map
effectively without compromising feature map resolution or receptive field.
Experiments on standard semantic correspondence benchmarks demonstrate that
MambaMatcher achieves state-of-the-art performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MRI质量评估方法存在根本性权衡：基于信号的方法缺乏语义理解，而深度学习方法牺牲了可解释性。

Method: 结合三个关键创新：通过MRQy增强模拟伪影的鲁棒指标提取、使用Qwen将指标转化为问答对、通过LoRA进行参数高效融合。

Result: 在MR-ART、FastMRI和MyConnectome基准测试中达到最先进性能，具有强大的零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: 通过桥接定量分析与语义推理，该框架生成临床可解释的输出，增强了动态医疗环境中的质量控制。

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) quality assessment is crucial for clinical
decision-making, yet remains challenging due to data scarcity and protocol
variability. Traditional approaches face fundamental trade-offs: signal-based
methods like MRIQC provide quantitative metrics but lack semantic
understanding, while deep learning approaches achieve high accuracy but
sacrifice interpretability. To address these limitations, we introduce the
Multimodal MRI Quality Assessment (MMRQA) framework, pioneering the integration
of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with acquisition-aware signal
processing. MMRQA combines three key innovations: robust metric extraction via
MRQy augmented with simulated artifacts, structured transformation of metrics
into question-answer pairs using Qwen, and parameter-efficient fusion through
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) of LLaVA-OneVision. Evaluated on MR-ART, FastMRI,
and MyConnectome benchmarks, MMRQA achieves state-of-the-art performance with
strong zero-shot generalization, as validated by comprehensive ablation
studies. By bridging quantitative analysis with semantic reasoning, our
framework generates clinically interpretable outputs that enhance quality
control in dynamic medical settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能农业中精确的动物计数至关重要，但在密集场景中由于遮挡和有限相机视角而难以实现。

Method: 利用几何投影和三平面融合，将多相机特征整合到统一地面平面，提取单视角特征并通过空间变换对齐，解码场景级密度图进行精确计数。

Result: TP-MVCC显著优于单视角和传统融合方法，在密集遮挡场景中达到95.1%的准确率，并展现出强大的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法在智能农业中具有实际应用潜力，能够有效解决密集遮挡场景下的动物计数问题。

Abstract: Accurate animal counting is essential for smart farming but remains difficult
in crowded scenes due to occlusions and limited camera views. To address this,
we propose a tri-plane-based multi-view chicken counting model (TP-MVCC), which
leverages geometric projection and tri-plane fusion to integrate features from
multiple cameras onto a unified ground plane. The framework extracts
single-view features, aligns them via spatial transformation, and decodes a
scene-level density map for precise chicken counting. In addition, we construct
the first multi-view dataset of silkie chickens under real farming conditions.
Experiments show that TP-MVCC significantly outperforms single-view and
conventional fusion comparisons, achieving 95.1\% accuracy and strong
robustness in dense, occluded scenarios, demonstrating its practical potential
for intelligent agriculture.

*Guolin Ke,Hui Xue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SphereAR提出了一种新的自回归图像生成方法，通过将VAE潜在空间约束在固定半径的超球面上，解决了自回归解码中的方差崩溃问题，在ImageNet生成任务上达到了新的SOTA水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 连续token自回归模型在图像生成中往往落后于潜在扩散和掩码生成模型，主要原因是VAE潜在空间中的异质方差在自回归解码过程中被放大，特别是在分类器无关引导下会导致方差崩溃。

Method: SphereAR将所有自回归输入和输出（包括CFG后）约束在固定半径的超球面上，利用超球面VAE来消除尺度分量，从而稳定自回归解码过程。

Result: 在ImageNet生成任务上，SphereAR-H（943M参数）达到FID 1.34，创造了自回归模型的新记录。较小的SphereAR-L（479M）和SphereAR-B（208M）分别达到FID 1.54和1.92，超越了更大规模的基线模型。

Conclusion: 这是首次纯next-token自回归图像生成器在可比参数规模下超越扩散和掩码生成模型，证明了超球面约束在解决自回归模型方差崩溃问题上的有效性。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models are promising for image generation, yet
continuous-token AR variants often trail latent diffusion and masked-generation
models. The core issue is heterogeneous variance in VAE latents, which is
amplified during AR decoding, especially under classifier-free guidance (CFG),
and can cause variance collapse. We propose SphereAR to address this issue. Its
core design is to constrain all AR inputs and outputs -- including after CFG --
to lie on a fixed-radius hypersphere (constant $\ell_2$ norm), leveraging
hyperspherical VAEs. Our theoretical analysis shows that hyperspherical
constraint removes the scale component (the primary cause of variance
collapse), thereby stabilizing AR decoding. Empirically, on ImageNet
generation, SphereAR-H (943M) sets a new state of the art for AR models,
achieving FID 1.34. Even at smaller scales, SphereAR-L (479M) reaches FID 1.54
and SphereAR-B (208M) reaches 1.92, matching or surpassing much larger
baselines such as MAR-H (943M, 1.55) and VAR-d30 (2B, 1.92). To our knowledge,
this is the first time a pure next-token AR image generator with raster order
surpasses diffusion and masked-generation models at comparable parameter
scales.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有农业视觉问答方法主要针对文本查询或单图像场景，无法处理需要多图像输入和外部农业知识的真实场景，且缺乏系统质量控制。

Method: 采用四角色多智能体框架：检索器获取外部信息，反思器评估充分性并触发重新检索，两个回答器并行生成候选答案以减少偏见，改进器通过迭代检查完善答案并确保多图像信息有效对齐。

Result: 在AgMMU基准测试中，该框架在多图像农业问答任务上取得了有竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: 该自反思多智能体框架能够有效处理农业视觉问答中的多图像输入和知识不完整问题，通过协作机制提升回答质量。

Abstract: Agricultural visual question answering is essential for providing farmers and
researchers with accurate and timely knowledge. However, many existing
approaches are predominantly developed for evidence-constrained settings such
as text-only queries or single-image cases. This design prevents them from
coping with real-world agricultural scenarios that often require multi-image
inputs with complementary views across spatial scales, and growth stages.
Moreover, limited access to up-to-date external agricultural context makes
these systems struggle to adapt when evidence is incomplete. In addition, rigid
pipelines often lack systematic quality control. To address this gap, we
propose a self-reflective and self-improving multi-agent framework that
integrates four roles, the Retriever, the Reflector, the Answerer, and the
Improver. They collaborate to enable context enrichment, reflective reasoning,
answer drafting, and iterative improvement.
  A Retriever formulates queries and gathers external information, while a
Reflector assesses adequacy and triggers sequential reformulation and renewed
retrieval. Two Answerers draft candidate responses in parallel to reduce bias.
The Improver refines them through iterative checks while ensuring that
information from multiple images is effectively aligned and utilized.
Experiments on the AgMMU benchmark show that our framework achieves competitive
performance on multi-image agricultural QA.

TL;DR: NeRV-Diffusion是一种隐式潜在视频扩散模型，通过生成神经网络权重来合成视频，将视频压缩为统一的神经网络表示，实现高效高质量的视频生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视频标记化方法将视频编码为逐帧特征图，而NeRV-Diffusion旨在将视频整体压缩并生成为统一的神经网络，避免去噪器中的时间跨帧注意力，提高视频合成效率和质量。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：1）基于超网络的标记器将原始视频从像素空间编码到神经参数空间；2）隐式扩散变换器对潜在INR权重进行去噪。通过重用瓶颈潜在、重新设计权重分配、上采样连接和输入坐标，实现高斯分布的INR权重。

Result: 在UCF-101和Kinetics-600等真实世界视频基准测试中，NeRV-Diffusion达到了优于先前基于INR模型的视频生成质量，并与最近最先进的非隐式模型性能相当。

Conclusion: NeRV-Diffusion提供了一种高效的视频生成方法，通过将视频表示为神经网络权重，实现了高质量的视频合成和平滑的权重空间插值。

Abstract: We present NeRV-Diffusion, an implicit latent video diffusion model that
synthesizes videos via generating neural network weights. The generated weights
can be rearranged as the parameters of a convolutional neural network, which
forms an implicit neural representation (INR), and decodes into videos with
frame indices as the input. Our framework consists of two stages: 1) A
hypernetworkbased tokenizer that encodes raw videos from pixel space to neural
parameter space, where the bottleneck latent serves as INR weights to decode.
2) An implicit diffusion transformer that denoises on the latent INR weights.
In contrast to traditional video tokenizers that encode videos into frame-wise
feature maps, NeRV-Diffusion compresses and generates a video holistically as a
unified neural network. This enables efficient and high-quality video synthesis
via obviating temporal cross-frame attentions in the denoiser and decoding
video latent with dedicated decoders. To achieve Gaussian-distributed INR
weights with high expressiveness, we reuse the bottleneck latent across all
NeRV layers, as well as reform its weight assignment, upsampling connection and
input coordinates. We also introduce SNR-adaptive loss weighting and scheduled
sampling for effective training of the implicit diffusion model. NeRV-Diffusion
reaches superior video generation quality over previous INR-based models and
comparable performance to most recent state-of-the-art non-implicit models on
real-world video benchmarks including UCF-101 and Kinetics-600. It also brings
a smooth INR weight space that facilitates seamless interpolations between
frames or videos.

Result: 在七个复杂多样的数据集上超越了现有分割方法，表现出卓越性能。

Conclusion: LamFormer在模型性能和复杂度之间取得了良好平衡，有效解决了Transformer在医学图像分割中的计算效率和局部细节提取问题。

Abstract: In the field of multi-organ medical image segmentation, recent methods
frequently employ Transformers to capture long-range dependencies from image
features. However, these methods overlook the high computational cost of
Transformers and their deficiencies in extracting local detailed information.
To address high computational costs and inadequate local detail information, we
reassess the design of feature extraction modules and propose a new
deep-learning network called LamFormer for fine-grained segmentation tasks
across multiple organs. LamFormer is a novel U-shaped network that employs
Linear Attention Mamba (LAM) in an enhanced pyramid encoder to capture
multi-scale long-range dependencies. We construct the Parallel Hierarchical
Feature Aggregation (PHFA) module to aggregate features from different layers
of the encoder, narrowing the semantic gap among features while filtering
information. Finally, we design the Reduced Transformer (RT), which utilizes a
distinct computational approach to globally model up-sampled features. RRT
enhances the extraction of detailed local information and improves the
network's capability to capture long-range dependencies. LamFormer outperforms
existing segmentation methods on seven complex and diverse datasets,
demonstrating exceptional performance. Moreover, the proposed network achieves
a balance between model performance and model complexity.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络对对抗样本高度脆弱，现有防御在梯度可估计时容易失效，梯度共识是导致对抗迁移性的关键因素

Method: 使用随机可学习滤波器集合，通过最大化Jacobian和logit空间响应的分歧来强制梯度不协调，同时保持自然预测

Result: 在ImageNet上显著提升CNN和Vision Transformer的鲁棒性，优于现有预处理、对抗训练和基于扩散的防御方法

Conclusion: 梯度分歧是对抗防御的实用且可泛化原则，DRIFT以可忽略的运行时间和内存成本实现鲁棒性提升

Abstract: Deep neural networks remain highly vulnerable to adversarial examples, and
most defenses collapse once gradients can be reliably estimated. We identify
\emph{gradient consensus} -- the tendency of randomized transformations to
yield aligned gradients -- as a key driver of adversarial transferability.
Attackers exploit this consensus to construct perturbations that remain
effective across transformations. We introduce \textbf{DRIFT} (Divergent
Response in Filtered Transformations), a stochastic ensemble of lightweight,
learnable filters trained to actively disrupt gradient consensus. Unlike prior
randomized defenses that rely on gradient masking, DRIFT enforces
\emph{gradient dissonance} by maximizing divergence in Jacobian- and
logit-space responses while preserving natural predictions. Our contributions
are threefold: (i) we formalize gradient consensus and provide a theoretical
analysis linking consensus to transferability; (ii) we propose a
consensus-divergence training strategy combining prediction consistency,
Jacobian separation, logit-space separation, and adversarial robustness; and
(iii) we show that DRIFT achieves substantial robustness gains on ImageNet
across CNNs and Vision Transformers, outperforming state-of-the-art
preprocessing, adversarial training, and diffusion-based defenses under
adaptive white-box, transfer-based, and gradient-free attacks. DRIFT delivers
these improvements with negligible runtime and memory cost, establishing
gradient divergence as a practical and generalizable principle for adversarial
defense.

Method: 构建包含视觉问答、报告生成和图像对选择三个任务的测试集，评估了6个专有和6个开源LVLM，并探索了多模态检索增强方法。

Result: 大多数LVLM缺乏分析时序医学图像中患者状况变化的能力，在闭卷设置下表现接近随机猜测水平。GPT o3、o4-mini和Claude 3.5 Sonnet表现相对较好但仍有不足。多模态检索增强比无检索和仅文本检索带来显著性能提升，VQA任务平均提升2.59%。

Conclusion: 该基准揭示了LVLM在时序医学图像推理方面的局限性，并表明多模态检索增强是解决这一挑战的有前景方向。

Abstract: Existing medical reasoning benchmarks for vision-language models primarily
focus on analyzing a patient's condition based on an image from a single visit.
However, this setting deviates significantly from real-world clinical practice,
where doctors typically refer to a patient's historical conditions to provide a
comprehensive assessment by tracking their changes over time. In this paper, we
introduce TemMed-Bench, the first benchmark designed for analyzing changes in
patients' conditions between different clinical visits, which challenges large
vision-language models (LVLMs) to reason over temporal medical images.
TemMed-Bench consists of a test set comprising three tasks - visual
question-answering (VQA), report generation, and image-pair selection - and a
supplementary knowledge corpus of over 17,000 instances. With TemMed-Bench, we
conduct an evaluation of six proprietary and six open-source LVLMs. Our results
show that most LVLMs lack the ability to analyze patients' condition changes
over temporal medical images, and a large proportion perform only at a
random-guessing level in the closed-book setting. In contrast, GPT o3, o4-mini
and Claude 3.5 Sonnet demonstrate comparatively decent performance, though they
have yet to reach the desired level. Furthermore, we explore augmenting the
input with both retrieved visual and textual modalities in the medical domain.
We also show that multi-modal retrieval augmentation yields notably higher
performance gains than no retrieval and textual retrieval alone across most
models on our benchmark, with the VQA task showing an average improvement of
2.59%. Overall, we compose a benchmark grounded on real-world clinical
practice, and it reveals LVLMs' limitations in temporal medical image
reasoning, as well as highlighting the use of multi-modal retrieval
augmentation as a potentially promising direction worth exploring to address
this challenge.

TL;DR: UI-UG是一个统一的多模态大语言模型，集成了UI理解和生成能力，在特定领域任务中表现出色，达到了最先进的性能水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管多模态大语言模型已在多个领域应用，但在用户界面等特定领域任务中仍面临理解准确性和生成质量的挑战。

Method: 采用监督微调结合组相对策略优化来增强细粒度理解，使用直接偏好优化来生成人类偏好的UI，并提出包含领域特定语言设计、训练策略、渲染过程和评估指标的工业有效工作流程。

Result: 在理解任务上达到最先进性能，超越更大的通用多模态大模型和相似规模的UI专用模型；在生成性能上与这些更大的模型相当，但计算成本显著降低。

Conclusion: 集成理解和生成任务可以同时提高两个任务的准确性和质量。

Abstract: Although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have been widely applied
across domains, they are still facing challenges in domain-specific tasks, such
as User Interface (UI) understanding accuracy and UI generation quality. In
this paper, we introduce UI-UG (a unified MLLM for UI Understanding and
Generation), integrating both capabilities. For understanding tasks, we employ
Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) combined with Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) to enhance fine-grained understanding on the modern complex UI data. For
generation tasks, we further use Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to make
our model generate human-preferred UIs. In addition, we propose an industrially
effective workflow, including the design of an LLM-friendly domain-specific
language (DSL), training strategies, rendering processes, and evaluation
metrics. In experiments, our model achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance
on understanding tasks, outperforming both larger general-purpose MLLMs and
similarly-sized UI-specialized models. Our model is also on par with these
larger MLLMs in UI generation performance at a fraction of the computational
cost. We also demonstrate that integrating understanding and generation tasks
can improve accuracy and quality for both tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GSM8K-V是一个纯视觉多图像数学推理基准，通过将文本数学问题转化为视觉形式来评估视觉语言模型的数学推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉数学推理基准主要局限于几何问题，缺乏数学文字问题的覆盖，且很少评估多图像推理。为了填补这些空白，需要创建一个更全面的视觉数学推理基准。

Method: 通过精心设计的自动化图像生成流程结合人工标注，将广泛使用的文本基准GSM8K系统性地映射为视觉形式，构建了1,319个高质量样本。

Result: 评估显示，现有视觉语言模型在文本GSM8K上接近饱和（95.22%准确率），但在GSM8K-V上表现显著下降（仅46.93%），表明视觉数学推理仍有很大改进空间。

Conclusion: GSM8K-V为视觉数学推理提供了新视角，建立了指导开发更鲁棒和可泛化视觉语言模型的基准。

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) achieve unified modeling of images and text,
enabling them to accomplish complex real-world tasks through perception,
planning, and reasoning. Among these tasks, reasoning is particularly
representative, with mathematical reasoning serving as a prominent example. It
highlights the high-level capability of VLMs to comprehend mathematical
information in images and to perform sophisticated reasoning. Recently,
numerous visual mathematical reasoning benchmarks have been proposed, but they
are often restricted to geometry, lack coverage of math word problems, and
rarely assess reasoning across multiple images. To address these gaps, we
introduce GSM8K-V, a purely visual multi-image mathematical reasoning
benchmark. GSM8K-V is built by systematically mapping each sample from the
widely used text-based GSM8K into visual form. Through a carefully designed
automated image-generation pipeline combined with meticulous human annotation,
we curate 1,319 high-quality samples. We evaluate a wide range of open-source
and closed-source models on GSM8K-V. Results show that although existing VLMs
have nearly saturated performance on text-based GSM8K, there remains
substantial room for improvement on GSM8K-V. For example, the best-performing
model, Gemini-2.5-Pro, achieves 95.22% accuracy on GSM8K but only 46.93% on
GSM8K-V. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of GSM8K-V, examining the
limitations of current models as well as potential directions for improvement.
GSM8K-V offers a new perspective on visual mathematical reasoning and
establishes a benchmark to guide the development of more robust and
generalizable VLMs.

*Jitai Hao,Hao Liu,Xinyan Xiao,Qiang Huang,Jun Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Uni-X提出了一种两端分离、中间共享的X形架构，解决了统一多模态模型中视觉和文本梯度冲突的问题，在3B参数规模下达到了与7B模型相当的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于自回归变换器的统一多模态模型存在严重的梯度冲突问题，特别是在浅层和深层，这源于图像和文本在低层统计特性上的根本差异。

Method: Uni-X采用两端分离、中间共享的X形架构：初始和最终层用于模态特定处理，中间层共享参数进行高级语义融合，有效消除梯度冲突。

Result: 在相同训练条件下，Uni-X实现了更优的训练效率。3B参数的Uni-X匹配或超越了7B自回归统一多模态模型，在图像生成任务上获得82的GenEval分数，同时在文本和视觉理解任务上表现强劲。

Conclusion: Uni-X为未来统一多模态建模提供了一个参数高效且可扩展的基础架构，有效解决了多模态训练中的梯度冲突问题。

Abstract: Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) built on shared autoregressive (AR)
transformers are attractive for their architectural simplicity. However, we
identify a critical limitation: when trained on multimodal inputs,
modality-shared transformers suffer from severe gradient conflicts between
vision and text, particularly in shallow and deep layers. We trace this issue
to the fundamentally different low-level statistical properties of images and
text, while noting that conflicts diminish in middle layers where
representations become more abstract and semantically aligned. To overcome this
challenge, we propose Uni-X, a two-end-separated, middle-shared architecture.
Uni-X dedicates its initial and final layers to modality-specific processing,
while maintaining shared parameters in the middle layers for high-level
semantic fusion. This X-shaped design not only eliminates gradient conflicts at
both ends but also further alleviates residual conflicts in the shared layers.
Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of Uni-X. Under identical
training conditions, Uni-X achieves superior training efficiency compared to
strong baselines. When scaled to 3B parameters with larger training data, Uni-X
matches or surpasses 7B AR-based UMMs, achieving a GenEval score of 82 for
image generation alongside strong performance in text and vision understanding
tasks. These results establish Uni-X as a parameter-efficient and scalable
foundation for future unified multimodal modeling. Our code is available at

*Jinhee Park,Guisik Kim,Choongsang Cho,Junseok Kwon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出R²M框架，通过模型融合解决深度伪造检测问题，无需重新训练即可适应新伪造方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度伪造生成器快速进化，使得数据收集和重复训练不切实际。模型融合天然适合深度伪造检测，因为各专家模型共享相同的二元决策，仅在生成器特定伪影上有所不同

Method: 提出Real-aware Residual Model Merging (R²M)：通过任务向量的低秩分解估计共享的Real组件，将每个专家分解为Real对齐部分和Fake残差，使用层级秩截断对残差去噪，并通过每任务范数匹配进行聚合

Result: 在分布内、跨数据集和未见数据集上，R²M优于联合训练和其他融合基线方法。R²M具有可组合性，当新伪造家族出现时，只需微调一个专家并重新融合

Conclusion: R²M提供了一种训练自由的参数空间融合框架，能够有效解决深度伪造检测中的模型适应性问题，无需重新训练即可适应新出现的伪造技术

Abstract: Deepfake generators evolve quickly, making exhaustive data collection and
repeated retraining impractical. We argue that model merging is a natural fit
for deepfake detection: unlike generic multi-task settings with disjoint
labels, deepfake specialists share the same binary decision and differ in
generator-specific artifacts. Empirically, we show that simple weight averaging
preserves Real representations while attenuating Fake-specific cues. Building
upon these findings, we propose Real-aware Residual Model Merging (R$^2$M), a
training-free parameter-space merging framework. R$^2$M estimates a shared Real
component via a low-rank factorization of task vectors, decomposes each
specialist into a Real-aligned part and a Fake residual, denoises residuals
with layerwise rank truncation, and aggregates them with per-task norm matching
to prevent any single generator from dominating. A concise rationale explains
why a simple head suffices: the Real component induces a common separation
direction in feature space, while truncated residuals contribute only minor
off-axis variations. Across in-distribution, cross-dataset, and unseen-dataset,
R$^2$M outperforms joint training and other merging baselines. Importantly,
R$^2$M is also composable: when a new forgery family appears, we fine-tune one
specialist and re-merge, eliminating the need for retraining.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合扩散模型和条件GAN的混合框架，从卫星图像生成地理一致的街景图像，在CVUSA数据集上表现优于纯扩散方法，与最先进的GAN方法竞争。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 街景图像是地理空间数据收集和城市分析的重要来源，但从卫星图像合成街景图像面临外观和视角差异的挑战。

Method: 采用多阶段训练策略，将Stable Diffusion作为双分支架构的核心组件，集成条件GAN生成地理一致的全景街景，并通过融合策略结合两种模型的优势。

Result: 在CVUSA数据集上的实验表明，该混合方法在多个评估指标上优于纯扩散方法，与最先进的GAN方法竞争，能生成真实且几何一致的街景图像。

Conclusion: 该混合框架成功生成了保持细粒度局部细节的现实街景图像，证明了扩散模型和GAN结合在跨视图图像合成中的有效性。

Abstract: Street view imagery has become an essential source for geospatial data
collection and urban analytics, enabling the extraction of valuable insights
that support informed decision-making. However, synthesizing street-view images
from corresponding satellite imagery presents significant challenges due to
substantial differences in appearance and viewing perspective between these two
domains. This paper presents a hybrid framework that integrates diffusion-based
models and conditional generative adversarial networks to generate
geographically consistent street-view images from satellite imagery. Our
approach uses a multi-stage training strategy that incorporates Stable
Diffusion as the core component within a dual-branch architecture. To enhance
the framework's capabilities, we integrate a conditional Generative Adversarial
Network (GAN) that enables the generation of geographically consistent
panoramic street views. Furthermore, we implement a fusion strategy that
leverages the strengths of both models to create robust representations,
thereby improving the geometric consistency and visual quality of the generated
street-view images. The proposed framework is evaluated on the challenging
Cross-View USA (CVUSA) dataset, a standard benchmark for cross-view image
synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate that our hybrid approach
outperforms diffusion-only methods across multiple evaluation metrics and
achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art GAN-based
methods. The framework successfully generates realistic and geometrically
consistent street-view images while preserving fine-grained local details,
including street markings, secondary roads, and atmospheric elements such as
clouds.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖几何信息，未能充分利用RGB-D数据中的丰富纹理和语义信息，且特征融合方式存在信息损失。

Method: 使用DINOv2提取图像视觉特征，在patch级别融合视觉和几何特征，并提出混合位置编码来同时编码图像空间和点云空间的位置信息。

Result: 在RGBD-3DMatch和RGBD-3DLoMatch数据集上，patch内点率提升14.2%，配准召回率提升15.7%。

Conclusion: DINOReg通过有效融合视觉和几何信息，显著提升了点云配准性能，证明了多模态信息融合的重要性。

Abstract: Point cloud registration is a fundamental task in 3D computer vision. Most
existing methods rely solely on geometric information for feature extraction
and matching. Recently, several studies have incorporated color information
from RGB-D data into feature extraction. Although these methods achieve
remarkable improvements, they have not fully exploited the abundant texture and
semantic information in images, and the feature fusion is performed in an
image-lossy manner, which limit their performance. In this paper, we propose
DINOReg, a registration network that sufficiently utilizes both visual and
geometric information to solve the point cloud registration problem. Inspired
by advances in vision foundation models, we employ DINOv2 to extract
informative visual features from images, and fuse visual and geometric features
at the patch level. This design effectively combines the rich texture and
global semantic information extracted by DINOv2 with the detailed geometric
structure information captured by the geometric backbone. Additionally, a mixed
positional embedding is proposed to encode positional information from both
image space and point cloud space, which enhances the model's ability to
perceive spatial relationships between patches. Extensive experiments on the
RGBD-3DMatch and RGBD-3DLoMatch datasets demonstrate that our method achieves
significant improvements over state-of-the-art geometry-only and multi-modal
registration methods, with a 14.2% increase in patch inlier ratio and a 15.7%
increase in registration recall. The code is publicly available at

TL;DR: 提出了MCAE（掩码聚类标注引擎），通过将语义一致的掩码组作为最小标注单元，实现了亚米级遥感影像的高效标注，构建了包含140亿像素的HiCity-LC数据集，支持生成准确率超过85%的城市级土地覆盖图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 亚米级遥感影像虽然提供了丰富的细节信息，但由于缺乏高质量标注数据集，其在大规模土地覆盖制图方面的潜力未能充分发挥。现有标注方法要么不可靠，要么成本过高。

Method: 基于空间自相关原理，将语义一致的掩码组作为最小标注单元，实现多个实例的同时标注。MCAE通过掩码聚类方法显著提高了标注效率。

Result: MCAE将标注效率提高了1-2个数量级，同时保持了标签质量、语义多样性和空间代表性。构建的HiCity-LC数据集包含约140亿标注像素，在五个主要中国城市生成的土地覆盖图分类准确率超过85%。

Conclusion: MCAE展示了在大规模亚米级制图方面的可扩展性和实用性，创建了首个公开可用的亚米级城市级土地覆盖基准数据集。

Abstract: Recent advances in remote sensing technology have made submeter resolution
imagery increasingly accessible, offering remarkable detail for fine-grained
land cover analysis. However, its full potential remains underutilized -
particularly for large-scale land cover mapping - due to the lack of
sufficient, high-quality annotated datasets. Existing labels are typically
derived from pre-existing products or manual annotation, which are often
unreliable or prohibitively expensive, particularly given the rich visual
detail and massive data volumes of submeter imagery. Inspired by the spatial
autocorrelation principle, which suggests that objects of the same class tend
to co-occur with similar visual features in local neighborhoods, we propose the
Mask Clustering-based Annotation Engine (MCAE), which treats semantically
consistent mask groups as the minimal annotating units to enable efficient,
simultaneous annotation of multiple instances. It significantly improves
annotation efficiency by one to two orders of magnitude, while preserving label
quality, semantic diversity, and spatial representativeness. With MCAE, we
build a high-quality annotated dataset of about 14 billion labeled pixels,
referred to as HiCity-LC, which supports the generation of city-scale land
cover maps across five major Chinese cities with classification accuracies
above 85%. It is the first publicly available submeter resolution city-level
land cover benchmark, highlighting the scalability and practical utility of
MCAE for large-scale, submeter resolution mapping. The dataset is available at

TL;DR: REALIGN是一个基于正则化融合部分Gromov-Wasserstein最优传输的自监督框架，用于处理程序视频学习中的背景片段、重复动作和非单调步骤顺序问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界的教学视频包含背景片段、重复动作和乱序步骤，这违反了传统对齐方法的强单调性假设。现有方法如OPEL仅依赖特征相似性，无法捕捉任务的高阶时间结构。

Method: 使用正则化融合部分Gromov-Wasserstein最优传输(R-FPGWOT)，联合建模视觉对应关系和时间关系，结合序列间对比学习来稳定训练。

Result: 在EgoProceL、ProceL和CrossTask基准测试中，REALIGN实现了高达18.9%的平均F1分数提升和超过30%的时间IoU增益，并产生更可解释的传输映射。

Conclusion: REALIGN能够有效处理教学视频中的噪声和乱序问题，在程序学习任务上取得了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: Learning from procedural videos remains a core challenge in self-supervised
representation learning, as real-world instructional data often contains
background segments, repeated actions, and steps presented out of order. Such
variability violates the strong monotonicity assumptions underlying many
alignment methods. Prior state-of-the-art approaches, such as OPEL, leverage
Kantorovich Optimal Transport (KOT) to build frame-to-frame correspondences,
but rely solely on feature similarity and fail to capture the higher-order
temporal structure of a task. In this paper, we introduce REALIGN, a
self-supervised framework for procedure learning based on Regularized Fused
Partial Gromov-Wasserstein Optimal Transport (R-FPGWOT). In contrast to KOT,
our formulation jointly models visual correspondences and temporal relations
under a partial alignment scheme, enabling robust handling of irrelevant
frames, repeated actions, and non-monotonic step orders common in instructional
videos. To stabilize training, we integrate FPGWOT distances with
inter-sequence contrastive learning, avoiding the need for multiple
regularizers and preventing collapse to degenerate solutions. Across egocentric
(EgoProceL) and third-person (ProceL, CrossTask) benchmarks, REALIGN achieves
up to 18.9% average F1-score improvements and over 30% temporal IoU gains,
while producing more interpretable transport maps that preserve key-step
orderings and filter out noise.

Motivation: 现有的3D多模态大语言模型依赖3D数据输入，限制了可扩展性和泛化能力。需要开发不依赖外部3D数据的解决方案。

Result: 在3D问答、3D密集描述和3D视觉定位等多个基准测试中验证了方法的有效性，展示了优越的多任务能力。

Conclusion: Vid-LLM通过视频输入实现了高效的3D场景理解，无需外部3D数据，具有更好的实用性和部署可行性。

Abstract: Recent developments in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have
significantly improved Vision-Language (VL) reasoning in 2D domains. However,
extending these capabilities to 3D scene understanding remains a major
challenge. Existing 3D Multimodal Large Language Models (3D-MLLMs) often depend
on 3D data inputs, which limits scalability and generalization. To address this
limitation, we propose Vid-LLM, a video-based 3D-MLLM that directly processes
video inputs without requiring external 3D data, making it practical for
real-world deployment. In our method, the geometric prior are directly used to
improve the performance of the sceen perception. To integrate the geometric
cues into the MLLM compactly, we design a Cross-Task Adapter (CTA) module to
align the 3D geometric priors with the vision-language representations. To
ensure geometric consistency and integrity, we introduce a Metric Depth Model
that recovers real-scale geometry from the reconstruction outputs. Finally, the
model is fine-tuned with a two-stage distillation optimization strategy,
realizing fast convergence and stabilizes training. Extensive experiments
across diverse benchmarks verified the effectiveness of our method on 3D
Question Answering, 3D Dense Captioning and 3D Visual Grounding tasks,
demonstrating the superior multi-task capabilities.

Conclusion: PCICF框架能有效识别复杂行人穿越情境，其计算高效组件有潜力用于车载操作域检测。

Abstract: We have recently observed the commercial roll-out of robotaxis in various
countries. They are deployed within an operational design domain (ODD) on
specific routes and environmental conditions, and are subject to continuous
monitoring to regain control in safety-critical situations. Since ODDs
typically cover urban areas, robotaxis must reliably detect vulnerable road
users (VRUs) such as pedestrians, bicyclists, or e-scooter riders. To better
handle such varied traffic situations, end-to-end AI, which directly compute
vehicle control actions from multi-modal sensor data instead of only for
perception, is on the rise. High quality data is needed for systematically
training and evaluating such systems within their OOD. In this work, we propose
PCICF, a framework to systematically identify and classify VRU situations to
support ODD's incident analysis. We base our work on the existing synthetic
dataset SMIRK, and enhance it by extending its single-pedestrian-only design
into the MoreSMIRK dataset, a structured dictionary of multi-pedestrian
crossing situations constructed systematically. We then use space-filling
curves (SFCs) to transform multi-dimensional features of scenarios into
characteristic patterns, which we match with corresponding entries in
MoreSMIRK. We evaluate PCICF with the large real-world dataset PIE, which
contains more than 150 manually annotated pedestrian crossing videos. We show
that PCICF can successfully identify and classify complex pedestrian crossings,
even when groups of pedestrians merge or split. By leveraging computationally
efficient components like SFCs, PCICF has even potential to be used onboard of
robotaxis for OOD detection for example. We share an open-source replication
package for PCICF containing its algorithms, the complete MoreSMIRK dataset and
dictionary, as well as our experiment results presented in:

bridge to generating synthetic 3D assets. In this work, we introduce RapidMV, a
novel text-to-multi-view generative model that can produce 32 multi-view

spatio-angular latent space, encoding both the spatial appearance and angular
viewpoint deviations into a single latent for improved efficiency and
multi-view consistency. We achieve effective training of RapidMV by
strategically decomposing our training process into multiple steps. We
demonstrate that RapidMV outperforms existing methods in terms of consistency
and latency, with competitive quality and text-image alignment.

TL;DR: CLQ是一种针对扩散变换器(DiTs)的跨层引导正交量化方法，通过交叉块校准、正交平滑和跨层参数搜索三个关键技术，在W4A4量化下实现3.98倍内存节省和3.95倍加速，同时保持视觉质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散变换器模型规模和复杂性的增加虽然提升了视觉生成质量，但也阻碍了在边缘设备上的实际部署。模型后训练量化可以减少内存消耗和加速推理，但会带来性能下降。

Method: 1. 交叉块校准(CBC)：获取准确的校准数据指导量化；2. 正交平滑(OBS)：量化每个通道的异常值分数，利用块Hadamard矩阵平滑异常值；3. 跨层参数搜索(CLPS)：搜索最优参数。

Result: 在图像生成和视频生成模型上评估，成功将模型压缩到W4A4，视觉质量和指标仅有可忽略的下降，实现3.98倍内存节省和3.95倍加速。

Conclusion: CLQ方法有效解决了扩散变换器量化中的性能下降问题，为边缘设备部署提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Visual generation quality has been greatly promoted with the rapid advances
in diffusion transformers (DiTs), which is attributed to the scaling of model
size and complexity. However, these attributions also hinder the practical
deployment of DiTs on edge devices, limiting their development and application.
Serve as an efficient model compression technique, model post-training
quantization (PTQ) can reduce the memory consumption and speed up the
inference, with inevitable performance degradation. To alleviate the
degradation, we propose CLQ, a cross-layer guided orthogonal-based quantization
method for DiTs. To be specific, CLQ consists of three key designs. First, we
observe that the calibration data used by most of the PTQ methods can not
honestly represent the distribution of the activations. Therefore, we propose
cross-block calibration (CBC) to obtain accurate calibration data, with which
the quantization can be better guided. Second, we propose orthogonal-based
smoothing (OBS), which quantifies the outlier score of each channel and
leverages block Hadamard matrix to smooth the outliers with negligible
overhead. Third, we propose cross-layer parameter searching (CLPS) to search.
We evaluate CLQ with both image generation and video generation models and
successfully compress the model into W4A4 with negligible degradation in visual
quality and metrics. CLQ achieves 3.98x memory saving and 3.95x speedup. Our
code is available at

### [260] [A Data-Centric Perspective on the Influence of Image Data Quality in Machine Learning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24420)
*Pei-Han Chen,Szu-Chi Chung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究开发了一个系统化的图像数据集质量评估流程，结合CleanVision和Fastdup工具并引入自动阈值选择，显著提升了低质量图像检测和去重性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着模型架构成熟，数据质量成为关键因素，但图像领域缺乏系统性的数据集质量评估研究。

Method: 使用CIFAKE数据集分析常见质量问题，结合CleanVision和Fastdup工具开发质量评估流程，引入自动阈值选择方法。

Result: 自动阈值方法在单扰动下将F1分数从0.6794提升至0.9468，双扰动下从0.7447提升至0.8557，去重策略将F1分数从0.4576提升至0.7928。

Conclusion: 卷积神经网络对模糊和严重降级等关键特征遮挡的退化特别敏感，提出的工作流程为图像机器学习中的数据质量评估提供了有效基础。

Abstract: In machine learning, research has traditionally focused on model development,
with relatively less attention paid to training data. As model architectures
have matured and marginal gains from further refinements diminish, data quality
has emerged as a critical factor. However, systematic studies on evaluating and
ensuring dataset quality in the image domain remain limited.
  This study investigates methods for systematically assessing image dataset
quality and examines how various image quality factors influence model
performance. Using the publicly available and relatively clean CIFAKE dataset,
we identify common quality issues and quantify their impact on training.
Building on these findings, we develop a pipeline that integrates two
community-developed tools, CleanVision and Fastdup. We analyze their underlying
mechanisms and introduce several enhancements, including automatic threshold
selection to detect problematic images without manual tuning.
  Experimental results demonstrate that not all quality issues exert the same
level of impact. While convolutional neural networks show resilience to certain
distortions, they are particularly vulnerable to degradations that obscure
critical visual features, such as blurring and severe downscaling. To assess
the performance of existing tools and the effectiveness of our proposed
enhancements, we formulate the detection of low-quality images as a binary
classification task and use the F1 score as the evaluation metric. Our
automatic thresholding method improves the F1 score from 0.6794 to 0.9468 under
single perturbations and from 0.7447 to 0.8557 under dual perturbations. For
near-duplicate detection, our deduplication strategy increases the F1 score
from 0.4576 to 0.7928. These results underscore the effectiveness of our
workflow and provide a foundation for advancing data quality assessment in
image-based machine learning.

TL;DR: Proxy-GS通过引入代理系统实现高斯遮挡感知，在保持渲染质量的同时显著提升渲染速度，特别是在遮挡严重的场景中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D高斯泼溅方法虽然高效，但MLP变体引入大量解码开销，且现有剪枝和LOD技术因缺乏遮挡感知而存在显著冗余。

Method: 提出Proxy-GS管道，使用快速代理系统在1ms内生成1000x1000分辨率的高精度遮挡深度图，指导锚点和高斯剔除以及训练过程中的致密化。

Result: 在MatrixCity Streets等遮挡严重场景中，Proxy-GS不仅增强了MLP基高斯泼溅的渲染能力，还实现了超过Octree-GS 2.5倍的加速，并持续提供更高的渲染质量。

Conclusion: Proxy-GS通过遮挡感知有效解决了3D高斯泼溅中的冗余问题，在保持高质量渲染的同时显著提升了效率。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as an efficient approach for
achieving photorealistic rendering. Recent MLP-based variants further improve
visual fidelity but introduce substantial decoding overhead during rendering.
To alleviate computation cost, several pruning strategies and level-of-detail
(LOD) techniques have been introduced, aiming to effectively reduce the number
of Gaussian primitives in large-scale scenes. However, our analysis reveals
that significant redundancy still remains due to the lack of occlusion
awareness. In this work, we propose Proxy-GS, a novel pipeline that exploits a
proxy to introduce Gaussian occlusion awareness from any view. At the core of
our approach is a fast proxy system capable of producing precise occlusion
depth maps at a resolution of 1000x1000 under 1ms. This proxy serves two roles:
first, it guides the culling of anchors and Gaussians to accelerate rendering
speed. Second, it guides the densification towards surfaces during training,
avoiding inconsistencies in occluded regions, and improving the rendering
quality. In heavily occluded scenarios, such as the MatrixCity Streets dataset,
Proxy-GS not only equips MLP-based Gaussian splatting with stronger rendering
capability but also achieves faster rendering speed. Specifically, it achieves
more than 2.5x speedup over Octree-GS, and consistently delivers substantially
higher rendering quality. Code will be public upon acceptance.

TL;DR: DCFlow是一个新颖的无监督跨模态光流估计框架，通过解耦优化策略和跨模态一致性约束来解决模态差异和几何不对齐问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅从外观相似性隐式学习光流估计，无法有效处理跨模态场景中的模态差异和几何不对齐问题。

Method: 采用解耦优化策略，协同训练模态转换网络和光流估计网络；提出几何感知数据合成流程和异常鲁棒损失；引入跨模态一致性约束联合优化两个网络。

Result: DCFlow可与多种光流估计网络集成，在无监督方法中达到最先进性能。构建了全面的跨模态光流基准数据集。

Conclusion: DCFlow通过解耦优化和跨模态一致性约束有效解决了跨模态光流估计中的关键挑战，在无监督方法中表现优异。

Abstract: This work presents DCFlow, a novel unsupervised cross-modal flow estimation
framework that integrates a decoupled optimization strategy and a cross-modal
consistency constraint. Unlike previous approaches that implicitly learn flow
estimation solely from appearance similarity, we introduce a decoupled
optimization strategy with task-specific supervision to address modality
discrepancy and geometric misalignment distinctly. This is achieved by
collaboratively training a modality transfer network and a flow estimation
network. To enable reliable motion supervision without ground-truth flow, we
propose a geometry-aware data synthesis pipeline combined with an
outlier-robust loss. Additionally, we introduce a cross-modal consistency
constraint to jointly optimize both networks, significantly improving flow
prediction accuracy. For evaluation, we construct a comprehensive cross-modal
flow benchmark by repurposing public datasets. Experimental results demonstrate
that DCFlow can be integrated with various flow estimation networks and
achieves state-of-the-art performance among unsupervised approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了UI2V-Bench基准测试，专注于评估图像到视频生成模型的语义理解和推理能力，填补现有评估只关注视频质量和时序一致性的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像到视频生成评估主要关注视频质量和时序一致性，但忽视了模型对输入图像中特定主题语义的理解能力，以及生成视频是否符合物理规律和人类常识。

Method: 设计了四个主要评估维度：空间理解、属性绑定、类别理解和推理。基于多模态大语言模型开发了两种评估方法：实例级细粒度语义理解流水线和基于反馈的推理流水线。包含约500个精心构建的文本-图像对。

Result: 评估了开源和闭源的图像到视频模型，发现人类评估与提出的基于MLLM的指标高度一致。

Conclusion: UI2V-Bench填补了图像到视频评估在语义理解和推理能力方面的关键空白，为该领域未来研究和模型开发提供了稳健的框架和数据集。

Abstract: Generative diffusion models are developing rapidly and attracting increasing
attention due to their wide range of applications. Image-to-Video (I2V)
generation has become a major focus in the field of video synthesis. However,
existing evaluation benchmarks primarily focus on aspects such as video quality
and temporal consistency, while largely overlooking the model's ability to
understand the semantics of specific subjects in the input image or to ensure
that the generated video aligns with physical laws and human commonsense. To
address this gap, we propose UI2V-Bench, a novel benchmark for evaluating I2V
models with a focus on semantic understanding and reasoning. It introduces four
primary evaluation dimensions: spatial understanding, attribute binding,
category understanding, and reasoning. To assess these dimensions, we design
two evaluation methods based on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs): an
instance-level pipeline for fine-grained semantic understanding, and a
feedback-based reasoning pipeline that enables step-by-step causal assessment
for more accurate evaluation. UI2V-Bench includes approximately 500 carefully
constructed text-image pairs and evaluates a range of both open source and
closed-source I2V models across all defined dimensions. We further incorporate
human evaluations, which show strong alignment with the proposed MLLM-based
metrics. Overall, UI2V-Bench fills a critical gap in I2V evaluation by
emphasizing semantic comprehension and reasoning ability, offering a robust
framework and dataset to support future research and model development in the
field.

TL;DR: NeoWorld是一个从单张输入图像生成交互式3D虚拟世界的深度学习框架，采用混合场景结构，在用户探索时动态渲染高真实感的3D环境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受科幻小说《Simulacron-3》按需构建世界概念的启发，旨在创建只在用户主动探索区域渲染高真实感3D表示的交互式虚拟世界。

Method: 采用混合场景结构：对关键前景对象进行完整3D建模，同时将背景和非交互区域合成为2D以保持效率，结合表示学习和对象到3D技术实现灵活视角操作和物理合理的场景动画。

Result: 在WorldScore基准测试中显著优于现有的2D和深度分层2.5D方法，能够提供动态、沉浸式且视觉一致的探索体验。

Conclusion: NeoWorld通过创新的混合3D-2D表示方法，成功实现了从单张图像生成交互式虚拟世界，为用户提供了渐进展开的沉浸式探索体验。

Abstract: We introduce NeoWorld, a deep learning framework for generating interactive
3D virtual worlds from a single input image. Inspired by the on-demand
worldbuilding concept in the science fiction novel Simulacron-3 (1964), our
system constructs expansive environments where only the regions actively
explored by the user are rendered with high visual realism through
object-centric 3D representations. Unlike previous approaches that rely on
global world generation or 2D hallucination, NeoWorld models key foreground
objects in full 3D, while synthesizing backgrounds and non-interacted regions
in 2D to ensure efficiency. This hybrid scene structure, implemented with
cutting-edge representation learning and object-to-3D techniques, enables
flexible viewpoint manipulation and physically plausible scene animation,
allowing users to control object appearance and dynamics using natural language
commands. As users interact with the environment, the virtual world
progressively unfolds with increasing 3D detail, delivering a dynamic,
immersive, and visually coherent exploration experience. NeoWorld significantly
outperforms existing 2D and depth-layered 2.5D methods on the WorldScore
benchmark.

Result: 在8个公开基准测试中取得最优性能，MVTec-AD图像级AUROC达99.7%，CIFAR-10达97.8%，在单类和跨类设置下均优于现有通用和专用模型。

Conclusion: 该方法在多个异常检测领域展现出强大的泛化能力，实现了跨领域的统一异常检测框架。

Abstract: Anomaly detection (AD) plays an important role in various real-world
applications. Recent advancements in AD, however, are often biased towards
industrial inspection, struggle to generalize to broader tasks like semantic
anomaly detection and vice versa. Although recent methods have attempted to
address general anomaly detection, their performance remains sensitive to
dataset-specific settings and single-class tasks. In this paper, we propose a
novel dual-model ensemble approach based on knowledge distillation (KD) to
bridge this gap. Our framework consists of a teacher and two student models: an
Encoder-Decoder model, specialized in detecting patch-level minor defects for
industrial AD and an Encoder-Encoder model, optimized for semantic AD. Both
models leverage a shared pre-trained encoder (DINOv2) to extract high-quality
feature representations. The dual models are jointly learned using the Noisy-OR
objective, and the final anomaly score is obtained using the joint probability
via local and semantic anomaly scores derived from the respective models. We
evaluate our method on eight public benchmarks under both single-class and
multi-class settings: MVTec-AD, MVTec-LOCO, VisA and Real-IAD for industrial
inspection and CIFAR-10/100, FMNIST and View for semantic anomaly detection.
The proposed method achieved state-of-the-art accuracies in both domains, in
multi-class as well as single-class settings, demonstrating generalization
across multiple domains of anomaly detection. Our model achieved an image-level
AUROC of 99.7% on MVTec-AD and 97.8% on CIFAR-10, which is significantly better
than the prior general AD models in multi-class settings and even higher than
the best specialist models on individual benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Laban运动分析的零样本推理优化方法，通过更新预训练扩散模型的文本嵌入来实现对运动Effort和Shape组件的细粒度控制，从而生成多样化的表达性人体运动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于扩散模型的文本到运动生成方法虽然能产生高质量运动，但难以实现细粒度的表达性运动控制，主要原因是数据集缺乏运动风格多样性以及自然语言难以表达定量特征。

Method: 提出零样本推理时优化方法，在采样步骤中更新预训练扩散模型的文本嵌入，引导运动生成模型获得期望的Laban Effort和Shape组件，无需额外运动数据。

Result: 该方法能够成功根据目标Laban标签操纵运动属性，在保持运动身份的同时产生多样化的表达性运动质量。

Conclusion: 通过将Laban Effort和Shape组件的量化方法无缝集成到文本引导的运动生成模型中，实现了可解释且表达性的人体运动生成控制。

Abstract: Diverse human motion generation is an increasingly important task, having
various applications in computer vision, human-computer interaction and
animation. While text-to-motion synthesis using diffusion models has shown
success in generating high-quality motions, achieving fine-grained expressive
motion control remains a significant challenge. This is due to the lack of
motion style diversity in datasets and the difficulty of expressing
quantitative characteristics in natural language. Laban movement analysis has
been widely used by dance experts to express the details of motion including
motion quality as consistent as possible. Inspired by that, this work aims for
interpretable and expressive control of human motion generation by seamlessly
integrating the quantification methods of Laban Effort and Shape components
into the text-guided motion generation models. Our proposed zero-shot,
inference-time optimization method guides the motion generation model to have
desired Laban Effort and Shape components without any additional motion data by
updating the text embedding of pretrained diffusion models during the sampling
step. We demonstrate that our approach yields diverse expressive motion
qualities while preserving motion identity by successfully manipulating motion
attributes according to target Laban tags.

TL;DR: 提出了一种选择性表示框架，可将二手服装图像检索数据库缩小至原始大小的10%而不损失检索精度，通过聚类和核心集选择识别代表性样本，并引入基于邻域一致性评分的异常值去除方法。

Motivation: 时尚产业是废物和排放的主要来源，促进二手市场发展具有重要意义。机器学习方法通过大规模评估二手服装价值来促进二手市场发展，但需要解决二手图像检索的可扩展性问题。

Method: 采用选择性表示框架，结合聚类和核心集选择方法识别代表性样本，引入基于邻域一致性评分的异常值去除方法，在筛选前过滤非特征性样本。

Result: 在DeepFashion Attribute、DeepFashion Con2Shop和DeepFashion2三个公开数据集上的实验表明，该方法在保持接近最优检索精度的同时，显著降低了计算成本，数据库可缩减至原始大小的10%。

Conclusion: 该选择性表示框架通过战略性修剪和选择代表性图像向量，实现了性能与效率的良好平衡，异常值去除方法进一步提升了检索性能。

Abstract: The fashion industry has been identified as a major contributor to waste and
emissions, leading to an increased interest in promoting the second-hand
market. Machine learning methods play an important role in facilitating the
creation and expansion of second-hand marketplaces by enabling the large-scale
valuation of used garments. We contribute to this line of work by addressing
the scalability of second-hand image retrieval from databases. By introducing a
selective representation framework, we can shrink databases to 10% of their
original size without sacrificing retrieval accuracy. We first explore
clustering and coreset selection methods to identify representative samples
that capture the key features of each garment and its internal variability.
Then, we introduce an efficient outlier removal method, based on a
neighbour-homogeneity consistency score measure, that filters out
uncharacteristic samples prior to selection. We evaluate our approach on three
public datasets: DeepFashion Attribute, DeepFashion Con2Shop, and DeepFashion2.
The results demonstrate a clear performance-efficiency trade-off by
strategically pruning and selecting representative vectors of images. The
retrieval system maintains near-optimal accuracy, while greatly reducing
computational costs by reducing the images added to the vector database.
Furthermore, applying our outlier removal method to clustering techniques
yields even higher retrieval performance by removing non-discriminative samples
before the selection.

TL;DR: 提出SCPO框架解决多模态大语言模型的视觉幻觉问题，通过语义课程偏好优化方法，在多个基准测试中将幻觉率降低高达62.9%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型存在严重的视觉幻觉问题，即生成响应与视觉证据相矛盾。现有的直接偏好优化方法难以捕捉细粒度语义差异且容易导致捷径学习

Method: 提出语义课程偏好优化(SCPO)框架，使用基于难度排序的语义课程偏好对数据集，结合动态参考模型和对称双向目标，从文本和视觉偏好中同时学习

Result: 在LLaVA模型的各种规模和版本上验证，SCPO在多个幻觉基准测试中表现优于基线模型，幻觉率降低高达62.9%，同时保持通用能力

Conclusion: SCPO是首个统一语义、对称性和课程学习的多模态大语言模型对齐框架，能有效缓解视觉幻觉问题，提高事实性而不损害通用能力

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly improved the
performance of various tasks, but continue to suffer from visual
hallucinations, a critical issue where generated responses contradict visual
evidence. While Direct Preference Optimization(DPO) is widely used for
alignment, its application to MLLMs often fails to capture fine-grained
semantic differences and encourages shortcut learning. To address these
challenges, we propose Semantic Curriculum Preference Optimization (SCPO), a
novel framework for MLLM alignment. SCPO employs a progressive, easy-to-hard
curriculum built upon our Semantic Curriculum Preference Pairs dataset, which
provides fine-grained semantic contrasts sorted by difficulty. This curriculum
is trained with a dynamic reference model and a novel symmetric, bidirectional
objective to facilitate simultaneous learning from both textual and visual
preferences. To our knowledge, SCPO is the first framework to unify semantics,
symmetry, and curriculum for MLLMs alignment, effectively mitigating visual
hallucinations. Extensive experiments on LLaVA models across various scales and
versions validate that SCPO demonstrates superior performance compared to
baseline models on multiple hallucination benchmarks, reducing the
hallucination rate by up to 62.9%. Moreover, evaluations on generalized
benchmarks show that SCPO improves factuality while preserving general
capabilities, with its performance remaining stable across general
vision-language benchmarks.

Motivation: 现有方法存在模态依赖不平衡问题，当主导模态在真实场景中退化时，整体性能显著下降，模态平衡成为实际多模态分割的关键挑战。

Method: 提出EQUISeg框架，基于四阶段跨模态Transformer块实现模态平衡编码，设计自引导模块通过相互引导机制自适应调整模态贡献。

Result: 在多个数据集上的广泛实验表明，EQUISeg实现了显著的性能提升，有效缓解了分割任务中模态不平衡的不利影响。

Conclusion: EQUISeg通过平衡模态贡献和引入相互引导机制，成功解决了多模态分割中的模态不平衡问题，提升了模型在退化条件下的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Multimodal semantic segmentation enhances model robustness by exploiting
cross-modal complementarities. However, existing methods often suffer from
imbalanced modal dependencies, where overall performance degrades significantly
once a dominant modality deteriorates in real-world scenarios. Thus, modality
balance has become acritical challenge for practical multimodal segmentation.
To address this issue, we propose EQUISeg, a multimodal segmentation framework
that balances modality contributions through equal encoding of modalities.
Built upon a four-stage Cross-modal Transformer Block(CMTB), EQUISeg enables
efficient multimodal fusion and hierarchical selection. Furthermore, we design
a Self-guided Module(SGM) that mitigates modality imbalance by introducing a
mutual guidance mechanism, enabling each modality to adaptively adjust its
contribution and enhance robustness under degraded conditions. Extensive
experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that EQUISeg achieves significant
performance gains and effectively alleviates the adverse effects of modality
imbalance in segmentation tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准CLIP文本编码器在复杂多对象场景中的图像编辑经常失败，无法有效处理对象数量和空间布局约束。

Method: QL-Adapter包含两个核心模块：图像-布局融合模块（ILFM）将布局先验与CLIP图像编码器的ViT补丁标记融合以增强空间结构理解；跨模态增强模块（CMAM）将图像特征注入文本分支以丰富文本嵌入和改进指令跟随。

Result: QL-Adapter在QL-Edit任务上实现了最先进的性能，显著优于现有模型。

Conclusion: QL-Adapter通过布局融合和跨模态增强有效解决了复杂多对象场景中的图像编辑挑战，在数量和布局一致性编辑任务上表现出色。

Abstract: Instruction driven image editing with standard CLIP text encoders often fails
in complex scenes with many objects. We present QL-Adapter, a framework for
multiple object editing that tackles two challenges: enforcing object counts
and spatial layouts, and accommodating diverse categories. QL-Adapter consists
of two core modules: the Image-Layout Fusion Module (ILFM) and the Cross-Modal
Augmentation Module (CMAM). ILFM fuses layout priors with ViT patch tokens from
the CLIP image encoder to strengthen spatial structure understanding. CMAM
injects image features into the text branch to enrich textual embeddings and
improve instruction following. We further build QL-Dataset, a benchmark that
spans broad category, layout, and count variations, and define the task of
quantity and layout consistent image editing (QL-Edit). Extensive experiments
show that QL-Adapter achieves state of the art performance on QL-Edit and
significantly outperforms existing models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Consistency Mid-Training (CMT)方法，在扩散预训练和流映射训练之间插入轻量级中间阶段，显著提升训练稳定性和效率，在多个数据集上实现最先进的少步生成性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有流映射模型（如一致性模型和平均流）虽然能实现少步生成，但训练不稳定、对超参数敏感且成本高昂。即使从预训练扩散模型初始化，仍需将无穷小步转换为长跳映射，稳定性问题仍未解决。

Method: 提出中间训练概念，在扩散预训练和最终流映射训练之间插入轻量级中间阶段CMT。该方法训练模型将预训练模型求解器轨迹上的点直接映射到求解器生成的干净样本，获得轨迹一致且稳定的初始化。

Result: 在CIFAR-10上实现2步FID 1.97，ImageNet 64x64上1.32，ImageNet 512x512上1.84，相比一致性模型减少98%训练数据和GPU时间。在ImageNet 256x256上实现1步FID 3.34，相比从头训练的MF减少约50%总训练时间。

Conclusion: CMT为训练流映射模型提供了一个原则性、高效且通用的框架，显著提升了训练稳定性和效率。

Abstract: Flow map models such as Consistency Models (CM) and Mean Flow (MF) enable
few-step generation by learning the long jump of the ODE solution of diffusion
models, yet training remains unstable, sensitive to hyperparameters, and
costly. Initializing from a pre-trained diffusion model helps, but still
requires converting infinitesimal steps into a long-jump map, leaving
instability unresolved. We introduce mid-training, the first concept and
practical method that inserts a lightweight intermediate stage between the
(diffusion) pre-training and the final flow map training (i.e., post-training)
for vision generation. Concretely, Consistency Mid-Training (CMT) is a compact
and principled stage that trains a model to map points along a solver
trajectory from a pre-trained model, starting from a prior sample, directly to
the solver-generated clean sample. It yields a trajectory-consistent and stable
initialization. This initializer outperforms random and diffusion-based
baselines and enables fast, robust convergence without heuristics. Initializing
post-training with CMT weights further simplifies flow map learning.
Empirically, CMT achieves state of the art two step FIDs: 1.97 on CIFAR-10,
1.32 on ImageNet 64x64, and 1.84 on ImageNet 512x512, while using up to 98%
less training data and GPU time, compared to CMs. On ImageNet 256x256, CMT
reaches 1-step FID 3.34 while cutting total training time by about 50% compared
to MF from scratch (FID 3.43). This establishes CMT as a principled, efficient,
and general framework for training flow map models.

Abstract: 3D scene understanding is fundamental for embodied AI and robotics,
supporting reliable perception for interaction and navigation. Recent
approaches achieve zero-shot, open-vocabulary 3D semantic mapping by assigning
embedding vectors to 2D class-agnostic masks generated via vision-language
models (VLMs) and projecting these into 3D. However, these methods often
produce fragmented masks and inaccurate semantic assignments due to the direct
use of raw masks, limiting their effectiveness in complex environments. To
address this, we leverage SemanticSAM with progressive granularity refinement
to generate more accurate and numerous object-level masks, mitigating the
over-segmentation commonly observed in mask generation models such as vanilla
SAM, and improving downstream 3D semantic segmentation. To further enhance
semantic context, we employ a context-aware CLIP encoding strategy that
integrates multiple contextual views of each mask using empirically determined
weighting, providing much richer visual context. We evaluate our approach on

*Kaizhen Zhu,Mokai Pan,Zhechuan Yu,Jingya Wang,Jingyi Yu,Ye Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文首次统一分析了扩散桥和流匹配两种生成模型，从随机最优控制和最优传输理论角度证明扩散桥具有更低的成本函数和更稳定的轨迹，而流匹配在小数据量时效率下降。通过公平的实验比较验证了理论预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决扩散桥和流匹配两种方法在理论和实践上的混淆，提供统一的理论框架来比较它们的相对优劣，指导实际应用中的模型选择。

Method: 从随机最优控制角度重新构建两种模型框架，证明扩散桥的成本函数更低；从最优传输角度分析流匹配插值系数的效率问题；设计基于潜在Transformer的扩散桥架构，并用相同结构实现流匹配模型进行公平比较。

Result: 在图像修复、超分辨率、去模糊、去噪、翻译和风格转换等任务上的大量实验表明，扩散桥在分布差异大时表现更好，流匹配在小数据量时效率下降，实验结果与理论预测完全一致。

Conclusion: 扩散桥在分布差异较大时具有优势，能生成更稳定自然的轨迹；流匹配在小数据量时插值效率下降。两种方法各有优缺点，应根据具体任务和数据规模选择合适模型。

Abstract: Diffusion Bridge and Flow Matching have both demonstrated compelling
empirical performance in transformation between arbitrary distributions.
However, there remains confusion about which approach is generally preferable,
and the substantial discrepancies in their modeling assumptions and practical
implementations have hindered a unified theoretical account of their relative
merits. We have, for the first time, provided a unified theoretical and
experimental validation of these two models. We recast their frameworks through
the lens of Stochastic Optimal Control and prove that the cost function of the
Diffusion Bridge is lower, guiding the system toward more stable and natural
trajectories. Simultaneously, from the perspective of Optimal Transport,
interpolation coefficients $t$ and $1-t$ of Flow Matching become increasingly
ineffective when the training data size is reduced. To corroborate these
theoretical claims, we propose a novel, powerful architecture for Diffusion
Bridge built on a latent Transformer, and implement a Flow Matching model with
the same structure to enable a fair performance comparison in various
experiments. Comprehensive experiments are conducted across Image Inpainting,
Super-Resolution, Deblurring, Denoising, Translation, and Style Transfer tasks,
systematically varying both the distributional discrepancy (different
difficulty) and the training data size. Extensive empirical results align
perfectly with our theoretical predictions and allow us to delineate the
respective advantages and disadvantages of these two models. Our code is
available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/DBFM-3E8E/.

TL;DR: 提出了一种融合大气散射物理先验的雾天人群计数方法，通过物理机制与数据驱动的协同优化，提升复杂气象条件下的人群计数精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对雾天环境中人群计数面临的长距离目标模糊、局部特征退化、图像对比度衰减等关键挑战，需要结合物理机制来改善计数性能。

Method: 引入可微分大气散射模型进行透射率动态估计和散射参数自适应校准；设计基于Kolmogorov-Arnold表示定理的MSA-KAN构建可学习边缘激活函数；提出天气感知GCN动态构建空间邻接矩阵。

Result: 在四个公共数据集上的实验表明，在浓雾场景下相比主流算法，MAE指标降低了12.2%-27.5%。

Conclusion: 该方法通过物理先验与深度学习的有效结合，显著提升了雾天环境下人群计数的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Aiming at the key challenges of crowd counting in foggy environments, such as
long-range target blurring, local feature degradation, and image contrast
attenuation, this paper proposes a crowd-counting method with a physical a
priori of atmospheric scattering, which improves crowd counting accuracy under
complex meteorological conditions through the synergistic optimization of the
physical mechanism and data-driven.Specifically, first, the method introduces a
differentiable atmospheric scattering model and employs transmittance dynamic
estimation and scattering parameter adaptive calibration techniques to
accurately quantify the nonlinear attenuation laws of haze on targets with
different depths of field.Secondly, the MSA-KAN was designed based on the
Kolmogorov-Arnold Representation Theorem to construct a learnable edge
activation function. By integrating a multi-layer progressive architecture with
adaptive skip connections, it significantly enhances the model's nonlinear
representation capability in feature-degraded regions, effectively suppressing
feature confusion under fog interference.Finally, we further propose a
weather-aware GCN that dynamically constructs spatial adjacency matrices using
deep features extracted by MSA-KAN. Experiments on four public datasets
demonstrate that our method achieves a 12.2\%-27.5\% reduction in MAE metrics
compared to mainstream algorithms in dense fog scenarios.

*Zhifang Zhang,Qiqi Tao,Jiaqi Lv,Na Zhao,Lei Feng,Joey Tianyi Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TokenSwap是一种针对大型视觉语言模型的隐蔽后门攻击方法，通过破坏模型对物体关系的理解而非固定目标内容，实现更难以检测的攻击效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LVLM后门攻击使用固定目标模式，容易被检测，因为模型会记忆这些频繁出现的模式。需要开发更隐蔽的攻击方法。

Method: 在训练时注入视觉触发器并交换文本答案中关键token的语法角色，使用自适应token加权损失强调交换token的学习，将视觉触发器与bags-of-words行为关联。

Result: 在多个基准测试和不同LVLM架构上，TokenSwap实现了高攻击成功率，同时保持了优越的隐蔽性和隐秘性。

Conclusion: TokenSwap证明了针对LVLM组合理解能力的后门攻击的有效性，展示了比固定模式攻击更强的隐蔽性。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have achieved impressive performance
across a wide range of vision-language tasks, while they remain vulnerable to
backdoor attacks. Existing backdoor attacks on LVLMs aim to force the victim
model to generate a predefined target pattern, which is either inserted into or
replaces the original content. We find that these fixed-pattern attacks are
relatively easy to detect, because the attacked LVLM tends to memorize such
frequent patterns in the training dataset, thereby exhibiting overconfidence on
these targets given poisoned inputs. To address these limitations, we introduce
TokenSwap, a more evasive and stealthy backdoor attack that focuses on the
compositional understanding capabilities of LVLMs. Instead of enforcing a fixed
targeted content, TokenSwap subtly disrupts the understanding of object
relationships in text. Specifically, it causes the backdoored model to generate
outputs that mention the correct objects in the image but misrepresent their
relationships (i.e., bags-of-words behavior). During training, TokenSwap
injects a visual trigger into selected samples and simultaneously swaps the
grammatical roles of key tokens in the corresponding textual answers. However,
the poisoned samples exhibit only subtle differences from the original ones,
making it challenging for the model to learn the backdoor behavior. To address
this, TokenSwap employs an adaptive token-weighted loss that explicitly
emphasizes the learning of swapped tokens, such that the visual triggers and
bags-of-words behavior are associated. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
TokenSwap achieves high attack success rates while maintaining superior
evasiveness and stealthiness across multiple benchmarks and various LVLM
architectures.

*Mohamad Ballout,Okajevo Wilfred,Seyedalireza Yaghoubi,Nohayr Muhammad Abdelmoneim,Julius Mayer,Elia Bruni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPLICE是一个基于COIN教学视频数据集的人类标注基准，用于评估多维度事件推理能力。该基准包含3,381个视频和11,423个事件片段，通过重新排列片段为连贯序列来测试人类和视觉语言模型的推理能力。结果显示VLMs与人类表现存在显著差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在事件推理方面存在局限性，需要专门的基准来评估其在时间、因果、空间、上下文和常识推理等多维度的能力。

Method: 从COIN数据集中筛选3,381个视频，涵盖12个类别和180个子类别，分割成11,423个事件片段。让人类参与者和最先进的VLMs重新排列这些片段，比较他们的表现。

Result: VLMs表现显著低于人类。人类标注的文本描述能提高模型准确率，但不影响人类表现，表明模型更依赖语言先验而非视觉理解。VLMs在时间因果推理主导的视频中表现相对较好，在上下文空间推理主导的视频中表现较差。

Conclusion: VLMs在视觉推理方面仍面临持续挑战，特别是在上下文和空间推理方面。模型过度依赖语言先验而非真正的视觉理解能力。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce SPLICE, a human-curated benchmark derived from the
COIN instructional video dataset, designed to probe event-based reasoning
across multiple dimensions: temporal, causal, spatial, contextual, and general
knowledge. SPLICE includes 3,381 human-filtered videos spanning 12 categories
and 180 sub-categories, such as sports, engineering, and housework. These
videos are segmented into a total of 11,423 event clips. We evaluate both human
participants and state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) on the task of
rearranging these clips into coherent event sequences to assess visual
reasoning capabilities. Results reveal a significant gap: VLMs struggle to
match human performance. While human-annotated textual descriptions improve
model accuracy, they do not affect human performance, suggesting that models
rely more on language priors than on visual understanding. Even with
annotations, VLMs fall short of human-level reasoning, underscoring persistent
challenges in visual reasoning. A deeper analysis across sub-categories shows
that VLMs perform relatively better on videos where temporal and causal
reasoning are dominant, compared to those where contextual and spatial
reasoning are dominant. They also perform better on everyday tasks than on
specialized ones.

TL;DR: SCOPE是一种基于扩散模型的类别级物体姿态估计方法，通过DINOv2特征作为连续语义先验，无需离散类别标签，在合成训练中优于现有方法31.9%，并能泛化到未知类别物体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机器人在开放环境中遇到未知物体时的姿态估计问题，需要语义理解能力来泛化到已知类别及之外的物体。

Method: 使用扩散模型结合DINOv2特征作为连续语义先验，通过交叉注意力注入语义信息，结合逼真训练数据和点法线噪声模型来减小Sim2Real差距。

Result: 在合成训练的类别级物体姿态估计中，5°5cm指标相对提升31.9%；在两个实例级数据集上展示了对未知类别的泛化能力，抓取成功率高达100%。

Conclusion: SCOPE通过连续语义先验实现了跨实例的规范化物体坐标系学习，在类别级姿态估计上达到最先进性能，并能有效泛化到未知类别物体。

Abstract: Object manipulation requires accurate object pose estimation. In open
environments, robots encounter unknown objects, which requires semantic
understanding in order to generalize both to known categories and beyond. To
resolve this challenge, we present SCOPE, a diffusion-based category-level
object pose estimation model that eliminates the need for discrete category
labels by leveraging DINOv2 features as continuous semantic priors. By
combining these DINOv2 features with photorealistic training data and a noise
model for point normals, we reduce the Sim2Real gap in category-level object
pose estimation. Furthermore, injecting the continuous semantic priors via
cross-attention enables SCOPE to learn canonicalized object coordinate systems
across object instances beyond the distribution of known categories. SCOPE
outperforms the current state of the art in synthetically trained
category-level object pose estimation, achieving a relative improvement of
31.9\% on the 5$^\circ$5cm metric. Additional experiments on two instance-level
datasets demonstrate generalization beyond known object categories, enabling
grasping of unseen objects from unknown categories with a success rate of up to
100\%. Code available: https://github.com/hoenigpeter/scope.

Abstract: This paper introduces Volterra Neural Ordinary Differential Equations
(VNODE), a piecewise continuous Volterra Neural Network that integrates
nonlinear Volterra filtering with continuous time neural ordinary differential
equations for image classification. Drawing inspiration from the visual cortex,
where discrete event processing is interleaved with continuous integration,
VNODE alternates between discrete Volterra feature extraction and ODE driven

requiring substantially fewer parameters than conventional deep architectures.
VNODE consistently outperforms state of the art models with improved
computational complexity as exemplified on benchmark datasets like CIFAR10 and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建联合人脸-颅骨可变形模型在远程诊断、手术规划等领域具有巨大潜力，但面临配对数据稀缺、配准精度不足、临床应用探索有限等挑战，且颅面畸形患者常被忽视。

Method: 构建包含200多个样本的数据集，提出密集射线匹配配准方法确保拓扑一致性，建立BFSM模型通过共享系数空间实现双向形状推断并建模组织厚度变化。

Result: 实验证实方法的鲁棒性和准确性，展示了在单图像3D人脸-颅骨重建和手术规划预测等医疗应用中的潜力。

Conclusion: BFSM模型有效解决了人脸-颅骨数据稀缺和配准问题，为医疗应用提供了实用工具，特别关注了颅面畸形患者的代表性。

Abstract: Building a joint face-skull morphable model holds great potential for
applications such as remote diagnostics, surgical planning, medical education,
and physically based facial simulation. However, realizing this vision is
constrained by the scarcity of paired face-skull data, insufficient
registration accuracy, and limited exploration of reconstruction and clinical
applications. Moreover, individuals with craniofacial deformities are often
overlooked, resulting in underrepresentation and limited inclusivity. To
address these challenges, we first construct a dataset comprising over 200
samples, including both normal cases and rare craniofacial conditions. Each
case contains a CT-based skull, a CT-based face, and a high-fidelity textured
face scan. Secondly, we propose a novel dense ray matching registration method
that ensures topological consistency across face, skull, and their tissue
correspondences. Based on this, we introduce the 3D Bidirectional Face-Skull
Morphable Model (BFSM), which enables shape inference between the face and
skull through a shared coefficient space, while also modeling tissue thickness
variation to support one-to-many facial reconstructions from the same skull,
reflecting individual changes such as fat over time. Finally, we demonstrate
the potential of BFSM in medical applications, including 3D face-skull
reconstruction from a single image and surgical planning prediction. Extensive
experiments confirm the robustness and accuracy of our method. BFSM is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文系统评估了YOLOv11模型在血液细胞检测中的表现，创建了包含16,891张图像和298,850个标注细胞的大规模数据集，发现YOLOv11 Medium变体在8:1:1数据分割下达到最佳平衡，mAP@0.5为0.934。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动外周血涂片分析劳动密集且主观，深度学习提供了有前景的替代方案，但缺乏对最先进模型如YOLOv11在细粒度PBS检测中的系统评估。

Method: 创建大规模标注数据集，包含12种外周血细胞类别和红细胞类别，共16,891张图像。对五种YOLOv11变体（从Nano到XLarge）进行综合评估，使用两种数据分割策略（70:20:10和80:10:10），采用mAP、精确度、召回率、F1分数和计算效率等多项性能标准。

Result: YOLOv11 Medium变体在8:1:1分割下达到最佳平衡，mAP@0.5为0.934。更大模型（Large和XLarge）仅带来边际精度提升但计算成本显著增加。8:1:1分割在所有模型中均优于7:2:1分割。

Conclusion: YOLOv11，特别是Medium变体，是自动化细粒度PBS检测的高效框架。公开的数据集为血液学中血细胞检测和分类研究提供了宝贵资源。

Abstract: Manual peripheral blood smear (PBS) analysis is labor intensive and
subjective. While deep learning offers a promising alternative, a systematic
evaluation of state of the art models such as YOLOv11 for fine grained PBS
detection is still lacking. In this work, we make two key contributions. First,
we curate a large scale annotated dataset for blood cell detection and
classification, comprising 16,891 images across 12 peripheral blood cell (PBC)
classes, along with the red blood cell class, all carefully re annotated for
object detection tasks. In total, the dataset contains 298,850 annotated cells.
Second, we leverage this dataset to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of five
YOLOv11 variants (ranging from Nano to XLarge). These models are rigorously
benchmarked under two data splitting strategies (70:20:10 and 80:10:10) and
systematically assessed using multiple performance criteria, including mean
Average Precision (mAP), precision, recall, F1 score, and computational
efficiency. Our experiments show that the YOLOv11 Medium variant achieves the
best trade off, reaching a mAP@0.5 of 0.934 under the 8:1:1 split. Larger
models (Large and XLarge) provide only marginal accuracy gains at substantially
higher computational cost. Moreover, the 8:1:1 split consistently outperforms
the 7:2:1 split across all models. These findings highlight YOLOv11,
particularly the Medium variant, as a highly effective framework for automated,
fine grained PBS detection. Beyond benchmarking, our publicly released dataset
(github.com/Mohamad-AbouAli/OI-PBC-Dataset) offers a valuable resource to
advance research on blood cell detection and classification in hematology.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统运动分析方法依赖手动标注或实验室设备，耗时昂贵且缺乏可扩展性。需要一种自动、准确的运动阶段分割方法来提取相关动力学变量。

Method: 将结构化最优传输(SOT)概念与注意力时空图卷积网络(ASTGCN)结合，实现上下文感知的时序分割。

Result: 在测试数据上达到71.02%的平均精度和74.61%的F1分数，显著优于现有无监督方法。同时发布了包含211个专业标枪投掷视频的新数据集。

Conclusion: 该方法为运动分析提供了一种有效的无监督分割解决方案，在标枪投掷分析中表现出色，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Precise analysis of athletic motion is central to sports analytics,
particularly in disciplines where nuanced biomechanical phases directly impact
performance outcomes. Traditional analytics techniques rely on manual
annotation or laboratory-based instrumentation, which are time-consuming,
costly, and lack scalability. Automatic extraction of relevant kinetic
variables requires a robust and contextually appropriate temporal segmentation.
Considering the specific case of elite javelin-throw, we present a novel
unsupervised framework for such a contextually aware segmentation, which
applies the structured optimal transport (SOT) concept to augment the
well-known Attention-based Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network
(ASTGCN). This enables the identification of motion phase transitions without
requiring expensive manual labeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
approach outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised methods, achieving 71.02%
mean average precision (mAP) and 74.61% F1-score on test data, substantially
higher than competing baselines. We also release a new dataset of 211 manually
annotated professional javelin-throw videos with frame-level annotations,
covering key biomechanical phases: approach steps, drive, throw, and recovery.

TL;DR: FreeRet是一个即插即用框架，无需额外训练即可将任何多模态大语言模型转换为两阶段检索器，通过语义嵌入和推理重排实现高效检索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs需要大量后训练才能转换为检索编码器，本文探索能否直接使用现成MLLMs作为强大的检索器。

Method: 采用两阶段检索：首先从模型直接获取语义嵌入进行快速候选搜索，然后利用模型推理能力进行精确重排；包含三个关键技术：绕过词汇对齐层、条件表示生成、中性选择框架缓解框架效应。

Result: 在MMEB和MMEB-V2基准测试的46个数据集上，FreeRet显著优于经过数百万对训练的模型，且具有模型无关性、可扩展性和多模态支持能力。

Conclusion: 预训练的MLLMs经过精心利用后，无需训练即可作为强大的检索引擎，填补了其作为通用模型角色的关键空白。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are emerging as versatile
foundations for mixed-modality retrieval. Yet, they often require heavy
post-hoc training to convert them into contrastive encoders for retrieval. This
work asks: Can off-the-shelf MLLMs serve as powerful retrievers without
additional training? We present FreeRet, a plug-and-play framework that turns
any MLLM into a two-stage retriever. FreeRet first derives semantically
grounded embeddings directly from the model for fast candidate search, and then
exploits its reasoning ability for precise reranking. The framework contributes
three advances: bypassing lexical alignment layers to obtain semantically
faithful embeddings, conditioning representation generation with explicit
priors, and mitigating framing effect in reranking via neutral choice framing.
On the MMEB and MMEB-V2 benchmarks spanning 46 datasets, FreeRet substantially
outperforms models trained on millions of pairs. Beyond benchmarks, FreeRet is
model-agnostic and scales seamlessly across MLLM families and sizes, preserves
their generative abilities, supports arbitrary modality combinations, and
unifies retrieval, reranking, and generation into end-to-end RAG within a
single model. Our findings demonstrate that pretrained MLLMs, when carefully
harnessed, can serve as strong retrieval engines without training, closing a
critical gap in their role as generalists.

Motivation: 解决现有视频生成模型计算成本高、推理速度慢的问题，实现低成本高质量的长视频生成。

Method: 采用线性注意力机制(Linear DiT)和恒定内存KV缓存技术，结合有效的数据过滤和训练策略。

Result: 在64个H100 GPU上仅需12天训练成本(仅为MovieGen的1%)，推理速度比同类模型快16倍，可在RTX 5090 GPU上部署。

Conclusion: SANA-Video实现了低成本、高质量的视频生成，为实际部署提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce SANA-Video, a small diffusion model that can efficiently
generate videos up to 720x1280 resolution and minute-length duration.
SANA-Video synthesizes high-resolution, high-quality and long videos with
strong text-video alignment at a remarkably fast speed, deployable on RTX 5090
GPU. Two core designs ensure our efficient, effective and long video
generation: (1) Linear DiT: We leverage linear attention as the core operation,
which is more efficient than vanilla attention given the large number of tokens
processed in video generation. (2) Constant-Memory KV cache for Block Linear
Attention: we design block-wise autoregressive approach for long video
generation by employing a constant-memory state, derived from the cumulative
properties of linear attention. This KV cache provides the Linear DiT with
global context at a fixed memory cost, eliminating the need for a traditional
KV cache and enabling efficient, minute-long video generation. In addition, we
explore effective data filters and model training strategies, narrowing the
training cost to 12 days on 64 H100 GPUs, which is only 1% of the cost of
MovieGen. Given its low cost, SANA-Video achieves competitive performance
compared to modern state-of-the-art small diffusion models (e.g., Wan 2.1-1.3B
and SkyReel-V2-1.3B) while being 16x faster in measured latency. Moreover,
SANA-Video can be deployed on RTX 5090 GPUs with NVFP4 precision, accelerating
the inference speed of generating a 5-second 720p video from 71s to 29s (2.4x
speedup). In summary, SANA-Video enables low-cost, high-quality video
generation.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) often struggle to ground reasoning
in perceptual evidence. We present a systematic study of perception
strategies-explicit, implicit, visual, and textual-across four multimodal
benchmarks and two MLLMs. Our findings show that explicit perception,
especially when paired with textual cues, consistently yields the best
improvements, particularly for smaller models. Based on this insight, we
propose VTPerception-R1, a unified two-stage framework that decouples
perception from reasoning. Stage 1 introduces perception-augmented fine-tuning,
and Stage 2 applies perception-aware reinforcement learning with novel visual,
textual, and consistency rewards. Experiments demonstrate that VTPerception-R1
significantly improves reasoning accuracy and robustness across diverse tasks,
offering a scalable and auditable solution for perception-grounded multimodal
reasoning. Our code is available at:

Unlike moire degradation, which has been extensively studied, the FB remains
underexplored despite its frequent and severe impact on readability and
perceived quality. We formulate FB removal as a dedicated restoration task and
introduce Removal of Image Flicker-Banding via Latent Diffusion Enhancement,
RIFLE, a diffusion-based framework designed to remove FB while preserving fine
details. We propose the flicker-banding prior estimator (FPE) that predicts key
banding attributes and injects it into the restoration network. Additionally,
Masked Loss (ML) is proposed to concentrate supervision on banded regions
without sacrificing global fidelity. To overcome data scarcity, we provide a
simulation pipeline that synthesizes FB in the luminance domain with stochastic
jitter in banding angle, banding spacing, and banding width. Feathered
boundaries and sensor noise are also applied for a more realistic simulation.
For evaluation, we collect a paired real-world FB dataset with pixel-aligned
banding-free references captured via long exposure. Across quantitative metrics
and visual comparisons on our real-world dataset, RIFLE consistently
outperforms recent image reconstruction baselines from mild to severe
flicker-banding. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first work to research
the simulation and removal of FB. Our work establishes a great foundation for
subsequent research in both the dataset construction and the removal model
design. Our dataset and code will be released soon.

TL;DR: Causal-Adapter是一个模块化框架，通过适配冻结的文本到图像扩散模型来实现反事实图像生成，能够在保持图像核心身份的同时对目标属性进行因果干预。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖提示工程而没有明确的因果结构，无法一致地将因果干预效果传播到因果依赖项。需要一种能够精确控制语义属性并减少虚假相关性的方法。

Method: 利用结构因果建模，结合两种属性正则化策略：提示对齐注入（将因果属性与文本嵌入对齐以实现精确语义控制）和条件标记对比损失（解耦属性因子并减少虚假相关性）。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上达到最先进性能：Pendulum数据集上MAE减少91%（精确属性控制），ADNI数据集上FID减少87%（高保真MRI图像生成）。

Conclusion: 该方法能够实现鲁棒、可泛化的反事实编辑，具有忠实的属性修改和强大的身份保持能力。

Abstract: We present Causal-Adapter, a modular framework that adapts frozen
text-to-image diffusion backbones for counterfactual image generation. Our
method enables causal interventions on target attributes, consistently
propagating their effects to causal dependents without altering the core
identity of the image. In contrast to prior approaches that rely on prompt
engineering without explicit causal structure, Causal-Adapter leverages
structural causal modeling augmented with two attribute regularization
strategies: prompt-aligned injection, which aligns causal attributes with
textual embeddings for precise semantic control, and a conditioned token
contrastive loss to disentangle attribute factors and reduce spurious
correlations. Causal-Adapter achieves state-of-the-art performance on both
synthetic and real-world datasets, with up to 91\% MAE reduction on Pendulum
for accurate attribute control and 87\% FID reduction on ADNI for high-fidelity
MRI image generation. These results show that our approach enables robust,
generalizable counterfactual editing with faithful attribute modification and
strong identity preservation.

Conclusion: 建立了一种通用且可扩展的面向对象生成建模方法，弥合了人类基于对象的感知与机器学习之间的差距，为创意、科学和实际领域的交互式、结构化生成工具扩展了设计空间。

Abstract: A central goal in AI is to represent scenes as compositions of discrete
objects, enabling fine-grained, controllable image and video generation. Yet
leading diffusion models treat images holistically and rely on text
conditioning, creating a mismatch for object-level editing. This thesis
introduces a framework that adapts powerful pretrained diffusion models for
object-centric synthesis while retaining their generative capacity.
  We identify a core challenge: balancing global scene coherence with
disentangled object control. Our method integrates lightweight, slot-based
conditioning into pretrained models, preserving their visual priors while
providing object-specific manipulation. For images, SlotAdapt augments
diffusion models with a register token for background/style and
slot-conditioned modules for objects, reducing text-conditioning bias and
achieving state-of-the-art results in object discovery, segmentation,
compositional editing, and controllable image generation.
  We further extend the framework to video. Using Invariant Slot Attention
(ISA) to separate object identity from pose and a Transformer-based temporal
aggregator, our approach maintains consistent object representations and
dynamics across frames. This yields new benchmarks in unsupervised video object
segmentation and reconstruction, and supports advanced editing tasks such as
object removal, replacement, and insertion without explicit supervision.
  Overall, this work establishes a general and scalable approach to
object-centric generative modeling for images and videos. By bridging human
object-based perception and machine learning, it expands the design space for
interactive, structured, and user-driven generative tools in creative,
scientific, and practical domains.

Motivation: 开放词汇伪装物体分割需要对训练时未见类别的伪装物体进行分割，对模型泛化能力要求极高。现有方法中的分类组件显著影响整体分割性能。

Method: 采用分类器中心的自适应框架，通过轻量级文本适配器和分层非对称初始化来改进分类组件。

Result: 在OVCamo基准测试中，相比OVCoser基线，cIoU从0.443提升到0.493，cSm从0.579提升到0.658，cMAE从0.336降低到0.239。

Conclusion: 针对性的分类增强为推进伪装物体分割性能提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary camouflaged object segmentation requires models to segment
camouflaged objects of arbitrary categories unseen during training, placing
extremely high demands on generalization capabilities. Through analysis of
existing methods, it is observed that the classification component
significantly affects overall segmentation performance. Accordingly, a
classifier-centric adaptive framework is proposed to enhance segmentation
performance by improving the classification component via a lightweight text
adapter with a novel layered asymmetric initialization. Through the
classification enhancement, the proposed method achieves substantial
improvements in segmentation metrics compared to the OVCoser baseline on the
OVCamo benchmark: cIoU increases from 0.443 to 0.493, cSm from 0.579 to 0.658,
and cMAE reduces from 0.336 to 0.239. These results demonstrate that targeted
classification enhancement provides an effective approach for advancing
camouflaged object segmentation performance.

Conclusion: 开发了一个有效的自动分割管道用于TBI病变分割，Python实现已公开可用。

Abstract: The identification and segmentation of moderate-severe traumatic brain injury
(TBI) lesions pose a significant challenge in neuroimaging. This difficulty
arises from the extreme heterogeneity of these lesions, which vary in size,
number, and laterality, thereby complicating downstream image processing tasks
such as image registration and brain parcellation, reducing the analytical
accuracy. Thus, developing methods for highly accurate segmentation of TBI
lesions is essential for reliable neuroimaging analysis. This study aims to
develop an effective automated segmentation pipeline to automatically detect
and segment TBI lesions in T1-weighted MRI scans. We evaluate multiple
approaches to achieve accurate segmentation of the TBI lesions. The core of our
pipeline leverages various architectures within the nnUNet framework for
initial segmentation, complemented by post-processing strategies to enhance
evaluation metrics. Our final submission to the challenge achieved an accuracy
of 0.8451, Dice score values of 0.4711 and 0.8514 for images with and without
visible lesions, respectively, with an overall Dice score of 0.5973, ranking
among the top-6 methods in the AIMS-TBI 2025 challenge. The Python
implementation of our pipeline is publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 公共数据集中严重的类别不平衡问题抑制了罕见类别车辆识别的性能，需要开发有效的重平衡策略来提升整体识别准确率。

Method: 1) 合并Kaggle、ImageNet和网络爬取数据创建16类约47k图像的数据集；2) 使用SMOTE过采样和针对性欠采样生成6个平衡变体；3) 基于MobileNet-V2特征的轻量级集成方法(Random Forest、AdaBoost、软投票组合器)；4) 可配置ResNet风格CNN，采用强数据增强和标签平滑训练。

Result: 最佳集成方法(SMOTE组合)达到74.8%测试准确率，CNN在完整测试集上达到79.19%，在未见推理批次上达到81.25%，证实了深度模型的优势。但最少数类(Barge)仍是失败模式，表明仅靠重平衡存在局限性。

Conclusion: 需要优先收集更多少数类样本，采用成本敏感目标(如focal loss)，并探索混合集成或CNN管道，以结合可解释性和表示能力。

Abstract: Accurate vehicle type recognition underpins intelligent transportation and
logistics, but severe class imbalance in public datasets suppresses performance
on rare categories. We curate a 16-class corpus (~47k images) by merging
Kaggle, ImageNet, and web-crawled data, and create six balanced variants via
SMOTE oversampling and targeted undersampling. Lightweight ensembles, such as
Random Forest, AdaBoost, and a soft-voting combiner built on MobileNet-V2
features are benchmarked against a configurable ResNet-style CNN trained with
strong augmentation and label smoothing. The best ensemble (SMOTE-combined)
attains 74.8% test accuracy, while the CNN achieves 79.19% on the full test set
and 81.25% on an unseen inference batch, confirming the advantage of deep
models. Nonetheless, the most under-represented class (Barge) remains a failure
mode, highlighting the limits of rebalancing alone. Results suggest
prioritizing additional minority-class collection and cost-sensitive objectives
(e.g., focal loss) and exploring hybrid ensemble or CNN pipelines to combine
interpretability with representational power.

Motivation: 现有数据集在系统结构和挑战性场景方面不足，限制了统一多模态模型的性能，需要更全面和结构化的训练数据。

Method: 采用层次化任务分类法，结合结构化资源池和GPT-4o构建自动化流水线，生成了8万高质量指令-图像对，覆盖11个主要领域和51个子任务。

Result: 在多个基准测试中取得显著性能提升，编辑任务提升18%（UniWorld-V1在ImgEdit-Bench），生成任务提升13%（Harmon在GenEval）。

Conclusion: 系统化的数据构建是推进多模态AI能力的关键，OpenGPT-4o-Image数据集为模型性能提升提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The performance of unified multimodal models for image generation and editing
is fundamentally constrained by the quality and comprehensiveness of their
training data. While existing datasets have covered basic tasks like style
transfer and simple object manipulation, they often lack the systematic
structure and challenging scenarios required for real-world applications. To
address this bottleneck, we introduce OpenGPT-4o-Image, a large-scale dataset
constructed using a novel methodology that combines hierarchical task taxonomy
with automated data generation. Our taxonomy not only includes fundamental
capabilities such as text rendering and style control but also introduces
highly practical yet challenging categories like scientific imagery for
chemistry illustrations and complex instruction editing requiring simultaneous
execution of multiple operations. Through an automated pipeline leveraging
structured resource pools and GPT-4o, we generate 80k high-quality
instruction-image pairs with controlled diversity, covering 11 major domains
and 51 subtasks. Extensive experiments show that fine-tuning leading models on
our dataset achieves significant performance gains across multiple benchmarks,
with improvements of up to 18\% on editing tasks (UniWorld-V1 on ImgEdit-Bench)
and 13% on generation tasks (Harmon on GenEval). Our work demonstrates that
systematic data construction is key to advancing multimodal AI capabilities.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的框架，通过显式推理物理不合理性来改进扩散模型的视频生成物理合理性，包含物理感知推理管道和同步解耦引导策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型依赖大规模文本-视频数据集隐式学习物理推理，成本高、难以扩展且容易产生违反物理定律的不合理运动。

Method: 使用轻量级物理感知推理管道构建反事实提示，提出同步解耦引导策略（SDG），包含同步方向归一化来对抗滞后抑制，以及轨迹解耦去噪来减轻累积轨迹偏差。

Result: 在不同物理领域的实验中，该方法显著提高了物理保真度，同时保持照片真实感，且无需额外训练。消融研究证实了物理感知推理组件和SDG的互补有效性。

Conclusion: 建立了一个新的即插即用物理感知视频生成范式，能够有效抑制不合理内容并提高物理合理性。

Abstract: Diffusion models can generate realistic videos, but existing methods rely on
implicitly learning physical reasoning from large-scale text-video datasets,
which is costly, difficult to scale, and still prone to producing implausible
motions that violate fundamental physical laws. We introduce a training-free
framework that improves physical plausibility at inference time by explicitly
reasoning about implausibility and guiding the generation away from it.
Specifically, we employ a lightweight physics-aware reasoning pipeline to
construct counterfactual prompts that deliberately encode physics-violating
behaviors. Then, we propose a novel Synchronized Decoupled Guidance (SDG)
strategy, which leverages these prompts through synchronized directional
normalization to counteract lagged suppression and trajectory-decoupled
denoising to mitigate cumulative trajectory bias, ensuring that implausible
content is suppressed immediately and consistently throughout denoising.
Experiments across different physical domains show that our approach
substantially enhances physical fidelity while maintaining photorealism,
despite requiring no additional training. Ablation studies confirm the
complementary effectiveness of both the physics-aware reasoning component and
SDG. In particular, the aforementioned two designs of SDG are also individually
validated to contribute critically to the suppression of implausible content
and the overall gains in physical plausibility. This establishes a new and
plug-and-play physics-aware paradigm for video generation.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖外部分类器或回归器进行主体级干预，对于结构特定干预效果不足，会产生不理想的全局效应，且需要用户提供繁琐的像素级标签图。

Method: 提出Segmentor-guided Counterfactual Fine-Tuning (Seg-CFT)，在标量值结构特定变量上进行干预，同时生成局部一致的反事实图像。

Result: 展示了生成逼真胸部X光片的能力，并在冠状动脉疾病建模方面显示出有希望的结果。

Conclusion: Seg-CFT方法简化了结构特定干预过程，无需像素级标签图，能够产生有效的局部一致反事实图像，在医学图像分析中具有应用潜力。

Abstract: Counterfactual image generation is a powerful tool for augmenting training
data, de-biasing datasets, and modeling disease. Current approaches rely on
external classifiers or regressors to increase the effectiveness of
subject-level interventions (e.g., changing the patient's age). For
structure-specific interventions (e.g., changing the area of the left lung in a
chest radiograph), we show that this is insufficient, and can result in
undesirable global effects across the image domain. Previous work used
pixel-level label maps as guidance, requiring a user to provide hypothetical
segmentations which are tedious and difficult to obtain. We propose
Segmentor-guided Counterfactual Fine-Tuning (Seg-CFT), which preserves the
simplicity of intervening on scalar-valued, structure-specific variables while
producing locally coherent and effective counterfactuals. We demonstrate the
capability of generating realistic chest radiographs, and we show promising
results for modeling coronary artery disease. Code:

Method: 构建包含113个精心策划任务的基准测试，涵盖100个真实网站，包含用户交互视频和所有静态资源，采用代理作为评判框架自动评估生成网页的功能正确性和视觉保真度。

Result: 对28个大型视觉语言模型的广泛实验显示，最佳模型的总体得分仅为36.35%，功能正确性(24.39% IFS)显著落后于视觉保真度(64.25% VFS)。

Conclusion: 当前模型在推理时间动态性和合成事件驱动逻辑方面存在关键局限性，IWR-Bench为视觉语言研究建立了一个具有挑战性的前沿领域。

Abstract: The webpage-to-code task requires models to understand visual representations
of webpages and generate corresponding code. However, existing benchmarks
primarily focus on static screenshot-to-code tasks, thereby overlooking the
dynamic interactions fundamental to real-world web applications. To address
this limitation, this paper introduces IWR-Bench, a novel benchmark for
evaluating the capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) in
interactive webpage reconstruction from video. IWR-Bench comprises 113
meticulously curated tasks from 100 real-world websites, with 1,001 actions and
featuring diverse interaction complexities (e.g., web games), visual styles,
and domains. Aligning with standard web development practices, each task
includes not only user interaction videos but also all crawled static assets
(e.g., images, videos). This benchmark evaluates models on two fundamental
challenges: comprehensive multi-modal reasoning to infer interaction logic from
video and assets, and advanced code generation to translate this logic into
functional code. An agent-as-a-judge framework with a comprehensive metric
system automatically assesses the functional correctness and visual fidelity of
generated webpages. Extensive experiments on 28 LVLMs reveal a significant
challenge: the best model achieves an overall score of only 36.35%, as
functional correctness (24.39% IFS) lags significantly behind visual fidelity
(64.25% VFS). These results highlight critical limitations in current models'
ability to reason about temporal dynamics and synthesize event-driven logic,
establishing IWR-Bench as a challenging frontier for vision-language research.
The benchmark and evaluation code will be made publicly available. Code is

Motivation: 探索生成对抗网络(GANs)的可扩展性，因为虽然可扩展性在生成建模中推动了进展，但在对抗学习中的原理仍未充分探索。

Method: 在紧凑的VAE潜在空间中训练以保持感知保真度，采用纯transformer架构的生成器和判别器，并针对扩展问题提出了轻量级中间监督和宽度感知学习率调整。

Result: GAT模型可在各种容量下可靠训练，GAT-XL/2在ImageNet-256上仅用40个epoch就达到了2.96 FID的SOTA性能，比强基线少用6倍训练轮数。

Conclusion: 通过潜在空间训练和transformer架构，GANs可以实现有效的可扩展性，GAT模型在计算效率和生成质量方面都表现出色。

Abstract: Scalability has driven recent advances in generative modeling, yet its
principles remain underexplored for adversarial learning. We investigate the
scalability of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) through two design
choices that have proven to be effective in other types of generative models:
training in a compact Variational Autoencoder latent space and adopting purely
transformer-based generators and discriminators. Training in latent space
enables efficient computation while preserving perceptual fidelity, and this
efficiency pairs naturally with plain transformers, whose performance scales
with computational budget. Building on these choices, we analyze failure modes
that emerge when naively scaling GANs. Specifically, we find issues as
underutilization of early layers in the generator and optimization instability
as the network scales. Accordingly, we provide simple and scale-friendly
solutions as lightweight intermediate supervision and width-aware learning-rate
adjustment. Our experiments show that GAT, a purely transformer-based and
latent-space GANs, can be easily trained reliably across a wide range of
capacities (S through XL). Moreover, GAT-XL/2 achieves state-of-the-art
single-step, class-conditional generation performance (FID of 2.96) on
ImageNet-256 in just 40 epochs, 6x fewer epochs than strong baselines.

Conclusion: 通过提供可复现的诊断基准和公开代码，帮助研究人员判断偏振相机是否适合其应用，并加速相关研究。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of floating debris on water is often compromised by
surface glare and changing outdoor illumination. Polarimetric imaging offers a
single-sensor route to mitigate water-surface glare that disrupts semantic
segmentation of floating objects. We benchmark state-of-the-art fusion networks
on PoTATO, a public dataset of polarimetric images of plastic bottles in inland
waterways, and compare their performance with single-image baselines using
traditional models. Our results indicate that polarimetric cues help recover
low-contrast objects and suppress reflection-induced false positives, raising
mean IoU and lowering contour error relative to RGB inputs. These sharper masks
come at a cost: the additional channels enlarge the models increasing the
computational load and introducing the risk of new false positives. By
providing a reproducible, diagnostic benchmark and publicly available code, we
hope to help researchers choose if polarized cameras are suitable for their
applications and to accelerate related research.

Abstract: Vision-Language Foundation Models (VLMs), trained on large-scale multimodal
datasets, have driven significant advances in Artificial Intelligence by
enabling rich cross-modal reasoning. Despite their success in general domains,
applying these models to medical imaging remains challenging due to the limited
availability of diverse imaging modalities and multilingual clinical data. Most
existing medical VLMs are trained on a subset of imaging modalities and focus
primarily on high-resource languages, thus limiting their generalizability and
clinical utility. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel
Vietnamese-language multimodal medical dataset comprising 1,567,062 paired
CT-PET images and corresponding 2,757 full-length clinical reports. This
dataset is designed to fill two pressing gaps in medical AI development: (1)
the lack of PET/CT imaging data in existing VLMs training corpora, which
hinders the development of models capable of handling functional imaging tasks;
and (2) the underrepresentation of low-resource languages, particularly the
Vietnamese language, in medical vision-language research. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first dataset to provide comprehensive PET/CT-report
pairs in Vietnamese. We further introduce a training framework to enhance VLMs'
learning, including data augmentation and expert-validated test sets. We
conduct comprehensive experiments benchmarking state-of-the-art VLMs on
downstream tasks, including medical report generation and visual question
answering. The experimental results show that incorporating our dataset
significantly improves the performance of existing VLMs. We believe this
dataset and benchmark will serve as a pivotal step in advancing the development
of more robust VLMs for medical imaging, particularly in low-resource
languages, and improving their clinical relevance in Vietnamese healthcare.

Conclusion: 三模态跟踪方法能够有效利用互补信息，在复杂场景中提供更鲁棒的跟踪性能。

Abstract: Existing multi-modal object tracking approaches primarily focus on dual-modal
paradigms, such as RGB-Depth or RGB-Thermal, yet remain challenged in complex
scenarios due to limited input modalities. To address this gap, this work
introduces a novel multi-modal tracking task that leverages three complementary
modalities, including visible RGB, Depth (D), and Thermal Infrared (TIR),
aiming to enhance robustness in complex scenarios. To support this task, we
construct a new multi-modal tracking dataset, coined RGBDT500, which consists
of 500 videos with synchronised frames across the three modalities. Each frame
provides spatially aligned RGB, depth, and thermal infrared images with precise
object bounding box annotations. Furthermore, we propose a novel multi-modal
tracker, dubbed RDTTrack. RDTTrack integrates tri-modal information for robust
tracking by leveraging a pretrained RGB-only tracking model and prompt learning
techniques. In specific, RDTTrack fuses thermal infrared and depth modalities
under a proposed orthogonal projection constraint, then integrates them with
RGB signals as prompts for the pre-trained foundation tracking model,
effectively harmonising tri-modal complementary cues. The experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method, showing
significant improvements over existing dual-modal approaches in terms of
tracking accuracy and robustness in complex scenarios.

*Max Curie,Paulo da Costa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLASP是一个无需标注数据或微调的轻量级无监督图像分割框架，通过自监督ViT特征提取、谱聚类和自动参数选择实现图像分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决无监督图像分割问题，为数字广告和营销工作流程（如品牌安全筛查、创意资源管理和社交媒体内容审核）中的大规模未标注数据提供易于复现的基线方法。

Method: 使用自监督ViT编码器提取补丁特征，构建亲和矩阵并应用谱聚类，通过特征间隙轮廓搜索自动选择分割数量，使用全连接DenseCRF锐化边界。

Result: 在COCO Stuff和ADE20K数据集上获得了具有竞争力的mIoU和像素精度，与最近的无监督基线方法表现相当。

Conclusion: CLASP的零训练设计使其成为处理大规模未标注数据的强大且易于复现的基线方法，特别适用于数字广告和营销工作流程。

Abstract: We introduce CLASP (Clustering via Adaptive Spectral Processing), a
lightweight framework for unsupervised image segmentation that operates without
any labeled data or finetuning. CLASP first extracts per patch features using a
self supervised ViT encoder (DINO); then, it builds an affinity matrix and
applies spectral clustering. To avoid manual tuning, we select the segment
count automatically with a eigengap silhouette search, and we sharpen the
boundaries with a fully connected DenseCRF. Despite its simplicity and training
free nature, CLASP attains competitive mIoU and pixel accuracy on COCO Stuff
and ADE20K, matching recent unsupervised baselines. The zero training design
makes CLASP a strong, easily reproducible baseline for large unannotated
corpora especially common in digital advertising and marketing workflows such
as brand safety screening, creative asset curation, and social media content
moderation

### [300] [ExGS: Extreme 3D Gaussian Compression with Diffusion Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24758)
*Jiaqi Chen,Xinhao Ji,Yuanyuan Gao,Hao Li,Yuning Gong,Yifei Liu,Dan Xu,Zhihang Zhong,Dingwen Zhang,Xiao Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ExGS是一个新颖的前馈框架，统一了通用高斯压缩(UGC)和GaussPainter，实现极端的3D高斯分布压缩。UGC执行无需重新优化的剪枝来大幅减少高斯基元，而GaussPainter利用扩散先验和掩码引导细化从严重剪枝的高斯场景中恢复高质量渲染。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经场景表示(如3D高斯分布)虽然实现了高质量神经渲染，但其大存储和传输成本阻碍了在资源受限环境中的部署。现有压缩方法要么依赖昂贵的优化，要么采用无训练的剪枝和量化，在高压缩比下会降低渲染质量。

Method: 提出ExGS框架，包含两个核心组件：UGC执行重优化自由的剪枝来减少高斯基元；GaussPainter利用扩散先验和掩码引导细化来恢复高质量渲染。采用轻量级VAE和一步扩散设计实现实时恢复。

Result: 该框架可以实现超过100倍的压缩(将典型的354.77 MB模型减少到约3.31 MB)，同时保持保真度并在挑战性条件下显著改善图像质量。

Conclusion: 这些结果突出了扩散先验在弥合极端压缩和高质量神经渲染之间差距中的核心作用。

Abstract: Neural scene representations, such as 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), have
enabled high-quality neural rendering; however, their large storage and
transmission costs hinder deployment in resource-constrained environments.
Existing compression methods either rely on costly optimization, which is slow
and scene-specific, or adopt training-free pruning and quantization, which
degrade rendering quality under high compression ratios. In contrast, recent
data-driven approaches provide a promising direction to overcome this
trade-off, enabling efficient compression while preserving high rendering
quality. We introduce \textbf{ExGS}, a novel feed-forward framework that
unifies \textbf{Universal Gaussian Compression} (UGC) with
\textbf{GaussPainter} for \textbf{Ex}treme 3D\textbf{GS} compression.
\textbf{UGC} performs re-optimization-free pruning to aggressively reduce
Gaussian primitives while retaining only essential information, whereas
\textbf{GaussPainter} leverages powerful diffusion priors with mask-guided
refinement to restore high-quality renderings from heavily pruned Gaussian
scenes. Unlike conventional inpainting, GaussPainter not only fills in missing
regions but also enhances visible pixels, yielding substantial improvements in
degraded renderings. To ensure practicality, it adopts a lightweight VAE and a
one-step diffusion design, enabling real-time restoration. Our framework can
even achieve over $100\times$ compression (reducing a typical 354.77 MB model
to about 3.31 MB) while preserving fidelity and significantly improving image
quality under challenging conditions. These results highlight the central role
of diffusion priors in bridging the gap between extreme compression and
high-quality neural rendering. Our code repository will be released at
\href{https://github.com/chenttt2001/ExGS}{here}.

Abstract: This paper presents a real-time pipeline for dynamic arm gesture recognition
based on OpenPose keypoint estimation, keypoint normalization, and a recurrent
neural network classifier. The 1 x 1 normalization scheme and two feature
representations (coordinate- and angle-based) are presented for the pipeline.
In addition, an efficient method to improve robustness against camera angle
variations is also introduced by using artificially rotated training data.

Conclusion: SkyLink方法通过创新的数据增强、特征聚合和3D场景集成，有效解决了跨视角地理定位中的视角差异问题，取得了优异的性能表现。

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization aims at establishing location correspondences
between different viewpoints. Existing approaches typically learn cross-view
correlations through direct feature similarity matching, often overlooking
semantic degradation caused by extreme viewpoint disparities. To address this
unique problem, we focus on robust feature retrieval under viewpoint variation
and propose the novel SkyLink method. We firstly utilize the Google Retrieval
Enhancement Module to perform data enhancement on street images, which
mitigates the occlusion of the key target due to restricted street viewpoints.
The Patch-Aware Feature Aggregation module is further adopted to emphasize
multiple local feature aggregations to ensure the consistent feature extraction
across viewpoints. Meanwhile, we integrate the 3D scene information constructed
from multi-scale UAV images as a bridge between street and satellite
viewpoints, and perform feature alignment through self-supervised and
cross-view contrastive learning. Experimental results demonstrate robustness
and generalization across diverse urban scenarios, which achieve 25.75$\%$
Recall@1 accuracy on University-1652 in the UAVM2025 Challenge. Code will be

TL;DR: LOVE-R1是一个自适应缩放的长视频理解模型，通过多步推理机制在时空感知之间取得平衡，在保持采样密度的同时动态调整帧分辨率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有大视频语言模型在长视频理解中面临的时空感知冲突问题，即均匀帧采样机制无法同时兼顾时间线索和空间细节。

Method: 提出慢-快自适应帧采样机制：先用小分辨率密集采样，当需要空间细节时，基于推理放大感兴趣片段；通过多步推理实现，并使用解耦强化微调优化内部缩放能力。

Result: 在4个常见长视频理解基准测试中，LOVE-R1平均比基线Qwen2.5-VL提升3.1个百分点，在采样密度和帧分辨率之间取得了良好平衡。

Conclusion: 自适应缩放机制有效解决了长视频理解中的时空权衡问题，多步推理和解耦强化微调显著提升了模型的细粒度视觉信息获取能力。

Abstract: Long video understanding is still challenging for recent Large Video-Language
Models (LVLMs) due to the conflict between long-form temporal understanding and
detailed spatial perception. LVLMs with a uniform frame sampling mechanism,
which samples frames with an equal frame size and fixed sampling rate,
inevitably sacrifice either temporal clues or spatial details, resulting in
suboptimal solutions. To mitigate this dilemma, we propose LOVE-R1, a model
that can adaptively zoom in on a video clip. The model is first provided with
densely sampled frames but in a small resolution. If some spatial details are
needed, the model can zoom in on a clip of interest with a large frame
resolution based on its reasoning until key visual information is obtained. The
whole process is implemented as a multi-step reasoning process. To train the
reasoning ability, we first finetune the model on our collected 38k
high-quality CoT data and enhance it with decoupled reinforcement finetuning.
As outcome rewards can not provide fine-grained process supervision, we
decouple multi-step reasoning into multiple single-step reasoning and optimize
the internal zoom-in ability explicitly. Experiments on long video
understanding benchmarks show that our model with the slow-fast adaptive frame
sampling mechanism achieves a great trade-off between sampling density and
frame resolutions, and LOVE-R1 outperforms our baseline Qwen2.5-VL by an
average of 3.1% points across 4 common long video understanding benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统单目深度估计方法受限于数据稀缺和质量问题，影响了模型的鲁棒性。需要一种能够生成大规模、多样化训练数据的方法来提升深度估计性能。

Method: 提出BRIDGE框架：1）使用RL优化的深度到图像生成技术合成大规模RGB-深度配对数据；2）采用混合监督策略，结合教师伪标签和真实深度数据进行训练。

Result: BRIDGE在规模和领域多样性方面取得突破，在定量评估和复杂场景细节捕捉方面持续优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该创新数据生成和训练范式能够培养通用且鲁棒的深度特征，为单目深度估计提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) is a foundational task for computer vision.
Traditional methods are limited by data scarcity and quality, hindering their

(D2I) generation framework that synthesizes over 20M realistic and
geometrically accurate RGB images, each intrinsically paired with its ground
truth depth, from diverse source depth maps. Then we train our depth estimation
model on this dataset, employing a hybrid supervision strategy that integrates
teacher pseudo-labels with ground truth depth for comprehensive and robust
training. This innovative data generation and training paradigm enables BRIDGE
to achieve breakthroughs in scale and domain diversity, consistently
outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches quantitatively and in
complex scene detail capture, thereby fostering general and robust depth
features. Code and models are available at

### [305] [Vision Function Layer in Multimodal LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24791)
*Cheng Shi,Yizhou Yu,Sibei Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究发现多模态大语言模型中的视觉功能解码分布在不同的解码器层，每个视觉功能（如计数、定位、OCR识别）集中在2-3个特定层（VFL），且这些层的深度顺序在不同模型间保持一致，与人类认知行为对齐。基于此提出了VFL-LoRA和VFL-select方法，显著提升模型性能和训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解多模态大语言模型中视觉相关功能的解码机制，探索不同解码器层在视觉处理中的具体功能分布，为模型优化提供理论基础。

Method: 提出视觉令牌交换分析框架，通过修改特定KV缓存条目来精确揭示解码过程中各层的功能；开发VFL-LoRA（针对VFL进行选择性训练）和VFL-select（基于VFL消融自动分类数据功能）方法。

Result: 发现视觉功能解码具有层次性分布特征，识别功能最先出现，其次是计数，最后是定位；VFL-LoRA优于全参数LoRA训练且防止功能遗忘；VFL-select仅用20%数据即可达到98%的全数据性能，超越人工数据选择效果。

Conclusion: 该研究深化了对MLLM视觉处理机制的理解，促进了更高效、可解释和鲁棒模型的发展，为下游应用提供了有效的优化策略。

Abstract: This study identifies that visual-related functional decoding is distributed
across different decoder layers in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs).
Typically, each function, such as counting, grounding, or OCR recognition,
narrows down to two or three layers, which we define as Vision Function Layers
(VFL). Additionally, the depth and its order of different VFLs exhibits a
consistent pattern across different MLLMs, which is well-aligned with human
behaviors (e.g., recognition occurs first, followed by counting, and then
grounding). These findings are derived from Visual Token Swapping, our novel
analytical framework that modifies targeted KV cache entries to precisely
elucidate layer-specific functions during decoding. Furthermore, these insights
offer substantial utility in tailoring MLLMs for real-world downstream
applications. For instance, when LoRA training is selectively applied to VFLs
whose functions align with the training data, VFL-LoRA not only outperform
full-LoRA but also prevent out-of-domain function forgetting. Moreover, by
analyzing the performance differential on training data when particular VFLs
are ablated, VFL-select automatically classifies data by function, enabling
highly efficient data selection to directly bolster corresponding capabilities.
Consequently, VFL-select surpasses human experts in data selection, and
achieves 98% of full-data performance with only 20% of the original dataset.
This study delivers deeper comprehension of MLLM visual processing, fostering
the creation of more efficient, interpretable, and robust models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统3D生成方法采用两阶段流程（先几何后外观），导致几何-纹理不对齐和额外成本。需要统一框架来同时处理几何和外观信息。

Method: 提出几何-外观统一VAE，将高分辨率稀疏特征压缩为紧凑的UniLat潜在表示；基于此训练单一流匹配模型，直接从高斯噪声映射到UniLat。

Conclusion: UniLat3D通过统一表示和单阶段生成，有效解决了传统方法的对齐问题，实现了高效高质量的3D资产生成。

Abstract: High-fidelity 3D asset generation is crucial for various industries. While
recent 3D pretrained models show strong capability in producing realistic
content, most are built upon diffusion models and follow a two-stage pipeline
that first generates geometry and then synthesizes appearance. Such a decoupled
design tends to produce geometry-texture misalignment and non-negligible cost.
In this paper, we propose UniLat3D, a unified framework that encodes geometry
and appearance in a single latent space, enabling direct single-stage
generation. Our key contribution is a geometry-appearance Unified VAE, which
compresses high-resolution sparse features into a compact latent representation
-- UniLat. UniLat integrates structural and visual information into a dense
low-resolution latent, which can be efficiently decoded into diverse 3D
formats, e.g., 3D Gaussians and meshes. Based on this unified representation,
we train a single flow-matching model to map Gaussian noise directly into
UniLat, eliminating redundant stages. Trained solely on public datasets,
UniLat3D produces high-quality 3D assets in seconds from a single image,
achieving superior appearance fidelity and geometric quality. More demos \&

<details>

Motivation: 3D物体分类在计算机视觉、机器人和自动驾驶等领域具有重要应用价值，但由于点云的无序性、不规则性和噪声，实现高精度分类仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 将点云转换为体素化二进制3D图像，提取区分性拓扑特征，然后使用轻量级一维卷积神经网络(1D CNN)进行训练。

Conclusion: TACO-Net通过结合拓扑特征和深度学习，为3D物体分类提供了新的SOTA解决方案，在合成和真实数据集上都表现出优异的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: 3D object classification is a crucial problem due to its significant
practical relevance in many fields, including computer vision, robotics, and
autonomous driving. Although deep learning methods applied to point clouds
sampled on CAD models of the objects and/or captured by LiDAR or RGBD cameras
have achieved remarkable success in recent years, achieving high classification
accuracy remains a challenging problem due to the unordered point clouds and
their irregularity and noise. To this end, we propose a novel state-of-the-art
(SOTA) 3D object classification technique that combines topological data
analysis with various image filtration techniques to classify objects when they
are represented using point clouds. We transform every point cloud into a
voxelized binary 3D image to extract distinguishing topological features. Next,
we train a lightweight one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D CNN)
using the extracted feature set from the training dataset. Our framework,
TACO-Net, sets a new state-of-the-art by achieving $99.05\%$ and $99.52\%$
accuracy on the widely used synthetic benchmarks ModelNet40 and ModelNet10, and
further demonstrates its robustness on the large-scale real-world OmniObject3D
dataset. When tested with ten different kinds of corrupted ModelNet40 inputs,
the proposed TACO-Net demonstrates strong resiliency overall.

TL;DR: UP2You是首个无需调参的解决方案，能够从极其无约束的野外2D照片中重建高保真3D着装人像。它通过数据校正器范式将非结构化输入转换为干净的正交多视角图像，并使用姿态相关特征聚合模块实现高效3D重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法需要"干净"输入（如全身图像或校准的多视角图像）的限制，直接处理原始、非结构化的野外照片，这些照片可能在姿态、视角、裁剪和遮挡方面差异很大。

Method: 引入数据校正器范式，在单次前向传播中高效将非约束输入转换为干净的正交多视角图像；使用姿态相关特征聚合模块（PCFA）选择性融合多参考图像信息；采用感知器基础的多参考形状预测器，无需预捕获的身体模板。

Result: 在4D-Dress、PuzzleIOI和野外捕获数据上的广泛实验表明，UP2You在几何精度（Chamfer-15%, P2S-18%）和纹理保真度（PSNR-21%, LPIPS-46%）上均优于先前方法，效率高（1.5分钟每人），支持任意姿态控制和免训练的多服装3D虚拟试穿。

Conclusion: UP2You为在随意拍摄人类照片的现实场景中提供了实用的3D重建解决方案，其模型和代码将公开发布以促进该未充分探索任务的研究。

Abstract: We present UP2You, the first tuning-free solution for reconstructing
high-fidelity 3D clothed portraits from extremely unconstrained in-the-wild 2D
photos. Unlike previous approaches that require "clean" inputs (e.g., full-body
images with minimal occlusions, or well-calibrated cross-view captures), UP2You
directly processes raw, unstructured photographs, which may vary significantly
in pose, viewpoint, cropping, and occlusion. Instead of compressing data into
tokens for slow online text-to-3D optimization, we introduce a data rectifier
paradigm that efficiently converts unconstrained inputs into clean, orthogonal
multi-view images in a single forward pass within seconds, simplifying the 3D
reconstruction. Central to UP2You is a pose-correlated feature aggregation
module (PCFA), that selectively fuses information from multiple reference
images w.r.t. target poses, enabling better identity preservation and nearly
constant memory footprint, with more observations. We also introduce a
perceiver-based multi-reference shape predictor, removing the need for
pre-captured body templates. Extensive experiments on 4D-Dress, PuzzleIOI, and
in-the-wild captures demonstrate that UP2You consistently surpasses previous
methods in both geometric accuracy (Chamfer-15%, P2S-18% on PuzzleIOI) and
texture fidelity (PSNR-21%, LPIPS-46% on 4D-Dress). UP2You is efficient (1.5
minutes per person), and versatile (supports arbitrary pose control, and
training-free multi-garment 3D virtual try-on), making it practical for
real-world scenarios where humans are casually captured. Both models and code
will be released to facilitate future research on this underexplored task.

Method: 使用零阶扰动在投影层估计token敏感度，通过轻量前向传播测量小随机扰动对投影输出的影响，无需反向传播

Result: 在多个VLM和基准测试中表现优于现有方法，剪枝高达94.4%的token同时保持精度，端到端推理速度提升最高达2.30倍

Conclusion: SensPrune是一种高效且有效的token剪枝框架，通过敏感度估计实现高性能视觉语言推理

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) enable strong multimodal reasoning but
incur heavy inference costs from redundant visual tokens. Token pruning
alleviates this issue, yet existing approaches face limitations.
Attention-based methods rely on raw attention scores, which are often unstable
across layers and heads and can lead to redundant selections. Diversity-based
methods improve robustness by selecting tokens far apart in feature space but
risk dropping regions needed for accurate prediction. We propose \ours, a
training-free framework built on a simple intuition: tokens with higher
sensitivity are more likely to influence the model's output, and they should
also capture complementary visual cues rather than overlapping information. To
achieve this, we estimate token sensitivity using zeroth-order perturbations at
the projection layer, a shallow and computationally light component of the
model. This approach measures how small random perturbations affect the
projection outputs, allowing us to approximate each token's influence through
lightweight forward passes without backpropagation. Extensive experiments
across multiple VLMs and benchmarks show that \ours consistently outperforms
prior methods, pruning up to 94.4\% of tokens while maintaining accuracy and
significantly improving efficiency, achieving up to 2.30x faster end-to-end
inference over the baseline.

Motivation: 扩散模型生成质量高但采样速度慢，流匹配与扩散模型在理论上等价，但不确定蒸馏技术是否可以直接迁移到流匹配模型。

Method: 基于贝叶斯规则和条件期望的简单推导统一高斯扩散和流匹配，将分数身份蒸馏(SiD)扩展到预训练文本到图像流匹配模型。

Conclusion: 分数蒸馏技术可广泛应用于文本到图像流匹配模型，解决了之前关于稳定性和合理性的担忧，统一了扩散和流基生成器的加速技术。

Abstract: Diffusion models achieve high-quality image generation but are limited by
slow iterative sampling. Distillation methods alleviate this by enabling one-
or few-step generation. Flow matching, originally introduced as a distinct
framework, has since been shown to be theoretically equivalent to diffusion
under Gaussian assumptions, raising the question of whether distillation
techniques such as score distillation transfer directly. We provide a simple
derivation -- based on Bayes' rule and conditional expectations -- that unifies
Gaussian diffusion and flow matching without relying on ODE/SDE formulations.
Building on this view, we extend Score identity Distillation (SiD) to
pretrained text-to-image flow-matching models, including SANA, SD3-Medium,
SD3.5-Medium/Large, and FLUX.1-dev, all with DiT backbones. Experiments show
that, with only modest flow-matching- and DiT-specific adjustments, SiD works
out of the box across these models, in both data-free and data-aided settings,
without requiring teacher finetuning or architectural changes. This provides
the first systematic evidence that score distillation applies broadly to
text-to-image flow matching models, resolving prior concerns about stability
and soundness and unifying acceleration techniques across diffusion- and
flow-based generators. We will make the PyTorch implementation publicly
available.

Conclusion: 提供了一种理论扎实且实用的rPPG解决方案，为基于物理的生理监测方法开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) measurement enables non-contact
physiological monitoring but suffers from accuracy degradation under head
motion and illumination changes. Existing deep learning methods are mostly
heuristic and lack theoretical grounding, which limits robustness and
interpretability. In this work, we propose a physics-informed rPPG paradigm
derived from the Navier-Stokes equations of hemodynamics, showing that the
pulse signal follows a second-order dynamical system whose discrete solution
naturally leads to a causal convolution. This provides a theoretical
justification for using a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN). Based on this
principle, we design PHASE-Net, a lightweight model with three key components:
(1) Zero-FLOPs Axial Swapper module, which swaps or transposes a few spatial
channels to mix distant facial regions and enhance cross-region feature
interaction without breaking temporal order; (2) Adaptive Spatial Filter, which
learns a soft spatial mask per frame to highlight signal-rich areas and
suppress noise; and (3) Gated TCN, a causal dilated TCN with gating that models
long-range temporal dynamics for accurate pulse recovery. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that PHASE-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance with strong
efficiency, offering a theoretically grounded and deployment-ready rPPG
solution.

TL;DR: 提出了ELPG-DTFS模型，一种基于先验引导的自适应时频图神经网络，用于抑郁症的EEG诊断，在MODMA数据集上达到97.63%准确率和97.33% F1分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前抑郁症诊断依赖主观量表，EEG提供低成本生物标志物，但现有深度模型将频谱视为静态图像、固定通道间图结构、忽略先验知识，限制了准确性和可解释性。

Method: 引入通道-频带注意力机制与跨频带互信息、可学习邻接矩阵用于动态功能连接、残差知识图路径注入神经科学先验。

Result: 在128通道MODMA数据集（53名受试者）上，ELPG-DTFS达到97.63%准确率和97.33% F1分数，超越2025年最先进的ACM-GNN。消融实验显示移除任何模块都会使F1降低高达4.35。

Conclusion: ELPG-DTFS为基于EEG的新一代抑郁症诊断提供了一个鲁棒且可解释的框架。

Abstract: Timely and objective screening of major depressive disorder (MDD) is vital,
yet diagnosis still relies on subjective scales. Electroencephalography (EEG)
provides a low-cost biomarker, but existing deep models treat spectra as static
images, fix inter-channel graphs, and ignore prior knowledge, limiting accuracy
and interpretability. We propose ELPG-DTFS, a prior-guided adaptive
time-frequency graph neural network that introduces: (1) channel-band attention
with cross-band mutual information, (2) a learnable adjacency matrix for
dynamic functional links, and (3) a residual knowledge-graph pathway injecting
neuroscience priors. On the 128-channel MODMA dataset (53 subjects), ELPG-DTFS
achieves 97.63% accuracy and 97.33% F1, surpassing the 2025 state-of-the-art
ACM-GNN. Ablation shows that removing any module lowers F1 by up to 4.35,
confirming their complementary value. ELPG-DTFS thus offers a robust and
interpretable framework for next-generation EEG-based MDD diagnostics.

Conclusion: F³是一种高效、鲁棒的事件数据表示方法，适用于多种机器人平台、光照条件和环境，在多个视觉任务中表现出色。

Abstract: This paper develops a mathematical argument and algorithms for building
representations of data from event-based cameras, that we call Fast Feature
Field ($\text{F}^3$). We learn this representation by predicting future events
from past events and show that it preserves scene structure and motion
information. $\text{F}^3$ exploits the sparsity of event data and is robust to
noise and variations in event rates. It can be computed efficiently using ideas
from multi-resolution hash encoding and deep sets - achieving 120 Hz at HD and
440 Hz at VGA resolutions. $\text{F}^3$ represents events within a contiguous
spatiotemporal volume as a multi-channel image, enabling a range of downstream
tasks. We obtain state-of-the-art performance on optical flow estimation,
semantic segmentation, and monocular metric depth estimation, on data from
three robotic platforms (a car, a quadruped robot and a flying platform),
across different lighting conditions (daytime, nighttime), environments
(indoors, outdoors, urban, as well as off-road) and dynamic vision sensors
(resolutions and event rates). Our implementations can predict these tasks at
25-75 Hz at HD resolution.

Method: 对RGB、灰度图和颜色对立通道应用DoG滤波，增强局部对比度，这种预处理方法轻量且与模型无关。

Result: 在Cityscapes、ACDC和Dark Zurich数据集上的评估表明，该方法在保持分布内性能的同时，显著提升了在夜间、雾天和雪天等恶劣条件下的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 这种轻量级、模型无关的预处理方法有潜力集成到成像管道中，为安全关键环境中的下游视觉模型提供任务就绪的鲁棒输入。

Abstract: Inspired by the human visual system's mechanisms for contrast enhancement and
color-opponency, we explore biologically motivated input preprocessing for
robust semantic segmentation. By applying Difference-of-Gaussians (DoG)
filtering to RGB, grayscale, and opponent-color channels, we enhance local
contrast without modifying model architecture or training. Evaluations on
Cityscapes, ACDC, and Dark Zurich show that such preprocessing maintains
in-distribution performance while improving robustness to adverse conditions
like night, fog, and snow. As this processing is model-agnostic and
lightweight, it holds potential for integration into imaging pipelines,
enabling imaging systems to deliver task-ready, robust inputs for downstream
vision models in safety-critical environments.

Motivation: 解决多模态大语言模型在实时流式视频理解中的存储限制和历史视觉特征不足问题，提升实时时空推理能力。

Method: 提出持久事件记忆森林机制，基于时间距离、内容相似度和合并频率的惩罚函数自适应组织视频帧为事件级树结构；引入细粒度时空窗口捕获短期视觉线索；构建OnlineIT指令调优数据集。

Result: 在StreamingBench上达到77.3%准确率，OVBench上60.5%，OVO-Bench上55.6%；在极端视觉token压缩（1024个token）下仍保持96.8%的平均准确率。

Conclusion: StreamForest在流式视频理解中展现出强大的鲁棒性、高效性和泛化能力，为实际应用提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently achieved remarkable
progress in video understanding. However, their effectiveness in real-time
streaming scenarios remains limited due to storage constraints of historical
visual features and insufficient real-time spatiotemporal reasoning. To address
these challenges, we propose StreamForest, a novel architecture specifically
designed for streaming video understanding. Central to StreamForest is the
Persistent Event Memory Forest, a memory mechanism that adaptively organizes
video frames into multiple event-level tree structures. This process is guided
by penalty functions based on temporal distance, content similarity, and merge
frequency, enabling efficient long-term memory retention under limited
computational resources. To enhance real-time perception, we introduce a
Fine-grained Spatiotemporal Window, which captures detailed short-term visual
cues to improve current scene perception. Additionally, we present OnlineIT, an
instruction-tuning dataset tailored for streaming video tasks. OnlineIT
significantly boosts MLLM performance in both real-time perception and future
prediction. To evaluate generalization in practical applications, we introduce
ODV-Bench, a new benchmark focused on real-time streaming video understanding
in autonomous driving scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that
StreamForest achieves the state-of-the-art performance, with accuracies of
77.3% on StreamingBench, 60.5% on OVBench, and 55.6% on OVO-Bench. In
particular, even under extreme visual token compression (limited to 1024
tokens), the model retains 96.8% of its average accuracy in eight benchmarks
relative to the default setting. These results underscore the robustness,
efficiency, and generalizability of StreamForest for streaming video
understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于环境上下文的新型扩散模型，能够通过文本、元数据和视觉数据三种控制信号的任意组合生成卫星图像，解决了现有方法在环境上下文有限、数据缺失和用户意图反映不足等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型在遥感领域应用时面临环境上下文有限、处理缺失或损坏数据困难、难以可靠反映用户意图等限制，需要改进以更好地利用多模态公开数据集。

Method: 开发了条件扩散模型，可基于动态环境条件作为控制信号，并采用元数据融合策略建模属性嵌入交互来处理部分损坏或缺失的观测数据。

Result: 在单图像和时间序列生成试验中，该方法在定性和定量评估（使用6种不同指标）均优于先前方法，具有更高的保真度、准确性和生成质量。

Conclusion: 环境上下文条件化能够提升卫星图像基础模型的性能，该模型有望用于下游任务，同时构建了首个公开可用的三模态数据集。

Abstract: Diffusion-based foundation models have recently garnered much attention in
the field of generative modeling due to their ability to generate images of
high quality and fidelity. Although not straightforward, their recent
application to the field of remote sensing signaled the first successful trials
towards harnessing the large volume of publicly available datasets containing
multimodal information. Despite their success, existing methods face
considerable limitations: they rely on limited environmental context, struggle
with missing or corrupted data, and often fail to reliably reflect user
intentions in generated outputs. In this work, we propose a novel diffusion
model conditioned on environmental context, that is able to generate satellite
images by conditioning from any combination of three different control signals:
a) text, b) metadata, and c) visual data. In contrast to previous works, the
proposed method is i) to our knowledge, the first of its kind to condition
satellite image generation on dynamic environmental conditions as part of its
control signals, and ii) incorporating a metadata fusion strategy that models
attribute embedding interactions to account for partially corrupt and/or
missing observations. Our method outperforms previous methods both
qualitatively (robustness to missing metadata, higher responsiveness to control
inputs) and quantitatively (higher fidelity, accuracy, and quality of
generations measured using 6 different metrics) in the trials of single-image
and temporal generation. The reported results support our hypothesis that
conditioning on environmental context can improve the performance of foundation
models for satellite imagery, and render our model a promising candidate for
usage in downstream tasks. The collected 3-modal dataset is to our knowledge,
the first publicly-available dataset to combine data from these three different
mediums.

TL;DR: ThermalGen是一个基于流的生成模型，用于从RGB图像合成热成像图像，解决了RGB-热成像配对数据稀缺的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 同步校准的RGB-热成像配对数据稀缺，限制了多模态图像对齐和检索等应用的发展，需要一种能够从丰富的RGB数据生成热成像的方法。

Method: 提出自适应基于流的生成模型ThermalGen，包含RGB图像条件架构和风格解耦机制，并构建了多个大规模RGB-T配对数据集。

Result: 在多个RGB-T基准测试中，ThermalGen实现了与现有GAN和扩散方法相当或更优的翻译性能，能够合成反映视角、传感器特性和环境条件变化的真实热成像。

Conclusion: ThermalGen是首个能够合成具有显著视角、传感器特性和环境条件变化的热成像的RGB-T图像翻译模型，为多模态视觉任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Paired RGB-thermal data is crucial for visual-thermal sensor fusion and
cross-modality tasks, including important applications such as multi-modal
image alignment and retrieval. However, the scarcity of synchronized and
calibrated RGB-thermal image pairs presents a major obstacle to progress in
these areas. To overcome this challenge, RGB-to-Thermal (RGB-T) image
translation has emerged as a promising solution, enabling the synthesis of
thermal images from abundant RGB datasets for training purposes. In this study,
we propose ThermalGen, an adaptive flow-based generative model for RGB-T image
translation, incorporating an RGB image conditioning architecture and a
style-disentangled mechanism. To support large-scale training, we curated eight
public satellite-aerial, aerial, and ground RGB-T paired datasets, and
introduced three new large-scale satellite-aerial RGB-T datasets--DJI-day,
Bosonplus-day, and Bosonplus-night--captured across diverse times, sensor
types, and geographic regions. Extensive evaluations across multiple RGB-T
benchmarks demonstrate that ThermalGen achieves comparable or superior
translation performance compared to existing GAN-based and diffusion-based
methods. To our knowledge, ThermalGen is the first RGB-T image translation
model capable of synthesizing thermal images that reflect significant
variations in viewpoints, sensor characteristics, and environmental conditions.

TL;DR: GHOST是一种自动生成诱导多模态大语言模型产生物体幻觉图像的方法，通过优化图像嵌入空间来误导模型，无需人工监督。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型存在物体幻觉问题，但现有基准测试使用固定视觉场景，无法发现模型特定或未预见的幻觉漏洞。

Method: 在图像嵌入空间进行优化以误导模型，同时保持目标对象缺失，然后引导扩散模型基于嵌入生成自然图像。

Result: 在包括GLM-4.1V-Thinking在内的多个模型上，幻觉成功率超过28%，远高于先前数据驱动方法的约1%。为Qwen2.5-VL优化的图像在GPT-4o中诱导幻觉的成功率达66.5%。

Conclusion: GHOST既是诊断工具也是纠正工具，通过在其生成的图像上进行微调可以减轻幻觉问题，有助于构建更可靠的多模态系统。

Abstract: Object hallucination in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is a
persistent failure mode that causes the model to perceive objects absent in the
image. This weakness of MLLMs is currently studied using static benchmarks with
fixed visual scenarios, which preempts the possibility of uncovering
model-specific or unanticipated hallucination vulnerabilities. We introduce
GHOST (Generating Hallucinations via Optimizing Stealth Tokens), a method
designed to stress-test MLLMs by actively generating images that induce
hallucination. GHOST is fully automatic and requires no human supervision or
prior knowledge. It operates by optimizing in the image embedding space to
mislead the model while keeping the target object absent, and then guiding a
diffusion model conditioned on the embedding to generate natural-looking
images. The resulting images remain visually natural and close to the original
input, yet introduce subtle misleading cues that cause the model to
hallucinate. We evaluate our method across a range of models, including
reasoning models like GLM-4.1V-Thinking, and achieve a hallucination success
rate exceeding 28%, compared to around 1% in prior data-driven discovery
methods. We confirm that the generated images are both high-quality and
object-free through quantitative metrics and human evaluation. Also, GHOST
uncovers transferable vulnerabilities: images optimized for Qwen2.5-VL induce
hallucinations in GPT-4o at a 66.5% rate. Finally, we show that fine-tuning on
our images mitigates hallucination, positioning GHOST as both a diagnostic and
corrective tool for building more reliable multimodal systems.

TL;DR: DC-Gen是一个通过深度压缩潜在空间来加速文本到图像扩散模型的通用框架，在保持基础模型质量的同时显著提升生成速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到图像扩散模型在高分辨率（如4K）图像生成时面临效率挑战，而现有研究很少处理潜在空间中的内在冗余问题。

Method: 采用后训练管道，首先通过轻量级嵌入对齐训练来弥合基础模型潜在空间与深度压缩潜在空间之间的表示差距，然后仅需少量LoRA微调即可解锁基础模型的生成质量。

Result: 在SANA和FLUX.1-Krea上验证了有效性，DC-Gen-FLUX在NVIDIA H100 GPU上将4K图像生成延迟降低了53倍，结合NVFP4 SVDQuant后，在单张NVIDIA 5090 GPU上仅需3.5秒生成4K图像，总延迟降低138倍。

Conclusion: DC-Gen框架能够在不牺牲生成质量的前提下，显著加速文本到图像扩散模型，特别是高分辨率图像生成任务。

Abstract: Existing text-to-image diffusion models excel at generating high-quality
images, but face significant efficiency challenges when scaled to high
resolutions, like 4K image generation. While previous research accelerates
diffusion models in various aspects, it seldom handles the inherent redundancy
within the latent space. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces DC-Gen, a
general framework that accelerates text-to-image diffusion models by leveraging
a deeply compressed latent space. Rather than a costly training-from-scratch
approach, DC-Gen uses an efficient post-training pipeline to preserve the
quality of the base model. A key challenge in this paradigm is the
representation gap between the base model's latent space and a deeply
compressed latent space, which can lead to instability during direct
fine-tuning. To overcome this, DC-Gen first bridges the representation gap with
a lightweight embedding alignment training. Once the latent embeddings are
aligned, only a small amount of LoRA fine-tuning is needed to unlock the base
model's inherent generation quality. We verify DC-Gen's effectiveness on SANA
and FLUX.1-Krea. The resulting DC-Gen-SANA and DC-Gen-FLUX models achieve
quality comparable to their base models but with a significant speedup.
Specifically, DC-Gen-FLUX reduces the latency of 4K image generation by 53x on
the NVIDIA H100 GPU. When combined with NVFP4 SVDQuant, DC-Gen-FLUX generates a
4K image in just 3.5 seconds on a single NVIDIA 5090 GPU, achieving a total
latency reduction of 138x compared to the base FLUX.1-Krea model. Code:

Motivation: 当前对判别模型的对抗攻击研究较多，但对生成管道的攻击研究较少，特别是那些输入微小扰动就能控制输出变化的攻击方法。

Method: 结合模块化扰动网络PoisonerNet与生成器-判别器对，制作隐蔽触发器；使用自定义代理指标评估攻击效果，通过感知和频域分析评估隐蔽性；在ControlNet引导的编辑中测试方法可迁移性。

Result: 中毒输出可能比干净输出具有更高的视觉质量；潜在空间中毒可以保持甚至增强输出美学；优化的扰动能在生成器输出中产生一致且隐蔽的效果。

Conclusion: 潜在空间中毒暴露了像素级防御的盲点，对图像生成管道的完整性构成威胁，挑战了中毒必然降低保真度的假设。

Abstract: Generative models such as GANs and diffusion models are widely used to
synthesize photorealistic images and to support downstream creative and editing
tasks. While adversarial attacks on discriminative models are well studied,
attacks targeting generative pipelines where small, stealthy perturbations in
inputs lead to controlled changes in outputs are less explored. This study
introduces VagueGAN, an attack pipeline combining a modular perturbation
network PoisonerNet with a Generator Discriminator pair to craft stealthy
triggers that cause targeted changes in generated images. Attack efficacy is
evaluated using a custom proxy metric, while stealth is analyzed through
perceptual and frequency domain measures. The transferability of the method to
a modern diffusion based pipeline is further examined through ControlNet guided
editing. Interestingly, the experiments show that poisoned outputs can display
higher visual quality compared to clean counterparts, challenging the
assumption that poisoning necessarily reduces fidelity. Unlike conventional
pixel level perturbations, latent space poisoning in GANs and diffusion
pipelines can retain or even enhance output aesthetics, exposing a blind spot
in pixel level defenses. Moreover, carefully optimized perturbations can
produce consistent, stealthy effects on generator outputs while remaining
visually inconspicuous, raising concerns for the integrity of image generation
pipelines.

Abstract: We introduce DC-VideoGen, a post-training acceleration framework for
efficient video generation. DC-VideoGen can be applied to any pre-trained video

innovations: (i) a Deep Compression Video Autoencoder with a novel chunk-causal
temporal design that achieves 32x/64x spatial and 4x temporal compression while
preserving reconstruction quality and generalization to longer videos; and (ii)
AE-Adapt-V, a robust adaptation strategy that enables rapid and stable transfer
of pre-trained models into the new latent space. Adapting the pre-trained
Wan-2.1-14B model with DC-VideoGen requires only 10 GPU days on the NVIDIA H100

Conclusion: DWGS通过结构约束、虚拟视图和遮挡补全有效提升了稀疏视图下的3D高斯溅射性能，实现了最先进的稀疏视图合成效果。

Abstract: Novel View Synthesis (NVS) from sparse views remains a core challenge in 3D
reconstruction, typically suffering from overfitting, geometric distortion, and
incomplete scene recovery due to limited multi-view constraints. Although 3D
Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables real-time, high-fidelity rendering, it
suffers from floating artifacts and structural inconsistencies under
sparse-input settings. To address these issues, we propose DWGS, a novel
unified framework that enhances 3DGS for sparse-view synthesis by integrating
robust structural cues, virtual view constraints, and occluded region
completion. Our approach introduces three principal contributions: a
Hybrid-Loss Depth Estimation module that leverages dense matching priors with
reprojection, point propagation, and smoothness constraints to enforce
multi-view consistency; a Bidirectional Warping Virtual View Synthesis method
generates virtual training views to impose stronger geometric and photometric
constraints; and an Occlusion-Aware Reconstruction component that utilizes
depth-difference mask and a learning-based inpainting model to recover obscured
regions. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks (LLFF, Blender, and DTU)
show that DWGS achieves a new state-of-the-art, achieving up to 21.13 dB PSNR
and 0.189 LPIPS, while retaining real-time inference capabilities.

Motivation: 现有方法将视觉语言模型监督和数据监督视为独立来源，缺乏有效融合，限制了源自由主动域适应的效果。

Method: DAM框架整合多模态监督，初始化稳定的视觉语言模型引导目标，采用双向蒸馏机制在迭代适应过程中促进目标模型与双重监督之间的知识交换。

Conclusion: DAM框架通过有效融合多模态监督与人工标注，在源自由主动域适应中实现了显著性能提升，证明了双重监督信号融合的有效性。

Abstract: Source-free active domain adaptation (SFADA) enhances knowledge transfer from
a source model to an unlabeled target domain using limited manual labels
selected via active learning. While recent domain adaptation studies have
introduced Vision-and-Language (ViL) models to improve pseudo-label quality or
feature alignment, they often treat ViL-based and data supervision as separate
sources, lacking effective fusion. To overcome this limitation, we propose Dual
Active learning with Multimodal (DAM) foundation model, a novel framework that
integrates multimodal supervision from a ViL model to complement sparse human
annotations, thereby forming a dual supervisory signal. DAM initializes stable
ViL-guided targets and employs a bidirectional distillation mechanism to foster
mutual knowledge exchange between the target model and the dual supervisions
during iterative adaptation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DAM
consistently outperforms existing methods and sets a new state-of-the-art

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于青少年特发性脊柱侧弯评估的新型深度学习框架，能够同时预测椎体上下终板角度和中点坐标，通过SVD分析椎体形态直接计算角度，无需预设曲线模式，在630张全脊柱X光片上达到83.45%的诊断准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统手动测量Cobb角存在显著的观察者间变异性，现有自动化方法使用简化的脊柱模型和预设曲线模式，无法应对临床复杂性。

Method: 结合HRNet骨干网络和Swin-Transformer模块，加入生物力学约束增强特征提取，使用奇异值分解(SVD)从椎体形态直接分析角度预测，灵活检测多样化的脊柱侧弯模式。

Result: 在630张10-18岁患者全脊柱X光片上达到83.45%诊断准确率和2.55°平均绝对误差，框架在分布外病例上表现出优异的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 新提出的椎体楔形指数(VWI)与曲线进展有显著预后相关性，而传统Cobb角无相关性，为早期AIS检测、个性化治疗规划和进展监测提供了有力支持。

Abstract: Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is a common spinal deformity affecting
approximately 2.2% of boys and 4.8% of girls worldwide. The Cobb angle serves
as the gold standard for AIS severity assessment, yet traditional manual
measurements suffer from significant observer variability, compromising
diagnostic accuracy. Despite prior automation attempts, existing methods use
simplified spinal models and predetermined curve patterns that fail to address
clinical complexity. We present a novel deep learning framework for AIS
assessment that simultaneously predicts both superior and inferior endplate
angles with corresponding midpoint coordinates for each vertebra, preserving
the anatomical reality of vertebral wedging in progressive AIS. Our approach
combines an HRNet backbone with Swin-Transformer modules and biomechanically
informed constraints for enhanced feature extraction. We employ Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD) to analyze angle predictions directly from vertebral
morphology, enabling flexible detection of diverse scoliosis patterns without
predefined curve assumptions. Using 630 full-spine anteroposterior radiographs
from patients aged 10-18 years with rigorous dual-rater annotation, our method
achieved 83.45% diagnostic accuracy and 2.55{\deg} mean absolute error. The
framework demonstrates exceptional generalization capability on
out-of-distribution cases. Additionally, we introduce the Vertebral Wedging
Index (VWI), a novel metric quantifying vertebral deformation. Longitudinal
analysis revealed VWI's significant prognostic correlation with curve
progression while traditional Cobb angles showed no correlation, providing
robust support for early AIS detection, personalized treatment planning, and
progression monitoring.

TL;DR: Attention Surgery是一个无需从头训练就能将预训练视频扩散模型中的注意力机制线性化或混合化的高效框架，在保持生成质量的同时将注意力计算成本降低高达40%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于Transformer的视频扩散模型虽然生成质量优秀，但受到自注意力二次方计算成本的限制，使得长序列和高分辨率视频生成计算代价高昂。

Method: 结合新型混合注意力机制（混合softmax和线性token）与轻量级蒸馏和微调流程，并采用成本感知的块率策略来平衡各层的表达能力和效率。

Result: 在Wan2.1 1.3B模型上应用Attention Surgery，在标准VBench和VBench-2.0基准测试中保持生成质量的同时，将注意力计算成本降低高达40%。

Conclusion: 该方法首次实现了具有竞争力的次二次方注意力视频扩散模型，为高效视频生成提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Transformer-based video diffusion models (VDMs) deliver state-of-the-art
video generation quality but are constrained by the quadratic cost of
self-attention, making long sequences and high resolutions computationally
expensive. While linear attention offers sub-quadratic complexity, prior
attempts fail to match the expressiveness of softmax attention without costly
retraining. We introduce \textit{Attention Surgery}, an efficient framework for
\textit{linearizing} or \textit{hybridizing} attention in pretrained VDMs
without training from scratch. Inspired by recent advances in language models,
our method combines a novel hybrid attention mechanism-mixing softmax and
linear tokens-with a lightweight distillation and fine-tuning pipeline
requiring only a few GPU-days. Additionally, we incorporate a cost-aware
block-rate strategy to balance expressiveness and efficiency across layers.
Applied to Wan2.1 1.3B, a state-of-the-art DiT-based VDM, Attention Surgery
achieves the first competitive sub-quadratic attention video diffusion models,
reducing attention cost by up to 40\% in terms of FLOPs, while maintaining
generation quality as measured on the standard VBench and VBench-2.0
benchmarks.

TL;DR: SID是一种目标导向的语言引导导航学习方法，通过自我改进的演示来提升智能体的探索能力。该方法通过迭代训练，让智能体生成更好的探索轨迹来训练更强的导航智能体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要使用最短路径轨迹，缺乏有效的探索先验来训练导航智能体。目标导向的语言引导导航需要在未知环境中进行鲁棒探索。

Method: 首先在环境采样的最短路径数据上训练初始智能体，然后利用该智能体生成新颖的探索轨迹。这些轨迹提供更强的探索策略演示，用于训练更好的智能体，形成迭代自我改进的管道。

Result: SID显著提升了导航智能体的探索能力和泛化性能，在REVERIE和SOON等任务上实现了新的最先进性能，在SOON未见验证集上达到50.9%的成功率，比之前领先方法高出13.9%。

Conclusion: 自我改进的演示管道能够扩展到新环境，产生的演示可以跨各种语言引导导航任务转移，提升了目标导向导航任务的性能上限。

Abstract: Goal-oriented language-guided navigation requires robust exploration
capabilities for agents to navigate to specified goals in unknown environments
without step-by-step instructions. Existing methods tend to exclusively utilize
shortest-path trajectories, lacking effective exploration priors for training
navigation agents. To address the above challenges, we present SID, a
goal-oriented language-guided navigation learning approach with Self-Improving
Demonstrations. Specifically, SID learns an initial agent on the shortest-path
data sampled from environments and then leverages this agent to generate novel
exploration trajectories. The novel rollouts provide demonstrations with
stronger exploration strategies to train a better agent, which in turn produces
higher-quality agent demonstrations for the next round of training. We show
that this iterative self-improving pipeline readily scales to new environments,
and the resulting demonstrations can be transferred across a variety of
language-guided navigation tasks, elevating the performance ceiling in diverse
goal-oriented navigation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SID
significantly boosts the exploration capabilities and generalization of
navigation agents. The resulting agent achieves new state-of-the-art
performance on goal-oriented language-guided navigation tasks, including
REVERIE, SOON, notably achieving a 50.9% success rate on the unseen validation
splits of SOON, surpassing the prior leading approaches by a margin of 13.9%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长视频具有时间复杂性和任务相关信息稀疏的特点，现有LLM方法在捕捉任务关键信息时难以兼顾完整性和效率。

Method: 采用多粒度感知代理模拟人类视觉的分散和集中注意力来捕捉任务相关信息，验证增强反思代理验证感知的关键线索以减少幻觉并优化后续感知策略。

Result: 在EgoSchema、Video-MME、NExT-QA和MovieChat数据集上表现出优越的准确性和效率，在EgoSchema上仅使用11.2帧就超越现有无训练方法，性能接近Gemini 1.5-Pro。

Conclusion: CogniGPT通过模拟人类渐进视觉认知的交互框架，能够探索最小化但信息丰富可靠的任务相关线索，实现高效准确的长视频理解。

Abstract: Long videos, characterized by temporal complexity and sparse task-relevant
information, pose significant reasoning challenges for AI systems. Although
various Large Language Model (LLM)-based approaches have advanced long video
understanding, they still struggle to achieve both completeness and efficiency
in capturing task-critical information. Inspired by human progressive visual
cognition, we propose CogniGPT, a framework that leverages an interactive loop
between Multi-Granular Perception Agent (MGPA) and Verification-Enhanced
Reflection Agent (VERA) for efficient and reliable long video understanding.
Specifically, MGPA mimics human visual divergent and focused attention to
capture task-related information, while VERA verifies perceived key clues to
mitigate hallucination and optimize subsequent perception strategies. Through
this interactive process, CogniGPT explores a minimal set of informative and
reliable task-related clues. Extensive experiments on EgoSchema, Video-MME,
NExT-QA, and MovieChat datasets demonstrate CogniGPT's superiority in both
accuracy and efficiency. Notably, on EgoSchema, it surpasses existing
training-free methods using only 11.2 frames and achieves performance
comparable to Gemini 1.5-Pro.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习在医学影像等高风险领域需要精确的置信度估计，过度自信的错误分类可能带来严重后果。

Method: 构建自定义CNN模型，在合并的脑MRI数据集上训练，引入五种图像噪声模拟真实不确定性，使用温度缩放进行后处理校准。

Result: TS在所有噪声条件下都显著降低了ECE和NLL，且不损害分类准确率。

Conclusion: 温度缩放是提升医疗AI系统决策置信度的有效且计算高效的方法，使模型在噪声或不确定环境中输出更可靠。

Abstract: Precise confidence estimation in deep learning is vital for high-stakes
fields like medical imaging, where overconfident misclassifications can have
serious consequences. This work evaluates the effectiveness of Temperature
Scaling (TS), a post-hoc calibration technique, in improving the reliability of
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for brain tumor classification. We develop
a custom CNN and train it on a merged brain MRI dataset. To simulate real-world
uncertainty, five types of image noise are introduced: Gaussian, Poisson, Salt
& Pepper, Speckle, and Uniform. Model performance is evaluated using precision,
recall, F1-score, accuracy, negative log-likelihood (NLL), and expected
calibration error (ECE), both before and after calibration. Results demonstrate
that TS significantly reduces ECE and NLL under all noise conditions without
degrading classification accuracy. This underscores TS as an effective and
computationally efficient approach to enhance decision confidence of medical AI
systems, hence making model outputs more reliable in noisy or uncertain
settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Social 3D Scene Graphs，一种增强的3D场景图表示，用于捕捉人类及其在环境中的属性、活动和关系，并创建了包含全面人-场景关系标注的新基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D场景图方法大多忽略场景中的人类，缺乏标注的人-环境关系数据，且仅从单帧图像捕获开放词汇关系，限制了建模超出观察内容的长期交互能力。

Method: 引入Social 3D Scene Graphs表示，使用开放词汇框架捕捉人类及其属性、活动和环境关系（包括本地和远程关系），并创建包含多样化查询的新基准。

Result: 实验表明，该表示提高了人类活动预测能力和对人类-环境关系的推理能力。

Conclusion: 这项工作为构建具有社会智能的机器人铺平了道路。

Abstract: Understanding how people interact with their surroundings and each other is
essential for enabling robots to act in socially compliant and context-aware
ways. While 3D Scene Graphs have emerged as a powerful semantic representation
for scene understanding, existing approaches largely ignore humans in the
scene, also due to the lack of annotated human-environment relationships.
Moreover, existing methods typically capture only open-vocabulary relations
from single image frames, which limits their ability to model long-range
interactions beyond the observed content. We introduce Social 3D Scene Graphs,
an augmented 3D Scene Graph representation that captures humans, their
attributes, activities and relationships in the environment, both local and
remote, using an open-vocabulary framework. Furthermore, we introduce a new
benchmark consisting of synthetic environments with comprehensive human-scene
relationship annotations and diverse types of queries for evaluating social
scene understanding in 3D. The experiments demonstrate that our representation
improves human activity prediction and reasoning about human-environment
relations, paving the way toward socially intelligent robots.

TL;DR: 提出基于跨模态融合注意力和自监督多事件表示学习的新框架，用于事件相机的人脸关键点对齐，在真实和合成事件数据集上超越现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件相机在低光和快速运动条件下具有优势，但现有RGB方法在事件数据上表现不佳，且缺乏标注事件数据集限制了该领域发展。

Method: 使用跨模态融合注意力(CMFA)整合RGB数据指导特征提取，同时采用自监督多事件表示学习(SSMER)从无标签事件数据中学习特征。

Result: 在真实E-SIE数据集和合成WFLW-V基准测试中，该方法在多个评估指标上持续超越最先进方法。

Conclusion: 所提框架有效解决了事件数据空间信息有限和标注数据缺乏的问题，显著提升了事件相机人脸关键点对齐性能。

Abstract: Event cameras offer unique advantages for facial keypoint alignment under
challenging conditions, such as low light and rapid motion, due to their high
temporal resolution and robustness to varying illumination. However, existing
RGB facial keypoint alignment methods do not perform well on event data, and
training solely on event data often leads to suboptimal performance because of
its limited spatial information. Moreover, the lack of comprehensive labeled
event datasets further hinders progress in this area. To address these issues,
we propose a novel framework based on cross-modal fusion attention (CMFA) and
self-supervised multi-event representation learning (SSMER) for event-based
facial keypoint alignment. Our framework employs CMFA to integrate
corresponding RGB data, guiding the model to extract robust facial features
from event input images. In parallel, SSMER enables effective feature learning
from unlabeled event data, overcoming spatial limitations. Extensive
experiments on our real-event E-SIE dataset and a synthetic-event version of
the public WFLW-V benchmark show that our approach consistently surpasses
state-of-the-art methods across multiple evaluation metrics.

TL;DR: 提出了一种动态插入合成肿瘤的在线增强策略，使用预训练的生成对抗网络（GliGANs）在训练过程中生成合成肿瘤，解决了脑胶质瘤分割中数据不足和存储成本高的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脑胶质瘤治疗前后扫描的稳健分割对于肿瘤监测和治疗规划很重要，但训练通用模型需要多样化的高质量标注数据，而这些数据往往有限。数据增强可以缓解这一问题，但存储大量增强的3D数据计算成本高昂。

Method: 基于nnU-Net框架，提出在线增强策略，在训练过程中动态插入使用预训练GliGANs生成的合成肿瘤。评估了三种模型及其集成：(1)无外部增强的基线模型，(2)常规在线增强模型，(3)定制化在线增强模型。

Result: 在BraTS 2025在线验证平台上，三个模型的集成获得了以下病变级别的Dice分数：ET 0.79、NETC 0.749、RC 0.872、SNFH 0.825、TC 0.79、WT 0.88。该工作在BraTS Lighthouse Challenge 2025 Task 1-成人胶质瘤分割中排名第一。

Conclusion: 提出的在线增强策略有效解决了脑胶质瘤分割中的数据不足问题，通过动态生成合成肿瘤实现了优异的性能，在BraTS 2025挑战赛中取得了第一名。

Abstract: Robust segmentation across both pre-treatment and post-treatment glioma scans
can be helpful for consistent tumor monitoring and treatment planning. BraTS
2025 Task 1 addresses this by challenging models to generalize across varying
tumor appearances throughout the treatment timeline. However, training such
generalized models requires access to diverse, high-quality annotated data,
which is often limited. While data augmentation can alleviate this, storing
large volumes of augmented 3D data is computationally expensive. To address
these challenges, we propose an on-the-fly augmentation strategy that
dynamically inserts synthetic tumors using pretrained generative adversarial
networks (GliGANs) during training. We evaluate three nnU-Net-based models and
their ensembles: (1) a baseline without external augmentation, (2) a regular
on-the-fly augmented model, and (3) a model with customized on-the-fly
augmentation. Built upon the nnU-Net framework, our pipeline leverages
pretrained GliGAN weights and tumor insertion methods from prior
challenge-winning solutions. An ensemble of the three models achieves
lesion-wise Dice scores of 0.79 (ET), 0.749 (NETC), 0.872 (RC), 0.825 (SNFH),
0.79 (TC), and 0.88 (WT) on the online BraTS 2025 validation platform. This

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RGBA视频生成方法往往忽视视觉质量，限制了实际应用。需要开发能够生成高质量透明视频的新方法。

Method: 设计有效的变分自编码器(VAE)将alpha通道编码到RGB潜在空间，构建高质量多样的RGBA视频数据集，使用扩散变换器进行训练。

Result: 模型在视觉质量、运动真实感和透明度渲染方面表现优异，能够生成各种半透明物体、发光效果和头发丝等精细细节。

Conclusion: Wan-Alpha框架在RGBA视频生成方面具有显著优势，为透明视频生成提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: RGBA video generation, which includes an alpha channel to represent
transparency, is gaining increasing attention across a wide range of
applications. However, existing methods often neglect visual quality, limiting
their practical usability. In this paper, we propose \textit{Wan-Alpha}, a new
framework that generates transparent videos by learning both RGB and alpha
channels jointly. We design an effective variational autoencoder (VAE) that
encodes the alpha channel into the RGB latent space. Then, to support the
training of our diffusion transformer, we construct a high-quality and diverse
RGBA video dataset. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, our model
demonstrates superior performance in visual quality, motion realism, and
transparency rendering. Notably, our model can generate a wide variety of
semi-transparent objects, glowing effects, and fine-grained details such as
hair strands. The released model is available on our website:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练扩散模型提供丰富的多尺度潜在特征，但它们在结构化输出（如人体姿态估计）方面的潜力尚未充分探索。

Method: 在SD U-Net的潜在空间中直接预测关键点热图，通过轻量级卷积姿态头映射特征，并加入辅助RGB重建分支以增强鲁棒性。

Result: 仅用Sapiens五分之一训练时间就在COCO验证集上达到同等性能，在HumanArt和COCO-OOD跨域基准上创下新纪录。

Conclusion: SDPose有效利用扩散先验进行姿态估计，并可作为零样本姿态标注器用于下游可控生成任务。

Abstract: Pre-trained diffusion models provide rich multi-scale latent features and are
emerging as powerful vision backbones. While recent works such as
Marigold~\citep{ke2024repurposing} and Lotus~\citep{he2024lotus} adapt
diffusion priors for dense prediction with strong cross-domain generalization,
their potential for structured outputs (e.g., human pose estimation) remains
underexplored. In this paper, we propose \textbf{SDPose}, a fine-tuning
framework built upon Stable Diffusion to fully exploit pre-trained diffusion
priors for human pose estimation. First, rather than modifying cross-attention
modules or introducing learnable embeddings, we directly predict keypoint
heatmaps in the SD U-Net's image latent space to preserve the original
generative priors. Second, we map these latent features into keypoint heatmaps
through a lightweight convolutional pose head, which avoids disrupting the
pre-trained backbone. Finally, to prevent overfitting and enhance
out-of-distribution robustness, we incorporate an auxiliary RGB reconstruction
branch that preserves domain-transferable generative semantics. To evaluate
robustness under domain shift, we further construct \textbf{COCO-OOD}, a
style-transferred variant of COCO with preserved annotations. With just
one-fifth of the training schedule used by Sapiens on COCO, SDPose attains
parity with Sapiens-1B/2B on the COCO validation set and establishes a new
state of the art on the cross-domain benchmarks HumanArt and COCO-OOD.
Furthermore, we showcase SDPose as a zero-shot pose annotator for downstream
controllable generation tasks, including ControlNet-based image synthesis and
video generation, where it delivers qualitatively superior pose guidance.

Motivation: 现有方法存在视场角限制（阻碍连续完整场景合成）或相机可控性不足（限制用户或自主代理自由探索）的问题，需要开发能够生成完整可探索360度视觉世界的解决方案。

Method: 1) 通过Unreal Engine在虚拟3D环境中模拟相机轨迹构建大规模全景视频-探索路径对数据集；2) 提出球面感知扩散变换器架构，将等矩形特征重投影到球面以建模几何邻接关系。

Result: 广泛实验表明PanoWorld-X在运动范围、控制精度和视觉质量等多个方面均取得优越性能。

Conclusion: 该框架在真实世界应用中具有巨大潜力，能够生成高质量、可控的全景视频，支持自由探索。

Abstract: Generating a complete and explorable 360-degree visual world enables a wide
range of downstream applications. While prior works have advanced the field,
they remain constrained by either narrow field-of-view limitations, which
hinder the synthesis of continuous and holistic scenes, or insufficient camera
controllability that restricts free exploration by users or autonomous agents.
To address this, we propose PanoWorld-X, a novel framework for high-fidelity
and controllable panoramic video generation with diverse camera trajectories.
Specifically, we first construct a large-scale dataset of panoramic
video-exploration route pairs by simulating camera trajectories in virtual 3D
environments via Unreal Engine. As the spherical geometry of panoramic data
misaligns with the inductive priors from conventional video diffusion, we then
introduce a Sphere-Aware Diffusion Transformer architecture that reprojects
equirectangular features onto the spherical surface to model geometric
adjacency in latent space, significantly enhancing visual fidelity and
spatiotemporal continuity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
PanoWorld-X achieves superior performance in various aspects, including motion
range, control precision, and visual quality, underscoring its potential for
real-world applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准Transformer的二次复杂度难以扩展到大规模场景，而空间邻近的视图比远距离视图能提供更多有用的局部场景信息。

Method: 使用局部视图Transformer处理每个视图周围邻域的信息，采用基于相对几何变换的新型位置编码，解码为包含颜色和透明度视图依赖的3D高斯分布场景表示。

Result: 能够单次前向传播重建任意大规模、高分辨率场景。

Conclusion: LVT架构有效解决了大规模场景重建中的计算复杂度问题，实现了高效的新视角合成。

Abstract: Large transformer models are proving to be a powerful tool for 3D vision and
novel view synthesis. However, the standard Transformer's well-known quadratic
complexity makes it difficult to scale these methods to large scenes. To
address this challenge, we propose the Local View Transformer (LVT), a
large-scale scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis architecture that
circumvents the need for the quadratic attention operation. Motivated by the
insight that spatially nearby views provide more useful signal about the local
scene composition than distant views, our model processes all information in a
local neighborhood around each view. To attend to tokens in nearby views, we
leverage a novel positional encoding that conditions on the relative geometric
transformation between the query and nearby views. We decode the output of our
model into a 3D Gaussian Splat scene representation that includes both color
and opacity view-dependence. Taken together, the Local View Transformer enables
reconstruction of arbitrarily large, high-resolution scenes in a single forward
pass. See our project page for results and interactive demos

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have delivered strong
reasoning capabilities in natural image domains, yet their potential for Earth
Observation (EO) remains largely unexplored. EO tasks introduce unique
challenges, spanning referred object detection, image or region captioning,
change detection, grounding, and temporal analysis, that demand task aware

aware rewards to enable effective adaptation of reasoning based RL models to
diverse EO tasks. This training strategy enhances reasoning capabilities for
remote sensing images, stabilizes optimization, and improves robustness.
Extensive experiments across multiple EO benchmarks show consistent performance

Motivation: 现有GRPO算法在自回归图像生成中存在训练不稳定、破坏预训练模型能力、图像质量下降和泛化能力差的问题。

Method: STAGE框架包含两个关键技术：1）优势/KL重加权 - 相似性感知重加权缓解冲突更新；2）熵奖励 - 基于参考模型的熵奖励稳定学习过程。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has recently been explored to improve text-to-image

models remains challenging. The instability of the training process easily
disrupts the pretrained model capability during long runs, resulting in
marginal gains, degraded image quality, and poor generalization. In this work,
we revisit GRPO for AR image generation and identify two key issues:
contradictory gradients from unnecessary tokens and unstable policy entropy
dynamics. To address these, we introduce STAGE, a stable and generalizable
framework that leverages two targeted solutions: 1) Advantage/KL reweighting.
Similarity-aware reweighting to alleviate conflicting updates; and 2) Entropy
reward. An entropy-based reward corresponding to reference model to stabilize
learning. With the help of alleviating conflicts between tokens and an entropy
reward for stabilizing training, we reduce disruption of the pretrained
distribution and mitigate reward hacking, which in turn improves generalization
and transfer better to other benchmarks. Experiments across multiple benchmarks
show that STAGE consistently improves visual quality, stability, and cross-task
generalization compared to baseline GRPO.

*Wenhao Li,Qiangchang Wang,Xianjing Meng,Zhibin Wu,Yilong Yin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出VT-FSL框架，通过大语言模型构建跨模态提示，结合几何对齐实现少样本学习，在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有少样本学习方法因缺乏实际实例基础而产生的语义幻觉问题，避免噪声引导和昂贵修正。

Method: 使用跨模态迭代提示(CIP)基于类名和支持图像生成精确描述，并合成语义一致图像；通过跨模态几何对齐(CGA)联合对齐文本、支持和合成视觉表示。

Result: 在10个多样化基准测试（包括标准、跨域和细粒度少样本学习场景）中建立了新的最先进性能。

Conclusion: VT-FSL通过精确的跨模态提示和几何对齐，有效解决了少样本学习中的语义幻觉问题，实现了结构化且一致的多模态集成。

Abstract: Few-shot learning (FSL) aims to recognize novel concepts from only a few
labeled support samples. Recent studies enhance support features by
incorporating additional semantic information or designing complex semantic
fusion modules. However, they still suffer from hallucinating semantics that
contradict the visual evidence due to the lack of grounding in actual
instances, resulting in noisy guidance and costly corrections. To address these
issues, we propose a novel framework, bridging Vision and Text with LLMs for
Few-Shot Learning (VT-FSL), which constructs precise cross-modal prompts
conditioned on Large Language Models (LLMs) and support images, seamlessly
integrating them through a geometry-aware alignment. It mainly consists of
Cross-modal Iterative Prompting (CIP) and Cross-modal Geometric Alignment
(CGA). Specifically, the CIP conditions an LLM on both class names and support
images to generate precise class descriptions iteratively in a single
structured reasoning pass. These descriptions not only enrich the semantic
understanding of novel classes but also enable the zero-shot synthesis of
semantically consistent images. The descriptions and synthetic images act
respectively as complementary textual and visual prompts, providing high-level
class semantics and low-level intra-class diversity to compensate for limited
support data. Furthermore, the CGA jointly aligns the fused textual, support,
and synthetic visual representations by minimizing the kernelized volume of the
3-dimensional parallelotope they span. It captures global and nonlinear
relationships among all representations, enabling structured and consistent
multimodal integration. The proposed VT-FSL method establishes new
state-of-the-art performance across ten diverse benchmarks, including standard,
cross-domain, and fine-grained few-shot learning scenarios. Code is available

Motivation: 图像配准是生物医学和生命科学中的基本逆问题，但现有算法未能与图像采集能力同步扩展，需要解决大规模配准的计算瓶颈。

Method: 提出IO感知的非GEMM融合内核，优化非GEMM瓶颈，实现卷积感知的张量分片，补充现有的模型并行技术。

Result: 在8个A6000 GPU上1分钟内完成100微米人脑MRI配准（比标准临床数据大570倍），加速现有最优配准流程6-7倍，减少峰值内存消耗20-59%，单GPU可处理比现有SOTA大64倍的问题。

Conclusion: FFDP框架在大规模图像配准方面实现了前所未有的扩展能力，显著提升了配准效率和问题规模处理能力。

Abstract: In this work, we propose FFDP, a set of IO-aware non-GEMM fused kernels
supplemented with a distributed framework for image registration at
unprecedented scales. Image registration is an inverse problem fundamental to
biomedical and life sciences, but algorithms have not scaled in tandem with
image acquisition capabilities. Our framework complements existing model
parallelism techniques proposed for large-scale transformer training by
optimizing non-GEMM bottlenecks and enabling convolution-aware tensor sharding.
We demonstrate unprecedented capabilities by performing multimodal registration
of a 100 micron ex-vivo human brain MRI volume at native resolution - an
inverse problem more than 570x larger than a standard clinical datum in about a
minute using only 8 A6000 GPUs. FFDP accelerates existing state-of-the-art
optimization and deep learning registration pipelines by upto 6 - 7x while
reducing peak memory consumption by 20 - 59%. Comparative analysis on a 250
micron dataset shows that FFDP can fit upto 64x larger problems than existing
SOTA on a single GPU, and highlights both the performance and efficiency gains
of FFDP compared to SOTA image registration methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GEM是一个基于3D高斯泼溅的冷冻电镜重建框架，在保持高效率的同时直接在实空间操作，相比现有方法实现了48%更快的训练速度、12%更低的内存使用，并提高了局部分辨率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 冷冻电镜数据集规模庞大，传统傅里叶空间方法效率高但保真度低，而基于神经辐射场的实空间方法精度高但内存和计算开销呈立方增长。

Method: 使用紧凑的3D高斯表示蛋白质，每个高斯仅用11个参数参数化，并设计了新颖的梯度计算来减少内存占用和训练成本。

Result: 在标准冷冻电镜基准测试中，GEM实现了高达48%的训练加速、12%的内存使用降低，局部分辨率提升高达38.8%。

Conclusion: GEM为冷冻电镜重建提供了一个实用且可扩展的范式，统一了速度、效率和高分辨率精度。

Abstract: Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has become a central tool for
high-resolution structural biology, yet the massive scale of datasets (often
exceeding 100k particle images) renders 3D reconstruction both computationally
expensive and memory intensive. Traditional Fourier-space methods are efficient
but lose fidelity due to repeated transforms, while recent real-space
approaches based on neural radiance fields (NeRFs) improve accuracy but incur
cubic memory and computation overhead. Therefore, we introduce GEM, a novel
cryo-EM reconstruction framework built on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) that
operates directly in real-space while maintaining high efficiency. Instead of
modeling the entire density volume, GEM represents proteins with compact 3D
Gaussians, each parameterized by only 11 values. To further improve the
training efficiency, we designed a novel gradient computation to 3D Gaussians
that contribute to each voxel. This design substantially reduced both memory
footprint and training cost. On standard cryo-EM benchmarks, GEM achieves up to
48% faster training and 12% lower memory usage compared to state-of-the-art
methods, while improving local resolution by as much as 38.8%. These results
establish GEM as a practical and scalable paradigm for cryo-EM reconstruction,
unifying speed, efficiency, and high-resolution accuracy. Our code is available

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MANI-Pure是一个基于扩散模型的对抗净化框架，通过分析对抗扰动的频率分布特性，采用频率自适应的噪声注入策略，在保持语义内容的同时有效抑制对抗攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗净化方法通常使用均匀噪声注入，这会破坏语义结构并削弱鲁棒性。研究发现对抗扰动主要集中在高频区域，且在不同频率和攻击类型中呈现异质性强度模式。

Method: 提出MANI-Pure框架，利用输入的幅度谱指导净化过程，自适应地应用异质、频率定向的噪声，在脆弱的高频低幅度频段抑制对抗扰动，同时保留语义关键的低频内容。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和ImageNet-1K上的实验表明，MANI-Pure将干净准确率差距缩小到原始分类器的0.59以内，同时将鲁棒准确率提升2.15，在RobustBench排行榜上达到top-1鲁棒准确率，超越先前最先进方法。

Conclusion: MANI-Pure通过频率自适应的噪声注入策略，有效解决了对抗净化中的语义结构破坏问题，显著提升了防御性能，为对抗防御提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Adversarial purification with diffusion models has emerged as a promising
defense strategy, but existing methods typically rely on uniform noise
injection, which indiscriminately perturbs all frequencies, corrupting semantic
structures and undermining robustness. Our empirical study reveals that
adversarial perturbations are not uniformly distributed: they are predominantly
concentrated in high-frequency regions, with heterogeneous magnitude intensity
patterns that vary across frequencies and attack types. Motivated by this
observation, we introduce MANI-Pure, a magnitude-adaptive purification
framework that leverages the magnitude spectrum of inputs to guide the
purification process. Instead of injecting homogeneous noise, MANI-Pure
adaptively applies heterogeneous, frequency-targeted noise, effectively
suppressing adversarial perturbations in fragile high-frequency, low-magnitude
bands while preserving semantically critical low-frequency content. Extensive
experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-1K validate the effectiveness of
MANI-Pure. It narrows the clean accuracy gap to within 0.59 of the original
classifier, while boosting robust accuracy by 2.15, and achieves the top-1
robust accuracy on the RobustBench leaderboard, surpassing the previous
state-of-the-art method.

Abstract: Reconstructing 3D scenes and synthesizing novel views has seen rapid progress
in recent years. Neural Radiance Fields demonstrated that continuous volumetric
radiance fields can achieve high-quality image synthesis, but their long
training and rendering times limit practicality. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
addressed these issues by representing scenes with millions of Gaussians,
enabling real-time rendering and fast optimization. However, Gaussian
primitives are not natively compatible with the mesh-based pipelines used in VR
headsets, and real-time graphics applications. Existing solutions attempt to
convert Gaussians into meshes through post-processing or two-stage pipelines,
which increases complexity and degrades visual quality. In this work, we
introduce Triangle Splatting+, which directly optimizes triangles, the
fundamental primitive of computer graphics, within a differentiable splatting
framework. We formulate triangle parametrization to enable connectivity through
shared vertices, and we design a training strategy that enforces opaque
triangles. The final output is immediately usable in standard graphics engines
without post-processing. Experiments on the Mip-NeRF360 and Tanks & Temples
datasets show that Triangle Splatting+achieves state-of-the-art performance in
mesh-based novel view synthesis. Our method surpasses prior splatting
approaches in visual fidelity while remaining efficient and fast to training.
Moreover, the resulting semi-connected meshes support downstream applications
such as physics-based simulation or interactive walkthroughs. The project page

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoAnchor是一个即插即用的模块，利用子空间亲和性来增强跨帧的视觉线索，无需重新训练即可显著提升多模态大语言模型在视觉空间推理任务上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在视觉-语言对齐方面取得了显著进展，但在视觉空间推理方面仍然受限。研究发现这种限制源于注意力机制：视觉标记被语言标记所掩盖，导致模型无法跨帧一致地识别相同的视觉线索。

Method: 作者在稀疏子空间聚类中的自表达性与Transformer注意力机制之间建立了新颖联系，提出了VideoAnchor模块，利用子空间亲和性来强化跨帧的视觉线索，将注意力锚定到共享的视觉结构上。

Result: 在多个基准测试和骨干模型上的广泛实验显示了一致的性能提升：在VSI-Bench和Video-MME（空间相关任务）上，使用InternVL2-8B和Qwen2.5VL-72B分别获得了3.2%和4.6%的改进。定性分析显示了更连贯的子空间划分和更强的视觉基础。

Conclusion: VideoAnchor通过将子空间聚类原理与注意力机制相结合，有效解决了多模态大语言模型在视觉空间推理中的局限性，为提升视频理解能力提供了一种高效且无需重新训练的解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive progress in
vision-language alignment, yet they remain limited in visual-spatial reasoning.
We first identify that this limitation arises from the attention mechanism:
visual tokens are overshadowed by language tokens, preventing the model from
consistently recognizing the same visual cues across frames. To address this
challenge, we draw a novel connection between the self-expressiveness property
in sparse subspace clustering and the attention mechanism in Transformers.
Building on this insight, we propose VideoAnchor, a plug-and-play module that
leverages subspace affinities to reinforce visual cues across frames without
retraining, effectively anchoring attention to shared visual structures.
Extensive experiments across benchmarks and backbone models show consistent
performance gains -- $e.g.$, 3.2% and 4.6% improvements on VSI-Bench and
Video-MME (spatial-related tasks) with InternVL2-8B and Qwen2.5VL-72B -- while
qualitative analyses demonstrate more coherent subspace partitions and stronger
visual grounding. Our codes will be made public available at

TL;DR: 提出Rolling Forcing方法，通过联合去噪、注意力锚点和高效训练算法，解决流式视频生成中的误差累积问题，实现高质量、低延迟的长视频生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有流式视频生成方法存在严重的误差累积问题，导致长时域视频质量显著下降，需要一种能够最小化误差累积的新技术。

Method: 1. 联合去噪方案：同时处理多帧，放松相邻帧间的严格因果关系；2. 注意力锚点机制：保留初始帧作为全局上下文锚点；3. 高效训练算法：在扩展的去噪窗口上进行少步蒸馏。

Result: 实验表明Rolling Forcing能够在单GPU上实时生成多分钟视频，显著减少误差累积。

Conclusion: Rolling Forcing是解决流式视频生成中误差累积问题的有效方法，支持高质量长视频的实时生成。

Abstract: Streaming video generation, as one fundamental component in interactive world
models and neural game engines, aims to generate high-quality, low-latency, and
temporally coherent long video streams. However, most existing work suffers
from severe error accumulation that often significantly degrades the generated
stream videos over long horizons. We design Rolling Forcing, a novel video
generation technique that enables streaming long videos with minimal error
accumulation. Rolling Forcing comes with three novel designs. First, instead of
iteratively sampling individual frames, which accelerates error propagation, we
design a joint denoising scheme that simultaneously denoises multiple frames
with progressively increasing noise levels. This design relaxes the strict
causality across adjacent frames, effectively suppressing error growth. Second,
we introduce the attention sink mechanism into the long-horizon stream video
generation task, which allows the model to keep key value states of initial
frames as a global context anchor and thereby enhances long-term global
consistency. Third, we design an efficient training algorithm that enables
few-step distillation over largely extended denoising windows. This algorithm
operates on non-overlapping windows and mitigates exposure bias conditioned on
self-generated histories. Extensive experiments show that Rolling Forcing
enables real-time streaming generation of multi-minute videos on a single GPU,
with substantially reduced error accumulation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统从头训练VAE主要关注低层细节，而预训练基础编码器具有丰富的语义结构，希望利用这些语义信息来改进图像生成标记器。

Method: 三阶段对齐策略：1)冻结编码器训练适配器和解码器；2)联合优化所有组件并添加语义保持损失；3)精炼解码器提升重建质量。

Result: 在ImageNet 256×256上，标记器加速扩散模型收敛，64个epoch内达到gFID 1.90；在LAION数据集上，2B参数文本到图像模型优于FLUX VAE。

Conclusion: 该方法简单、可扩展，为连续标记器设计建立了语义基础范式，能够有效利用预训练编码器的语义信息。

Abstract: In this work, we propose aligning pretrained visual encoders to serve as
tokenizers for latent diffusion models in image generation. Unlike training a
variational autoencoder (VAE) from scratch, which primarily emphasizes
low-level details, our approach leverages the rich semantic structure of
foundation encoders. We introduce a three-stage alignment strategy: (1) freeze
the encoder and train an adapter and a decoder to establish a semantic latent
space; (2) jointly optimize all components with an additional semantic
preservation loss, enabling the encoder to capture perceptual details while
retaining high-level semantics; and (3) refine the decoder for improved
reconstruction quality. This alignment yields semantically rich image
tokenizers that benefit diffusion models. On ImageNet 256$\times$256, our
tokenizer accelerates the convergence of diffusion models, reaching a gFID of
1.90 within just 64 epochs, and improves generation both with and without
classifier-free guidance. Scaling to LAION, a 2B-parameter text-to-image model
trained with our tokenizer consistently outperforms FLUX VAE under the same
training steps. Overall, our method is simple, scalable, and establishes a
semantically grounded paradigm for continuous tokenizer design.

Motivation: 现有视觉模型在预定义任务上表现良好，但在个性化视觉任务（用户自定义对象或新目标）上表现不佳。现有个性化方法依赖昂贵的微调或合成数据管道，缺乏灵活性。

Method: 提出四面板框架PICO，重新利用扩散变换器作为视觉上下文学习器。构建VisRel数据集，强调任务多样性而非规模。提出注意力引导的种子评分器提高可靠性。

Result: PICO在实验中超越了微调和合成数据基线，能够灵活适应新颖的用户定义任务，在识别和生成任务上都具有良好泛化能力。

Conclusion: PICO框架通过视觉上下文学习实现了高效的个性化视觉任务处理，证明了任务多样性对鲁棒泛化的重要性。

Abstract: Modern vision models, trained on large-scale annotated datasets, excel at
predefined tasks but struggle with personalized vision -- tasks defined at test
time by users with customized objects or novel objectives. Existing
personalization approaches rely on costly fine-tuning or synthetic data
pipelines, which are inflexible and restricted to fixed task formats. Visual
in-context learning (ICL) offers a promising alternative, yet prior methods
confine to narrow, in-domain tasks and fail to generalize to open-ended
personalization. We introduce Personalized In-Context Operator (PICO), a simple
four-panel framework that repurposes diffusion transformers as visual
in-context learners. Given a single annotated exemplar, PICO infers the
underlying transformation and applies it to new inputs without retraining. To
enable this, we construct VisRel, a compact yet diverse tuning dataset, showing
that task diversity, rather than scale, drives robust generalization. We
further propose an attention-guided seed scorer that improves reliability via
efficient inference scaling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PICO (i)
surpasses fine-tuning and synthetic-data baselines, (ii) flexibly adapts to
novel user-defined tasks, and (iii) generalizes across both recognition and
generation.

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型存在幻觉问题，生成与输入图像不一致的输出。研究发现浅层视觉特征更容易导致幻觉，因为它们只捕获有偏见的低层信息，不足以支持高层推理

Method: LayerCD（层对比解码），通过对比视觉编码器浅层和深层特征生成的输出分布来过滤幻觉

Result: 在两个幻觉基准测试上显著优于当前最先进方法

Conclusion: LayerCD是一种简单有效的方法，通过利用视觉特征的不同层次来减少多模态大语言模型的幻觉问题

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown impressive perception and
reasoning capabilities, yet they often suffer from hallucinations -- generating
outputs that are linguistically coherent but inconsistent with the context of
the input image, including inaccuracies in objects, attributes, and relations.
To address this challenge, we propose a simple approach called Layer
Contrastive Decoding (LayerCD). Our design is motivated by the observation that
shallow visual features are much more likely than deep visual features to cause
an MLLM to hallucinate as they only capture biased, low-level information that
is insufficient for high-level reasoning. Therefore, LayerCD aims to filter out
hallucinations by contrasting the output distributions generated from visual
features of different levels, specifically those from the shallow and deep
layers of the vision encoder, respectively. We conduct extensive experiments on
two hallucination benchmarks and show that LayerCD significantly outperforms
current state-of-the-art. The code for LayerCD is available at
https://github.com/maifoundations/LayerCD .

Motivation: 现有方法难以处理包含大幅物体变形、大尺度相机运动和有限视角覆盖的长视频序列，这限制了动态场景理解和3D内容创建的应用。

Method: 训练个性化物体姿态估计器，通过预训练图像到3D模型进行监督，指导可变形3D高斯表示的优化，并使用长期2D点跟踪进行正则化。

Result: PAD3R能够重建高保真、可关节化的3D表示，在具有挑战性的场景中表现出良好的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法在动态场景理解和3D内容创建方面具有潜力，能够以类别无关的方式处理复杂的变形3D重建任务。

Abstract: We present PAD3R, a method for reconstructing deformable 3D objects from
casually captured, unposed monocular videos. Unlike existing approaches, PAD3R
handles long video sequences featuring substantial object deformation,
large-scale camera movement, and limited view coverage that typically challenge
conventional systems. At its core, our approach trains a personalized,
object-centric pose estimator, supervised by a pre-trained image-to-3D model.
This guides the optimization of deformable 3D Gaussian representation. The
optimization is further regularized by long-term 2D point tracking over the
entire input video. By combining generative priors and differentiable
rendering, PAD3R reconstructs high-fidelity, articulated 3D representations of
objects in a category-agnostic way. Extensive qualitative and quantitative
results show that PAD3R is robust and generalizes well across challenging
scenarios, highlighting its potential for dynamic scene understanding and 3D
content creation.

into erroneous conclusions. Intermediate visual cues can steer reasoning;
however, existing cue-based methods are constrained with low-fidelity image
processing and linear, rigid reasoning patterns, limiting their effectiveness
on complex structured-image tasks. In this paper, we propose PixelCraft, a
novel multi-agent system for high-fidelity image processing and flexible visual
reasoning on structured images. The system comprises a dispatcher, a planner, a
reasoner, critics, and a set of visual tool agents. To achieve high-fidelity
processing, we construct a high-quality corpus and fine-tune an MLLM into a
grounding model, whose pixel-level localizations are integrated with
traditional computer vision (CV) algorithms in tool agents. Building on this
foundation, PixelCraft facilitates flexible visual reasoning through a dynamic
three-stage workflow of tool selection, agent discussion, and self-criticism.
Moreover, unlike prior linear reasoning patterns that simply append historical
images, PixelCraft maintains an image memory to allow the planner to adaptively
revisit earlier visual steps, explore alternative reasoning branches, and
dynamically adjust the reasoning trajectory during discussion. Extensive
experiments on challenging chart and geometry benchmarks demonstrate that
PixelCraft significantly improves visual reasoning performance for advanced
MLLMs, setting a new standard for structured image reasoning. Our code will be
available at https://github.com/microsoft/PixelCraft.

TL;DR: FlashI2V通过潜在偏移和傅里叶引导解决图像到视频生成中的条件图像泄漏问题，在域外数据上实现最佳泛化性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有I2V方法存在条件图像泄漏问题，导致运动缓慢、颜色不一致等性能下降，且在域外场景中性能降低

Method: 提出潜在偏移技术，通过从噪声潜在中减去条件图像信息来隐式整合条件；使用傅里叶变换的高频幅度特征加速收敛并调整生成视频的细节水平

Result: 仅用13亿参数，在Vbench-I2V上获得53.01的动态度分数，超越CogVideoX1.5-5B-I2V和Wan2.1-I2V-14B-480P

Conclusion: FlashI2V有效克服条件图像泄漏，在域外数据上实现最佳泛化性能

Abstract: In Image-to-Video (I2V) generation, a video is created using an input image
as the first-frame condition. Existing I2V methods concatenate the full
information of the conditional image with noisy latents to achieve high
fidelity. However, the denoisers in these methods tend to shortcut the
conditional image, which is known as conditional image leakage, leading to
performance degradation issues such as slow motion and color inconsistency. In
this work, we further clarify that conditional image leakage leads to
overfitting to in-domain data and decreases the performance in out-of-domain
scenarios. Moreover, we introduce Fourier-Guided Latent Shifting I2V, named
FlashI2V, to prevent conditional image leakage. Concretely, FlashI2V consists
of: (1) Latent Shifting. We modify the source and target distributions of flow
matching by subtracting the conditional image information from the noisy
latents, thereby incorporating the condition implicitly. (2) Fourier Guidance.
We use high-frequency magnitude features obtained by the Fourier Transform to
accelerate convergence and enable the adjustment of detail levels in the
generated video. Experimental results show that our method effectively
overcomes conditional image leakage and achieves the best generalization and
performance on out-of-domain data among various I2V paradigms. With only 1.3B
parameters, FlashI2V achieves a dynamic degree score of 53.01 on Vbench-I2V,
surpassing CogVideoX1.5-5B-I2V and Wan2.1-I2V-14B-480P. Github page:

*Penghao Wu,Yushan Zhang,Haiwen Diao,Bo Li,Lewei Lu,Ziwei Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Visual Jigsaw是一个自监督的后训练框架，通过视觉拼图任务增强多模态大语言模型的视觉理解能力，无需额外标注或视觉生成组件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型的后训练范式主要是文本中心的，视觉输入仅用于提取稀疏线索进行文本推理，缺乏对视觉信号的内在理解。

Method: 将视觉输入分割、打乱，要求模型通过自然语言输出正确的排列顺序，与可验证奖励的强化学习自然对齐，无需额外视觉生成组件。

Result: 在图像、视频和3D数据上的实验显示，在细粒度感知、时间推理和3D空间理解方面有显著提升。

Conclusion: 自监督视觉中心任务在多模态大语言模型后训练中具有巨大潜力，有望激发更多视觉中心预文本设计的研究。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning based post-training has recently emerged as a powerful
paradigm for enhancing the alignment and reasoning capabilities of multimodal
large language models (MLLMs). While vision-centric post-training is crucial
for enhancing MLLMs' intrinsic understanding of visual signals, current
post-training paradigms are predominantly text-centric, where dense visual
inputs are only leveraged to extract sparse cues for text-based reasoning.
There exist a few approaches in this direction, however, they often still rely
on text as an intermediate mediator or introduce additional visual generative
designs. In this work, we introduce Visual Jigsaw, a generic self-supervised
post-training framework designed to strengthen visual understanding in MLLMs.
Visual Jigsaw is formulated as a general ordering task: visual inputs are
partitioned, shuffled, and the model must reconstruct the visual information by
producing the correct permutation in natural language. This naturally aligns
with reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR), requires no
additional visual generative components, and derives its supervisory signal
automatically without any annotations. We instantiate Visual Jigsaw across
three visual modalities, including images, videos, and 3D data. Extensive
experiments demonstrate substantial improvements in fine-grained perception,
temporal reasoning, and 3D spatial understanding. Our findings highlight the
potential of self-supervised vision-centric tasks in post-training MLLMs and
aim to inspire further research on vision-centric pretext designs. Project

*Yang Liu,Chuanchen Luo,Zimo Tang,Junran Peng,Zhaoxiang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了VGGT-X方法，解决了3D基础模型在密集新视角合成中的内存消耗和输出质量问题，实现了无需COLMAP的密集新视角合成和姿态估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有新视角合成方法依赖SfM获取3D属性，但SfM在低纹理或低重叠场景中速度慢且脆弱。3D基础模型虽然速度快，但在密集视图设置中存在内存负担大和输出不完美的问题。

Method: VGGT-X包含内存高效的VGGT实现（可扩展到1000+图像）、自适应全局对齐来增强VGGT输出，以及鲁棒的3DGS训练实践。

Result: 实验表明该方法显著缩小了与COLMAP初始化管线的质量差距，在密集COLMAP-free新视角合成和姿态估计中达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: VGGT-X为3D基础模型在密集新视角合成中的应用提供了有效解决方案，并分析了与COLMAP初始化渲染的剩余差距，为未来发展提供了见解。

Abstract: We study the problem of applying 3D Foundation Models (3DFMs) to dense Novel
View Synthesis (NVS). Despite significant progress in Novel View Synthesis
powered by NeRF and 3DGS, current approaches remain reliant on accurate 3D
attributes (e.g., camera poses and point clouds) acquired from
Structure-from-Motion (SfM), which is often slow and fragile in low-texture or
low-overlap captures. Recent 3DFMs showcase orders of magnitude speedup over
the traditional pipeline and great potential for online NVS. But most of the
validation and conclusions are confined to sparse-view settings. Our study
reveals that naively scaling 3DFMs to dense views encounters two fundamental
barriers: dramatically increasing VRAM burden and imperfect outputs that
degrade initialization-sensitive 3D training. To address these barriers, we
introduce VGGT-X, incorporating a memory-efficient VGGT implementation that
scales to 1,000+ images, an adaptive global alignment for VGGT output
enhancement, and robust 3DGS training practices. Extensive experiments show
that these measures substantially close the fidelity gap with
COLMAP-initialized pipelines, achieving state-of-the-art results in dense
COLMAP-free NVS and pose estimation. Additionally, we analyze the causes of
remaining gaps with COLMAP-initialized rendering, providing insights for the
future development of 3D foundation models and dense NVS. Our project page is

*Alessandra Urbinati,Mirko Lai,Simona Frenda,Marco Antonio Stranisci*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种无监督方法，使用不确定性作为代理指标来衡量内容审核模型对弱势群体（女性和非白人标注者）的偏见，发现某些预训练模型对少数群体标签预测准确率高但置信度低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动内容审核对社交媒体安全至关重要，但基于语言模型的分类器存在种族和社会偏见问题。现有基准语料库难以有效衡量模型公平性，需要新的评估方法。

Method: 使用符合预测技术计算模型不确定性，作为分析模型偏见的代理指标。评估了11个模型对女性和非白人标注者的偏见程度，并与基于性能的指标（如F1分数）进行比较。

Result: 结果显示，某些预训练模型对少数群体标签预测准确率高，但预测置信度低。通过测量模型置信度，可以发现哪些标注者群体在预训练模型中得到更好表示。

Conclusion: 通过测量模型置信度能够识别预训练模型中的群体表示偏差，为模型去偏过程提供指导，确保在有效使用前进行去偏处理。

Abstract: Automatic content moderation is crucial to ensuring safety in social media.
Language Model-based classifiers are being increasingly adopted for this task,
but it has been shown that they perpetuate racial and social biases. Even if
several resources and benchmark corpora have been developed to challenge this
issue, measuring the fairness of models in content moderation remains an open
issue. In this work, we present an unsupervised approach that benchmarks models
on the basis of their uncertainty in classifying messages annotated by people
belonging to vulnerable groups. We use uncertainty, computed by means of the
conformal prediction technique, as a proxy to analyze the bias of 11 models
against women and non-white annotators and observe to what extent it diverges
from metrics based on performance, such as the $F_1$ score. The results show
that some pre-trained models predict with high accuracy the labels coming from
minority groups, even if the confidence in their prediction is low. Therefore,
by measuring the confidence of models, we are able to see which groups of
annotators are better represented in pre-trained models and lead the debiasing
process of these models before their effective use.

TL;DR: AccessEval基准评估了21个闭源和开源LLM在6个现实世界领域和9种残疾类型中对中性查询和残疾意识查询的响应差异，发现对残疾意识查询的响应更负面、刻板印象更强、事实错误更多。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 系统调查LLM在不同残疾背景下处理现实生活查询时表现出的差异，揭示模型行为中存在的系统性偏见。

Method: 使用AccessEval基准，通过中性查询和残疾意识查询的配对比较，评估21个LLM在6个领域和9种残疾类型中的表现，采用情感、社会感知和事实准确性指标。

Result: 对残疾意识查询的响应具有更负面语调、更多刻板印象和更高事实错误率，这些影响因领域和残疾类型而异，听力、言语和行动障碍受到的影响尤为严重。

Conclusion: 这些差异反映了模型行为中根深蒂固的健全主义偏见，强调了在日常生活应用中减轻偏见的重要性，并有助于弥合技术评估与用户影响之间的差距。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed across diverse domains
but often exhibit disparities in how they handle real-life queries. To
systematically investigate these effects within various disability contexts, we
introduce \textbf{AccessEval (Accessibility Evaluation)}, a benchmark
evaluating 21 closed- and open-source LLMs across 6 real-world domains and 9
disability types using paired Neutral and Disability-Aware Queries. We
evaluated model outputs with metrics for sentiment, social perception, and
factual accuracy.
  Our analysis reveals that responses to disability-aware queries tend to have
a more negative tone, increased stereotyping, and higher factual error compared
to neutral queries. These effects show notable variation by domain and
disability type, with disabilities affecting hearing, speech, and mobility
disproportionately impacted. These disparities reflect persistent forms of
ableism embedded in model behavior.
  By examining model performance in real-world decision-making contexts, we
better illuminate how such biases can translate into tangible harms for
disabled users. This framing helps bridges the gap between technical evaluation
and user impact, reinforcing importance of bias mitigation in day-to-day
applications. Our dataset is publicly available at:

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Agentar-Scale-SQL是一个新颖的Text-to-SQL框架，通过协调的测试时扩展策略在BIRD基准测试中达到SOTA性能，执行准确率达到81.67%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前SOTA的Text-to-SQL方法在BIRD等挑战性基准测试中仍远落后于人类专家，现有测试时扩展方法缺乏协调策略且忽视了模型的内部推理过程。

Method: 采用协调的测试时扩展策略，结合三个不同视角：i)通过RL增强的内在推理进行内部扩展，ii)通过迭代优化进行顺序扩展，iii)使用多样化合成和锦标赛选择进行并行扩展。

Result: 在BIRD基准测试中达到SOTA性能，测试集执行准确率为81.67%，在官方排行榜上排名第一。

Conclusion: Agentar-Scale-SQL展示了一条通向人类水平性能的有效路径，是一个易于适应新数据库和更强大语言模型的通用框架。

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) Text-to-SQL methods still lag significantly behind
human experts on challenging benchmarks like BIRD. Current approaches that
explore test-time scaling lack an orchestrated strategy and neglect the model's
internal reasoning process. To bridge this gap, we introduce Agentar-Scale-SQL,
a novel framework leveraging scalable computation to improve performance.
Agentar-Scale-SQL implements an Orchestrated Test-Time Scaling strategy that
synergistically combines three distinct perspectives: i) Internal Scaling via
RL-enhanced Intrinsic Reasoning, ii) Sequential Scaling through Iterative
Refinement, and iii) Parallel Scaling using Diverse Synthesis and Tournament
Selection. Agentar-Scale-SQL is a general-purpose framework designed for easy
adaptation to new databases and more powerful language models. Extensive
experiments show that Agentar-Scale-SQL achieves SOTA performance on the BIRD
benchmark, reaching 81.67\% execution accuracy on the test set and ranking
first on the official leaderboard, demonstrating an effective path toward
human-level performance.

*Kaishuai Xu,Wenjun Hou,Yi Cheng,Wenjie Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了RAR²框架，通过联合学习改进推理增强检索和检索增强推理，在医学问答任务中优于现有RAG方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG方法在处理需要深度推理的复杂医学问题时表现不佳，因为表面输入无法反映任务真实的知识需求，且缺乏对推理过程的显式建模。

Method: 构建思维过程揭示隐含知识需求，指导检索和答案生成；使用混合偏好对数据集和DPO进行训练；设计两种测试时扩展策略。

Result: 在多个生物医学问答数据集上实验证明RAR²的有效性，优于有或无微调的RAG基线方法。

Conclusion: RAR²框架通过联合优化推理和检索过程，成功解决了复杂医学问题中的知识需求建模问题，显著提升了医学问答性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising performance on diverse
medical benchmarks, highlighting their potential in supporting real-world
clinical tasks. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a key
approach for mitigating knowledge gaps and hallucinations by incorporating
external medical information. However, RAG still struggles with complex medical
questions that require intensive reasoning, as surface-level input often fails
to reflect the true knowledge needs of the task. Existing methods typically
focus on refining queries without explicitly modeling the reasoning process,
limiting their ability to retrieve and integrate clinically relevant knowledge.
In this work, we propose RAR$^2$, a joint learning framework that improves both
Reasoning-Augmented Retrieval and Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning. RAR$^2$
constructs a thought process to uncover implicit knowledge requirements and
uses it to guide retrieval and answer generation. We build a training dataset
of mixed preference pairs and apply Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to
train the model. Moreover, we design two test-time scaling strategies to
explore the boundaries of our framework. Experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of RAR$^2$ across several biomedical question answering datasets,
outperforming RAG baselines with or without fine-tuning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MultiSpider 2.0扩展了Spider 2.0到8种语言，揭示了当前LLMs在多语言Text-to-SQL任务上的显著性能差距，并提出了协作式语言代理基准来改进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数Text-to-SQL基准仅限于英语，限制了多语言进展，需要创建能评估跨语言鲁棒性的基准。

Method: 将Spider 2.0扩展到8种语言（英、德、法、西、葡、日、中、越），保持结构难度同时增加语言和方言变异性，并引入协作式语言代理基准迭代优化查询。

Result: 最先进LLMs在内在推理下仅达到4%执行准确率（MultiSpider 1.0为60%），协作代理方法将准确率提升至15%。

Conclusion: 存在显著的多语言性能差距，需要开发跨语言鲁棒的方法以支持实际企业部署。

Abstract: Text-to-SQL enables natural access to databases, yet most benchmarks are
English-only, limiting multilingual progress. We introduce MultiSpider 2.0,
extending Spider 2.0 to eight languages (English, German, French, Spanish,
Portuguese, Japanese, Chinese, Vietnamese). It preserves Spider 2.0's
structural difficulty while adding linguistic and dialectal variability,
demanding deeper reasoning for complex SQL. On this benchmark, state-of-the-art
LLMs (such as DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI o1) reach only 4\% execution accuracy when
relying on intrinsic reasoning, versus 60\% on MultiSpider 1.0. Therefore, we
provide a collaboration-driven language agents baseline that iteratively
refines queries, improving accuracy to 15\%. These results reveal a substantial
multilingual gap and motivate methods that are robust across languages and
ready for real-world enterprise deployment. Our benchmark is available at

TL;DR: TRUEBench是一个专为LLM生产力助手设计的新基准测试，通过多语言输入、隐式约束捕获和多轮对话评估，提供更真实的指令遵循能力评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试在评估LLM真实世界指令遵循能力方面存在不足，包括缺乏多语言性、未能捕获用户请求中的隐式约束，以及忽视多轮对话的复杂性。

Method: 引入TRUEBench基准测试，包含12种语言的输入提示、多语言指令、严格的评估标准来捕获显式和隐式约束，以及具有累积约束和上下文切换的复杂多轮对话场景。使用LLM验证器精炼约束以确保评估可靠性。

Result: 实验表明TRUEBench比现有基准测试更具挑战性，即使是像OpenAI o1这样的强大模型也仅达到69.07%的整体通过率。

Conclusion: TRUEBench为LLM在实际生产力场景中提供了严格且现实的评估，突显了它们的能力和局限性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integral as productivity
assistants, but existing benchmarks fall short in rigorously evaluating their
real-world instruction-following capabilities. Current benchmarks often (i)
lack sufficient multilinguality, (ii) fail to capture the implicit constraints
inherent in user requests, and (iii) overlook the complexities of multi-turn
dialogue. To address these critical gaps and provide a more realistic
assessment, we introduce TRUEBench (Trustworthy Real-world Usage Evaluation
Benchmark)1, a novel benchmark specifically designed for LLM-based productivity
assistants. TRUEBench distinguishes itself by featuring input prompts across 12
languages, incorporating intra-instance multilingual instructions, employing
rigorous evaluation criteria to capture both explicit and implicit constraints,
and including complex multi-turn dialogue scenarios with both accumulating
constraints and context switches. Furthermore, to ensure reliability in
evaluation, we refined constraints using an LLM validator. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that TRUEBench presents significantly greater
challenges than existing benchmarks; for instance, a strong model like OpenAI
o1 achieved only a 69.07% overall pass rate. TRUEBench offers a demanding and
realistic assessment of LLMs in practical productivity settings, highlighting
their capabilities and limitations.

TL;DR: 提出动态注意力融合(DAF)框架，结合文本和语音特征进行情感分析，无需微调预训练编码器即可超越单模态和静态融合方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统情感分析仅依赖文本，忽略了语调等非语言线索，无法捕捉真实情感意图。

Method: 使用动态注意力机制，将预训练语言模型的文本嵌入与语音编码器的声学特征自适应加权融合。

Result: 在大型多模态基准测试中持续优于静态融合和单模态基线，F1分数显著提升，预测误差降低。

Conclusion: 动态加权策略对建模复杂情感输入至关重要，为情感预测提供更稳健基础，对情感计算应用具有广泛影响。

Abstract: Traditional sentiment analysis has long been a unimodal task, relying solely
on text. This approach overlooks non-verbal cues such as vocal tone and prosody
that are essential for capturing true emotional intent. We introduce Dynamic
Attention Fusion (DAF), a lightweight framework that combines frozen text
embeddings from a pretrained language model with acoustic features from a
speech encoder, using an adaptive attention mechanism to weight each modality
per utterance. Without any finetuning of the underlying encoders, our proposed
DAF model consistently outperforms both static fusion and unimodal baselines on
a large multimodal benchmark. We report notable gains in F1-score and
reductions in prediction error and perform a variety of ablation studies that
support our hypothesis that the dynamic weighting strategy is crucial for
modeling emotionally complex inputs. By effectively integrating verbal and
non-verbal information, our approach offers a more robust foundation for
sentiment prediction and carries broader impact for affective computing
applications -- from emotion recognition and mental health assessment to more
natural human computer interaction.

TL;DR: 提出了一种在扩散语言模型中近似联合采样的方法，通过轻量级采样器层在单个前向传播中生成多个token，平衡生成质量与速度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统扩散语言模型通过无序解掩码并行生成文本，但并行解掩码越多，生成文本与真实联合分布差距越大，导致准确性下降。需要一种方法在保持生成速度的同时近似联合采样

Method: 在现有大型扩散LM基础上开发轻量级单层采样器，一次完整模型前向传播后，仅对该采样器层进行多次前向传播，生成多个解掩码token。采样器训练模仿冻结完整模型的精确联合采样

Result: 在预训练和指令调优模型上验证有效性，当每个去噪步骤解掩码4个token时，MAUVE得分达到0.87（相比边际基线0.31），接近真实联合分布

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了扩散语言模型中的近似联合采样，在保持生成质量的同时显著提升速度，为高效文本生成提供了可行方案

Abstract: In autoregressive language models, each token is sampled by conditioning on
all the past tokens; the overall string has thus been sampled from the correct
underlying joint distribution represented by the model. In contrast, masked
diffusion language models generate text by unmasking tokens out of order and
potentially in parallel. Generating an overall string sampled from the correct
underlying joint distribution would (again) require exactly one token unmasking
in every full-model forward pass. The more tokens unmasked in parallel, the
further away the string is from the true joint; this can be seen in the
resulting drop in accuracy (but, increase in speed). In this paper we devise a
way to {\em approximately} sample multiple tokens from the joint distribution
in a single full-model forward pass; we do so by developing a new lightweight
single-layer ``sampler" on top of an existing large diffusion LM. One forward
pass of the full model can now be followed by multiple forward passes of only
this sampler layer, to yield multiple unmasked tokens. Our sampler is trained
to mimic exact joint sampling from the (frozen) full model. We show the
effectiveness of our approximate joint sampling for both pretrained-only
(Dream-7B-Base) and instruction-tuned (Dream-7B-Instruct) models on language
modeling and math \& coding tasks. When four tokens are unmasked for each
full-model denoising step, our sampling algorithm achieves a MAUVE score of
0.87 (vs marginal baseline of 0.31) with respect to the true joint
distribution.

TL;DR: 提出了无痛激活引导（PAS），一种完全自动化的激活引导方法，无需手动构建提示对或特征标注，即可利用标注数据集对语言模型进行后训练控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的权重后训练方法耗时昂贵，提示引导方法难以精确控制且需要手动试错，而现有激活引导技术需要手动构建提示对或特征标注，使用不便。

Method: PAS是一系列完全自动化的方法，利用任何给定的标注数据集自动构建激活向量，无需提示构建、特征标注或人工干预。

Result: 在三个开源模型和18个任务上的评估显示，PAS能可靠提升行为任务性能，但对智能导向任务无效。内省变体iPAS在偏见、道德和对齐任务上分别提升10.1%、5.2%和34.8%。

Conclusion: PAS提供了一种快速、轻量的激活向量构建方法，可作为实用的自动化语言模型后训练选项，明确了激活引导的有效应用场景和局限性。

Abstract: Language models (LMs) are typically post-trained for desired capabilities and
behaviors via weight-based or prompt-based steering, but the former is
time-consuming and expensive, and the latter is not precisely controllable and
often requires manual trial-and-error. While activation steering (AS) promises
a cheap, fast, and controllable alternative to the two existing post-training
methods, current AS techniques require hand-crafted prompt pairs or
labor-intensive feature annotation, making them more inconvenient than the
plug-and-play methods such as Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT). We introduce Painless Activation Steering (PAS), a family of
fully automated methods that make AS readily usable with any given labeled
dataset, with no need for prompt construction, feature labeling, or human
intervention. We evaluate PAS on three open-weight models
(Llama3.1-8B-Instruct, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-8B, and Nous-Hermes-2) and 18 tasks;
we find that PAS reliably improves performance for behavior tasks, but not for
intelligence-oriented tasks. The introspective variant (iPAS) delivers the
strongest causal steering effects (10.1% on Bias, 5.2% on Morality, and 34.8%
on Alignment). We also show PAS delivers additional gains on top of In-Context
Learning (ICL) and SFT. PAS constructs a fast, lightweight activation vector
that can be cheaply trained, easily stored, and activated at will. Our results
provide a characterization of where AS helps, where it fails, and how to deploy
it as a practical, automated LM post-training option.

TL;DR: 论文提出了MIRAGE基准来评估多跳推理中的歧义处理能力，并开发了CLARION框架来显著提升模型表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的多跳问答往往涉及与推理过程密不可分的歧义性，这带来了独特挑战，因为单个问题会产生多个需要独立解决的推理路径。现有大语言模型在此类设置下表现不佳。

Method: 构建了包含1,142个高质量歧义多跳问题的MIRAGE基准，采用句法、通用和语义歧义分类法，并通过多LLM验证流程进行严格筛选。同时提出了CLARION多智能体框架来处理歧义。

Result: 实验表明即使最先进的模型在MIRAGE上也表现不佳，确认了结合歧义解决和多步推理是一个独特且重大的挑战。CLARION框架显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 多跳推理中的歧义处理是一个重要挑战，CLARION框架为开发更自适应和鲁棒的推理系统开辟了道路。

Abstract: Real-world Multi-hop Question Answering (QA) often involves ambiguity that is
inseparable from the reasoning process itself. This ambiguity creates a
distinct challenge, where multiple reasoning paths emerge from a single
question, each requiring independent resolution. Since each sub-question is
ambiguous, the model must resolve ambiguity at every step. Thus, answering a
single question requires handling multiple layers of ambiguity throughout the
reasoning chain. We find that current Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle in
this setting, typically exploring wrong reasoning paths and producing
incomplete answers. To facilitate research on multi-hop ambiguity, we introduce
MultI-hop Reasoning with AmbiGuity Evaluation for Illusory Questions (MIRAGE),
a benchmark designed to analyze and evaluate this challenging intersection of
ambiguity interpretation and multi-hop reasoning. MIRAGE contains 1,142
high-quality examples of ambiguous multi-hop questions, categorized under a
taxonomy of syntactic, general, and semantic ambiguity, and curated through a
rigorous multi-LLM verification pipeline. Our experiments reveal that even
state-of-the-art models struggle on MIRAGE, confirming that resolving ambiguity
combined with multi-step inference is a distinct and significant challenge. To
establish a robust baseline, we propose CLarifying Ambiguity with a Reasoning
and InstructiON (CLARION), a multi-agent framework that significantly
outperforms existing approaches on MIRAGE, paving the way for more adaptive and
robust reasoning systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器学习代码生成基准主要局限于英语，忽视了ML研究和实践的全球多语言特性。

Method: 构建ML2B基准，包含30个Kaggle竞赛翻译成13种自然语言，涵盖表格、文本和图像数据类型，使用AIDE自动化框架进行端到端评估。

Result: 结果显示非英语任务性能显著下降15-45%，揭示了多语言表示学习在代码生成中的关键挑战。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated strong capabilities
in generating machine learning (ML) code, enabling end-to-end pipeline
construction from natural language instructions. However, existing benchmarks
for ML code generation are mainly restricted to English, overlooking the global
and multilingual nature of ML research and practice. To address this gap, we
present ML2B, the first benchmark for evaluating multilingual ML code
generation. ML2B consists of 30 Kaggle competitions translated into 13 natural
languages, covering tabular, text, and image data types, with structured
metadata and validated human-reviewed translations. For evaluation, we employ
AIDE, an automated framework for end-to-end assessment of data science
pipelines, and provide insights into cross-lingual model performance. Our
results reveal substantial 15-45% performance degradation on non-English tasks,
highlighting critical challenges in multilingual representation learning for
code generation. The benchmark, evaluation framework, and comprehensive results
are made available through our GitHub repository to facilitate future research
in multilingual ML code generation: https://github.com/enaix/ml2b.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文创建了首个多方言阿拉伯语伪造语音数据集，通过评估多个TTS模型发现FishSpeech在阿拉伯语语音克隆方面表现最佳，但单一模型可能限制泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成式文本转语音模型的发展，区分真实和合成语音变得困难，特别是对研究较少的阿拉伯语及其方言。现有伪造检测研究主要集中在英语，阿拉伯语存在显著研究空白。

Method: 构建多方言阿拉伯语伪造语音数据集，通过评估流水线比较不同TTS模型：使用嵌入方法+分类器头、基于MFCC特征的经典机器学习算法、RawNet2架构；计算人类评分的平均意见得分；通过自动语音识别模型测量词错误率。

Result: FishSpeech在Casablanca语料库的阿拉伯语语音克隆中优于其他TTS模型，产生更真实和具有挑战性的合成语音样本。

Conclusion: FishSpeech是生成阿拉伯语合成语音的最佳模型，但仅依赖单一TTS构建数据集可能会限制模型的泛化能力。

Abstract: With the rise of generative text-to-speech models, distinguishing between
real and synthetic speech has become challenging, especially for Arabic that
have received limited research attention. Most spoof detection efforts have
focused on English, leaving a significant gap for Arabic and its many dialects.
In this work, we introduce the first multi-dialect Arabic spoofed speech
dataset. To evaluate the difficulty of the synthesized audio from each model
and determine which produces the most challenging samples, we aimed to guide
the construction of our final dataset either by merging audios from multiple
models or by selecting the best-performing model, we conducted an evaluation
pipeline that included training classifiers using two approaches: modern
embedding-based methods combined with classifier heads; classical machine
learning algorithms applied to MFCC features; and the RawNet2 architecture. The
pipeline further incorporated the calculation of Mean Opinion Score based on
human ratings, as well as processing both original and synthesized datasets
through an Automatic Speech Recognition model to measure the Word Error Rate.
Our results demonstrate that FishSpeech outperforms other TTS models in Arabic
voice cloning on the Casablanca corpus, producing more realistic and
challenging synthetic speech samples. However, relying on a single TTS for
dataset creation may limit generalizability.

TL;DR: EditGRPO是一种混合策略强化学习算法，专门用于优化放射学报告生成，通过临床动机奖励提升生成质量，在多个数据集上超越传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在放射学报告生成中虽然性能有所提升，但其监督微调目标并未明确与临床效果对齐，需要更有效的优化方法。

Method: EditGRPO结合了在线策略探索和离线策略指导，通过在训练过程中注入句子级别的详细修正来解决强化学习中的探索困境和采样效率问题。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-VL-3B模型上应用EditGRPO后，在四个主要胸部X光报告生成数据集上，CheXbert、GREEN、Radgraph和RATEScore指标平均提升3.4%，在未见数据集上平均性能增益达5.9%。

Conclusion: EditGRPO通过混合策略强化学习方法有效提升了放射学报告生成的临床效果，并展现出优异的跨域泛化能力。

Abstract: Radiology report generation requires advanced medical image analysis,
effective temporal reasoning, and accurate text generation. Although recent
innovations, particularly multimodal large language models (MLLMs), have shown
improved performance, their supervised fine-tuning (SFT) objective is not
explicitly aligned with clinical efficacy. In this work, we introduce EditGRPO,
a mixed-policy reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm designed specifically to
optimize the generation through clinically motivated rewards. EditGRPO
integrates on-policy exploration with off-policy guidance by injecting
sentence-level detailed corrections during training rollouts. This mixed-policy
approach addresses the exploration dilemma and sampling efficiency issues
typically encountered in RL. Applied to a Qwen2.5-VL-3B MLLM initialized with
supervised fine-tuning (SFT), EditGRPO outperforms both SFT and vanilla GRPO
baselines, achieving an average improvement of 3.4% in CheXbert, GREEN,
Radgraph, and RATEScore metrics across four major chest X-ray report generation
datasets. Notably, EditGRPO also demonstrates superior out-of-domain
generalization, with an average performance gain of 5.9% on unseen datasets.

*Chi Ruan,Dongfu Jiang,Yubo Wang,Wenhu Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Critique Reinforcement Learning (CRL)方法，通过让模型生成对(问题，解决方案)对的批判来增强推理能力，并在代码生成任务上验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习主要关注生成响应，缺乏明确的批判或反思机制。受CFT和CGD等研究的启发，需要开发能够显式教导LLMs如何批判的方法。

Method: 提出CRL方法，模型为给定的(问题，解决方案)对生成批判，奖励仅基于生成的批判的最终判断标签是否与真实判断一致。在此基础上开发Critique-Coder，在标准RL数据中替换20%为CRL数据进行混合训练。

Result: Critique-Coder在所有评估基准上均优于仅使用RL的基线模型。Critique-Coder-8B在LiveCodeBench(v5)上达到60%以上，优于DeepCoder-14B和GPT-o1。在BBEH数据集的逻辑推理任务上也表现更好。

Conclusion: CRL作为标准RL的补充，能够增强模型的通用推理和批判能力，这些能力可迁移到广泛的任务中。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a popular training paradigm,
particularly when paired with reasoning models. While effective, it primarily
focuses on generating responses and lacks mechanisms to explicitly foster
critique or reflection. Several recent studies, like Critique-Fine-Tuning (CFT)
and Critique-Guided-Distillation (CGD) have shown the benefits of explicitly
teaching LLMs how to critique. Motivated by them, we propose Critique
Reinforcement Learning (CRL), where the model is tasked with generating a
critique for a given (question, solution) pair. The reward is determined solely
by whether the final judgment label $c \in \{\texttt{True}, \texttt{False}\}$
of the generated critique aligns with the ground-truth judgment $c^*$. Building
on this point, we introduce \textsc{Critique-Coder}, which is trained on a
hybrid of RL and CRL by substituting 20\% of the standard RL data with CRL
data. We fine-tune multiple models (\textsc{Critique-Coder}) and evaluate them
on different benchmarks to show their advantages over RL-only models. We show
that \textsc{Critique-Coder} consistently outperforms RL-only baselines on all
the evaluated benchmarks. Notably, our \textsc{Critique-Coder-8B} can reach
over 60\% on LiveCodeBench (v5), outperforming other reasoning models like
DeepCoder-14B and GPT-o1. Beyond code generation, \textsc{Critique-Coder} also
demonstrates enhanced general reasoning abilities, as evidenced by its better
performance on logic reasoning tasks from the BBEH dataset. This indicates that
the application of CRL on coding datasets enhances general reasoning and
critique abilities, which are transferable across a broad range of tasks.
Hence, we believe that CRL works as a great complement to standard RL for LLM
reasoning.

*Hwan Chang,Yonghyun Jun,Hwanhee Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ChatInject是一种新型的间接提示注入攻击，通过模仿原生聊天模板格式和多轮对话策略，显著提高了攻击成功率，现有防御方法对此类攻击效果有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着基于大语言模型的智能体与外部环境交互的广泛部署，出现了新的攻击面。传统研究主要关注纯文本注入攻击，但LLM对结构化聊天模板的依赖及其在上下文操作中的脆弱性尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 提出ChatInject攻击方法，将恶意载荷格式化为模仿原生聊天模板的形式，并开发了基于说服策略的多轮对话变体，通过多轮对话引导智能体接受和执行可疑操作。

Result: 实验显示：(1)ChatInject攻击成功率显著高于传统方法，在AgentDojo上从5.18%提升至32.05%，在InjecAgent上从15.13%提升至45.90%，多轮对话在InjecAgent上达到52.33%成功率；(2)聊天模板载荷具有强跨模型迁移性，对闭源模型也有效；(3)现有防御方法对此类攻击基本无效。

Conclusion: 当前智能体系统存在严重安全漏洞，ChatInject攻击揭示了基于聊天模板和多轮对话策略的新型威胁，现有防御机制需要改进以应对此类攻击。

Abstract: The growing deployment of large language model (LLM) based agents that
interact with external environments has created new attack surfaces for
adversarial manipulation. One major threat is indirect prompt injection, where
attackers embed malicious instructions in external environment output, causing
agents to interpret and execute them as if they were legitimate prompts. While
previous research has focused primarily on plain-text injection attacks, we
find a significant yet underexplored vulnerability: LLMs' dependence on
structured chat templates and their susceptibility to contextual manipulation
through persuasive multi-turn dialogues. To this end, we introduce ChatInject,
an attack that formats malicious payloads to mimic native chat templates,
thereby exploiting the model's inherent instruction-following tendencies.
Building on this foundation, we develop a persuasion-driven Multi-turn variant
that primes the agent across conversational turns to accept and execute
otherwise suspicious actions. Through comprehensive experiments across frontier
LLMs, we demonstrate three critical findings: (1) ChatInject achieves
significantly higher average attack success rates than traditional prompt
injection methods, improving from 5.18% to 32.05% on AgentDojo and from 15.13%
to 45.90% on InjecAgent, with multi-turn dialogues showing particularly strong
performance at average 52.33% success rate on InjecAgent, (2)
chat-template-based payloads demonstrate strong transferability across models
and remain effective even against closed-source LLMs, despite their unknown
template structures, and (3) existing prompt-based defenses are largely
ineffective against this attack approach, especially against Multi-turn
variants. These findings highlight vulnerabilities in current agent systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出RSM-DCK模型，通过检测上下文和知识库中的相关部分来改进多轮对话响应选择，避免无用信息干扰。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检索式对话系统将所有上下文和知识内容用于匹配响应候选，但实际上不同部分的重要性不同，过多无用信息会影响匹配性能。

Method: 使用最近上下文作为查询，在词级和语句级语义上预选相关上下文和知识部分；响应候选与选定的上下文和知识分别交互；最后利用上下文和响应候选的融合表示更自信地后选相关知识部分进行匹配。

Result: 在两个基准数据集上的评估结果表明，该模型优于现有方法，并能有效检测相关上下文和知识进行响应选择。

Conclusion: RSM-DCK模型通过检测相关上下文和知识部分，显著提升了多轮对话响应选择的性能。

Abstract: Recently, knowledge-grounded conversations in the open domain gain great
attention from researchers. Existing works on retrieval-based dialogue systems
have paid tremendous efforts to utilize neural networks to build a matching
model, where all of the context and knowledge contents are used to match the
response candidate with various representation methods. Actually, different
parts of the context and knowledge are differentially important for recognizing
the proper response candidate, as many utterances are useless due to the topic
shift. Those excessive useless information in the context and knowledge can
influence the matching process and leads to inferior performance. To address
this problem, we propose a multi-turn \textbf{R}esponse \textbf{S}election
\textbf{M}odel that can \textbf{D}etect the relevant parts of the
\textbf{C}ontext and \textbf{K}nowledge collection (\textbf{RSM-DCK}). Our
model first uses the recent context as a query to pre-select relevant parts of
the context and knowledge collection at the word-level and utterance-level
semantics. Further, the response candidate interacts with the selected context
and knowledge collection respectively. In the end, The fused representation of
the context and response candidate is utilized to post-select the relevant
parts of the knowledge collection more confidently for matching. We test our
proposed model on two benchmark datasets. Evaluation results indicate that our
model achieves better performance than the existing methods, and can
effectively detect the relevant context and knowledge for response selection.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了In-Context Routing (ICR)方法，在注意力logits层面内化可泛化的ICL模式，通过可学习的输入条件路由器调制注意力logits，实现训练一次即可重用的框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的隐式上下文学习方法主要依赖向残差流中注入偏移向量，这些向量通常从标记演示或任务特定对齐构建，未能充分利用ICL的结构机制且泛化能力有限。

Method: ICR提取ICL过程中出现的可重用结构方向，并使用可学习的输入条件路由器相应调制注意力logits，形成训练一次即可重用的框架。

Result: 在12个真实世界数据集上的评估显示，ICR始终优于需要任务特定检索或训练的先前隐式ICL方法，并在现有方法难以处理的域外任务上展现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: ICR能够推动ICL实用价值的边界，为隐式上下文学习提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Implicit in-context learning (ICL) has newly emerged as a promising paradigm
that simulates ICL behaviors in the representation space of Large Language
Models (LLMs), aiming to attain few-shot performance at zero-shot cost.
However, existing approaches largely rely on injecting shift vectors into
residual flows, which are typically constructed from labeled demonstrations or
task-specific alignment. Such designs fall short of utilizing the structural
mechanisms underlying ICL and suffer from limited generalizability. To address
this, we propose In-Context Routing (ICR), a novel implicit ICL method that
internalizes generalizable ICL patterns at the attention logits level. It
extracts reusable structural directions that emerge during ICL and employs a
learnable input-conditioned router to modulate attention logits accordingly,
enabling a train-once-and-reuse framework. We evaluate ICR on 12 real-world
datasets spanning diverse domains and multiple LLMs. The results show that ICR
consistently outperforms prior implicit ICL methods that require task-specific
retrieval or training, while demonstrating robust generalization to
out-of-domain tasks where existing methods struggle. These findings position
ICR to push the boundary of ICL's practical value.

TL;DR: 该论文对45个大型语言模型进行了大规模认知偏见评估，分析了280万条响应，发现LLMs在17.8-57.3%的情况下表现出与人类相似的认知偏见行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs越来越多地嵌入现实世界决策过程，需要评估它们是否表现出人类认知偏见，这对确保AI决策的可靠性至关重要。

Method: 提出了基于多选题任务的评估框架，与心理学家合作手工策划了220个决策场景数据集，使用受控提示变体生成多样化提示。

Result: LLMs在锚定、可得性、确认、框架、解释、过度归因、前景理论和代表性偏见等8种认知偏见中表现出偏见一致性行为。模型规模和提示特异性显著影响偏见易感性：更大模型（>32B参数）在39.5%情况下减少偏见，更详细提示使大多数偏见减少达14.9%。

Conclusion: LLMs确实表现出系统性认知偏见，模型规模和提示设计是减轻偏见的重要因素，需要在AI系统部署中考虑这些发现以确保决策质量。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly embedded in real-world
decision-making processes, it becomes crucial to examine the extent to which
they exhibit cognitive biases. Extensively studied in the field of psychology,
cognitive biases appear as systematic distortions commonly observed in human
judgments. This paper presents a large-scale evaluation of eight
well-established cognitive biases across 45 LLMs, analyzing over 2.8 million
LLM responses generated through controlled prompt variations. To achieve this,
we introduce a novel evaluation framework based on multiple-choice tasks,
hand-curate a dataset of 220 decision scenarios targeting fundamental cognitive
biases in collaboration with psychologists, and propose a scalable approach for
generating diverse prompts from human-authored scenario templates. Our analysis
shows that LLMs exhibit bias-consistent behavior in 17.8-57.3% of instances
across a range of judgment and decision-making contexts targeting anchoring,
availability, confirmation, framing, interpretation, overattribution, prospect
theory, and representativeness biases. We find that both model size and prompt
specificity play a significant role on bias susceptibility as follows: larger
size (>32B parameters) can reduce bias in 39.5% of cases, while higher prompt
detail reduces most biases by up to 14.9%, except in one case
(Overattribution), which is exacerbated by up to 8.8%.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于图神经网络和Transformer的混合方法，结合词汇资源预测阿拉伯语文档可读性，在文档级表现优于单一方法，而GNN在句子级预测更精确。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发阿拉伯语文档可读性预测系统，参与BAREC共享任务2025的约束赛道，旨在通过融合图结构和Transformer模型提升预测性能。

Method: 将文档建模为句子级图，节点包含句子和词元，边捕获词汇共现和类别关系。使用SAMER词汇表特征和阿拉伯语Transformer嵌入增强句子节点。GNN和Transformer作为独立分支训练，通过后期融合结合预测结果。文档级预测采用最大池化聚合句子级输出。

Result: 实验结果显示混合方法在多个可读性指标上优于单独的GNN或Transformer分支。融合方法在文档级具有优势，而纯GNN方法在句子级可读性预测更精确。

Conclusion: 图神经网络与Transformer的融合在文档级可读性预测中表现优越，但GNN单独使用时在句子级预测精度更高，表明不同方法在不同粒度任务中各有优势。

Abstract: We present a graph-based approach enriched with lexicons to predict
document-level readability in Arabic, developed as part of the Constrained
Track of the BAREC Shared Task 2025. Our system models each document as a
sentence-level graph, where nodes represent sentences and lemmas, and edges
capture linguistic relationships such as lexical co-occurrence and class
membership. Sentence nodes are enriched with features from the SAMER lexicon as
well as contextual embeddings from the Arabic transformer model. The graph
neural network (GNN) and transformer sentence encoder are trained as two
independent branches, and their predictions are combined via late fusion at
inference. For document-level prediction, sentence-level outputs are aggregated
using max pooling to reflect the most difficult sentence. Experimental results
show that this hybrid method outperforms standalone GNN or transformer branches
across multiple readability metrics. Overall, the findings highlight that
fusion offers advantages at the document level, but the GNN-only approach
remains stronger for precise prediction of sentence-level readability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受心理学研究启发，当前的自反思策略主要关注逻辑或结构优化，但未能利用情感反馈的引导潜力。

Method: 使用基于Paul Ekman六种基本情感的情感化短语对错误回答提供反馈，通过系统变化情感语调引导模型逃离错误推理路径。

Result: 在有验证器指导时，情感迭代协议显著提升推理深度和准确性，但在无验证器设置下难以稳定利用这些收益。

Conclusion: 机器推理的下一个前沿不仅在于逻辑精炼，还在于理解和利用模型的"内心"（情感方面）。

Abstract: Test-time scaling has shown considerable success in improving the performance
of language models on complex reasoning tasks without requiring fine-tuning.
However, current strategies such as self-reflection primarily focus on logical
or structural refinement. They do not leverage the guiding potential of
affective feedback. Inspired by psychological research showing that emotions
can modulate cognitive performance, we introduce HEART--a novel framework that
uses emotionally-driven prompts for iterative self-correction. HEART provides
feedback on a model's incorrect response using a curated set of concise,
emotionally charged phrases based on the six universal emotions categorized by
Dr. Paul Ekman. By systematically varying the emotional tone of the feedback
across iterations, our method guides the model to escape flawed reasoning paths
and explore more promising alternatives. We evaluate our framework on
challenging reasoning benchmarks including OlympiadBench, Humanity's Last Exam,
and SimpleQA. Our results reveal a significant new phenomenon: when guided by
an oracle verifier, this affective iteration protocol unlocks significantly
deeper reasoning, leading to consistent and substantial increases in accuracy
over state-of-the-art baselines with the same verifier. However, we also
identify a critical bottleneck for practical deployment. In a verifier-free
setting, it struggles to harness these gains consistently, highlighting as a
key challenge for future work. Our findings suggest that the next frontier in
machine reasoning may lie not just in refining logic, but also in understanding
and leveraging the `HEART' of the models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种将心理理论（ToM）显式集成到LLM对话代理中的方法，通过ToMAgent模型在对话中生成心理状态，显著提升了对话效果和目标达成能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的聊天机器人和基于LLM的社交代理通常不整合心理理论（ToM），而ToM是人类社交智能的关键方面，因此需要开发能够理解他人心理状态的对话代理。

Method: 首先通过提示模型在对话轮次之间生成心理状态，然后引入ToMAgent模型，该模型通过将ToM与对话前瞻配对来训练，产生对实现对话目标最有用的心理状态。

Result: 在Sotopia交互式社交评估基准测试中，该方法在多个基线模型上表现出色，ToMA展现出更具战略性、目标导向的推理行为，能够进行长期适应性调整，同时与对话伙伴保持更好的关系。

Conclusion: 这项研究在将心理理论整合到构建社交智能LLM代理方面迈出了重要一步，证明了显式使用ToM可以显著提升对话代理的性能。

Abstract: Theory of Mind (ToM)-an understanding of the mental states of others-is a key
aspect of human social intelligence, yet, chatbots and LLM-based social agents
do not typically integrate it. In this work, we demonstrate that LLMs that
explicitly use ToM get better at dialogue, achieving goals more effectively.
After showing that simply prompting models to generate mental states between
dialogue turns already provides significant benefit, we further introduce
ToMAgent (ToMA), a ToM-focused dialogue agent. ToMA is trained by pairing ToM
with dialogue lookahead to produce mental states that are maximally useful for
achieving dialogue goals. Experiments on the Sotopia interactive social
evaluation benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of our method over a range
of baselines. Comprehensive analysis shows that ToMA exhibits more strategic,
goal-oriented reasoning behaviors, which enable long-horizon adaptation, while
maintaining better relationships with their partners. Our results suggest a
step forward in integrating ToM for building socially intelligent LLM agents.

Result: 在1000个文档提取任务基准测试中，平均奖励0.573，优于GPT-4.1(0.457)、o3(0.464)和GPT-4.1-2025(0.459)。

Conclusion: 任务特定优化可以产生超越通用系统的模型，同时需要更少的计算资源。

Abstract: This paper presents Extract-0, a 7-billion parameter language model
specifically optimized for document information extraction that achieves
performance exceeding models with parameter counts several orders of magnitude
larger. Through a novel combination of synthetic data generation, supervised
fine-tuning with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), and reinforcement learning via
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), Extract-0 achieves a mean reward of
0.573 on a benchmark of 1,000 diverse document extraction tasks, outperforming
GPT-4.1 (0.457), o3 (0.464), and GPT-4.1-2025 (0.459). The training methodology
employs a memory-preserving synthetic data generation pipeline that produces
280,128 training examples from diverse document sources, followed by
parameterefficient fine-tuning that modifies only 0.53% of model weights (40.4M
out of 7.66B parameters). The reinforcement learning phase introduces a novel
semantic similarity-based reward function that handles the inherent ambiguity
in information extraction tasks. This research demonstrates that task-specific

Conclusion: 模型在所有测试中表现总体较差，需要通过临床医生标注的数据集进行领域特定训练，并建立全面的评估框架来基准化性能。

Abstract: Background: Large language models (LLMs) can be useful in diagnosing medical
conditions, but few studies have evaluated their consistency in recommending
appropriate medication regimens. The purpose of this evaluation was to test
GPT-4o on three medication benchmarking tests including mapping a drug name to
its correct formulation, identifying drug-drug interactions using both its
internal knowledge and using a web search, and preparing a medication order
sentence after being given the medication name. Methods: Using GTP-4o three
experiments were completed. Accuracy was quantified by computing cosine
similarity on TF-IDF vectors, normalized Levenshtein similarity, and
ROUGE-1/ROUGE-L F1 between each response and its reference string or by manual
evaluation by clinicians. Results: GPT-4o performed poorly on drug-formulation
matching, with frequent omissions of available drug formulations (mean 1.23 per
medication) and hallucinations of formulations that do not exist (mean 1.14 per
medication). Only 49% of tested medications were correctly matched to all
available formulations. Accuracy was decreased for medications with more
formulations (p<0.0001). GPT-4o was also inconsistent at identifying
drug-drug-interactions, although it had better performance with the
search-augmented assessment compared to its internal knowledge (54.7% vs.
69.2%, p=0.013). However, allowing a web-search worsened performance when there
was no drug-drug interaction (median % correct 100% vs. 40%, p<0.001). Finally,
GPT-4o performed moderately with preparing a medication order sentence, with
only 65.8% of medication order sentences containing no medication or
abbreviation errors. Conclusions: Model performance was overall poor for all
tests. This highlights the need for domain-specific training through
clinician-annotated datasets and a comprehensive evaluation framework for
benchmarking performance.

*Melissa Roemmele,John Joon Young Chung,Taewook Kim,Yuqian Sun,Alex Calderwood,Max Kreminski*

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种使用LLM作为接口来提示文生图模型生成故事场景插图的方法，并创建了SceneIllustrations数据集用于跨模态叙事转换研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用生成式AI将文本内容转换为视觉媒体的能力，特别是为故事叙述生成场景插图，以增强故事表达效果。

Method: 构建一个流水线，使用LLM作为接口处理原始故事文本，生成适合文生图模型的提示词，从而自动生成场景插图。

Result: 创建了SceneIllustrations数据集，通过人工标注获得插图质量评估，证明LLM能够有效表达故事文本中隐含的场景知识。

Conclusion: LLM在生成和评估插图方面具有显著影响力，能够有效支持跨模态叙事转换任务。

Abstract: Generative AI has established the opportunity to readily transform content
from one medium to another. This capability is especially powerful for
storytelling, where visual illustrations can illuminate a story originally
expressed in text. In this paper, we focus on the task of narrative scene
illustration, which involves automatically generating an image depicting a
scene in a story. Motivated by recent progress on text-to-image models, we
consider a pipeline that uses LLMs as an interface for prompting text-to-image
models to generate scene illustrations given raw story text. We apply
variations of this pipeline to a prominent story corpus in order to synthesize
illustrations for scenes in these stories. We conduct a human annotation task
to obtain pairwise quality judgments for these illustrations. The outcome of
this process is the SceneIllustrations dataset, which we release as a new
resource for future work on cross-modal narrative transformation. Through our
analysis of this dataset and experiments modeling illustration quality, we
demonstrate that LLMs can effectively verbalize scene knowledge implicitly
evoked by story text. Moreover, this capability is impactful for generating and
evaluating illustrations.

### [378] [What Matters More For In-Context Learning under Matched Compute Budgets: Pretraining on Natural Text or Incorporating Targeted Synthetic Examples?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22947)
*Mohammed Sabry,Anya Belz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 在等量计算条件下，显式训练归纳电路并不能持续改善上下文学习能力。虽然Bi-Induct课程能加速小规模模型的归纳头出现，但这不直接转化为更好的泛化性能。自然文本训练的模型在标准基准测试中表现相当甚至更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试在预训练中显式练习归纳电路是否能改善上下文学习，还是自然文本在等量计算下已经足够。研究定向合成数据是否能加速归纳头出现并增强ICL能力。

Method: 引入Bi-Induct轻量级课程，在预训练流中注入前向复制（归纳）、后向复制（反归纳）或平衡混合数据。训练0.13B到1B参数模型，在等FLOPs条件下评估少样本ICL基准、头级遥测和语言建模困惑度。

Result: Bi-Induct在小规模加速归纳头出现，但不持续改善泛化。在标准LM基准上匹配自然训练；在函数式ICL探针上，1B自然训练模型表现最佳。自然训练模型发展出更广泛、更早的归纳头，无需显式归纳模式。

Conclusion: 诱导激活不足够：ICL增益取决于这些电路是否变得功能必要。结果强调需要机制感知的预训练诊断和数据混合，以培养负载承担而非仅存在的结构。

Abstract: Does explicitly exercising the induction circuit during pretraining improve
in-context learning (ICL), or is natural text sufficient when compute is held
constant (iso-FLOPs)? To test whether targeted synthetic data can accelerate
induction-head emergence and enhance ICL, we introduce Bi-Induct, a lightweight
curriculum that injects forward-copy (Induction), backward-copy (Anti), or a
balanced mix into the pretraining stream. We train models from 0.13B to 1B
parameters under iso-FLOPs, evaluating (i) few-shot ICL benchmarks, (ii)
head-level telemetry, and (iii) held-out language modeling perplexity. Our
findings challenge the assumption that early induction circuit activation
directly improves ICL. While Bi-Induct accelerates induction-head emergence at
small scales, this does not consistently yield stronger generalization. On
standard LM benchmarks, Bi-Induct matches natural-only training; on
function-style ICL probes, the 1B natural-only performs best. Stress tests
(e.g., label permutation, HITS@1 vs. HITS@3, 1 vs. 10 shots) preserve these
trends. Telemetry shows larger natural-only models develop broader, earlier
induction heads without explicit induction patterns. Anti-induction data fails
to elicit meaningful activation. Perplexity penalties from synthetic data
shrink with scale, suggesting larger models can absorb non-natural patterns
with minimal cost. Crucially, ablating the top 2% of induction heads degrades
ICL more than random ablations, especially for natural-only models, indicating
more centralized, load-bearing circuits. Bi-Induct variants exhibit more
redundant induction activity, implying different circuit utilization. Overall,
inducing activation is not sufficient: ICL gains depend on these circuits
becoming functionally necessary. These results underscore mechanism-aware
pretraining diagnostics and data mixtures that foster load-bearing, not merely
present, structure.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文研究了自监督语音模型在识别英语名词和动词屈折变化时使用的表征策略，发现这些模型通过全局线性几何结构来关联词形变化，而非直接追踪音系或形态单位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解自监督语音模型在嘈杂环境中识别口语单词时使用的语言表征类型，特别是它们如何处理音系和形态现象。

Method: 研究针对单词识别优化的S3M变体模型，分析它们对常见英语名词和动词屈折变化的表征方式。

Result: 模型表征展现出全局线性几何结构，可用于关联英语名词和动词与其规则屈折形式，但这种结构不直接追踪音系或形态单位，而是追踪英语词汇中许多词对之间的规则分布关系。

Conclusion: 这些发现提出了可能支持人类口语单词识别的候选表征策略，挑战了音系和形态需要不同语言表征的传统假设。

Abstract: Self-supervised speech models can be trained to efficiently recognize spoken
words in naturalistic, noisy environments. However, we do not understand the
types of linguistic representations these models use to accomplish this task.
To address this question, we study how S3M variants optimized for word
recognition represent phonological and morphological phenomena in frequent
English noun and verb inflections. We find that their representations exhibit a
global linear geometry which can be used to link English nouns and verbs to
their regular inflected forms.
  This geometric structure does not directly track phonological or
morphological units. Instead, it tracks the regular distributional
relationships linking many word pairs in the English lexicon -- often, but not
always, due to morphological inflection. These findings point to candidate
representational strategies that may support human spoken word recognition,
challenging the presumed necessity of distinct linguistic representations of
phonology and morphology.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究通过控制实验首次系统分析了表格表示形式对问答性能的影响，发现SQL方法在结构化数据上表现好但在半结构化数据上退化，LLMs灵活但精度低，混合方法在噪声模式中表现平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的表格问答需要同时处理结构化数据库和半结构化表格，但现有基准测试受限于固定数据格式，未能系统研究表示形式如何影响模型性能。

Method: 使用语言化流水线生成配对的结枃化和半结构化表格，保持内容不变但改变结构，并引入包含表格大小、连接需求、查询复杂度和模式质量等维度的诊断基准。

Result: 实验显示SQL方法在结构化输入上准确率高但在半结构化数据上性能下降，LLMs具有灵活性但精度降低，混合方法在噪声模式中表现最佳。这些效应随表格增大和查询变复杂而增强。

Conclusion: 没有单一方法在所有条件下都表现优异，表格表示形式在塑造问答性能中起着核心作用，研究结果为模型选择和设计提供了可行见解，为适应多样化真实世界数据格式的鲁棒混合方法铺平了道路。

Abstract: Table Question Answering (Table QA) in real-world settings must operate over
both structured databases and semi-structured tables containing textual fields.
However, existing benchmarks are tied to fixed data formats and have not
systematically examined how representation itself affects model performance. We
present the first controlled study that isolates the role of table
representation by holding content constant while varying structure. Using a
verbalization pipeline, we generate paired structured and semi-structured
tables, enabling direct comparisons across modeling paradigms. To support
detailed analysis, we introduce a diagnostic benchmark with splits along table
size, join requirements, query complexity, and schema quality. Our experiments
reveal consistent trade-offs: SQL-based methods achieve high accuracy on
structured inputs but degrade on semi-structured data, LLMs exhibit flexibility
but reduced precision, and hybrid approaches strike a balance, particularly
under noisy schemas. These effects intensify with larger tables and more
complex queries. Ultimately, no single method excels across all conditions, and
we highlight the central role of representation in shaping Table QA
performance. Our findings provide actionable insights for model selection and
design, paving the way for more robust hybrid approaches suited for diverse
real-world data formats.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传记是事实知识的关键但未被充分探索的维度，目前缺乏系统评估LLM在传记推理能力的方法。

Method: 构建覆盖400万人的多语言多模态数据集AdamDB；基于布鲁姆分类法设计六个推理层级的评估基准AdamBench；开发针对传记内容的检索增强生成系统AdamRAG。

Result: AdamRAG显著提升开源模型性能，对闭源模型有适度改善；在低阶推理任务上提升最大；流行度强烈影响准确性；人脸图像的多模态输入改进较小且不稳定。

Conclusion: ADAM建立了首个认知、文化和多模态基础的传记评估基准，推动了多语言、准确且抗幻觉的多模态大语言模型发展。

Abstract: We introduce ADAM (A Diverse Archive of Mankind), a framework for evaluating
and improving multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in biographical
reasoning. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to
systematically examine LLM capabilities in biography, a critical yet
underexplored dimension of factual knowledge. At its core, AdamDB is a
multilingual and multimodal dataset covering over 4 million individuals across
geography, time, and profession, while AdamBench provides cognitively
structured evaluations based on Bloom's taxonomy, spanning six reasoning levels
in both English and native languages. To address hallucinations, particularly
for lesser-known individuals, we propose AdamRAG, a retrieval-augmented
generation system tailored to biographical contexts. Experiments show that
AdamRAG substantially improves open-source models and modestly benefits
closed-source ones, with the largest gains on lower-order reasoning. Popularity
strongly mediates accuracy, and multimodal input via face images offers
smaller, less consistent improvements than retrieval. ADAM establishes the
first benchmark and framework for cognitively, culturally, and multimodally
grounded biographical evaluation, advancing the development of multilingual,
accurate, and hallucination-resistant MLLMs.

Conclusion: 成功创建了多模型生成的英语和捷克语语料库，为研究LLM生成文本的语言特征提供了有价值的资源，这些语料库可公开获取并支持语言学分析。

Abstract: This article presents two corpora of English and Czech texts generated with
large language models (LLMs). The motivation is to create a resource for
comparing human-written texts with LLM-generated text linguistically. Emphasis
was placed on ensuring these resources are multi-genre and rich in terms of
topics, authors, and text types, while maintaining comparability with existing
human-created corpora. These generated corpora replicate reference human
corpora: BE21 by Paul Baker, which is a modern version of the original Brown
Corpus, and Koditex corpus that also follows the Brown Corpus tradition but in
Czech. The new corpora were generated using models from OpenAI, Anthropic,
Alphabet, Meta, and DeepSeek, ranging from GPT-3 (davinci-002) to GPT-4.5, and
are tagged according to the Universal Dependencies standard (i.e., they are
tokenized, lemmatized, and morphologically and syntactically annotated). The
subcorpus size varies according to the model used (the English part contains on
average 864k tokens per model, 27M tokens altogether, the Czech partcontains on
average 768k tokens per model, 21.5M tokens altogether). The corpora are freely
available for download under the CC BY 4.0 license (the annotated data are

TL;DR: ReMemR1是一种具有回调增强记忆的内存增强代理，通过选择性检索整个记忆历史和支持非线性推理来解决长上下文问答中的信息分散问题。结合多级奖励强化学习，显著提升了长文档问答性能。


<details>

Motivation: 现有的大语言模型在处理长上下文问答时面临关键证据分散在数百万token中的挑战。现有的"边读边记"方法虽然效率高，但存在不可逆的前向处理、信息覆盖丢失和稀疏强化学习信号等问题。

Method: 提出ReMemR1内存增强代理，具有回调增强记忆机制，允许从整个记忆历史中选择性检索，支持非线性推理和早期证据重访。同时提出多级奖励强化学习(RLMLR)，结合最终答案奖励和密集的步骤级信号来指导有效内存使用。

Result: 在长文档问答任务上的实验表明，ReMemR1相比现有基于内存的方法取得了显著提升，验证了其作为长上下文推理代理的有效解决方案。

Conclusion: ReMemR1通过回调增强记忆和多级奖励强化学习，有效缓解了信息退化问题，改进了监督机制，支持多跳内存利用，为长上下文推理代理提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models face challenges in long-context question answering,
where key evidence of a query may be dispersed across millions of tokens.
Existing works equip large language models with a memory corpus that is
dynamically updated during a single-pass document scan, also known as the
"memorize while reading" methods. While this approach scales efficiently, it
suffers from irreversible forward-only processing, information loss through
overwriting, and sparse reinforcement learning signals. To tackle these
challenges, we present ReMemR1, a memory-augmented agent with callback-enhanced
memory that allows selective retrieval from the entire memory history and
allows non-linear reasoning and revisiting of early evidence. To further
strengthen training, we propose Reinforcement Learning with Multi-Level Rewards
(RLMLR), which combines final-answer rewards with dense, step-level signals
that guide effective memory use. Together, these contributions mitigate
information degradation, improve supervision, and support multi-hop memory
utilizing. Experiments on long-document QA show significant gains over existing
memory-based approaches, which validates ReMemR1 as an effective solution for
long-context reasoning agents.

TL;DR: 本文研究了大型语言模型在多方辩论系统中的奉承行为，提出了首个专门针对该场景的奉承行为定义和评估指标，揭示了奉承行为会导致辩论过早达成共识，降低准确性，并提出了相应的设计原则。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在多方辩论系统中表现出过度的奉承倾向，这种倾向可能导致辩论过早达成共识，从而削弱多方辩论的优势。现有研究主要关注用户与LLM之间的奉承行为，而代理间奉承行为在辩论中的影响尚不清楚。

Method: 提出了首个操作框架：(1) 为多方辩论系统定义了专门的奉承行为定义；(2) 开发了评估代理奉承水平及其对信息交换影响的新指标；(3) 系统研究了不同奉承水平在去中心化和中心化辩论框架中对结果的影响。

Result: 研究发现奉承行为是核心失败模式，会在达成正确结论前放大分歧崩溃，导致比单代理基线更低的准确性，并源于不同的辩手驱动和法官驱动失败模式。

Conclusion: 基于研究发现，提出了可操作的多方辩论系统设计原则，有效平衡代理互动中的生产性分歧与合作。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often display sycophancy, a tendency toward
excessive agreeability. This behavior poses significant challenges for
multi-agent debating systems (MADS) that rely on productive disagreement to
refine arguments and foster innovative thinking. LLMs' inherent sycophancy can
collapse debates into premature consensus, potentially undermining the benefits
of multi-agent debate. While prior studies focus on user--LLM sycophancy, the
impact of inter-agent sycophancy in debate remains poorly understood. To
address this gap, we introduce the first operational framework that (1)
proposes a formal definition of sycophancy specific to MADS settings, (2)
develops new metrics to evaluate the agent sycophancy level and its impact on
information exchange in MADS, and (3) systematically investigates how varying
levels of sycophancy across agent roles (debaters and judges) affects outcomes
in both decentralized and centralized debate frameworks. Our findings reveal
that sycophancy is a core failure mode that amplifies disagreement collapse
before reaching a correct conclusion in multi-agent debates, yields lower
accuracy than single-agent baselines, and arises from distinct debater-driven
and judge-driven failure modes. Building on these findings, we propose
actionable design principles for MADS, effectively balancing productive
disagreement with cooperation in agent interactions.

Result: 在多种模型架构和任务上，该方法在计算效率和整体性能上都优于自评估方法。

Conclusion: 语义投票为不可验证任务提供了一种计算高效且性能优越的自改进方案。

Abstract: The rising cost of acquiring supervised data has driven significant interest
in self-improvement for large language models (LLMs). Straightforward
unsupervised signals like majority voting have proven effective in generating
pseudo-labels for verifiable tasks, while their applicability to unverifiable
tasks (e.g., translation) is limited by the open-ended character of responses.
As a result, self-evaluation mechanisms (e.g., self-judging and entropy
minimization) are predominantly used to derive pseudo-labels. However,
self-evaluation relying on LLMs typically incurs high computational overhead
and introduces overconfidence issues due to intrinsic biases. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel self-evaluation-free approach for unverifiable
tasks, designed for lightweight yet effective self-improvement. Inspired by
majority voting commonly employed in verifiable tasks, we propose semantic
voting as a novel mechanism that relaxes the principle of hard matching (i.e.,
exact matching) toward soft matching (i.e., semantic similarity). Soft matching
is achieved by leveraging a lightweight sentence embedding model to quantify
semantic similarity, thereby mitigating excessive computational burden and
intrinsic bias-associated limitations of self-evaluation. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that our method achieves substantial gains in
computational efficiency and overall better performance than self-evaluation
methods across diverse model architectures and tasks.

Motivation: 当前RAG代理开发缺乏过程级监督来指导任务分解、检索器调用和逐步决策能力，而现有数据合成方法只能产生思维链推理，无法模拟环境交互。

Method: EviPath包含三个组件：溯因子任务规划（分解问题并规划最优解路径）、忠实子问题回答（使用支持证据构建代理环境生成推理思路和答案）、对话微调（将完整交互轨迹格式化为对话格式进行监督微调）。

Result: 在广泛使用的问答基准测试中，使用EviPath合成数据训练的8B参数模型显著且持续优于最先进的基线方法，在开放领域问答中实现了14.7%的绝对EM增益。

Conclusion: EviPath能够有效合成证据锚定的推理路径，使LLM能够直接从合成数据中学习复杂推理和工具使用能力，显著提升RAG代理的性能。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation agents development is hindered by the lack of
process-level supervision to effectively guide agentic capabilities like task
decomposition, retriever invocation, and stepwise decision-making. While
reinforcement learning offers a potential solution, it suffers from sparse
rewards and the limited reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs).
Meanwhile, existing data synthesis methods only produce chain-of-thought
rationales and fail to model environmental interactions. In this paper, we
propose EviPath, an evidence-anchored reasoning path synthesis paradigm for RAG
agent development. EviPath comprises: (i) Abductive Subtask Planning, which
decomposes the problem into sub-questions and iteratively plans an optimal
solution path based on the dependencies between them; (ii) Faithful
Sub-question Answering, which uses supporting evidence to construct a proxy
environment to generate reasoning thoughts and answers for each sub-question;
and (iii) Conversational Fine-Tuning, which formats the complete
agent-environment interaction trajectory into a dialogue format suitable for
Supervised Fine-Tuning. EviPath allows LLMs to learn complex reasoning and
tool-use capabilities directly from synthesized data. Extensive experiments on
widely-used question-answering benchmarks show that an 8B parameter model
trained with EviPath-synthesized data significantly and consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines with a double-digit absolute EM gain of
14.7% in open-domain question answering.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解大型语言模型在创意任务中的不确定性是一个基本挑战，特别是在存在多个有效输出的情况下。

Method: 使用置信集（概率分布的凸包）框架，分析500个创意写作提示，每个提示有10个人类续写，评估4个语言模型在5种解码策略下生成的10万个故事。

Result: 模型与人类创意校准的最佳结果仅为0.434（Gemma-2B，温度0.7），解码策略选择贡献了39.4%到72.0%的总认知不确定性，模型规模与校准质量相关性弱。

Conclusion: 几何框架为改进生成系统以实现人机创意对齐提供了可行见解，并发布了完整的实验框架。

Abstract: Understanding uncertainty in large language models remains a fundamental
challenge, particularly in creative tasks where multiple valid outputs exist.
We present a geometric framework using credal sets - convex hulls of
probability distributions - to quantify and decompose uncertainty in neural
text generation, calibrated against human creative variation. Analyzing 500
creative writing prompts from the WritingPrompts dataset with 10 unique human
continuations each, we evaluate four language models across five decoding
strategies, generating 100,000 stories. Our credal set analysis reveals
substantial gaps in capturing human creative variation, with the best
model-human calibration reaching only 0.434 (Gemma-2B with temperature 0.7). We
decompose total uncertainty into epistemic and aleatoric components, finding
that the choice of decoding strategy contributes 39.4% to 72.0% of total
epistemic uncertainty. Model scale shows weak correlation with calibration
quality and no significant difference exists between base and instruction-tuned
models in calibration quality. Our geometric framework provides actionable
insights for improving generation systems for human-AI creative alignment. We
release our complete experimental framework.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为d²Cache的训练自由近似KV缓存框架，用于加速扩散式大语言模型(dLLM)的推理效率，通过两阶段细粒度选择策略自适应更新KV状态，同时实现推理加速和生成质量提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散式大语言模型(dLLM)由于依赖双向注意力机制，无法像自回归模型(ARM)那样直接受益于标准的键值(KV)缓存，导致推理效率较低。

Method: 提出d²Cache框架，采用两阶段细粒度选择策略：识别关键token并在每个解码步骤自适应更新其KV状态，同时缓存其余token的KV状态以供重用。

Result: 在LLaDA和Dream两个代表性dLLM上的实验表明，d²Cache不仅实现了显著的推理加速，还在生成质量上获得了一致的提升。

Conclusion: d²Cache是一种有效的训练自由解决方案，能够同时提升dLLM的推理效率和生成质量，支持准从左到右的生成方式并缓解序列末端token的过早过度自信问题。

Abstract: Diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs), despite their promising
performance, still suffer from inferior inference efficiency. This is because
dLLMs rely on bidirectional attention and cannot directly benefit from the
standard key-value (KV) cache as autoregressive models (ARMs) do. To tackle
this issue, we introduce \textit{Dual aDaptive Cache} (d$^2$Cache), which is a
training-free approximate KV cache framework for accelerating dLLM inference.
d$^2$Cache features a two-stage fine-grained selection strategy to identify
tokens and adaptively update their KV states at each decoding step, while
caching the KV states of the remaining tokens for reuse. Furthermore,
d$^2$Cache naturally offers a more reliable decoding alternative, which can
enable quasi left-to-right generation and mitigate premature overconfidence in
tokens at the end of the sequence. Extensive experimental results on two
representative dLLMs (\ie, LLaDA and Dream) demonstrate that d$^2$Cache not
only achieves substantial inference speedups, but also yields consistent
improvements in generation quality. The code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了SmiSelf框架，通过将无效SMILES转换为SELFIES表示来确保100%有效的分子生成，同时保持分子特性并提升其他指标性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在少样本设置下使用SMILES表示生成分子时难以保证有效性的问题，探索如何实现100%有效的分子生成。

Method: 开发SmiSelf框架，利用语法规则将无效SMILES转换为SELFIES表示，借助SELFIES的机制来修正无效SMILES。

Result: 实验表明SmiSelf能确保100%有效性，同时保持分子特性，并在其他指标上维持或提升性能。

Conclusion: SmiSelf扩展了LLMs在生物医学中的实际应用，兼容所有基于SMILES的生成模型。

Abstract: Molecule generation is key to drug discovery and materials science, enabling
the design of novel compounds with specific properties. Large language models
(LLMs) can learn to perform a wide range of tasks from just a few examples.
However, generating valid molecules using representations like SMILES is
challenging for LLMs in few-shot settings. In this work, we explore how LLMs
can generate 100% valid molecules. We evaluate whether LLMs can use SELFIES, a
representation where every string corresponds to a valid molecule, for valid
molecule generation but find that LLMs perform worse with SELFIES than with
SMILES. We then examine LLMs' ability to correct invalid SMILES and find their
capacity limited. Finally, we introduce SmiSelf, a cross-chemical language
framework for invalid SMILES correction. SmiSelf converts invalid SMILES to
SELFIES using grammatical rules, leveraging SELFIES' mechanisms to correct the
invalid SMILES. Experiments show that SmiSelf ensures 100% validity while
preserving molecular characteristics and maintaining or even enhancing
performance on other metrics. SmiSelf helps expand LLMs' practical applications
in biomedicine and is compatible with all SMILES-based generative models. Code

Simulation TL;DR: A non-collaborative user simulation method for tool agent.
Abstract: Tool agents interact with users through multi-turn dialogues to
accomplish various tasks. Recent studies have adopted user simulation methods
to develop these agents in multi-turn settings. However, existing user
simulators tend to be agent-friendly, exhibiting only cooperative behaviors,
which fails to train and test agents against non-collaborative users in the
real world. To address this, we propose a novel user simulator architecture
that simulates four categories of non-collaborative behaviors: requesting
unavailable services, digressing into tangential conversations, expressing
impatience, and providing incomplete utterances. Our user simulator can
simulate challenging and natural non-collaborative behaviors while reliably
delivering all intents and information necessary to accomplish the task. Our
experiments on MultiWOZ and $\tau$-bench reveal significant performance
degradation in state-of-the-art tool agents when encountering non-collaborative
users. We provide detailed analyses of agents' weaknesses under each
non-collaborative condition, such as escalated hallucinations and dialogue
breakdowns. Ultimately, we contribute an easily extensible user simulation
framework to help the research community develop tool agents and preemptively
diagnose them under challenging real-world conditions within their own
services.

TL;DR: TagPR框架通过标记思维方法增强LLM的个性化推理能力，使用数据驱动管道生成带语义标签的推理链，结合监督微调和多阶段强化学习，在LaMP基准上实现32.65%的平均提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型在通用推理方面表现出色，但在个性化推理方面存在不足，无法有效分析用户历史、推断独特偏好并生成定制化响应。

Method: 开发数据驱动管道自动生成带语义标签的推理链，采用监督微调建立基础推理模式，然后进行多阶段强化学习，使用包含标签约束和个性化奖励模型的复合奖励信号。

Result: 在LaMP基准和自建数据集上的实验显示，该方法达到最先进水平，相比基础模型在所有任务上平均提升32.65%。

Conclusion: 结构化、可解释的推理是解锁LLM真正个性化能力的有效途径。

Abstract: Recent advancements have endowed Large Language Models (LLMs) with impressive
general reasoning capabilities, yet they often struggle with personalization
reasoning - the crucial ability to analyze user history, infer unique
preferences, and generate tailored responses. To address this limitation, we
introduce TagPR, a novel training framework that significantly enhances an
LLM's intrinsic capacity for personalization reasoning through a tagging the
thought approach. Our method first develops a data-driven pipeline to
automatically generate and semantically label reasoning chains, creating a
structured dataset that fosters interpretable reasoning. We then propose a
synergistic training strategy that begins with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on
this tagged data to establish foundational reasoning patterns, followed by a
multi-stage reinforcement learning (RL) process. This RL phase is guided by a
unique composite reward signal, which integrates tag-based constraints and a
novel Personalization Reward Model with User Embeddings (PRMU) to achieve
fine-grained alignment with user-specific logic. Extensive experiments on the
public LaMP benchmark and a self-constructed dataset demonstrate that our
approach achieves state-of-the-art results, delivering an average improvement
of 32.65% over the base model across all tasks. Our work validates that
structured, interpretable reasoning is a highly effective pathway to unlocking
genuine personalization capabilities in LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TReASURe是一种基于树搜索的测试时对齐方法，针对掩码扩散语言模型解决了分支相关性和奖励评估方差大的问题，在低计算预算下实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将树搜索应用于掩码扩散语言模型面临两个关键挑战：(i)并行去掩码产生高度相关的分支，限制了探索；(ii)通过采样完成进行奖励评估会产生高方差估计，使剪枝不稳定。

Method: 提出TReASURe方法，包含：(i)UnmaskBranch分支策略，基于首次命中去掩码，在单个模型调用中多样化令牌内容和揭示顺序；(ii)ResubstituteScore剪枝规则，使用确定性重替换以低方差代理完成来评分部分掩码序列。

Result: 在困惑度、语言可接受性以及情感和毒性控制方面取得了最先进的结果，在匹配计算预算下优于先前方法，在低NFE（函数评估次数）机制中表现尤其突出。

Conclusion: TReASURe通过改进的分支策略和剪枝规则，有效解决了掩码扩散语言模型中树搜索的关键挑战，在计算效率和性能方面都取得了显著提升。

Abstract: Tree search has recently emerged as a powerful framework for aligning
generative models with task-specific rewards at test time. Applying tree search
to Masked Diffusion Language Models, however, introduces two key challenges:
(i) parallel unmasking yields highly correlated branches, limiting exploration,
and (ii) reward evaluation via sampled completions produces high-variance
estimates, making pruning unstable. We propose TReASURe, a tree-search
test-time alignment method that addresses these issues. It introduces (i)
UnmaskBranch, a branching strategy based on first-hitting unmasking that
diversifies both token content and reveal order with a single model call per
parent node, and (ii) ResubstituteScore, a pruning rule that uses deterministic
resubstitution to score partially masked sequences with low-variance proxy
completions. Theoretically, we quantify branching efficiency gains in NFEs
(number of function evaluations), show that the scoring rule approximates the
true reward with error bounded by predictive uncertainty, and prove
improvements with larger tree widths. Empirically, TReASURe achieves
state-of-the-art results on perplexity, linguistic acceptability, and control
of sentiment and toxicity, outperforming prior methods under matched compute
budgets, with especially strong gains in low-NFE regimes.

TL;DR: 提出了T2PAM新范式，利用用户反馈作为奖励信号估计最优策略，通过ROSA算法实现单步高效更新，使LLM在对话中进行自我修正。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在多轮交互中性能下降，因为它们在静态单轮数据上训练，难以适应实时用户反馈。

Method: 提出T2PAM范式，利用用户反馈估计潜在最优策略，然后更新少量参数；引入ROSA算法，实现单步高效策略更新。

Result: 理论分析证明ROSA策略会收敛到用户偏好；实验显示在任务效果和效率上均有显著提升。

Conclusion: T2PAM和ROSA能够有效解决LLM在多轮交互中的性能退化问题，实现高效的自适应对话优化。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) employ multi-turn interaction as a fundamental
paradigm for completing complex tasks. However, their performance often
degrades in extended interactions, as they are typically trained on static,
single-turn data, which hinders their ability to adapt to real-time user
feedback. To address this limitation, we first propose a new paradigm:
Test-Time Policy Adaptation for Multi-Turn Interactions (T2PAM), which utilizes
user feedback from the ongoing interaction as a reward signal to estimate a
latent optimal policy aligned with user preferences, then updates a small
subset of parameters to steer the model toward this policy, ultimately enabling
efficient in-conversation self-correction. We then introduce Optimum-Referenced
One-Step Adaptation (ROSA), a lightweight algorithm that operationalizes T2PAM.
ROSA guides the model parameters toward a theoretical optimal policy in a
single, efficient update step, avoiding costly iterative gradient-based
optimization and minimizing computational overhead. We provide a rigorous
theoretical analysis guaranteeing that the policy of ROSA converges to the
preference of user as the number of interactions increases. Extensive
experiments on challenging benchmark demonstrate that ROSA achieves significant
improvements in both task effectiveness and efficiency.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的预训练方法：用潜在思维预训练语言模型，通过在生成每个token前先生成一个中间潜在思维（隐藏状态），从而在相同推理成本下获得比标准模型更好的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受Chain-of-Thought（CoT）在测试时通过扩展生成步骤提升性能的启发，探索是否能在预训练阶段通过扩展计算步骤来改善每个token的生成质量。

Method: 预训练语言模型先生成中间潜在思维（当前位置的最后一个隐藏状态），然后使用该潜在思维作为输入来预测实际的下一个token，这种额外的计算步骤让模型能在无约束连续空间中优化预测。

Result: 在相同推理成本下，生成一个额外潜在思维的1.4B模型性能超过标准2.8B模型，在语言建模和各种下游任务上表现更优。增加潜在思维数量（形成类似CoT的链）能持续提升模型性能。

Conclusion: 通过预训练时引入潜在思维生成步骤，可以在不增加推理成本的情况下显著提升语言模型的性能，这为改进语言模型预训练提供了新思路。

Abstract: The remarkable success of Chain-of-Thought (CoT), which enhances performance
by scaling generation steps at test-time, inspires us to ask: can we leverage a
similar scaling of computational steps during pretraining to improve the
generation of each individual token? To address this, we propose a novel
pre-training methodology: Pretraining Language Models with Latent Thoughts. Our
approach pretrains a language model (LM) to first generate an intermediate
latent thought-the last hidden state of the current position-which is then used
as input to predict the actual subsequent token. This additional computational
step enables the LM to refine its prediction within unconstrained continuous
space. Our experiments demonstrate that, at an identical inference cost, a LM
that generates one additional latent thought per token outperforms a standard
model with double the parameters. For instance, ours-1.4B (Pythia Arch),
pretrained on 300B tokens from the Pile, significantly surpasses the vanilla
Pythia-2.8B trained on the same data on both language modeling and a range of
general downstream tasks. Furthermore, increasing the number of latent thoughts
generated before each actual token-forming a chain analogous to
CoT-consistently improves the model's performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM驱动的多智能体系统在复杂任务中表现出色，但存在系统性故障模式：在指令冲突时智能体错误地优先处理系统级规则，而现有宏观指标无法有效检测和指导修复这些微观违规行为。

Method: 三阶段框架：(1)诊断-上下文角色遵从评分(CRAS)，将角色遵从分解为四个可测量维度；(2)定位-注意力漂移分析，发现指令冲突主要由中间层注意力头解决；(3)对齐-手术式指令层对齐(SAIL)，仅在定位的关键层安装LoRA，使用基于令牌权重的DPO风格偏好目标进行优化。

Result: 在标准基准和多智能体框架上，该方法显著提高了指令层级遵从性（如在AutoGen上的MedQA任务中提升5.60%），且无需全模型微调。

Conclusion: 通过诊断、定位和对齐的三阶段框架，能够有效解决LLM多智能体系统中的指令冲突问题，提升系统可靠性，为可靠性关键部署提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-powered multi-agent systems (MAS) have rapidly
advanced collaborative reasoning, tool use, and role-specialized coordination
in complex tasks. However, reliability-critical deployment remains hindered by
a systemic failure mode: hierarchical compliance under instruction conflicts
(system-user, peer-peer), where agents misprioritize system-level rules in the
presence of competing demands. Moreover, widely used macro-level metrics (e.g.,
pass@k) obscure these micro-level violations and offer little actionable
guidance for remedy. In this work, we present a full-stack, three-stage
framework: (1) Diagnose - Contextualized Role Adherence Score (CRAS), a
query-wise, context-aware scoring metric that decomposes role adherence into
four measurable dimensions; (2) Localize - attention drift analysis revealing
that instruction conflicts are resolved by attention heads that are largely
concentrated in middle layers; (3) Align - Surgical Alignment of Instruction
Layers (SAIL), which installs LoRA only on the localized focal layers and
optimizes a token-weighted DPO-style preference objective that credits tokens
by their focal attentional contribution. Across standard benchmarks and MAS
frameworks, our surgical approach improves instruction hierarchy compliance
(e.g., +5.60% with AutoGen on MedQA) without full-model finetuning.

Motivation: 现有研究主要使用违反范式，混淆了句法类别检测和短语结构构建两个可分离的过程，并隐含假设短语结构在类别检测之后。本研究旨在在自然阅读条件下区分这两个过程并测试其时间顺序。

Method: 使用ZuCo语料库中共同记录的EEG和眼动追踪数据，分析注视转移模式，进行贝叶斯网络建模，并分析注视相关电位。

Result: 注视转移显示读者优先在句法核心词之间移动；贝叶斯网络显示结构深度是偏离线性阅读的最强驱动因素；注视相关电位显示句法惊奇度在词出现前和早期整合阶段影响神经活动。

Conclusion: 短语结构构建可以发生在词类检测之前并主导词汇影响，支持预测性的"树状支架"理解模型，扩展了当前句法时间模型。

Abstract: A central question in psycholinguistics is the timing of syntax in sentence
processing. Much of the existing evidence comes from violation paradigms, which
conflate two separable processes - syntactic category detection and phrase
structure construction - and implicitly assume that phrase structure follows
category detection. In this study, we use co-registered EEG and eye-tracking
data from the ZuCo corpus to disentangle these processes and test their
temporal order under naturalistic reading conditions. Analyses of gaze
transitions showed that readers preferentially moved between syntactic heads,
suggesting that phrase structures, rather than serial word order, organize
scanpaths. Bayesian network modeling further revealed that structural depth was
the strongest driver of deviations from linear reading, outweighing lexical
familiarity and surprisal. Finally, fixation-related potentials demonstrated
that syntactic surprisal influences neural activity before word onset (-184 to
-10 ms) and during early integration (48 to 300 ms). These findings extend
current models of syntactic timing by showing that phrase structure
construction can precede category detection and dominate lexical influences,
supporting a predictive "tree-scaffolding" account of comprehension.

Method: 提出Insight-to-Solve方法，通过将演示转化为明确的、可重用的见解，并生成目标特定的推理轨迹，可选地通过自我精炼提高连贯性和正确性。

Result: 在多样化基准测试中，I2S和I2S+方法始终优于直接回答和测试时扩展基线，在开源和闭源模型上均表现优异。GPT-4.1在AIME'25上提升14.0%。

Conclusion: 通过洞察-精炼-解决框架，可以有效地利用上下文演示来提升推理大语言模型的性能。

Abstract: Recent reasoning LLMs (RLMs), especially those trained with verifier-based
reinforcement learning, often perform worse with few-shot CoT than with direct
answering. We revisit this paradox using high-quality reasoning traces from
DeepSeek-R1 as demonstrations and find that adding more exemplars consistently
degrades accuracy, even when demonstrations are optimal. A detailed analysis
reveals two mechanisms behind this decline: (i) semantic misguidance, where
high textual similarity leads the model to treat the target as the same as the
exemplar and to copy intermediate steps verbatim; and (ii) strategy transfer
failure, where the model struggles to extract useful reasoning strategies and
apply them to target questions. Guided by these, we introduce Insight-to-Solve
(I2S), a sequential test-time procedure that turns demonstrations into
explicit, reusable insights and derives a target-specific reasoning trace;
optionally, the reasoning is self-refined for coherence and correctness (I2S+).
Extensive experiments on diverse benchmarks show that I2S and I2S+ consistently
outperform both direct answering and test-time scaling baselines across open-
and closed-source models. Even for GPT models, our method helps: on AIME'25,
GPT-4.1 rises by +14.0%, and o1-mini improves by +2.7% on AIME and +1.7% on
GPQA, indicating that in-context demonstrations can be harnessed effectively
via insight-refine-solve framework.

Motivation: 探究K-pop在全球市场成功背后的语言策略，特别是语码转换和英语歌词使用在全球化背景下的作用。

Method: 收集2017-2025年登上Billboard Hot 100和Global 200榜单的K-pop歌曲数据，分析英语和韩语歌词比例、语码转换频率等语言特征，并进行性别分类预测。

Result: 英语在全球成功的K-pop歌曲中占主导地位，男女歌手都高度使用英语和语码转换，无显著性别差异。女性独唱歌手更倾向于使用英语。分类任务达到0.76的宏F1分数。

Conclusion: K-pop歌词中的语言选择受到全球市场压力的影响，反映了表演者身份和榜单背景的风格模式，英语使用对美国市场成功更为关键。

Abstract: Code switching, particularly between Korean and English, has become a
defining feature of modern K-pop, reflecting both aesthetic choices and global
market strategies. This paper is a primary investigation into the linguistic
strategies employed in K-pop songs that achieve global chart success, with a
focus on the role of code-switching and English lyric usage. A dataset of K-pop
songs that appeared on the Billboard Hot 100 and Global 200 charts from 2017 to
2025, spanning 14 groups and 8 solo artists, was compiled. Using this dataset,
the proportion of English and Korean lyrics, the frequency of code-switching,
and other stylistic features were analysed. It was found that English dominates
the linguistic landscape of globally charting K-pop songs, with both male and
female performers exhibiting high degrees of code-switching and English usage.
Statistical tests indicated no significant gender-based differences, although
female solo artists tend to favour English more consistently. A classification
task was also performed to predict performer gender from lyrics, achieving
macro F1 scores up to 0.76 using multilingual embeddings and handcrafted
features. Finally, differences between songs charting on the Hot 100 versus the
Global 200 were examined, suggesting that, while there is no significant gender
difference in English, higher English usage may be more critical for success in
the US-focused Hot 100. The findings highlight how linguistic choices in K-pop
lyrics are shaped by global market pressures and reveal stylistic patterns that
reflect performer identity and chart context.

TL;DR: 该研究通过分析Gemma-2模型生成介词短语时的内部机制，发现模型倾向于生成工具性补语而非属性性补语，并通过调整单个注意力头的值向量成功改变了补语功能角色的分布。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解语言模型在生成介词短语时如何决定补语是作为工具性附加语还是属性修饰语的内在机制，这一决策过程目前仍不明确。

Method: 构建包含with引导介词短语的提示集，在同等支持工具性和属性性续写的语境中测试模型偏好；通过将激活投影到词汇空间来识别偏好工具性补语的注意力头；通过缩放单个注意力头的值向量来改变补语功能角色的分布。

Result: 模型显示出对工具性补语的强烈偏好（3:4比例）；通过调整单个注意力头的值向量，成功将工具性补语比例降至33%，属性性补语比例提升至36%。

Conclusion: 语言模型中存在特定的注意力头负责介词短语补语功能角色的决策，通过干预这些注意力头可以控制补语的生成分布，这为理解模型内部决策机制提供了新视角。

Abstract: Language Models, when generating prepositional phrases, must often decide for
whether their complements functions as an instrumental adjunct (describing the
verb adverbially) or an attributive modifier (enriching the noun adjectivally),
yet the internal mechanisms that resolve this split decision remain poorly
understood. In this study, we conduct a targeted investigation into Gemma-2 to
uncover and control the generation of prepositional complements. We assemble a
prompt suite containing with-headed prepositional phrases whose contexts
equally accommodate either an instrumental or attributive continuation,
revealing a strong preference for an instrumental reading at a ratio of 3:4. To
pinpoint individual attention heads that favor instrumental over attributive
complements, we project activations into the vocabulary space. By scaling the
value vector of a single attention head, we can shift the distribution of
functional roles of complements, attenuating instruments to 33% while elevating
attributes to 36%.

Conclusion: 进度感知是提升LLM在多轮函数调用中性能的关键因素，PARL-MT框架为此提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive success in single-turn
function calling, yet real-world applications such as travel planning or
multi-stage data analysis typically unfold across multi-turn conversations. In
these settings, LLMs must not only issue accurate function calls at each step
but also maintain progress awareness, the ability to summarize past
interactions and plan future actions to ensure coherent, long-horizon task
execution. Existing approaches, however, either reduce multi-turn training to
isolated single-turn samples, which neglects task-level planning, or employ
end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL) that struggles with redundancy and lacks
explicit integration of progress awareness. To overcome these limitations, we
introduce PARL-MT, a framework that explicitly incorporates progress awareness
into LLM training for multi-turn function calling. PARL-MT combines (i) a
Progress Awareness Generation (PAG) pipeline, which automatically constructs
datasets coupling conversation summaries with future task planning, and (ii) a
Progress Awareness-Guided Reinforcement Learning (PAG-RL) algorithm, which
integrates progress awareness into RL training to reduce contextual redundancy
and improve alignment between local actions and global task completion.
Empirical results on two public benchmarks demonstrate that PARL-MT
significantly outperforms existing methods, highlighting the effectiveness of
progress awareness in enabling robust and efficient multi-turn function
calling.

Abstract: This study aims to test and evaluate the capabilities and characteristics of
current mainstream Visual Language Models (VLMs) in generating critiques for
traditional Chinese painting. To achieve this, we first developed a
quantitative framework for Chinese painting critique. This framework was
constructed by extracting multi-dimensional evaluative features covering
evaluative stance, feature focus, and commentary quality from human expert
critiques using a zero-shot classification model. Based on these features,

TL;DR: CLAIRE是一个结合LLM推理与检索的智能系统，用于检测维基百科中的不一致性，帮助编辑提高知识一致性。研究发现至少3.3%的英文维基百科事实存在矛盾。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 维基百科作为最大的开放知识库，是训练大语言模型和检索增强生成系统的关键资源，确保其准确性至关重要。但维基百科的准确性如何，以及如何改进它？

Method: 提出语料库级不一致性检测任务，开发CLAIRE系统，结合LLM推理与检索来发现潜在不一致声明并提供上下文证据。通过用户研究和随机抽样分析进行评估。

Result: 在用户研究中，87.5%的编辑报告使用CLAIRE时信心更高，参与者在相同时间内识别出64.7%更多的不一致性。至少3.3%的英文维基百科事实存在矛盾，这些不一致性传播到7.3%的FEVEROUS和4.0%的AmbigQA示例中。

Conclusion: 矛盾是维基百科中可测量的组成部分，基于LLM的系统如CLAIRE可以为编辑提供实用工具，帮助大规模提高知识一致性。

Abstract: Wikipedia is the largest open knowledge corpus, widely used worldwide and
serving as a key resource for training large language models (LLMs) and
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. Ensuring its accuracy is
therefore critical. But how accurate is Wikipedia, and how can we improve it?
  We focus on inconsistencies, a specific type of factual inaccuracy, and
introduce the task of corpus-level inconsistency detection. We present CLAIRE,
an agentic system that combines LLM reasoning with retrieval to surface
potentially inconsistent claims along with contextual evidence for human
review. In a user study with experienced Wikipedia editors, 87.5% reported
higher confidence when using CLAIRE, and participants identified 64.7% more
inconsistencies in the same amount of time.
  Combining CLAIRE with human annotation, we contribute WIKICOLLIDE, the first
benchmark of real Wikipedia inconsistencies. Using random sampling with
CLAIRE-assisted analysis, we find that at least 3.3% of English Wikipedia facts
contradict another fact, with inconsistencies propagating into 7.3% of FEVEROUS
and 4.0% of AmbigQA examples. Benchmarking strong baselines on this dataset
reveals substantial headroom: the best fully automated system achieves an AUROC
of only 75.1%.
  Our results show that contradictions are a measurable component of Wikipedia
and that LLM-based systems like CLAIRE can provide a practical tool to help
editors improve knowledge consistency at scale.

*Soumick Sarker,Abhijit Kumar Rai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Fin-ExBERT是一个轻量级模块化框架，用于从金融对话记录中提取用户意图相关句子，采用领域适应的BERT主干和LoRA适配器，通过两阶段训练和动态阈值策略实现高效信息提取。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金融对话记录具有非正式结构、领域特定词汇和可变意图密度等特点，给句子级信息提取带来独特挑战，需要专门解决方案。

Method: 基于领域适应BERT主干，结合LoRA适配器实现高效微调；采用两阶段训练策略（先训练分类器头再逐步解冻主干）；使用基于概率曲率的动态阈值策略。

Result: 在真实世界对话记录上表现出强大的精确率和F1分数，输出可解释，适用于下游审计和问答工作流。

Conclusion: Fin-ExBERT提供了一个可部署的金融对话挖掘解决方案，支持批量评估、可视化和校准导出。

Abstract: Financial dialogue transcripts pose a unique challenge for sentence-level
information extraction due to their informal structure, domain-specific
vocabulary, and variable intent density. We introduce Fin-ExBERT, a lightweight
and modular framework for extracting user intent-relevant sentences from
annotated financial service calls. Our approach builds on a domain-adapted BERT
(Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) backbone enhanced
with LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) adapters, enabling efficient fine-tuning using
limited labeled data. We propose a two-stage training strategy with progressive
unfreezing: initially training a classifier head while freezing the backbone,
followed by gradual fine-tuning of the entire model with differential learning
rates. To ensure robust extraction under uncertainty, we adopt a dynamic
thresholding strategy based on probability curvature (elbow detection),
avoiding fixed cutoff heuristics. Empirical results show strong precision and
F1 performance on real-world transcripts, with interpretable output suitable
for downstream auditing and question-answering workflows. The full framework
supports batched evaluation, visualization, and calibrated export, offering a
deployable solution for financial dialogue mining.

*Wonje Jeung,Sangyeon Yoon,Yoonjun Cho,Dongjae Jeon,Sangwoo Shin,Hyesoo Hong,Albert No*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出A2D方法，通过token级对齐使扩散大语言模型在检测到有害内容时发出[EOS]拒绝信号，有效防御任意解码顺序和预填充攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散大语言模型的任意顺序生成特性扩大了攻击面，有害内容可能出现在任意位置，且模板预填充攻击如DIJA可以绕过响应级拒绝机制。

Method: A2D是一种token级对齐方法，在随机掩码条件下将dLLMs对齐，使其在出现有害内容时发出[EOS]拒绝信号。

Result: A2D将DIJA攻击成功率从80%以上降至接近零（LLaDA-8B-Instruct为1.3%，Dream-v0-Instruct-7B为0.0%），并实现高达19.3倍的快速安全终止。

Conclusion: A2D方法在token级实现安全对齐，有效防御任意解码顺序和任意步骤预填充攻击，同时支持实时监控和早期拒绝。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) enable any-order generation, but this
flexibility enlarges the attack surface: harmful spans may appear at arbitrary
positions, and template-based prefilling attacks such as DIJA bypass
response-level refusals. We introduce A2D (Any-Order, Any-Step Defense), a
token-level alignment method that aligns dLLMs to emit an [EOS] refusal signal
whenever harmful content arises. By aligning safety directly at the token-level
under randomized masking, A2D achieves robustness to both any-decoding-order
and any-step prefilling attacks under various conditions. It also enables
real-time monitoring: dLLMs may begin a response but automatically terminate if
unsafe continuation emerges. On safety benchmarks, A2D consistently prevents
the generation of harmful outputs, slashing DIJA success rates from over 80% to
near-zero (1.3% on LLaDA-8B-Instruct, 0.0% on Dream-v0-Instruct-7B), and
thresholded [EOS] probabilities allow early rejection, yielding up to 19.3x
faster safe termination.

TL;DR: 本文提出了政策推理轨迹（PRT）方法，通过生成专门的推理链来提升LLM在政策合规评估中的能力，在HIPAA和GDPR政策评估中取得了新的最优结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 政策合规评估需要专家进行系统化的逐步推理过程，但获取这种黄金标准的专家级推理过程成本高昂。

Method: 引入政策推理轨迹（PRT）作为专门的生成推理链，在推理时和训练时使用这些推理链来提升LLM的政策合规评估能力。

Result: 使用PRT显著提升了开源和商业模型的性能，在HIPAA和GDPR政策评估中达到了新的最优水平，同时提高了准确引用政策条款的能力。

Conclusion: PRT通过提供高质量的推理链，有效提升了LLM在政策合规评估中的准确性和可解释性。

Abstract: Policy compliance assessment is a fundamental task of evaluating whether an
input case strictly complies with a set of human-defined rules, more generally
known as policies. In practice, human experts follow a systematic, step-by-step
process to identify violations with respect to specific stipulations outlined
in the policy. However, such documentation of gold-standard, expert-level
reasoning processes is costly to acquire. In this paper, we introduce Policy
Reasoning Traces (PRT), a form of specialized generated reasoning chains that
serve as a reasoning bridge to improve an LLM's policy compliance assessment
capabilities. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that the use of PRTs for
both inference-time and training-time scenarios significantly enhances the
performance of open-weight and commercial models, setting a new
state-of-the-art for HIPAA and GDPR policies. Beyond accuracy gains, we also
highlight how PRTs can improve an LLM's ability to accurately cite policy
clauses, as well as influence compliance decisions through their high
utilization from the raw chains of thought.

TL;DR: 提出了SIE框架，通过大规模结构化数据自动构建推理环境，解决了现有环境在可扩展性、通用推理能力和可验证性方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数学和编码环境依赖专家标注难以扩展，游戏环境学到的技能过于专门化难以泛化。理想LLM推理环境应具备可扩展性、通用推理能力和可验证性。

Method: SIE框架从大规模结构化数据自动构建推理环境，利用结构化数据的组合模式支持通用推理，通过显式模式和推理链实现基于规则的可验证性。

Result: SIE框架在领域内结构化推理上取得显著提升，学到的组合推理技能能有效泛化到领域外数学和逻辑推理任务。在信息受限的部分SIE中，LLM能通过环境探索推断缺失信息。

Conclusion: SIE框架成功构建了具备可扩展性、通用推理能力和可验证性的LLM推理环境，显著提升了推理能力和泛化性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved significant advancements in
reasoning capabilities through reinforcement learning (RL) via environmental
exploration. As the intrinsic properties of the environment determine the
abilities that LLMs can learn, the environment plays a important role in the RL
finetuning process. An ideal LLM reasoning environment should possess three
core characteristics: scalability, generalizable reasoning, and verifiability.
However, existing mathematical and coding environments are difficult to scale
due to heavy reliance on expert annotation, while the skills learned in
game-based environments are too specialized to generalize. To bridge this gap,
we introduce the \textbf{S}tructured \textbf{I}n-context \textbf{E}nvironment
(SIE) framework. SIE achieves scalability by automatically constructing
reasoning environments from large-scale structured data, where the rich
compositional patterns naturally support generalizable reasoning. Moreover, the
explicit schemas and reasoning chains in structured data provide a foundation
for rule-based verifiability. Experimental results show that SIE framework not
only achieves substantial improvements in in-domain structured reasoning, but
also enables the learned compositional reasoning skills to generalize
effectively to out-of-domain mathematical and logical reasoning tasks. We
further explored learning in information-limited partial SIEs and found that
LLMs can infer the missing information through exploring the environment,
leading to robust reasoning improvements and generalization performance.

TL;DR: C-Evolve是一种基于共识的进化算法，通过聚合多个提示的输出并采用多数投票机制来提升AI系统性能，在各类任务中达到最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有提示进化算法主要关注单个提示的优化，很少探索通过聚合多个提示的结果达成共识是否能进一步扩展系统能力边界。

Method: 采用基于岛屿的进化算法维持种群多样性，从不同岛屿选择提示形成组，通过多数投票聚合输出，使用投票评分作为适应度标准来评估每个提示在组内的贡献。

Result: 在Qwen3-8B上，HotpotQA达到70.67%，IFBench达到43.88%，分别比GEPA提升4.95%和2.73%；在GPT-4.1-mini上，IFBench准确率提升至47.96%，MATH基准达到95.33%。

Conclusion: C-Evolve通过群体共识机制能够产生和维护具有高潜力形成高性能组的提示，在开放式和封闭式任务中都展现出竞争优势。

Abstract: Prompt evolution algorithms offer a powerful paradigm for enhancing AI
systems based on closed-source models, while few work explores whether
aggregating results from multiple prompts to reach a consensus can further
advance the system capability boundary. In this paper, we introduce
Consensus-Evolve (C-Evolve), an evolutionary algorithm that discovers a group
of prompts whose aggregated outputs after majority voting achieve optimal
performance. More specifically, C-Evolve employs an island-based evolutionary
algorithm to maintain population diversity, and prompts from distinct islands
are selected to form groups to aggregate their outputs. The key difference from
single individual evolution is a voting score, which evaluates each individual
prompt's contribution within groups. We take this as the fitness score for
evolution instead of individual performance. Consequently, C-Evolve is more
likely to produce and maintain prompts with higher potential to form a
high-performing group and eliminate low-performing ones, gradually improving
the group performance after reaching consensus. Our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of tasks, including both
open-ended tasks like HotpotQA and closed-ended tasks like MATH. On Qwen3-8B,
C-Evolve achieves 70.67% on HotpotQA and 43.88% on IFBench, which are 4.95% and
2.73% higher than GEPA, respectively. For GPT-4.1-mini, the accuracy on IFBench
is further improved to 47.96% and reaches 95.33% in the MATH benchmark. These
results demonstrate the C-Evolve's competitive performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PRISM是一个统一的机器遗忘框架，通过在表示空间和参数空间实施双重平滑性来提高鲁棒性和平衡遗忘指标，解决了现有方法中的灾难性遗忘和指标不平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型的快速发展，机器遗忘技术需要解决用户隐私、版权侵权和安全问题。现有最先进的遗忘方法存在灾难性遗忘和指标不平衡问题，且容易受到重新学习和越狱攻击。

Method: PRISM框架包含两个平滑优化阶段：表示空间阶段使用鲁棒训练的探针防御越狱攻击；参数空间阶段解耦保留-遗忘梯度冲突，减少不平衡，平滑参数空间以缓解重新学习攻击。

Result: 在WMDP和MUSE数据集上的广泛实验表明，PRISM在多种攻击下优于最先进的基线方法，并在关键指标间实现了更好的平衡。

Conclusion: PRISM通过双重空间平滑性有效解决了机器遗忘中的鲁棒性和指标平衡问题，在对话和连续文本设置下都表现出色。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models, Machine Unlearning has
emerged to address growing concerns around user privacy, copyright
infringement, and overall safety. Yet state-of-the-art (SOTA) unlearning
methods often suffer from catastrophic forgetting and metric imbalance, for
example by over-optimizing one objective (e.g., unlearning effectiveness,
utility preservation, or privacy protection) at the expense of others. In
addition, small perturbations in the representation or parameter space can be
exploited by relearn and jailbreak attacks. To address these challenges, we
propose PRISM, a unified framework that enforces dual-space smoothness in
representation and parameter spaces to improve robustness and balance
unlearning metrics. PRISM consists of two smoothness optimization stages: (i) a
representation space stage that employs a robustly trained probe to defend
against jailbreak attacks, and (ii) a parameter-space stage that decouples
retain-forget gradient conflicts, reduces imbalance, and smooths the parameter
space to mitigate relearning attacks. Extensive experiments on WMDP and MUSE,
across conversational-dialogue and continuous-text settings, show that PRISM
outperforms SOTA baselines under multiple attacks while achieving a better
balance among key metrics.

TL;DR: 提出了MedCritical框架，通过两阶段方法让小模型自我对抗学习，无需大模型持续指导，在医学推理任务上达到7B小模型的新SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医学领域复杂推理任务中，小模型性能不足的问题，同时避免传统知识蒸馏方法依赖大模型指导带来的高成本、低效率问题。

Method: 两阶段框架：第一阶段从大模型提取思维模板指导小模型生成复杂推理；第二阶段通过模型自迭代协作的DPO方法，让小模型自我对抗学习错误修正轨迹。

Result: MedCritical 7B模型在CMExam基准上超越Taiyi和Huatuo-o1-7B模型3.04%和10.12%，在7B小模型中达到新SOTA性能。

Conclusion: 提出的模型自我学习DPO方法能以较低成本实现与传统知识蒸馏相当的效果，为小模型在医学复杂推理任务中的性能提升提供了有效途径。

Abstract: In the field of medicine, complex reasoning tasks such as clinical diagnosis,
treatment planning, and medical knowledge integration pose significant
challenges, where small language models often underperform compared to large
language models like GPT-4 and Deepseek. Recent knowledge distillation-based
methods aim to address these issues through teacher-guided error correction,
but this LLM as judge approach remains challenging in terms of cost, time, and
efficiency. To circumvent this issue, we propose a novel two-stage framework,
MedCritical, which uses a small language model fine-tuned by a large teacher
model to play against itself. In the first stage, we extract high-level and
detailed long-chain thought templates from the teacher model to guide the
student model to generate more complex reasoning thoughts. In the second stage,
we introduce direct preference optimization (DPO) through model self-iteration
collaboration to enhance the reasoning ability of the student model by playing
against the correction trajectory of the fine-tuned model during training. This
model self-learning DPO approach teaches the student model to use its own
error-driven insights to consolidate its skills and knowledge to solve complex
problems, and achieves comparable results to traditional knowledge distillation
methods using teacher models at a lower cost. Notably, our MedCritical 7B model
outperforms the Taiyi and Huatuo-o1-7B models by 3.04\% and 10.12\%
respectively on the CMExam benchmark, achieving new SOTA performance among
7B-class small models.

TL;DR: 提出MetaAPO框架，通过元学习器动态评估在线采样与离线数据的收益，实现数据生成与模型训练的耦合，在减少42%在线标注成本的同时，在多个基准测试中优于现有偏好优化方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决离线偏好数据与演化模型策略之间的分布不匹配问题，现有方法使用静态启发式或解耦的在线采样策略，无法适应模型的动态学习状态。

Method: 使用轻量级元学习器作为"对齐差距估计器"，评估在线采样相对于离线数据的潜在收益，指导有针对性的在线生成，并为优化目标分配样本级元权重，动态平衡在线和离线数据的质量与分布。

Result: 在AlpacaEval 2、Arena-Hard和MT-Bench上的实验表明，MetaAPO在各种设置下始终优于现有的偏好优化方法，同时减少了42%的在线标注成本。

Conclusion: MetaAPO通过动态耦合数据生成与模型训练，有效解决了分布不匹配问题，在保持性能的同时显著降低了标注成本。

Abstract: Preference optimization is crucial for aligning large language models (LLMs)
with human values and intentions. A significant challenge in this process is
the distribution mismatch between pre-collected offline preference data and the
evolving model policy. Existing methods attempt to reduce this gap using static
heuristics or decoupled online sampling strategies, but they often fail to
adapt to the model's dynamic learning state. To bridge this gap, we propose
Meta-Weighted Adaptive Preference Optimization (MetaAPO), a novel framework
that dynamically couples data generation with model training. MetaAPO employs a
lightweight meta-learner, as an "alignment gap estimator", to evaluate the
potential benefits of on-policy sampling in relation to offline data. This
guides targeted online generation and assigns sample-wise meta-weights to the
optimization objective, dynamically balancing the quality and distribution of
online and offline data. Experiments on AlpacaEval 2, Arena-Hard and MT-Bench
demonstrate that MetaAPO consistently outperforms existing preference
optimization approaches across various settings, while reducing 42% in online
annotation costs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在放射学中常产生临床无依据的描述（医学幻觉），这在要求准确性和图像基础输出的医疗应用中存在严重风险。

Method: CCD框架整合任务特定放射学专家模型的结构化临床信号，采用双阶段对比机制在生成过程中细化token级logits，无需修改基础MLLM。

Result: 在三个数据集和多个模型上的实验表明，CCD持续提升放射学报告生成性能，在MIMIC-CXR数据集上，应用于最先进RRG模型时RadGraph-F1提升高达17%。

Conclusion: CCD提供了一个轻量级且可推广的解决方案，用于减轻医学幻觉，有效连接放射学中的专家模型和MLLMs。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have recently achieved remarkable
progress in radiology by integrating visual perception with natural language
understanding. However, they often generate clinically unsupported
descriptions, known as medical hallucinations, which pose serious risks in
medical applications that demand accuracy and image-grounded outputs. Through
empirical analysis, we find that prompt-induced hallucinations remain prevalent
in radiology MLLMs, largely due to over-sensitivity to clinical sections. To
address this, we introduce Clinical Contrastive Cecoding (CCD), a training-free
and retrieval-free inference framework that integrates structured clinical
signals from task-specific radiology expert models. CCD introduces a dual-stage
contrastive mechanism to refine token-level logits during generation, thereby
enhancing clinical fidelity without modifying the base MLLM. Experiments on
three datasets and multiple models demonstrate that CCD consistently improves
overall performance on radiology report generation (RRG). On the MIMIC-CXR
dataset, it yields up to a 17% improvement in RadGraph-F1 when applied to
state-of-the-art RRG models. Our approach provides a lightweight and
generalisable solution for mitigating medical hallucinations, effectively
bridging expert models and MLLMs in radiology.

Motivation: 现有防护模型在流式处理、多语言支持和模型可移植性方面存在局限，需要更高效的安全防护解决方案。

Method: 计算防护模型与预训练语言模型的参数差异得到Guard Vector，结合目标语言模型构建TGM，采用前缀训练和单令牌输出分类器的流式感知方法。

Result: TGM在标准安全套件上提升分类质量，支持中、日、韩语扩展，无需额外训练或目标语言标签，在Llama和Gemma骨干网络上实现模型可移植性。

Conclusion: 该方法降低了数据和计算需求，促进了流式感知评估实践，有助于构建更负责任的AI生态系统。

Abstract: We introduce Guard Vector, a safety task vector computed as the parameter
difference between a guardrail model (Guard Model) and a same-architecture
pretrained language model. Composing this vector with a target language model
yields a Target Guard Model (TGM). We then adapt TGM with a streaming-aware
approach that combines prefix-based training and evaluation with a classifier
that produces a single-token output. With this composition alone, TGM improves
classification quality over established Guard Models across standard safety
suites and enables language extensibility to Chinese, Japanese, and Korean,
requiring neither additional training nor target language labels. It also
demonstrates model portability across two widely used public guardrail
backbones, Llama and Gemma. With prefix SFT (supervised fine-tuning), TGM
preserves classification quality under streaming by aligning the behavior
between prefix inputs and full-text inputs. The single-token output design
increases throughput and reduces latency. Together, these components reduce
data and compute requirements while promoting streaming-aware evaluation
practices, thereby contributing to a more responsible AI ecosystem.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练实验是理解大语言模型学习机制的重要工具，但计算成本高昂限制了实验规模。

Method: 在单次训练运行中同时进行10个实验，包括数据污染、投毒、记忆化等研究，使用1.5B参数模型在210B token上训练。

Result: 成功复现了多个先前工作的结果，并进行了知识获取、数学推理和水印等新研究，实验对模型训练动态影响极小。

Conclusion: 单次训练运行中进行多实验的方法可以在有限计算预算下实现大模型的严格科学实验，但需要注意实验间可能的交互影响。

Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated that controlled pretraining experiments are a
powerful tool for understanding learning, reasoning, and memorization in large
language models (LLMs). However, the computational cost of pretraining presents
a significant constraint. To overcome this constraint, we propose to conduct
multiple pretraining experiments simultaneously during a single training run.
We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach by conducting ten experiments
during the training of a 1.5B parameter model on 210B tokens. Although we only
train a single model, we can replicate the results from multiple previous works
on data contamination, poisoning, and memorization. We also conduct novel
investigations into knowledge acquisition, mathematical reasoning, and
watermarking. For example, we dynamically update the training data until the
model acquires a particular piece of knowledge. Remarkably, the influence of
the ten experiments on the model's training dynamics and overall performance is
minimal. However, interactions between different experiments may act as a
potential confounder in our approach. We propose to test for interactions with
continual pretraining experiments, finding them to be negligible in our setup.
Overall, our findings suggest that performing multiple pretraining experiments
in a single training run can enable rigorous scientific experimentation with
large models on a compute budget.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动提示优化方法存在稳定性差、效率低、容易陷入局部最优的问题，需要更有效的优化策略。

Method: GRACE框架包含两个协同策略：门控精炼策略通过反馈调节门和更新拒绝门来稳定优化过程；自适应压缩策略在优化停滞时蒸馏提示核心概念，重新构建优化路径。

Result: 在11个任务上的实验显示，GRACE在BIG-Bench Hard、领域特定和通用NLP任务上分别实现了4.7%、4.4%和2.7%的平均相对性能提升，仅需先前方法25%的计算预算。

Conclusion: GRACE通过策略性地引入信息损失，在性能和效率方面都取得了显著提升，为提示优化提供了高效稳定的解决方案。

Abstract: Prompt engineering is crucial for leveraging the full potential of large
language models (LLMs). While automatic prompt optimization offers a scalable
alternative to costly manual design, generating effective prompts remains
challenging. Existing methods often struggle to stably generate improved
prompts, leading to low efficiency, and overlook that prompt optimization
easily gets trapped in local optima. Addressing this, we propose GRACE, a
framework that integrates two synergistic strategies: Gated Refinement and
Adaptive Compression, achieving Efficient prompt optimization. The gated
refinement strategy introduces a feedback regulation gate and an update
rejection gate, which refine update signals to produce stable and effective
prompt improvements. When optimization stagnates, the adaptive compression
strategy distills the prompt's core concepts, restructuring the optimization
trace and opening new paths. By strategically introducing information loss
through refinement and compression, GRACE delivers substantial gains in
performance and efficiency. In extensive experiments on 11 tasks across three
practical domains, including BIG-Bench Hard (BBH), domain-specific, and general
NLP tasks, GRACE achieves significant average relative performance improvements
of 4.7%, 4.4% and 2.7% over state-of-the-art methods, respectively. Further
analysis shows that GRACE achieves these gains using only 25% of the prompt
generation budget required by prior methods, highlighting its high optimization
efficiency and low computational overhead. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 该论文提出了机器翻译中的副文本显化任务，通过构建专家对齐的副文本数据集，评估LLM在文化术语翻译中的表现，发现LLM生成的副文本能提高理解但不如专业译者，并揭示了文化调解的开放性本质。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机器翻译在文化术语传递中的挑战，现有方法只关注文本内解决方案，忽略了专业译者使用的脚注和尾注等副文本工具。

Method: 基于Genette的副文本理论，构建了560个专家对齐的副文本数据集，评估了带和不带推理轨迹的LLM在显化选择和内容上的表现，使用内在提示和代理检索方法进行实验。

Result: LLM生成的副文本能提高受众理解，但效果远不如译者创作的副文本；统计分析显示专业译者在副文本使用上存在很大差异，表明文化调解具有内在开放性。

Conclusion: 副文本显化有潜力推动机器翻译超越语言对等，在单语解释和个性化适应方面具有广阔应用前景。

Abstract: The faithful transfer of contextually-embedded meaning continues to challenge
contemporary machine translation (MT), particularly in the rendering of
culture-bound terms--expressions or concepts rooted in specific languages or
cultures, resisting direct linguistic transfer. Existing computational
approaches to explicitating these terms have focused exclusively on in-text
solutions, overlooking paratextual apparatus in the footnotes and endnotes
employed by professional translators. In this paper, we formalize Genette's
(1987) theory of paratexts from literary and translation studies to introduce
the task of paratextual explicitation for MT. We construct a dataset of 560
expert-aligned paratexts from four English translations of the classical
Chinese short story collection Liaozhai and evaluate LLMs with and without
reasoning traces on choice and content of explicitation. Experiments across
intrinsic prompting and agentic retrieval methods establish the difficulty of
this task, with human evaluation showing that LLM-generated paratexts improve
audience comprehension, though remain considerably less effective than
translator-authored ones. Beyond model performance, statistical analysis
reveals that even professional translators vary widely in their use of
paratexts, suggesting that cultural mediation is inherently open-ended rather
than prescriptive. Our findings demonstrate the potential of paratextual
explicitation in advancing MT beyond linguistic equivalence, with promising
extensions to monolingual explanation and personalized adaptation.

TL;DR: 该研究比较人类评分员和大型语言模型在自动评分中的表现，分析评分不一致的原因，通过相似性度量和聚类分析评估评分理由的差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在自动评分中的应用日益广泛，需要理解人类和LLM评分员的推理过程差异，以识别评分不一致的潜在原因。

Method: 使用大规模测试的作文数据，基于二次加权kappa和归一化互信息评估GPT-4o、Gemini等LLM的评分准确性，通过余弦相似度评估评分理由的相似性，并使用主成分分析探索评分理由的聚类模式。

Result: 研究发现LLM在自动评分中表现出不同的准确性和推理模式，评分理由的相似性和聚类分析揭示了人类和LLM评分员在推理过程中的差异。

Conclusion: 该研究为理解LLM在自动评分中的准确性和"思考"过程提供了见解，有助于改进对人类评分和基于LLM的自动评分背后推理过程的理解。

Abstract: Advances in automated scoring are closely aligned with advances in
machine-learning and natural-language-processing techniques. With recent
progress in large language models (LLMs), the use of ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude,
and other generative-AI chatbots for automated scoring has been explored. Given
their strong reasoning capabilities, LLMs can also produce rationales to
support the scores they assign. Thus, evaluating the rationales provided by
both human and LLM raters can help improve the understanding of the reasoning
that each type of rater applies when assigning a score. This study investigates
the rationales of human and LLM raters to identify potential causes of scoring
inconsistency. Using essays from a large-scale test, the scoring accuracy of
GPT-4o, Gemini, and other LLMs is examined based on quadratic weighted kappa
and normalized mutual information. Cosine similarity is used to evaluate the
similarity of the rationales provided. In addition, clustering patterns in
rationales are explored using principal component analysis based on the
embeddings of the rationales. The findings of this study provide insights into
the accuracy and ``thinking'' of LLMs in automated scoring, helping to improve
the understanding of the rationales behind both human scoring and LLM-based
automated scoring.

TL;DR: 论文提出检索约束解码(RCD)策略，通过限制模型输出为唯一表面形式，更准确评估语言模型的参数知识，避免因评估标准过严而低估模型能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型编码了大量事实知识，但由于评估标准过于严格，许多正确答案因表达形式不同而被误判为错误，导致模型参数知识被低估。

Method: 提出检索约束解码(RCD)策略，限制模型输出为唯一的表面形式；构建YAGO-QA数据集(19,137个通用知识问题)。

Result: 在135M到70B参数的开源语言模型上验证，标准解码低估了模型知识。Llama-3.1-70B在标准解码下F1为32.3%，使用RCD提升到46.0%；Llama-3.1-8B使用RCD达到33.0%，超过更大模型的标准解码表现。

Conclusion: RCD解码策略能更准确评估语言模型的参数知识，避免因表面形式差异导致的误判，证明当前评估方法可能严重低估了模型的实际知识能力。

Abstract: Language models (LMs) encode substantial factual knowledge, but often produce
answers judged as incorrect. We hypothesize that many of these answers are
actually correct, but are expressed in alternative surface forms that are
dismissed due to an overly strict evaluation, leading to an underestimation of
models' parametric knowledge. We propose Retrieval-Constrained Decoding (RCD),
a decoding strategy that restricts model outputs to unique surface forms. We
introduce YAGO-QA, a dataset of 19,137 general knowledge questions. Evaluating
open-source LMs from 135M to 70B parameters, we show that standard decoding
undervalues their knowledge. For instance, Llama-3.1-70B scores only 32.3% F1
with vanilla decoding but 46.0% with RCD. Similarly, Llama-3.1-8B reaches 33.0%
with RCD, outperforming the larger model under vanilla decoding. We publicly
share the code and dataset at https://github.com/Rajjaa/disambiguated-LLM.

TL;DR: CooT是一个解码时框架，通过认知自监控循环让LLM在生成过程中动态检测和纠正有害行为，将安全对齐从固定属性转变为显式、可审计的过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM对齐策略将安全嵌入模型权重，导致控制隐式、静态且难以修改，需要一种更灵活、显式的安全控制方法。

Method: CooT包含标准文本生成器和认知感知器，感知器使用基于优先级的结构化原则层次来监控生成序列，检测到违规时回滚到错误点并重新生成。

Result: 在多个基准测试和模型系列上的广泛实验证实，CooT持续提升了安全性和社交推理性能。

Conclusion: CooT将对齐从固定属性转变为推理过程中活跃的显式、动态、可审计过程，允许灵活的策略更新而无需重新训练模型。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex reasoning but can still exhibit
harmful behaviors. Current alignment strategies typically embed safety into
model weights, making these controls implicit, static, and difficult to modify.
This paper introduces Cognition-of-Thought (CooT), a novel decoding-time
framework that equips LLMs with an explicit cognitive self-monitoring loop.
CooT couples a standard text Generator with a cognitive Perceiver that
continuously monitors the unfolding sequence. The Perceiver uses a structured,
precedence-based hierarchy of principles (e.g., safety over obedience) to
detect potential misalignments as they arise. When violations are flagged, CooT
intervenes by rolling back the generation to the point of error and
regenerating under injected guidance that combines universal social priors with
context-specific warnings. CooT thus transforms alignment from a fixed property
into an explicit, dynamic, and auditable process active during inference,
allowing for flexible policy updates without retraining the model. Extensive
experiments across multiple benchmarks and model families confirm that CooT
consistently improves safety and social reasoning performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文综述了37篇关于大规模评估中自动项目难度预测的研究，发现基于文本的机器学习方法（包括传统模型和先进语言模型）能够有效预测项目难度，无需传统耗时费力的现场测试方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统项目难度建模依赖现场测试和经典测试理论或项目反应理论校准，过程耗时且成本高昂。需要寻找更高效的替代方法。

Method: 系统回顾37篇相关文献，分析每项研究的数据集、难度参数、学科领域、项目类型、模型特征、输入数据、评估标准等要素。

Result: 结果显示，虽然经典机器学习模型因其可解释性仍具价值，但最先进的语言模型（包括小型和大型transformer架构）能够捕捉句法和语义模式，无需手动特征工程。文本方法预测项目难度的RMSE最低可达0.165，Pearson相关系数最高达0.87，准确率最高达0.806。

Conclusion: 文本方法在大规模评估中预测项目难度具有巨大潜力，为实践提供了基准参考，并指出了未来研究方向。

Abstract: Item difficulty plays a crucial role in test performance, interpretability of
scores, and equity for all test-takers, especially in large-scale assessments.
Traditional approaches to item difficulty modeling rely on field testing and
classical test theory (CTT)-based item analysis or item response theory (IRT)
calibration, which can be time-consuming and costly. To overcome these
challenges, text-based approaches leveraging machine learning and language
models, have emerged as promising alternatives. This paper reviews and
synthesizes 37 articles on automated item difficulty prediction in large-scale
assessment settings published through May 2025. For each study, we delineate
the dataset, difficulty parameter, subject domain, item type, number of items,
training and test data split, input, features, model, evaluation criteria, and
model performance outcomes. Results showed that although classic machine
learning models remain relevant due to their interpretability, state-of-the-art
language models, using both small and large transformer-based architectures,
can capture syntactic and semantic patterns without the need for manual feature
engineering. Uniquely, model performance outcomes were summarized to serve as a
benchmark for future research and overall, text-based methods have the
potential to predict item difficulty with root mean square error (RMSE) as low
as 0.165, Pearson correlation as high as 0.87, and accuracy as high as 0.806.
The review concludes by discussing implications for practice and outlining
future research directions for automated item difficulty modeling.

demonstrating that phoneme-aware pretraining combined with targeted
augmentation yields strong performance in phoneme-level mispronunciation
detection.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个用于阿拉伯语情感分析的主动学习框架，通过LLM辅助标注显著减少标注成本，在三个阿拉伯语数据集上达到或超过人工标注的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿拉伯语情感分析因缺乏大规模高质量标注数据集而进展有限，且主动学习和LLM在阿拉伯语标注中的应用研究较少。

Method: 使用主动学习框架，评估LSTM、GRU、RNN等深度学习架构，在三个阿拉伯语数据集上比较人工标注和LLM辅助标注策略，评估了GPT-4o、Claude 3 Sonnet等五个LLM。

Result: LLM辅助的主动学习在减少标注样本的情况下达到竞争性或更优性能，如在Hunger Station数据集上LSTM模型仅用450个GPT-4o标注样本就达到93%准确率。

Conclusion: LLM辅助标注可以有效降低阿拉伯语情感分析的标注成本，同时保持高性能，为资源有限的语言提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Natural language processing (NLP), particularly sentiment analysis, plays a
vital role in areas like marketing, customer service, and social media
monitoring by providing insights into user opinions and emotions. However,
progress in Arabic sentiment analysis remains limited due to the lack of large,
high-quality labeled datasets. While active learning has proven effective in
reducing annotation efforts in other languages, few studies have explored it in
Arabic sentiment tasks. Likewise, the use of large language models (LLMs) for
assisting annotation and comparing their performance to human labeling is still
largely unexplored in the Arabic context. In this paper, we propose an active
learning framework for Arabic sentiment analysis designed to reduce annotation
costs while maintaining high performance. We evaluate multiple deep learning
architectures: Specifically, long short-term memory (LSTM), gated recurrent
units (GRU), and recurrent neural networks (RNN), across three benchmark
datasets: Hunger Station, AJGT, and MASAC, encompassing both modern standard
Arabic and dialectal variations. Additionally, two annotation strategies are
compared: Human labeling and LLM-assisted labeling. Five LLMs are evaluated as
annotators: GPT-4o, Claude 3 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro, DeepSeek Chat, and LLaMA 3
70B Instruct. For each dataset, the best-performing LLM was used: GPT-4o for
Hunger Station, Claude 3 Sonnet for AJGT, and DeepSeek Chat for MASAC. Our
results show that LLM-assisted active learning achieves competitive or superior
performance compared to human labeling. For example, on the Hunger Station
dataset, the LSTM model achieved 93% accuracy with only 450 labeled samples
using GPT-4o-generated labels, while on the MASAC dataset, DeepSeek Chat
reached 82% accuracy with 650 labeled samples, matching the accuracy obtained
through human labeling.

TL;DR: 本文研究了微调LLM作为评判模型在实际部署中的三个关键问题：未来兼容性、向后兼容性和问题泛化能力。实验表明未来兼容性最具挑战，向后兼容性相对容易，而所有模型在未见问题上都出现性能下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前微调评判模型的标准评估忽略了实际部署中的关键问题，包括如何应对生成模型的不断演进和泛化到未见问题。本文旨在填补这一研究空白。

Method: 在数学领域建立统一框架，使用不同的训练和测试分布，比较三种基于SFT和DPO的微调算法在三个不同基础模型上的表现。

Result: 实验显示：未来兼容性对大多数模型都很困难；向后兼容性相对容易，DPO训练的模型持续改进性能；持续学习比仅在强或弱响应上训练能更平衡地适应新旧响应分布变化；所有模型在未见问题上都出现性能下降。

Conclusion: 这些发现为在不断变化的生成模型环境中开发和部署评判模型提供了实践指导，强调了未来兼容性和问题泛化能力的重要性。

Abstract: The LLM-as-a-judge paradigm is widely used in both evaluating free-text model
responses and reward modeling for model alignment and finetuning. Recently,
finetuning judges with judge-specific data has emerged as an often preferred
choice over directly prompting frontier models as judges, as the former
achieves better performance with smaller model sizes while being more robust to
common biases. However, the standard evaluation ignores several practical
concerns of finetuned judges regarding their real world deployment. In this
paper, we identify and formalize three aspects that affect the shelf life of
these judges: future proofing and backward compatibility -- how well judges
finetuned on responses by today's generator models perform on responses by
future models or past models, as well as question generalization -- how well
judges generalize to unseen questions at test time. We study these three
aspects in the math domain under a unified framework with varying train and
test distributions, three SFT- and DPO-based finetuning algorithms and three
different base models. Experiments suggest that future-proofing is challenging
for most models, while backward compatibility is relatively easy, with
DPO-trained models consistently improving performance. We further find that
continual learning provides a more balanced adaptation to shifts between older
and newer response distributions than training solely on stronger or weaker
responses. Moreover, all models observe certain degrees of performance
degradation when moving from questions seen during training to unseen ones,
showing that current judges do not fully generalize to unseen questions. These
findings provide insights into practical considerations for developing and
deploying judge models in the face of ever-changing generators.

Motivation: 现有CoT蒸馏方法低估了推理链质量的重要性，过度关注数据量，可能导致将噪声或错误信息传递给学生模型

Method: 提出模型导向推理链选择蒸馏(MoRSD)，包括设计推理链难度(RD)指标来衡量学生模型在给定推理链下生成正确答案的能力，基于准确性、多样性和难度来选择高质量推理链

Result: 在三个任务的七个数据集上相比基线平均提升4.6%，使用更少但更高质量的推理链

Conclusion: 少量高质量推理链比整个数据集更能提升学生模型的推理能力，MoRSD为高效CoT蒸馏提供了可行解决方案

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) distillation aims to enhance small language models'
(SLMs) reasoning by transferring multi-step reasoning capability from the
larger teacher models. However, existing work underestimates rationale quality,
focusing primarily on data quantity, which may transfer noisy or incorrect
information to the student model. To address the above issues, we proposed
\textbf{M}odel-\textbf{O}riented \textbf{R}ationale \textbf{S}election
\textbf{D}istillation (MoRSD), which can discern and select high quality
rationales for distillation to improve performance further. We further propose
a Rationale Difficulty (RD) metric to measure the ability of the student model
to generate the correct answer under a given rationale. Compared to the
baseline, we achieved 4.6$\%$ average improvement on seven datasets over three
tasks, using fewer rationales by controlling their accuracy, diversity, and
difficulty. Our results reveal that a small portion of the high quality
rationales can enhance the reasoning ability of student models than the entire
dataset. Our method promises to be a possible solution for efficient CoT
distillation. Our code will be released in https://github.com/Leon221220/MoRSD.

Motivation: 目前缺乏开放、真实世界、基于执行的基准测试来评估自然语言到JQL的转换能力，企业团队依赖JQL从Jira检索问题但缺乏标准评估方法。

Method: 构建了包含10万对自然语言请求和已验证JQL查询的大规模基准测试，包含四种用户请求类型：长自然语言、短自然语言、语义相似和语义精确，并在包含20万个问题的实时Jira实例上进行执行验证。

Result: 在23个不同参数规模、开源和闭源的LLM上测试，最佳模型在Jackal-5K子集上的平均执行准确率为60.3%，不同请求类型表现差异显著：长自然语言(86.0%)、短自然语言(35.7%)、语义相似(22.7%)、语义精确(99.3%)。

Conclusion: Jackal基准测试揭示了当前最先进LLM在生成正确可执行JQL查询方面的局限性，为Jira企业数据研究设置了新的基于执行的挑战。

Abstract: Enterprise teams rely on the Jira Query Language (JQL) to retrieve and filter
issues from Jira. Yet, to our knowledge, there is no open, real-world,
execution-based benchmark for mapping natural language queries to JQL. We
introduce Jackal, a novel, large-scale text-to-JQL benchmark comprising 100,000
natural language (NL) requests paired with validated JQL queries and
execution-based results on a live Jira instance with over 200,000 issues. To
reflect real-world usage, each JQL query is associated with four types of user
requests: (i) Long NL, (ii) Short NL, (iii) Semantically Similar, and (iv)
Semantically Exact. We release Jackal, a corpus of 100,000 text-to-JQL pairs,
together with an execution-based scoring toolkit, and a static snapshot of the
evaluated Jira instance for reproducibility. We report text-to-JQL results on
23 Large Language Models (LLMs) spanning parameter sizes, open and closed
source models, across execution accuracy, exact match, and canonical exact
match. In this paper, we report results on Jackal-5K, a 5,000-pair subset of
Jackal. On Jackal-5K, the best overall model (Gemini 2.5 Pro) achieves only
60.3% execution accuracy averaged equally across four user request types.
Performance varies significantly across user request types: (i) Long NL
(86.0%), (ii) Short NL (35.7%), (iii) Semantically Similar (22.7%), and (iv)
Semantically Exact (99.3%). By benchmarking LLMs on their ability to produce
correct and executable JQL queries, Jackal exposes the limitations of current
state-of-the-art LLMs and sets a new, execution-based challenge for future
research in Jira enterprise data.

Motivation: LLM在关键应用场景中频繁出现幻觉问题，现有检测方法受限于知识覆盖范围或难以捕捉推理过程中的偏差，需要新的检测方法。

Method: 将LLM推理过程建模为认知旅程，通过隐藏层时域信号模拟人类信号感知和辨别过程，使用FFT映射到时域构建频谱特征，设计基于频谱特征的幻觉检测算法。

Result: 频谱特征分析实验证明了该方法的有效性，HSAD方法在检测准确性和鲁棒性方面表现更高。

Conclusion: HSAD方法通过有效结合推理过程建模和频域特征提取，克服了现有方法的局限性，为LLM幻觉检测提供了新思路。

Abstract: Although Large Language Models have demonstrated powerful capabilities in a
wide range of tasks such as language understanding and code generation, the
frequent occurrence of hallucinations during the generation process has become
a significant impediment to their deployment in critical application scenarios.
Current mainstream hallucination detection methods rely on factual consistency
verification or static hidden layer features. The former is constrained by the
scope of knowledge coverage, while the latter struggles to capture reasoning
biases during the inference process. To address these issues, and inspired by
signal analysis methods in cognitive neuroscience, this paper proposes a
hallucination detection method based on the frequency-domain analysis of hidden
layer temporal signals, named HSAD (\textbf{H}idden \textbf{S}ignal
\textbf{A}nalysis-based \textbf{D}etection). First, by treating the LLM's
reasoning process as a cognitive journey that unfolds over time, we propose
modeling and simulating the human process of signal perception and
discrimination in a deception-detection scenario through hidden layer temporal
signals. Next, The Fast Fourier Transform is applied to map these temporal
signals into the frequency domain to construct spectral features, which are
used to capture anomalies that arise during the reasoning process; analysis
experiments on these spectral features have proven the effectiveness of this
approach. Finally, a hallucination detection algorithm is designed based on
these spectral features to identify hallucinations in the generated content. By
effectively combining the modeling of the reasoning process with
frequency-domain feature extraction, the HSAD method overcomes the limitations
of existing approaches in terms of knowledge coverage and the detection of
reasoning biases, demonstrating higher detection accuracy and robustness.

*Taiqiang Wu,Runming Yang,Tao Liu,Jiahao Wang,Zenan Xu,Ngai Wong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Timber是一种无需训练的方法，通过部分将Instruct模型回退到Base模型来增强探索能力，同时保持利用能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 后训练被认为只是表面改变，有效秩(eRank)变化很小，但存在探索能力受限的权衡问题。

Method: 通过微调权重差异，将Instruct模型部分回退到配对的Base模型。

Result: 在Llama和Qwen系列上的实验表明，Timber持续改进原始Instruct模型，特别是在Pass@k性能上。

Conclusion: 研究为后训练阶段提供了权重层面的新见解，以及无需训练即可优化Instruct模型的实用策略。

Abstract: Post-training, which elicits a pretrained Base model into the corresponding
Instruct model, is widely considered to be superficial. In this work, we first
reinforce this hypothesis by providing novel quantitative evidence from the
weight level that the effective rank (eRank) remains negligibly changed.
However, this superficiality also suffers a critical trade-off, improving the
exploitation capabilities at the cost of limiting its exploration. To tackle
this issue, we propose Timber, a simple yet effective training-free method that
enhances the exploration capability of the Instruct model while preserving its
exploitation. The key insight is to partially revert Instruct towards the
paired Base model by subtle yet targeted refinement of the weight deltas.
Extensive experiments on Llama and Qwen series demonstrate that Timber
consistently improves vanilla Instruct models, particularly on Pass@k
performance. Our findings offer new insights into the post-training stage at
the weight level and practical strategies to refine the Instruct model without
training.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Latent Codebooks for Fast Thinking框架，通过训练时使用简洁的CoT草图学习离散策略先验，推理时使用少量连续思考向量实现策略级指导，无需生成显式推理标记，显著降低推理成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理导向的LLMs依赖逐步生成显式标记，效率低下且需要大规模监督微调或强化学习。CoT技术虽然提升性能但推理轨迹长，增加延迟和标记使用量。

Method: 1. 使用简洁CoT草图训练学习离散策略先验的代码本；2. 推理时基于代码本蒸馏的连续思考向量进行单次推理；3. 提出GainRouter轻量路由机制，自适应切换快速代码本引导推理和慢速显式推理。

Result: 在多个推理基准测试中达到竞争性或更优的准确率，同时显著降低推理成本。

Conclusion: 该方法为大型语言模型提供了高效且可控推理的实用路径，有效抑制过度思考并减少不必要的标记生成。

Abstract: Reasoning-oriented Large Language Models (LLMs) often rely on generating
explicit tokens step by step, and their effectiveness typically hinges on
large-scale supervised fine-tuning or reinforcement learning. While
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques substantially enhance performance on complex
reasoning tasks, they remain inefficient, requiring long reasoning traces that
increase latency and token usage. In this work, we introduce Latent Codebooks
for Fast Thinking, a framework that uses concise CoT sketches only during
training to learn a codebook of discrete strategy priors. At inference, the
model conditions on a handful of continuous thinking vectors distilled from the
codebook in a single pass, enabling strategy-level guidance without producing
explicit reasoning tokens. To complement this design, we propose GainRouter, a
lightweight routing mechanism that adaptively switches between fast codebook
guided inference and slow explicit reasoning, thereby suppressing overthinking
and reducing unnecessary token generation. Experiments across multiple
reasoning benchmarks show that our approach achieves competitive or superior
accuracy while substantially lowering inference cost, offering a practical path
toward efficient and controllable reasoning in large language models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RemeDi是一种基于掩码的扩散语言模型，通过引入重掩码机制，能够更灵活地修正文本生成中的错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的掩码扩散语言模型难以修正已生成的不正确标记，关键挑战在于识别输入中的潜在错误。

Method: RemeDi联合预测标记分布和每个标记的置信度分数，基于置信度决定哪些标记需要重掩码，并设计了包含监督微调和强化学习的训练流程。

Result: 实验表明RemeDi在多个数据集上达到了开源扩散语言模型的最先进水平。

Conclusion: 重掩码机制显著提升了扩散语言模型在文本修正方面的能力，为更灵活的文本生成提供了新思路。

Abstract: Mask-based Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) struggle to revise incorrect
tokens: once a token is generated, it typically remains fixed. The key
challenge is to identify potential errors in the inputs. In this paper, we
propose \emph{\underline{Rem}asking-\underline{e}nabled \underline{Di}ffusion
Language Model (RemeDi}, a mask-based DLM that introduces \emph{remasking} as
another fundamental mechanism, enabling more flexible text refinement in
diffusion-based text generation. To achieve this, RemeDi jointly predicts token
distributions and per-token confidence scores at each step. The confidence
scores determine which tokens to be unmasked after the current step, allowing
the model to identify tokens with low quality and remask them. These remasked
tokens can be resampled with richer context in subsequent steps. We design a
remask-aware pipeline to train this ability, including supervised fine-tuning
which teaches the model to detect and remask incorrect tokens in addition to
predict mask tokens, and reinforcement learning which optimizes full generation
trajectories toward higher rewards. Experiments show that RemeDi achieves the
state-of-the-art results among open-source DLMs on multiple datasets.

TL;DR: RL在跨语言推理泛化方面优于SFT，特别是在非英语数据上训练时表现更好，为多语言推理提供了更稳健的策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索强化学习(RL)与监督微调(SFT)在跨语言推理泛化方面的差异，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 使用Qwen2.5-3B-Base作为基础模型，在多种多语言推理基准（数学推理、常识推理、科学推理）上进行实验比较RL和SFT。

Result: RL不仅准确率更高，跨语言泛化能力也显著强于SFT；在非英语数据上训练的RL表现优于英语数据训练，而SFT无此现象。

Conclusion: RL能够使模型具备更稳健的推理策略，为更公平有效的多语言推理提供了重要指导。

Abstract: Enhancing the complex reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs)
attracts widespread attention. While reinforcement learning (RL) has shown
superior performance for improving complex reasoning, its impact on
cross-lingual generalization compared to Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) remains
unexplored. We present the first systematic investigation into cross-lingual
reasoning generalization of RL and SFT. Using Qwen2.5-3B-Base as our foundation
model, we conduct experiments on diverse multilingual reasoning benchmarks,
including math reasoning, commonsense reasoning, and scientific reasoning. Our
investigation yields two significant findings: (1) Tuning with RL not only
achieves higher accuracy but also demonstrates substantially stronger
cross-lingual generalization capabilities compared to SFT. (2) RL training on
non-English data yields better overall performance and generalization than
training on English data, which is not observed with SFT. Furthermore, through
comprehensive mechanistic analyses, we explore the underlying factors of RL's
superiority and generalization across languages. Our results provide compelling
evidence that RL enables the model with more robust reasoning strategies,
offering crucial guidance for more equitable and effective multilingual
reasoning.

TL;DR: 提出一种批量对齐策略，通过在多语言数据批次中直接对齐模型输出来解决LLM在非英语语言上的性能差距问题，提升非英语准确率23.9%且不影响英语性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在英语与非英语语言之间存在显著性能差距，影响多语言企业应用的可靠性和客户体验，即使使用RAG系统，非英语语言的准确率仍比英语低29%。

Method: 使用批量对齐策略进行微调，在每个训练批次中利用语义等价的多语言数据直接对齐不同语言的模型输出。

Result: 该方法将非英语语言的准确率提升了23.9%，同时不损害英语性能、模型推理能力或检索质量。

Conclusion: 该方法简单易实现、可扩展，能与现有LLM训练和部署流程无缝集成，为工业应用提供更稳健和公平的多语言AI解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) remain unreliable for global enterprise
applications due to substantial performance gaps between high-resource and
mid/low-resource languages, driven by English-centric pretraining and internal
reasoning biases. This inconsistency undermines customer experience and
operational reliability in multilingual settings such as customer support,
content moderation, and information retrieval. Even with advanced
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, we observe up to an 29% accuracy
drop in non-English languages compared to English.
  We propose a practical, batch-wise alignment strategy for fine-tuning LLMs,
leveraging semantically equivalent multilingual data in each training batch to
directly align model outputs across languages. This approach improves
non-English accuracy by up to 23.9\% without compromising English performance,
model reasoning, or retrieval quality. Our method is simple to implement,
scalable, and integrates seamlessly with existing LLM training \& deployment
pipelines, enabling more robust and equitable multilingual AI solutions in
industry.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TF-Bench是一个基于System F类型推断的基准测试，用于评估LLMs的程序语义推理能力，通过去除语义无关的自然语言构建纯语义版本TF-Bench_pure，发现当前最先进LLMs在此任务上表现有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前代码推理基准缺乏形式化的程序中心演绎框架，无法评估模型是否真正理解程序语义而非利用自然语言与代码标记的表面关联。

Method: 基于System F类型推断构建TF-Bench基准，通过验证转换去除语义无关自然语言创建TF-Bench_pure纯语义版本，并提出两个新指标评估鲁棒性和测试时推理效果。

Result: 最先进LLM（Claude-3.7-sonnet）在TF-Bench_pure上仅达到55.85%准确率，显示当前模型在程序语义推理方面存在重大局限。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs在程序语义推理能力上存在显著不足，需要未来研究重点关注和改进。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into the software
engineering ecosystem. Their test-time compute (TTC) reasoning capabilities
show significant potential for understanding program logic and semantics beyond
mere token recognition. However, current benchmarks for code reasoning lack a
formal, program-centric deductive framework to ensure sound evaluation, and are
incapable of assessing whether models genuinely reason about program semantics
or merely exploit superficial associations between natural language and code
tokens. To bridge this gap, we introduce TF-Bench, a benchmark designed to
evaluate LLM reasoning based on type inference in System F, a task we refer to
as program semantics reasoning. By employing verified transformations to remove
semantically irrelevant natural language, we construct TF-Bench_pure, a purely
semantics-driven variant of TF-Bench. Our analysis reveals substantial
limitations in state-of-the-art LLMs, with the best-performing LLM
(Claude-3.7-sonnet) achieving only 55.85% accuracy on TF-Bench_pure.
Additionally, we propose two novel metrics to assess robustness and the
effectiveness of test-time reasoning, underscoring critical limitations in
current LLM capabilities and highlighting essential directions for future
research.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show promising results for embodied
agents in operating meaningfully in complex, human-centered environments. Yet,
evaluating their capacity for nuanced, human-like reasoning and decision-making
remains challenging. In this work, we introduce VIVA+, a cognitively grounded
benchmark for evaluating the reasoning and decision-making of MLLMs in
human-centered situations. VIVA+ consists of 1,317 real-world situations paired
with 6,373 multiple-choice questions, targeting three core abilities for
decision-making: (1) Foundational Situation Comprehension, (2) Context-Driven
Action Justification, and (3) Reflective Reasoning. Together, these dimensions
provide a systematic framework for assessing a model's ability to perceive,
reason, and act in socially meaningful ways. We evaluate the latest commercial
and open-source models on VIVA+, where we reveal distinct performance patterns
and highlight significant challenges. We further explore targeted training and
multi-step reasoning strategies, which yield consistent performance
improvements. Finally, our in-depth analysis highlights current model
limitations and provides actionable insights for advancing MLLMs toward more
robust, context-aware, and socially adept decision-making in real-world
settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MMKGC方法存在两种范式：融合方法会丢失模态特定信息且缺乏灵活性，集成方法难以捕捉模态间上下文依赖的语义交互。需要克服这两种局限。

Method: 使用四元数代数，四个正交基表示独立模态，Hamilton积建模模态间交互。包含细粒度实体表示分解模块和鲁棒关系感知模态融合模块，获得三个独立模态和一个融合模态的表示。

Result: 大量实验表明该方法达到了最先进的性能，具有鲁棒性和计算效率。

Conclusion: M-Hyper方法成功实现了融合与独立模态表示的共存协作，在MMKGC任务上表现优异。

Abstract: Multi-modal knowledge graph completion (MMKGC) aims to discover missing facts
in multi-modal knowledge graphs (MMKGs) by leveraging both structural
relationships and diverse modality information of entities. Existing MMKGC
methods follow two multi-modal paradigms: fusion-based and ensemble-based.
Fusion-based methods employ fixed fusion strategies, which inevitably leads to
the loss of modality-specific information and a lack of flexibility to adapt to
varying modality relevance across contexts. In contrast, ensemble-based methods
retain modality independence through dedicated sub-models but struggle to
capture the nuanced, context-dependent semantic interplay between modalities.
To overcome these dual limitations, we propose a novel MMKGC method M-Hyper,
which achieves the coexistence and collaboration of fused and independent
modality representations. Our method integrates the strengths of both
paradigms, enabling effective cross-modal interactions while maintaining
modality-specific information. Inspired by ``quaternion'' algebra, we utilize
its four orthogonal bases to represent multiple independent modalities and
employ the Hamilton product to efficiently model pair-wise interactions among
them. Specifically, we introduce a Fine-grained Entity Representation
Factorization (FERF) module and a Robust Relation-aware Modality Fusion (R2MF)
module to obtain robust representations for three independent modalities and
one fused modality. The resulting four modality representations are then mapped
to the four orthogonal bases of a biquaternion (a hypercomplex extension of
quaternion) for comprehensive modality interaction. Extensive experiments
indicate its state-of-the-art performance, robustness, and computational
efficiency.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 多模态大语言模型在逻辑推理中面临融合瓶颈，当模态提供独立且充分的推理路径时能提升性能，但冗余或链式推理支持反而会损害表现。主要问题是任务组合瓶颈和融合瓶颈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态推理中关于额外模态是否真正帮助推理的矛盾报告，缺乏受控评估框架和模型内部分析来理解模态交互何时支持或损害推理。

Method: 提出基于逻辑的评估框架，将多模态推理分为六种交互模式，分析事实在不同模态间的分布和逻辑组合方式。通过注意力模式分析和两步提示策略进行验证。

Result: 额外模态仅在提供独立充分推理路径时提升性能；识别出三种性能下降模式：弱模态拖累整体、冲突导致模态偏好、联合信号整合失败；发现注意力模式未能编码事实有用性。

Conclusion: 融合而非感知是多模态推理的主要障碍，建议采用组合感知训练和早期融合控制作为有前景的方向。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) promise enhanced reasoning by
integrating diverse inputs such as text, vision, and audio. Yet cross-modal
reasoning remains underexplored, with conflicting reports on whether added
modalities help or harm performance. These inconsistencies stem from a lack of
controlled evaluation frameworks and analysis of models' internals to isolate
when and why modality interactions support or undermine reasoning. We address
this gap through a logic-grounded evaluation framework that categorizes
multimodal reasoning into six interaction patterns, varying how facts are
distributed across modalities and logically combined. Empirically, additional
modalities enhance reasoning only when they provide independent and sufficient
reasoning paths, while redundant or chained entailment support often hurts
performance. Moreover, reasoning degrades in three systematic ways: weaker
modalities drag down overall performance, conflicts bias preference toward
certain modalities, and joint signals from different modalities fail to be
integrated effectively. Therefore, we identify two core failures:
task-composition bottleneck, where recognition and reasoning cannot be jointly
executed in one pass, and fusion bottleneck, where early integration introduces
bias. For further investigation, we find that attention patterns fail to encode
fact usefulness, but a simple two-step prompting (recognize then reason)
restores performance, confirming the task-composition bottleneck. Moreover,
modality identity remains recoverable in early layers, and softening attention
in early fusion improves reasoning, highlighting biased fusion as another
failure mode. Overall, our findings show that integration, not perception, is
the main barrier to multimodal reasoning, suggesting composition-aware training
and early fusion control as promising directions.

<details>

Motivation: 语音集成到LLMs虽然扩展了模型能力，但往往会削弱其核心文本能力，限制了模型充分利用预训练文本知识的能力。

Method: 提出了基于参数重要性估计的分析框架，研究了编码器-适配器范式，并探索了分层学习率调度和低秩适应(LoRA)两种缓解策略。

Result: 实验结果表明，两种方法都比完全微调更好地保持了文本能力，同时提高了下游口语问答性能。

Conclusion: 分析为所提缓解策略的有效性提供了原则性解释，将其优势与LLMs中文本知识的结构特性联系起来。

Abstract: The integration of speech into Large Language Models (LLMs) has substantially
expanded their capabilities, but often at the cost of weakening their core
textual competence. This degradation limits the ability of speech-enabled LLMs
to fully exploit their pre-trained text-based knowledge. In this work, we
analyze the underlying mechanisms of this issue through a focused study of the
widely used encoder-adaptor paradigm. We propose an analytical framework based
on parameter importance estimation, which reveals that fine-tuning for speech
introduces a textual importance distribution shift: the layer-wise allocation
of parameters critical to textual reasoning is disrupted. Building on this
insight, we investigate two mitigation strategies: layer-wise learning rate
scheduling and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), both aim to preserve the original
parameter distribution. Experimental results show that both approaches better
maintain textual competence than full fine-tuning, while also improving
downstream spoken question answering performance. Furthermore, our analysis
offers a principled explanation for the effectiveness of the proposed
mitigation strategies, linking their benefits to the structural properties of
textual knowledge in LLMs.

Motivation: 现有RLHF框架主要依赖偏好奖励，但忽视了模型内部知识边界，加剧了"幻觉税"问题，需要解决长文本生成中的事实性缺陷

Method: 基于策略模型表达知识与基础模型参数知识的一致性，引入双事实对齐机制，构建事实检查表指导在线强化学习，并训练自评估模块

Result: 在多个长文本基准测试中显著改善事实性指标，有效缓解模型幻觉问题

Conclusion: KLCF框架通过知识一致性强化学习，以轻量级且无需外部知识的方式有效提升了LLM的事实准确性

Abstract: Hallucination and factuality deficits remain key obstacles to the reliability
of large language models (LLMs) in long-form generation. Existing reinforcement
learning from human feedback (RLHF) frameworks primarily rely on preference
rewards, yet they often overlook the model's internal knowledge boundaries,
exacerbating the so-called "hallucination tax". To address this challenge, we
propose Knowledge-Level Consistency Reinforcement Learning Framework (KLCF), a
novel framework that focuses on the knowledge consistency between the policy
model's expressed knowledge and the base model's parametric knowledge, and
introduces a Dual-Fact Alignment mechanism to jointly optimize factual recall
and precision. Specifically, KLCF leverages pretrained knowledge boundaries to
construct fact checklist, guiding online reinforcement learning to improve
factual coverage and recall; simultaneously, it trains a self-assessment module
based on the base model's internal knowledge to enhance factual precision
during generation. Unlike prior methods that rely on external retrieval or
heavy verification, our reward design is fully external-knowledge-free and
lightweight, making KLCF efficient and easily scalable to large-scale training.
Experimental results demonstrate that KLCF substantially improves factuality
metrics across multiple long-form benchmarks and effectively alleviates model
hallucinations.

TL;DR: 提出LoGo框架，通过结合个性化本地记忆和捕捉群体共享兴趣的全局记忆，解决LLM个性化中的冷启动和偏见问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM个性化面临两个关键挑战：冷启动问题（用户历史数据不足）和偏见问题（用户历史数据丰富但偏斜），这些问题源于无法建模用户间的集体知识。

Method: 提出本地-全局记忆框架(LoGo)，结合个性化本地记忆和捕捉群体共享兴趣的全局记忆，并引入调解器模块来解决本地和全局信号之间的冲突。

Result: 在多个基准测试上的广泛实验表明，LoGo持续提升个性化质量，既能预热冷启动用户，又能减轻偏见预测。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了整合集体知识对于增强LLM个性化的重要性。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) personalization aims to tailor model behavior to
individual users based on their historical interactions. However, its
effectiveness is often hindered by two key challenges: the \textit{cold-start
problem}, where users with limited history provide insufficient context for
accurate personalization, and the \textit{biasing problem}, where users with
abundant but skewed history cause the model to overfit to narrow preferences.
We identify both issues as symptoms of a common underlying limitation, i.e.,
the inability to model collective knowledge across users. To address this, we
propose a local-global memory framework (LoGo) that combines the personalized
local memory with a collective global memory that captures shared interests
across the population. To reconcile discrepancies between these two memory
sources, we introduce a mediator module designed to resolve conflicts between
local and global signals. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks
demonstrate that LoGo consistently improves personalization quality by both
warming up cold-start users and mitigating biased predictions. These results
highlight the importance of incorporating collective knowledge to enhance LLM
personalization.

TL;DR: 本文提出了KAPPA方法，通过分析LLMs在选择题中的知识-预测差距，发现隐藏状态在知识基和预测基上的错位是错误预测的原因，并通过投影调整来对齐这两个基向量，从而提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在选择题上表现不佳，尽管在其他情境下能展示正确知识。这种知识-预测差距的机制尚不明确，需要研究并解决。

Method: 通过探测分析发现隐藏状态中存在知识基和预测基构成的空间，提出KAPPA方法——一种无参数的干预技术，通过投影变换将预测坐标与知识坐标对齐。

Result: 在Big-Bench-Hard和ARC-Challenge的二选一重构任务上，KAPPA显著提高了准确率，并持续优于基线方法。跨数据集实验显示子空间具有一定泛化能力，且KAPPA在选择题之外的自由形式问题上也有效。

Conclusion: 研究为知识-预测差距提供了新的几何理解，并提出了一种实用的方法来更好地使模型行为与其潜在知识对齐。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail on multiple-choice questions (MCQs)
despite demonstrating correct knowledge in other contexts, such as free-form
generation. To investigate the mechanism underlying this knowledge-prediction
gap on MCQs and alleviate it, we conduct a probing analysis and find that
residual streams in certain layers contain a subspace spanned by two important
bases: a \emph{knowledge basis} that encodes the probability of the
ground-truth answer for a given MCQ and a \emph{prediction basis} that encodes
the probability of the answer choice predicted by the model. We observe that
incorrect predictions arise from a misalignment of the model's hidden states
along these two bases. Hence, we introduce \textbf{KAPPA} (Knowledge-Aligned
Prediction through Projection-based Adjustment), a parameter-free intervention
that transforms the hidden states to align the prediction coordinate with the
knowledge coordinate within this subspace. Experiments on binary-choice
reformulations of Big-Bench-Hard and ARC-Challenge show that KAPPA
substantially improves accuracy and consistently outperforms baselines. While
optimal subspaces differ across tasks, subspaces generalize to some extent, as
supported by cross-dataset experiments. Moreover, KAPPA extends its
effectiveness to free-form questions beyond MCQs. Our work provides a new
geometric understanding of the knowledge-prediction gap and offers a practical
method for better aligning model behavior with its latent knowledge.

Abstract: This paper presents our submission to the QIAS 2025 shared task on Islamic
knowledge understanding and reasoning. We developed a hybrid
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system that combines sparse and dense
retrieval methods with cross-encoder reranking to improve large language model
(LLM) performance. Our three-stage pipeline incorporates BM25 for initial
retrieval, a dense embedding retrieval model for semantic matching, and
cross-encoder reranking for precise content retrieval. We evaluate our approach
on both subtasks using two LLMs, Fanar and Mistral, demonstrating that the
proposed RAG pipeline enhances performance across both, with accuracy
improvements up to 25%, depending on the task and model configuration. Our best
configuration is achieved with Fanar, yielding accuracy scores of 45% in
Subtask 1 and 80% in Subtask 2.

*Arti Rani,Shweta Singh,Nihar Ranjan Sahoo,Gaurav Kumar Nayak*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了OpenBiasBench基准和Open-DeBias方法，用于检测和缓解LLMs在问答任务中的开放集偏见，包括已知和未见过的偏见类别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有偏见缓解方法局限于预定义类别，无法处理新颖或上下文特定的新兴偏见，需要开发能够应对开放集偏见的解决方案。

Method: 提出Open-DeBias方法，使用适配器模块进行数据高效和参数高效的偏见缓解，能够泛化到未见过的偏见类别。

Result: 在BBQ数据集上，Open-DeBias比BMBI方法在模糊子集上提升48%准确率，在消歧子集上提升6%。在零样本迁移到韩语BBQ时达到84%准确率。

Conclusion: Open-DeBias在多种NLP任务中表现出鲁棒性、多语言优势和适用于通用开放域偏见缓解的能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success on question
answering (QA) tasks, yet they often encode harmful biases that compromise
fairness and trustworthiness. Most existing bias mitigation approaches are
restricted to predefined categories, limiting their ability to address novel or
context-specific emergent biases. To bridge this gap, we tackle the novel
problem of open-set bias detection and mitigation in text-based QA. We
introduce OpenBiasBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate biases
across a wide range of categories and subgroups, encompassing both known and
previously unseen biases. Additionally, we propose Open-DeBias, a novel,
data-efficient, and parameter-efficient debiasing method that leverages adapter
modules to mitigate existing social and stereotypical biases while generalizing
to unseen ones. Compared to the state-of-the-art BMBI method, Open-DeBias
improves QA accuracy on BBQ dataset by nearly $48\%$ on ambiguous subsets and
$6\%$ on disambiguated ones, using adapters fine-tuned on just a small fraction
of the training data. Remarkably, the same adapters, in a zero-shot transfer to
Korean BBQ, achieve $84\%$ accuracy, demonstrating robust language-agnostic
generalization. Through extensive evaluation, we also validate the
effectiveness of Open-DeBias across a broad range of NLP tasks, including
StereoSet and CrowS-Pairs, highlighting its robustness, multilingual strength,
and suitability for general-purpose, open-domain bias mitigation. The project

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SPELL是一个多角色自玩强化学习框架，通过问题生成器、回答器和验证器的循环角色实现无需标注的长文本推理优化，在多个基准测试中显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长文本推理在大型语言模型中的进展滞后，主要由于处理长文本的内在困难以及缺乏可靠的人工标注和可程序化验证的奖励信号。

Method: SPELL框架集成三个循环角色：问题生成器从原始文档生成问题，回答器学习基于文档回答问题，验证器评估回答与参考答案的语义等价性以产生奖励信号，并通过自动课程和自适应奖励函数稳定训练。

Result: 在六个长文本基准测试中，SPELL持续提升各种LLM的性能，优于同等规模的大规模标注数据微调模型，在Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking模型上平均获得7.6分的pass@8提升。

Conclusion: SPELL展示了在无需标注数据的情况下有效优化长文本推理的潜力，为扩展到更强大模型提供了前景。

Abstract: Progress in long-context reasoning for large language models (LLMs) has
lagged behind other recent advances. This gap arises not only from the
intrinsic difficulty of processing long texts, but also from the scarcity of
reliable human annotations and programmatically verifiable reward signals. In
this paper, we propose SPELL, a multi-role self-play reinforcement learning
framework that enables scalable, label-free optimization for long-context
reasoning. SPELL integrates three cyclical roles-questioner, responder, and
verifier-within a single model to enable continual self-improvement. The
questioner generates questions from raw documents paired with reference
answers; the responder learns to solve these questions based on the documents;
and the verifier evaluates semantic equivalence between the responder's output
and the questioner's reference answer, producing reward signals to guide
continual training. To stabilize training, we introduce an automated curriculum
that gradually increases document length and a reward function that adapts
question difficulty to the model's evolving capabilities. Extensive experiments
on six long-context benchmarks show that SPELL consistently improves
performance across diverse LLMs and outperforms equally sized models fine-tuned
on large-scale annotated data. Notably, SPELL achieves an average 7.6-point
gain in pass@8 on the strong reasoning model Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking, raising
its performance ceiling and showing promise for scaling to even more capable
models.

*Shaobo Wang,Jiaming Wang,Jiajun Zhang,Cong Wang,Yue Min,Zichen Wen,Fei Huang,Huiqiang Jiang,Junyang Lin,Dayiheng Liu,Linfeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Q-Tuning是一个统一的数据修剪框架，通过联合优化样本级和token级修剪，在仅使用12.5%训练数据的情况下，在SmolLM2-1.7B上实现了比全数据SFT基线平均+38%的改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着监督微调(SFT)从轻量级后训练步骤演变为计算密集型阶段，现有数据修剪方法存在设计碎片化问题，无法同时优化样本级和token级修剪，导致显著的低效率。

Method: 提出错误-不确定性(EU)平面诊断框架，然后开发Quadrant-based Tuning(Q-Tuning)两阶段策略：首先进行样本级筛选保留富含信息误解或校准信号的样本；其次应用非对称token修剪策略，仅从误解样本中修剪不太重要的token，同时完整保留校准样本。

Result: 在五个不同基准测试中创下新纪录，在SmolLM2-1.7B上仅使用12.5%原始训练数据就实现了比全数据SFT基线平均+38%的改进。

Conclusion: Q-Tuning是第一个持续优于全数据训练的动态修剪方法，为预算受限的LLM SFT提供了实用且可扩展的数据利用最大化蓝图。

Abstract: As supervised fine-tuning (SFT) evolves from a lightweight post-training step
into a compute-intensive phase rivaling mid-training in scale, data efficiency
has become critical for aligning large language models (LLMs) under tight
budgets. Existing data pruning methods suffer from a fragmented design: they
operate either at the sample level or the token level in isolation, failing to
jointly optimize both dimensions. This disconnect leads to significant
inefficiencies--high-value samples may still contain redundant tokens, while
token-level pruning often discards crucial instructional or corrective signals
embedded in individual examples. To address this bottleneck, we introduce the
Error-Uncertainty (EU) Plane, a diagnostic framework that jointly characterizes
the heterogeneous utility of training data across samples and tokens. Guided by
this insight, we propose Quadrant-based Tuning (Q-Tuning), a unified framework
that strategically coordinates sample pruning and token pruning. Q-Tuning
employs a two-stage strategy: first, it performs sample-level triage to retain
examples rich in informative misconceptions or calibration signals; second, it
applies an asymmetric token-pruning policy, using a context-aware scoring
mechanism to trim less salient tokens exclusively from misconception samples
while preserving calibration samples in their entirety. Our method sets a new
state of the art across five diverse benchmarks. Remarkably, on SmolLM2-1.7B,
Q-Tuning achieves a +38\% average improvement over the full-data SFT baseline
using only 12.5\% of the original training data. As the first dynamic pruning
approach to consistently outperform full-data training, Q-Tuning provides a
practical and scalable blueprint for maximizing data utilization in
budget-constrained LLM SFT.

*Yibo Yan,Guangwei Xu,Xin Zou,Shuliang Liu,James Kwok,Xuming Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DocPruner是一个用于视觉文档检索的框架，通过自适应剪枝减少存储开销，能在保持检索性能的同时减少50-60%的存储需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于多向量范式的方法虽然有效，但每个文档需要存储数百个向量，导致存储开销过大，难以大规模部署。

Method: 利用文档内部补丁注意力分布动态识别和丢弃冗余嵌入，实现自适应补丁级嵌入剪枝。

Result: 在十多个代表性数据集上的实验表明，DocPruner能显著减少存储需求，同时检索性能下降可忽略不计。

Conclusion: DocPruner提供了一个稳健、灵活且有效的解决方案，可用于构建存储高效的大规模视觉文档检索系统。

Abstract: Visual Document Retrieval (VDR), the task of retrieving visually-rich
document pages using queries that combine visual and textual cues, is crucial
for numerous real-world applications. Recent state-of-the-art methods leverage
Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) in a multi-vector paradigm, representing
each document as patch-level embeddings to capture fine-grained details. While
highly effective, this approach introduces a critical challenge: prohibitive
storage overhead, as storing hundreds of vectors per page makes large-scale
deployment costly and impractical. To address this, we introduce DocPruner, the
first framework to employ adaptive patch-level embedding pruning for VDR to
effectively reduce the storage overhead. DocPruner leverages the intra-document
patch attention distribution to dynamically identify and discard redundant
embeddings for each document. This adaptive mechanism enables a significant
50-60% reduction in storage for leading multi-vector VDR models with negligible
degradation in document retrieval performance. Extensive experiments across
more than ten representative datasets validate that DocPruner offers a robust,
flexible, and effective solution for building storage-efficient, large-scale
VDR systems.

### [447] [Taming Masked Diffusion Language Models via Consistency Trajectory Reinforcement Learning with Fewer Decoding Step](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23924)
*Jingyi Yang,Guanxu Chen,Xuhao Hu,Jing Shao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文针对掩码扩散语言模型(MDLMs)提出EOS早期拒绝(EOSER)和递增步长(ASS)解码调度器，以及一致性轨迹组相对策略优化(CJ-GRPO)方法，解决了MDLMs解码策略和强化学习算法不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MDLMs具有并行解码、灵活生成顺序和较少推理步骤等优势，但其解码策略和强化学习算法研究不足。直接将AR模型技术迁移到MDLMs存在训练-推理不一致性问题。

Method: 提出EOSER和ASS解码调度器实现全扩散式解码，减少解码步骤；引入CJ-GRPO方法确保轨迹一致性，减少跳步优化误差。

Result: 在数学和规划等推理任务上使用LLaDA-8B-Instruct进行实验，证明所提方法能有效且高效地驯服MDLMs。

Conclusion: EOSER、ASS和CJ-GRPO方法为MDLMs的解码和强化学习提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Masked diffusion language models (MDLMs) have recently emerged as a promising
alternative to autoregressive (AR) language models, offering properties such as
parallel decoding, flexible generation orders, and the potential for fewer
inference steps. Despite these advantages, decoding strategies and
reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms tailored for MDLMs remain underexplored.
A naive approach is to directly transfer techniques well-established for AR
models to MDLMs. However, this raises an immediate question: Is such a naive
transfer truly optimal? For example, 1) Block-wise and semi-AR decoding
strategies are not employed during the training of MDLMs, so why do they
outperform full diffusion-style decoding during inference? 2) Applying RL
algorithms designed for AR models directly to MDLMs exhibits a
training-inference inconsistency, since MDLM decoding are non-causal
(parallel). This results in inconsistencies between the rollout trajectory and
the optimization trajectory. To address these challenges, we propose EOS Early
Rejection (EOSER) and Ascending Step-Size (ASS) decoding scheduler, which
unlock the potential of MDLMs to perform full diffusion-style decoding,
achieving competitive performance with fewer decoding steps. Additionally, we
introduce Consistency Trajectory Group Relative Policy Optimization (CJ-GRPO)
for taming MDLMs, which emphasizes the consistency between rollout trajectory
and optimization trajectory, and reduces the optimization errors caused by
skip-step optimization. We conduct extensive experiments on reasoning tasks,
such as mathematical and planning benchmarks, using LLaDA-8B-Instruct. The
results demonstrate that the proposed EOSER and ASS mechanisms, together with
CJ-GRPO, hold significant promise for effectively and efficiently taming MDLMs.

*Zhangdie Yuan,Zifeng Ding,Andreas Vlachos*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EVOLVECAST框架评估LLMs在新信息出现时如何修正预测，发现模型更新不一致且保守，置信度校准远不及人类标准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究将未来事件预测视为静态任务，未考虑随着新证据出现预测和置信度应如何演变。

Method: 使用人类预测者作为参考基准，分析LLMs在更新上下文下的预测偏移和置信度校准，比较语言化置信度和基于logits的置信度估计。

Result: LLMs对新信息有一定响应性，但更新往往不一致或过于保守；两种置信度估计方法均未明显优于对方，且都远不及人类标准；模型普遍表现出保守偏差。

Conclusion: 模型在信念更新方面存在保守倾向，需要更稳健的信念更新方法。

Abstract: Prior work has largely treated future event prediction as a static task,
failing to consider how forecasts and the confidence in them should evolve as
new evidence emerges. To address this gap, we introduce EVOLVECAST, a framework
for evaluating whether large language models appropriately revise their
predictions in response to new information. In particular, EVOLVECAST assesses
whether LLMs adjust their forecasts when presented with information released
after their training cutoff. We use human forecasters as a comparative
reference to analyze prediction shifts and confidence calibration under updated
contexts. While LLMs demonstrate some responsiveness to new information, their
updates are often inconsistent or overly conservative. We further find that
neither verbalized nor logits-based confidence estimates consistently
outperform the other, and both remain far from the human reference standard.
Across settings, models tend to express conservative bias, underscoring the
need for more robust approaches to belief updating.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Easy Turn，一个开源的、模块化的回合检测模型，整合声学和语言双模态信息来预测四种对话回合状态，并发布了1,145小时的训练数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全双工交互对于自然人机通信至关重要，但现有解决方案要么依赖未开源的专用回合检测模型，要么参数规模过大或仅支持单模态，要么需要大量稀缺的全双工数据进行LLM微调。

Method: 开发了Easy Turn模型，集成声学和语言双模态信息，预测四种对话回合状态（完成、未完成、反馈、等待），并构建了1,145小时的Easy Turn trainset训练数据集。

Result: 与现有开源模型（如TEN Turn Detection和Smart Turn V2）相比，在开源Easy Turn测试集上实现了最先进的回合检测准确率。

Conclusion: Easy Turn解决了现有回合检测模型的局限性，提供了开源的双模态解决方案，数据和模型将在GitHub上公开。

Abstract: Full-duplex interaction is crucial for natural human-machine communication,
yet remains challenging as it requires robust turn-taking detection to decide
when the system should speak, listen, or remain silent. Existing solutions
either rely on dedicated turn-taking models, most of which are not
open-sourced. The few available ones are limited by their large parameter size
or by supporting only a single modality, such as acoustic or linguistic.
Alternatively, some approaches finetune LLM backbones to enable full-duplex
capability, but this requires large amounts of full-duplex data, which remain
scarce in open-source form. To address these issues, we propose Easy Turn, an
open-source, modular turn-taking detection model that integrates acoustic and
linguistic bimodal information to predict four dialogue turn states: complete,
incomplete, backchannel, and wait, accompanied by the release of Easy Turn
trainset, a 1,145-hour speech dataset designed for training turn-taking
detection models. Compared to existing open-source models like TEN Turn
Detection and Smart Turn V2, our model achieves state-of-the-art turn-taking
detection accuracy on our open-source Easy Turn testset. The data and model
will be made publicly available on GitHub.

*Claudio Fantinuoli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于视觉的机器口译方法（VGI），通过整合视觉语言模型处理语音和网络摄像头输入的视觉信息，旨在通过上下文视觉信息来增强翻译过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前机器口译系统仅依赖单一的语言信号，在需要视觉、情境或语用信息进行消歧和确保充分性的场景中表现受限。

Method: 构建了一个原型系统，集成视觉语言模型处理语音和网络摄像头输入的视觉信息，并创建了一个手工制作的诊断语料库来评估三种类型的歧义。

Result: 视觉基础显著改善了词汇消歧，在性别解析方面取得了适度但不稳定的增益，对句法歧义没有显示出益处。

Conclusion: 拥抱多模态是提高机器口译翻译质量的重要步骤。

Abstract: Machine Interpreting systems are currently implemented as unimodal, real-time
speech-to-speech architectures, processing translation exclusively on the basis
of the linguistic signal. Such reliance on a single modality, however,
constrains performance in contexts where disambiguation and adequacy depend on
additional cues, such as visual, situational, or pragmatic information. This
paper introduces Vision-Grounded Interpreting (VGI), a novel approach designed
to address the limitations of unimodal machine interpreting. We present a
prototype system that integrates a vision-language model to process both speech
and visual input from a webcam, with the aim of priming the translation process
through contextual visual information. To evaluate the effectiveness of this
approach, we constructed a hand-crafted diagnostic corpus targeting three types
of ambiguity. In our evaluation, visual grounding substantially improves
lexical disambiguation, yields modest and less stable gains for gender
resolution, and shows no benefit for syntactic ambiguities. We argue that
embracing multimodality represents a necessary step forward for advancing
translation quality in machine interpreting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM在复杂任务中依赖链式思维推理，但总是生成冗长推理轨迹效率低下，导致过多token使用和更高的推理成本。

Method: HiPO结合混合数据管道（提供配对的Think-on和Think-off响应）与混合强化学习奖励系统，平衡准确性和效率，避免过度依赖详细推理。

Result: 在数学和编程基准测试中，HiPO能够显著减少token长度，同时保持或提高准确性。

Conclusion: HiPO为高效自适应推理提供了一种原则性方法，推动了推理导向LLM在资源敏感现实环境中的部署。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly rely on chain-of-thought (CoT)
reasoning to improve accuracy on complex tasks. However, always generating
lengthy reasoning traces is inefficient, leading to excessive token usage and
higher inference costs. This paper introduces the Hybrid Policy Optimization
(i.e., HiPO), a framework for adaptive reasoning control that enables LLMs to
selectively decide when to engage in detailed reasoning (Think-on) and when to
respond directly (Think-off). Specifically, HiPO combines a hybrid data
pipelineproviding paired Think-on and Think-off responseswith a hybrid
reinforcement learning reward system that balances accuracy and efficiency
while avoiding over-reliance on detailed reasoning. Experiments across
mathematics and coding benchmarks demonstrate that HiPO can substantially
reduce token length while maintaining or improving accuracy. Finally, we hope
HiPO a can be a principled approach for efficient adaptive reasoning, advancing
the deployment of reasoning-oriented LLMs in real-world, resource-sensitive
settings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了ByteSized32Refactored，一个重构、模块化且可扩展的文本游戏生成实现，通过GameBasic.py基础库将代码从2万行减少到1万行，并支持新场景的扩展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模拟交互式世界模型是大型语言模型的核心挑战，需要可扩展的文本游戏生成环境来支持LLM适应环境规范。

Method: 重构ByteSized32语料库，创建GameBasic.py基础库，抽象出7个基类（如GameObject等）作为可复用模块，实现代码结构优化和模块化设计。

Result: 使用GPT-4o进行实验，在未见场景下生成的文本游戏在四个评估维度中的两个维度上质量提升，但在另外两个维度上下降，表明重构代码的层次结构为LLM带来了新挑战。

Conclusion: 基于基础库和模块化优化的可扩展代码结构不仅促进LLM适应环境规范，还建立了支持未来扩展的可扩展环境。

Abstract: Simulating interactive world models remains a core challenge in Large
Language Models(LLMs). In this work, we introduce the ByteSized32Refactored, a
refactored, modular, and extensible implementation of the original ByteSized32
corpus to explore the task of text game generation. We further optimize the
code structure of each text game and create the GameBasic.py foundation
library, which centralizes common logic across all 32 games by abstracting 7
base classes (GameObject, etc.) into reusable modules, thereby reducing from
20k to 10k total lines of Python code compared to the original Bytesized32. Our
refactored implementation enables extendability - with our centralized design,
ByteSized32Refactored can be more efficiently extended to include text games of
new scenarios and specifications by reusing the shared logic and
functionalities. Extensive experiments with GPT-4o demonstrate a mix of
performance - with Bytesized32Refactored, the generated text games for unseen
scenarios showcase quality improvements on two of the four evaluation
dimensions while decreases on the other two, indicating that the hierarchical
structure of the refactored code presents new challenges for LLMs. Overall, we
highlight that our extensible code structure, centered on the foundation
library and the modular optimization, not only facilitates LLM adaptation to
environment specifications but also establishes a scalable environment that
supports future extensions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有偏好对齐方法需要精心策划的数据和昂贵的参数优化，导致任务特定的模型。PaLRS旨在提供更高效、灵活的训练免费替代方案。

Method: 从少量偏好对中提取残差流中的偏好信号，生成轻量级即插即用转向向量，在推理时应用这些向量来引导模型行为。

Result: PaLRS在数学推理和代码生成基准测试中实现了一致的性能提升，同时保持了基线通用性能，相比DPO对齐模型表现更好且节省大量时间。

Conclusion: PaLRS为偏好对齐提供了有效、高效且灵活的替代方案，实现了训练免费、即插即用的对齐机制，仅需最少数据。

Abstract: Preference alignment is a critical step in making Large Language Models
(LLMs) useful and aligned with (human) preferences. Existing approaches such as
Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback or Direct Preference Optimization
typically require curated data and expensive optimization over billions of
parameters, and eventually lead to persistent task-specific models. In this
work, we introduce Preference alignment of Large Language Models via Residual
Steering (PaLRS), a training-free method that exploits preference signals
encoded in the residual streams of LLMs. From as few as one hundred preference
pairs, PaLRS extracts lightweight, plug-and-play steering vectors that can be
applied at inference time to push models toward preferred behaviors. We
evaluate PaLRS on various small-to-medium-scale open-source LLMs, showing that
PaLRS-aligned models achieve consistent gains on mathematical reasoning and
code generation benchmarks while preserving baseline general-purpose
performance. Moreover, when compared to DPO-aligned models, they perform better
with huge time savings. Our findings highlight that PaLRS offers an effective,
much more efficient and flexible alternative to standard preference
optimization pipelines, offering a training-free, plug-and-play mechanism for
alignment with minimal data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型的快速扩展，其计算和环境成本问题日益突出，需要研究如何在保持性能的同时提高效率。

Method: 使用Flores+基准测试和人工评估，比较完整3.3B fp32模型、蒸馏模型和量化模型在法语、印地语和卡纳达语翻译中的表现，并分析碳排放。

Result: 完整3.3B模型BLEU得分最高但碳排放最大(0.007-0.008kg CO2/次)，蒸馏模型推理速度快4.5倍且BLEU下降很小，即使激进量化(INT4)也能保持高准确性和流畅度。

Conclusion: 模型压缩策略能大幅减少计算需求和环境影响，同时保持竞争力的翻译质量，但在低资源环境中权衡更明显，建议评估框架应整合效率和可持续性指标。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of large language models (LLMs) has heightened concerns
about their computational and environmental costs. This study investigates the
trade-offs between translation quality and efficiency by comparing full-scale,
distilled, and quantized models using machine translation as a case study. We
evaluated performance on the Flores+ benchmark and through human judgments of
conversational translations in French, Hindi, and Kannada. Our analysis of
carbon emissions per evaluation run revealed that the full 3.3B fp32 model,
while achieving the highest BLEU scores, incurred the largest environmental
footprint (about 0.007-0.008 kg CO2 per run). The distilled models achieved an
inference of up to 4.5x faster than the full 3.3B model, with only minimal
reductions in BLEU scores. Human evaluations also showed that even aggressive
quantization (INT4) preserved high levels of accuracy and fluency, with
differences between models generally minor. These findings demonstrate that
model compression strategies can substantially reduce computational demands and
environmental impact while maintaining competitive translation quality, though
trade-offs are more pronounced in low-resource settings. We argue for
evaluation frameworks that integrate efficiency and sustainability alongside
objective metrics as central dimensions of progress in NLP.

Conclusion: 该框架为实现可验证更安全、更可监管的AI铺平了道路。

Abstract: As autonomous AI agents are increasingly deployed in industry, it is
essential to safeguard them. We introduce a novel framework that automates the
translation of unstructured design documents into verifiable, real-time
guardrails. We introduce "Policy as Prompt," a new approach that uses Large
Language Models (LLMs) to interpret and enforce natural language policies by
applying contextual understanding and the principle of least privilege. Our
system first ingests technical artifacts to construct a verifiable policy tree,
which is then compiled into lightweight, prompt-based classifiers that audit
agent behavior at runtime. We validate our approach across diverse
applications, demonstrating a scalable and auditable pipeline that bridges the
critical policy-to-practice gap, paving the way for verifiably safer and more
regulatable AI.

TL;DR: MCPMark是一个新的MCP基准测试，包含127个高质量任务，旨在更真实全面地评估MCP使用情况，相比现有基准测试具有更丰富的交互深度和复杂性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MCP基准测试范围狭窄，主要关注读取密集型任务或交互深度有限的任务，无法捕捉真实世界工作流程的复杂性和现实性。

Method: 构建了127个由领域专家和AI代理协作创建的高质量任务，每个任务包含精心策划的初始状态和用于自动验证的程序脚本，需要更丰富多样的环境交互和CRUD操作。

Result: 最佳模型gpt-5-medium仅达到52.56% pass@1和33.86% pass^4，其他强模型如claude-sonnet-4和o3低于30% pass@1和15% pass^4。LLM平均需要16.2个执行轮次和17.4个工具调用。

Conclusion: MCPMark具有压力测试性质，显著超越了先前MCP基准测试的复杂度，突显了当前LLM在复杂MCP任务中的性能限制。

Abstract: MCP standardizes how LLMs interact with external systems, forming the
foundation for general agents. However, existing MCP benchmarks remain narrow
in scope: they focus on read-heavy tasks or tasks with limited interaction
depth, and fail to capture the complexity and realism of real-world workflows.
To address this gap, we propose MCPMark, a benchmark designed to evaluate MCP
use in a more realistic and comprehensive manner. It consists of $127$
high-quality tasks collaboratively created by domain experts and AI agents.
Each task begins with a curated initial state and includes a programmatic
script for automatic verification. These tasks demand richer and more diverse
interactions with the environment, involving a broad range of create, read,
update, and delete (CRUD) operations. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of
cutting-edge LLMs using a minimal agent framework that operates in a
tool-calling loop. Empirical results show that the best-performing model,
gpt-5-medium, reaches only $52.56$\% pass@1 and $33.86$\% pass^4, while other
widely regarded strong models, including claude-sonnet-4 and o3, fall below
$30$\% pass@1 and $15$\% pass^4. On average, LLMs require $16.2$ execution
turns and $17.4$ tool calls per task, significantly surpassing those in
previous MCP benchmarks and highlighting the stress-testing nature of MCPMark.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了序列扩散语言模型（SDLM），通过下一代序列预测（NSP）统一了下一代令牌和下一代块预测，能够自适应确定每个步骤的生成长度，同时保持KV缓存兼容性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散语言模型（DLMs）具有理论效率优势，但受限于固定长度解码和与KV缓存不兼容的问题。块扩散方法虽然缓解了这些问题，但仍强制使用固定块大小且需要昂贵的训练。

Method: 基于下一代序列预测（NSP）构建SDLM，可以在固定大小的掩码块内进行扩散推理，但根据模型置信度动态解码连续子序列，从而保持KV缓存兼容性。

Result: 实验表明，SDLM仅使用350万个训练样本就能匹配或超越强大的自回归基线，同时比Qwen-2.5实现2.1倍更高的吞吐量。SDLM-32B模型显示出更显著的效率提升。

Conclusion: SDLM展示了强大的可扩展性潜力，为扩散语言模型的实际应用提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion language models (DLMs) have strong theoretical efficiency but are
limited by fixed-length decoding and incompatibility with key-value (KV)
caches. Block diffusion mitigates these issues, yet still enforces a fixed
block size and requires expensive training. We introduce Next Sequence
Prediction (NSP), which unifies next-token and next-block prediction, enabling
the model to adaptively determine the generation length at each step. When the
length is fixed to 1, NSP reduces to standard next-token prediction. Building
on NSP, we propose Sequential Diffusion Language Model (SDLM), which can
retrofit pre-trained autoregressive language models (ALMs) at minimal cost.
Specifically, SDLM performs diffusion inference within fixed-size mask blocks,
but dynamically decodes consecutive subsequences based on model confidence,
thereby preserving KV-cache compatibility and improving robustness to varying
uncertainty and semantics across the sequence. Experiments show that SDLM
matches or surpasses strong autoregressive baselines using only 3.5M training
samples, while achieving 2.1 higher throughput than Qwen-2.5. Notably, the
SDLM-32B model delivers even more pronounced efficiency gains, demonstrating
the strong scalability potential of our modeling paradigm. Project page and

### [458] [SparseD: Sparse Attention for Diffusion Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24014)
*Zeqing Wang,Gongfan Fang,Xinyin Ma,Xingyi Yang,Xinchao Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SparseD是一种针对扩散语言模型的高效稀疏注意力方法，通过预计算头部特定的稀疏模式并在所有步骤中复用，同时在早期步骤使用全注意力，实现了无损加速，在64k上下文长度下比FlashAttention快1.5倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的开源扩散语言模型存在高推理延迟问题，主要原因是注意力机制在长上下文中的二次复杂度。虽然稀疏注意力在自回归模型中有效，但不适用于扩散语言模型，因为其注意力模式具有头部特异性、跨步骤相似性以及早期步骤关键性等独特特征。

Method: 提出SparseD方法：1）预计算头部特定的稀疏模式并跨所有去噪步骤复用；2）在早期去噪步骤使用全注意力，后期切换到稀疏注意力，以保持生成质量。

Result: 实验结果显示SparseD实现了无损加速，在64k上下文长度和1024个去噪步骤下，比FlashAttention快1.5倍。

Conclusion: SparseD为在长上下文应用中部署扩散语言模型提供了一个实用且高效的解决方案，成功解决了扩散语言模型中的稀疏注意力挑战。

Abstract: While diffusion language models (DLMs) offer a promising alternative to
autoregressive models (ARs), existing open-source DLMs suffer from high
inference latency. This bottleneck is mainly due to the attention's quadratic
complexity with respect to context length in computing all query-key pairs.
Intuitively, to reduce this complexity, a natural strategy is to restrict
attention to sparse patterns that retain only the most relevant connections.
Such approaches are well-established in ARs, where attention follows fixed and
clearly defined sparse patterns. However, in DLMs, we observe distinct sparsity
behaviors: (1) attention patterns vary across heads, (2) attention patterns in
each head remain highly similar across denoising steps, and (3) early denoising
steps are critical for generation. These findings render sparse attention
methods designed for ARs largely incompatible with DLMs, as they fail to
capture head-specific structures and risk degrading generation when applied in
early denoising steps. To address these challenges, we propose SparseD, a novel
sparse attention method for DLMs. Leveraging the observations, SparseD only
requires pre-computing head-specific sparse patterns one time, and reuses them
across all steps. This prevents recomputing sparse patterns at each denoising
step. Meanwhile, SparseD uses full attention in the early steps, then switches
to sparse attention later to maintain generation quality. Together, these
establish SparseD as a practical and efficient solution for deploying DLMs in
long-context applications. Experimental results demonstrate that SparseD
achieves lossless acceleration, delivering up to $1.50\times$ speedup over
FlashAttention at a 64k context length with 1,024 denoising steps.

*Hongbo Liu,Jia Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出ResFormer架构，通过级联方法高效建模不同上下文长度，结合储层计算网络和Transformer，在多个数据集上显著提升性能并降低内存消耗


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型存在二次时间内存复杂度限制输入长度的问题，处理长上下文仍然具有挑战性

Method: ResFormer采用级联方法：储层计算网络捕获长期依赖关系（线性时间），传统Transformer处理短期句子依赖（固定长度输入）

Result: 在EmoryNLP数据集上准确率提升+22.3%，在MultiWOZ、MELD和IEMOCAP上持续提升，同时内存消耗降低

Conclusion: ResFormer在建模长上下文信息方面既有效又高效，解决了传统Transformer的计算复杂度限制

Abstract: Sequence classification is essential in NLP for understanding and
categorizing language patterns in tasks like sentiment analysis, intent
detection, and topic classification. Transformer-based models, despite
achieving state-of-the-art performance, have inherent limitations due to
quadratic time and memory complexity, restricting their input length. Although
extensive efforts have aimed at reducing computational demands, processing
extensive contexts remains challenging.
  To overcome these limitations, we propose ResFormer, a novel neural network
architecture designed to model varying context lengths efficiently through a
cascaded methodology. ResFormer integrates an reservoir computing network
featuring a nonlinear readout to effectively capture long-term contextual
dependencies in linear time. Concurrently, short-term dependencies within
sentences are modeled using a conventional Transformer architecture with
fixed-length inputs.
  Experiments demonstrate that ResFormer significantly outperforms baseline
models of DeepSeek-Qwen and ModernBERT, delivering an accuracy improvement of
up to +22.3% on the EmoryNLP dataset and consistent gains on MultiWOZ, MELD,
and IEMOCAP. In addition, ResFormer exhibits reduced memory consumption,
underscoring its effectiveness and efficiency in modeling extensive contextual
information.

Motivation: 随着社交媒体和互联网的发展，情感分析在营销、政治、客户服务等领域的重要性日益增长，但针对外语的情感分析由于缺乏标注数据而存在缺陷。

Method: 使用多语言数据集，采用预训练情感分析模型的集成方法，包括bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment和XLM-R模型。

Result: 实验结果表明，所提出的方法在情感分析任务中取得了超过86%的性能表现。

Conclusion: 提出的Transformer集成模型和大型语言模型能够有效解决外语情感分析中缺乏标注数据的问题，具有较好的实用价值。

Abstract: Sentiment analysis is a very important natural language processing activity
in which one identifies the polarity of a text, whether it conveys positive,
negative, or neutral sentiment. Along with the growth of social media and the
Internet, the significance of sentiment analysis has grown across numerous
industries such as marketing, politics, and customer service. Sentiment
analysis is flawed, however, when applied to foreign languages, particularly
when there is no labelled data to train models upon. In this study, we present
a transformer ensemble model and a large language model (LLM) that employs
sentiment analysis of other languages. We used multi languages dataset.
Sentiment was then assessed for sentences using an ensemble of pre-trained
sentiment analysis models: bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment, and XLM-R.
Our experimental results indicated that sentiment analysis performance was more
than 86% using the proposed method.

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注LLMs在少量任务特定约束下的生成能力，而本文探索LLMs能否解析大规模、细粒度的通用约束列表。

Method: 创建Words Checker实例评估模型特性(如大小、家族)和引导技术(如简单提示、思维链)的影响，并提出FoCusNet模型将原始约束列表解析为更小子集。

Result: 实验显示现有解决方案在约束数量增加时性能显著下降，而FoCusNet能带来8-13%的准确率提升。

Conclusion: FoCusNet能有效帮助LLMs专注于相关约束，在大规模约束生成任务中表现出显著性能优势。

Abstract: Recent research has explored the constrained generation capabilities of Large
Language Models (LLMs) when explicitly prompted by few task-specific
requirements. In contrast, we introduce Large-Scale Constraint Generation
(LSCG), a new problem that evaluates whether LLMs can parse a large,
fine-grained, generic list of constraints. To examine the LLMs' ability to
handle an increasing number constraints, we create a practical instance of
LSCG, called Words Checker. In Words Checker, we evaluate the impact of model
characteristics (e.g., size, family) and steering techniques (e.g., Simple
Prompt, Chain of Thought, Best of N) on performance. We also propose FoCusNet,
a small and dedicated model that parses the original list of constraints into a
smaller subset, helping the LLM focus on relevant constraints. Experiments
reveal that existing solutions suffer a significant performance drop as the
number of constraints increases, with FoCusNet showing an 8-13% accuracy boost.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注指令遵循和演绎推理，但大语言模型能否发现新知识以及如何评估这种能力仍是核心问题。

Method: 引入GEAR评估范式，通过三个指标自动评分假设集：一致性（假设能解释观察）、泛化性（假设能对未见输入做出有意义的预测）、多样性（假设集覆盖不同的预测和模式）。

Result: 在四个溯因推理基准测试的1500个问题上评估了9个大语言模型，生成了超过50,000个候选假设，揭示了被传统评估方法掩盖的模型差异。

Conclusion: GEAR提供了一个原则性框架来评估溯因推理，并为大语言模型提供无需标注、可扩展的训练信号，帮助生成更多样化和可靠的假设。

Abstract: Since the advent of large language models (LLMs), research has focused on
instruction following and deductive reasoning. A central question remains: can
these models discover new knowledge, and how can we evaluate this ability? We
address this by studying abductive reasoning-the generation of plausible
hypotheses to explain observations-and introduce GEAR (General Evaluation for
Abductive Reasoning), a general-purpose, fully automated, transparent, and
label-free evaluation paradigm. GEAR scores hypothesis sets by three metrics:
consistency (each hypothesis explains the observations), generalizability
(consistent hypotheses make meaningful predictions on unseen inputs), and
diversity (the set covers distinct predictions and patterns). Built this way,
GEAR is scalable (no human gold answers), reliable (deterministic scoring
aligned with classical abduction), and open-ended (scores improve only when
models produce new plausible hypotheses, unlike static benchmarks that saturate
once accuracy is high). Using GEAR, we conduct a fine-grained study of nine
LLMs on four abduction benchmarks with 1,500 problems, generating over 50,000
candidate hypotheses and revealing model differences obscured by gold-answer or
purely human evaluations. We further propose a momentum-based curriculum that
adjusts GEAR-derived training data by learning velocity: it starts with what
the model learns quickly and shifts toward harder objectives such as generating
diverse hypotheses once the model is confident on foundational objectives.
Without gold-label supervision, this strategy improves all GEAR objectives and
these gains transfer to established abductive reasoning benchmarks. Taken
together, GEAR provides a principled framework that evaluates abduction and
supplies label-free, scalable training signals that help LLMs produce more
diverse and reliable hypotheses.

Motivation: 现有情感分析模型存在固有的社会偏见，这些偏见在现实应用中可能造成危害。构建自然、语言丰富且多样化的测试句子集成本高昂，需要领域专家和众包。

Method: 使用大语言模型进行可控的测试句子生成，通过最小化规范要求生成高质量测试用例，提供更好的语言变异性和多样性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能够为情感分析模型生成具有高语言变异性和多样性的测试句子，相比基础提示方法提供更好的测试覆盖，即使对于先前未见过的偏见也有效。

Conclusion: BTC-SAM框架通过利用大语言模型，能够高效生成高质量偏见测试用例，为情感分析模型的偏见检测提供了更全面和有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Sentiment Analysis (SA) models harbor inherent social biases that can be
harmful in real-world applications. These biases are identified by examining
the output of SA models for sentences that only vary in the identity groups of
the subjects. Constructing natural, linguistically rich, relevant, and diverse
sets of sentences that provide sufficient coverage over the domain is
expensive, especially when addressing a wide range of biases: it requires
domain experts and/or crowd-sourcing. In this paper, we present a novel bias
testing framework, BTC-SAM, which generates high-quality test cases for bias
testing in SA models with minimal specification using Large Language Models
(LLMs) for the controllable generation of test sentences. Our experiments show
that relying on LLMs can provide high linguistic variation and diversity in the
test sentences, thereby offering better test coverage compared to base
prompting methods even for previously unseen biases.

Motivation: 大语言模型在道德推理方面面临泛化挑战，因为模型擅长捕捉分布语义，而道德推理在语用层面运作，两者存在根本差异。

Method: 提出基于道德基础理论的语用推理方法，在每一步利用上下文信息来弥合语用差距，引导LLMs将道德基础与道德推理目标相连接。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法显著增强了大语言模型在道德推理中的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法为未来基于道德基础理论的研究奠定了基础，为解决LLMs在道德推理中的泛化问题提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Moral reasoning has emerged as a promising research direction for Large
Language Models (LLMs), yet achieving generalization remains a central
challenge. From a linguistic standpoint, this difficulty arises because LLMs
are adept at capturing distributional semantics, which fundamentally differs
from the morals which operate at the pragmatic level. This paper investigates
how LLMs can achieve generalized moral reasoning despite their reliance on
distributional semantics. We propose pragmatic inference methods grounded in
moral foundations theory, which leverage contextual information at each step to
bridge the pragmatic gap and guide LLMs in connecting moral foundations with
moral reasoning objectives. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach
significantly enhances LLMs' generalization in moral reasoning, providing a
foundation for future research grounded in moral foundations theory.

Motivation: 现有提示优化方法主要关注点准确率，很少考虑改写不变性和搜索稳定性，导致自动生成的提示词对小的语义保持改写非常敏感，性能波动大。

Conclusion: 通过最小化文本锐度，TARE框架能够生成对语义改写更鲁棒的提示词，解决了现有提示优化方法的脆弱性问题，在保持准确率的同时提高了稳定性。

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) hinges on carefully
engineered prompts. However, prevailing prompt optimization methods, ranging
from heuristic edits and reinforcement learning to evolutionary search,
primarily target point-wise accuracy. They seldom enforce paraphrase invariance
or searching stability, and therefore cannot remedy this brittleness in
practice. Automated prompt search remains brittle: small, semantically
preserving paraphrases often cause large performance swings. We identify this
brittleness as the textual sharpness of the prompt landscape. In this work, we
provide the first formal treatment of textual sharpness in the discrete,
semantic space of prompts, together with an operational robustness criterion
over a semantic neighborhood; the design is black-box or API-only, requiring no
gradients to update the model's parameters. Then we introduce TARE (Textual
Sharpness-Aware Evolving), a derivative-free framework that alternates between
an inner, sampling-based adversarial search that stresses a prompt with hard
paraphrases and an outer, robust selection that prefers candidates whose
neighborhoods remain strong. We further propose ATARE, which learns anisotropic
weights to shape the semantic neighborhood and adapts its radius over time to
balance exploration and fidelity. Diverse tasks evaluate our methods, whose
design for minimizing textual sharpness gap leads to prompts that preserve
accuracy under paraphrasing, outperforming accuracy-only prompt search while
remaining computationally practical.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大模型比较主要关注宏观统计指标，缺乏对模型推理过程差异的深入分析，需要一种能够揭示不同模型思维特征的方法。

Method: 使用生成式语言模型比较两个大模型的推理轨迹，识别其独特特征，基于经验分布建模这些特征如何预测推理轨迹的来源模型，通过迭代过程构建人类可读的分类法。

Result: 在12个开源大模型上应用LOT，成功识别出系统性的思维差异，在区分不同规模、基础模型家族或目标领域的模型时达到80-100%的准确率；案例研究表明，将小模型推理风格与大模型对齐可提升GPQA准确率3.3-5.7%。

Conclusion: LOT方法能够有效揭示大模型的思维差异，不仅提供分类能力，还通过自然语言分类法给出定性解释，为理解和改进模型推理提供了新视角。

Abstract: Current comparisons of large reasoning models (LRMs) focus on macro-level
statistics such as task accuracy or reasoning length. Whether different LRMs
reason differently remains an open question. To address this gap, we introduce
the LLM-proposed Open Taxonomy (LOT), a classification method that uses a
generative language model to compare reasoning traces from two LRMs and
articulate their distinctive features in words. LOT then models how these
features predict the source LRM of a reasoning trace based on their empirical
distributions across LRM outputs. Iterating this process over a dataset of
reasoning traces yields a human-readable taxonomy that characterizes how models
think. We apply LOT to compare the reasoning of 12 open-source LRMs on tasks in
math, science, and coding. LOT identifies systematic differences in their
thoughts, achieving 80-100% accuracy in distinguishing reasoning traces from
LRMs that differ in scale, base model family, or objective domain. Beyond
classification, LOT's natural-language taxonomy provides qualitative
explanations of how LRMs think differently. Finally, in a case study, we link
the reasoning differences to performance: aligning the reasoning style of
smaller Qwen3 models with that of the largest Qwen3 during test time improves
their accuracy on GPQA by 3.3-5.7%.

TL;DR: 提出了基于任务子空间对数归因(TSLA)的新框架，识别专门负责任务识别(TR)和任务学习(TL)的注意力头，揭示了它们在上下文学习中的不同但互补的作用机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 调和关于大语言模型上下文学习机制的两个主要观点：注意力头的组件级分析和ICL整体分解为任务识别与任务学习，以提供统一且可解释的机制理解。

Method: 使用TSLA框架识别TR和TL专用注意力头，通过相关性分析、消融实验、输入扰动以及带有隐藏状态几何分析的引导实验来验证其作用。

Result: 发现TR头通过将隐藏状态与任务子空间对齐来促进任务识别，而TL头在子空间内旋转隐藏状态朝向正确标签以促进预测，两者独立且有效捕获ICL的TR和TL组件。

Conclusion: 该框架为大型语言模型如何在不同任务和设置中执行上下文学习提供了统一且可解释的机制解释，能够调和先前关于ICL机制的研究发现。

Abstract: We investigate the mechanistic underpinnings of in-context learning (ICL) in
large language models by reconciling two dominant perspectives: the
component-level analysis of attention heads and the holistic decomposition of
ICL into Task Recognition (TR) and Task Learning (TL). We propose a novel
framework based on Task Subspace Logit Attribution (TSLA) to identify attention
heads specialized in TR and TL, and demonstrate their distinct yet
complementary roles. Through correlation analysis, ablation studies, and input
perturbations, we show that the identified TR and TL heads independently and
effectively capture the TR and TL components of ICL. Using steering experiments
with geometric analysis of hidden states, we reveal that TR heads promote task
recognition by aligning hidden states with the task subspace, while TL heads
rotate hidden states within the subspace toward the correct label to facilitate
prediction. We further show how previous findings on ICL mechanisms, including
induction heads and task vectors, can be reconciled with our
attention-head-level analysis of the TR-TL decomposition. Our framework thus
provides a unified and interpretable account of how large language models
execute ICL across diverse tasks and settings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出学习任务向量(LTVs)作为比提取任务向量更准确灵活的方法，并通过系统分析揭示了任务向量在Transformer中的工作机制，发现其主要通过注意力头OV电路发挥作用，且传播过程基本呈线性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究通常从模型输出或隐藏状态提取任务向量，方法繁琐且不透明，很少阐明任务向量如何影响计算机制。本文旨在解决这两个局限性。

Method: 直接训练学习任务向量(LTVs)，并通过系统分析研究任务向量的机制作用，包括在低层次分析注意力头OV电路，在高层次分析任务向量在Transformer中的传播特性。

Result: LTVs在准确性上优于提取的任务向量，具有更好的灵活性；任务向量主要通过注意力头OV电路发挥作用，其中少数"关键头"起决定性作用；尽管Transformer存在非线性，但任务向量传播基本呈线性。

Conclusion: LTVs不仅提供了获取有效任务向量的实用方法，还为理解上下文学习机制提供了原则性视角。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can perform new tasks from in-context
demonstrations, a phenomenon known as in-context learning (ICL). Recent work
suggests that these demonstrations are compressed into task vectors (TVs),
compact task representations that LLMs exploit for predictions. However, prior
studies typically extract TVs from model outputs or hidden states using
cumbersome and opaque methods, and they rarely elucidate the mechanisms by
which TVs influence computation. In this work, we address both limitations.
First, we propose directly training Learned Task Vectors (LTVs), which surpass
extracted TVs in accuracy and exhibit superior flexibility-acting effectively
at arbitrary layers, positions, and even with ICL prompts. Second, through
systematic analysis, we investigate the mechanistic role of TVs, showing that
at the low level they steer predictions primarily through attention-head OV
circuits, with a small subset of "key heads" most decisive. At a higher level,
we find that despite Transformer nonlinearities, TV propagation is largely
linear: early TVs are rotated toward task-relevant subspaces to improve logits
of relevant labels, while later TVs are predominantly scaled in magnitude.
Taken together, LTVs not only provide a practical approach for obtaining
effective TVs but also offer a principled lens into the mechanistic foundations
of ICL.

TL;DR: RAG-GUI是一个轻量级视觉语言模型，通过在推理时利用网络教程来增强GUI代理的性能，采用监督微调和自引导拒绝采样微调方法，在各种任务中表现优于基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于视觉语言模型的GUI代理在自动化复杂数字任务方面具有潜力，但在实际应用中受到训练数据稀缺和任务复杂性的限制，特别是需要处理罕见、未见场景的长尾知识。

Method: 提出RAG-GUI方法：首先通过监督微调进行预热，然后通过自引导拒绝采样微调进一步优化。该方法设计为模型无关的通用插件，可在推理时利用网络教程增强任何基于VLM的代理。

Result: 在三个不同任务上的评估显示，RAG-GUI始终优于基线代理，在两个模型尺寸上比其他推理基线高出2.6%至13.3%，表现出强大的泛化能力和实用的即插即用能力。

Conclusion: RAG-GUI通过有效利用网络教程和创新的微调策略，显著提升了GUI代理在现实场景中的性能，具有很好的通用性和实用性。

Abstract: GUI agents powered by vision-language models (VLMs) show promise in
automating complex digital tasks. However, their effectiveness in real-world
applications is often limited by scarce training data and the inherent
complexity of these tasks, which frequently require long-tailed knowledge
covering rare, unseen scenarios. We propose RAG-GUI , a lightweight VLM that
leverages web tutorials at inference time. RAG-GUI is first warm-started via
supervised finetuning (SFT) and further refined through self-guided rejection
sampling finetuning (RSF). Designed to be model-agnostic, RAG-GUI functions as
a generic plug-in that enhances any VLM-based agent. Evaluated across three
distinct tasks, it consistently outperforms baseline agents and surpasses other
inference baselines by 2.6% to 13.3% across two model sizes, demonstrating
strong generalization and practical plug-and-play capabilities in real-world
scenarios.

TL;DR: 本文提出了MedIRT框架，基于项目反应理论(IRT)来评估大型语言模型在医学应用中的表现，相比传统准确率指标能提供更稳定和细致的性能排名。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在医疗高风险应用中的使用增加，需要更可靠和准确的评估方法。传统准确率指标无法捕捉问题特征或提供主题特定见解。

Method: 使用项目反应理论(IRT)，为每个主题建立单维双参数逻辑IRT模型，联合估计LLM的潜在模型能力、问题难度和区分度，基于80个不同LLM在1,100个USMLE对齐问题上的响应数据。

Result: 发现LLM具有独特的"尖峰"能力特征，整体排名可能具有误导性。GPT-5在大多数领域表现最佳(11个中的8个)，但在社会科学和通信领域被Claude-3-opus超越，即使后者整体排名第23位。IRT还能识别有缺陷的问题。

Conclusion: 这项工作建立了一个基于心理测量学的稳健方法，对于LLM在医疗保健中的安全、有效和可信部署至关重要，并提出了整合多因素能力特征和操作指标的实用决策支持框架。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly proposed for high-stakes
medical applications, there has emerged a critical need for reliable and
accurate evaluation methodologies. Traditional accuracy metrics fail
inadequately as they neither capture question characteristics nor offer
topic-specific insights. To address this gap, we introduce \textsc{MedIRT}, a
rigorous evaluation framework grounded in Item Response Theory (IRT), the gold
standard in high-stakes educational testing. Unlike previous research relying
on archival data, we prospectively gathered fresh responses from 80 diverse
LLMs on a balanced, 1,100-question USMLE-aligned benchmark. Using one
unidimensional two-parameter logistic IRT model per topic, we estimate LLM's
latent model ability jointly with question difficulty and discrimination,
yielding more stable and nuanced performance rankings than accuracy alone.
Notably, we identify distinctive ``spiky'' ability profiles, where overall
rankings can be misleading due to highly specialized model abilities. While
\texttt{GPT-5} was the top performer in a majority of domains (8 of 11), it was
outperformed in Social Science and Communication by \texttt{Claude-3-opus},
demonstrating that even an overall 23rd-ranked model can hold the top spot for
specific competencies. Furthermore, we demonstrate IRT's utility in auditing
benchmarks by identifying flawed questions. We synthesize these findings into a
practical decision-support framework that integrates our multi-factor
competency profiles with operational metrics. This work establishes a robust,
psychometrically grounded methodology essential for the safe, effective, and
trustworthy deployment of LLMs in healthcare.

TL;DR: 提出了PET框架，通过推断用户偏好在稳定可解释的偏好簇上的动态概率分布，替代直接生成偏好列表的方法，实现更透明、公平和多样化的个性化推荐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的直接生成偏好列表方法存在个性化受限、决策过程不透明、加剧流行度偏差等问题，需要更透明和可解释的用户偏好建模方法。

Method: PET框架将任务重新定义为推断用户在稳定可解释偏好簇上的动态概率分布，应用logit-probing和生成式分类技术，实现透明的偏好学习。

Result: 在公开基准测试中，PET比直接生成基线方法在NDCG指标上提升高达40%；在真实短视频平台数据集上，在长尾内容排序方面表现优异，NDCG得分比SOTA生产模型高出7倍。

Conclusion: PET将用户画像模型从直接偏好列表生成转变为透明的分布偏好映射，为更可解释、公平和多样化的个性化系统铺平了道路。

Abstract: Understanding how user preference evolves over time is a fundamental
challenge central to modern digital ecosystems, for which Large Language Models
(LLMs) are an increasingly prominent and popular approach due to their ability
to comprehend the rich semantic context within behavioral data. A common
practice is to use LLMs to predict a user's next action by directly generating
a ranked list of preferred items. Although effective for short-term prediction,
the end-to-end generation paradigm inherently limits personalization. Its
opaque decision-making process obscures holistic user profiling and exacerbates
popularity bias. To address these limitations, we propose Preference Evolution
Tracking (PET), a framework that reframes the task as inferring a dynamic
probability distribution over a stable and interpretable lattice of preference
clusters. By applying logit-probing and generative classification techniques,
PET infers a user's preference as a probability distribution, enabling
transparent preference learning. On public benchmarks (Yelp, MovieLens), PET
improves ranking quality by up to 40% in NDCG over direct generation baselines.
On a large-scale, real-world dataset from a short-video platform, it excels at
ranking long-tail contents, significantly outperforming a SOTA production model
by 7 times in the NDCG score. Ultimately, PET transforms the user profile model
from direct preference list generation to a transparent distributional
preference mapping, paving the way for more explainable, fair, and diverse
personalization systems.

TL;DR: AceSearcher是一个合作自玩框架，通过训练单一LLM在分解者和求解者两个角色间切换，有效解决复杂推理任务中的多跳检索和推理能力限制问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的搜索增强LLM在处理复杂推理任务时存在多跳检索效果不佳和推理能力有限的问题，需要更有效的解决方案。

Method: 采用合作自玩框架，训练单一LLM交替扮演分解者（分解复杂查询）和求解者（整合检索上下文生成答案）两个角色，结合监督微调和强化学习微调。

Result: 在10个数据集的3个推理密集型任务上，AceSearcher平均精确匹配率提升7.6%。32B版本在文档级金融推理任务上达到DeepSeek-V3性能，仅使用其5%参数。小规模版本（1.5B和8B）也优于参数多9倍的现有搜索增强LLM。

Conclusion: AceSearcher在复杂推理任务中展现出卓越的效率和效果，通过合作自玩框架显著提升了搜索增强LLM的性能。

Abstract: Search-augmented LLMs often struggle with complex reasoning tasks due to
ineffective multi-hop retrieval and limited reasoning ability. We propose
AceSearcher, a cooperative self-play framework that trains a single large
language model (LLM) to alternate between two roles: a decomposer that breaks
down complex queries and a solver that integrates retrieved contexts for answer
generation. AceSearcher couples supervised fine-tuning on a diverse mixture of
search, reasoning, and decomposition tasks with reinforcement fine-tuning
optimized for final answer accuracy, eliminating the need for intermediate
annotations. Extensive experiments on three reasoning-intensive tasks across 10
datasets show that AceSearcher outperforms state-of-the-art baselines,
achieving an average exact match improvement of 7.6%. Remarkably, on
document-level finance reasoning tasks, AceSearcher-32B matches the performance
of the DeepSeek-V3 model using less than 5% of its parameters. Even at smaller
scales (1.5B and 8B), AceSearcher often surpasses existing search-augmented
LLMs with up to 9x more parameters, highlighting its exceptional efficiency and
effectiveness in tackling complex reasoning tasks. Our code will be published

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于语言表达的不确定性估计方法，通过模型使用模糊语言（如“可能”、“或许”）来表达置信度，提供了一种轻量级且符合人类交流习惯的替代方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有置信度估计方法存在实际障碍：logits通常被隐藏、多重采样计算成本高、数值化不确定性表达偏离自然交流。语言置信度提供了一种轻量级和以人为中心的替代方案。

Method: 1) 发布了首个包含人类标注置信度分数的大规模模糊表达数据集；2) 提出了轻量级映射器，以接近零成本将模糊表达转换为置信度分数；3) 系统研究了现代LLM的语言置信度表现；4) 引入了微调框架来进一步提高语言置信度的可靠性。

Result: 研究发现大多数LLM在表达可靠的语言置信度方面表现不佳，但精心设计的提示方法能够实现有竞争力的校准和区分能力。微调框架进一步提高了语言置信度的可靠性。

Conclusion: 语言置信度作为一种可扩展、高效且与人类对齐的LLM不确定性估计方法具有潜力，值得进一步探索这一有前景但研究不足的方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in high-stakes settings,
where overconfident responses can mislead users. Reliable confidence estimation
has been shown to enhance trust and task accuracy. Yet existing methods face
practical barriers: logits are often hidden, multi-sampling is computationally
expensive, and verbalized numerical uncertainty (e.g., giving a 0-100 score)
deviates from natural communication. We revisit linguistic confidence (LC),
where models express uncertainty through hedging language (e.g., probably,
might), offering a lightweight and human-centered alternative. To advance this
direction, we (1) release the first diverse, large-scale dataset of hedging
expressions with human-annotated confidence scores, and (2) propose a
lightweight mapper that converts hedges into confidence scores at near-zero
cost. Building on these resources, we (3) conduct the first systematic study of
LC across modern LLMs and QA benchmarks, revealing that while most LLMs
underperform in expressing reliable LC, carefully designed prompting achieves
competitive calibration and discriminability. Finally, we (4) introduce a
fine-tuning framework that further improves LC reliability. Taken together, our
work positions linguistic confidence as a scalable, efficient, and
human-aligned approach to LLM uncertainty estimation, and calls for deeper
exploration of this promising yet underexplored direction.

TL;DR: BeyondBench是一个避免训练数据污染的评估框架，通过算法问题生成来测试语言模型的真实推理能力，包含44个算法任务和117种变体，分为三个难度级别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基准测试存在训练数据污染问题，无法确定模型是真正推理还是仅回忆答案，需要创建新鲜且未受污染的问题来公平评估语言模型。

Method: 使用算法问题生成方法，从超过10^15个独特实例的组合空间中动态创建数学基础问题，解决方案通过数学证明确定性验证。

Result: 评估了101个语言模型，发现所有模型家族都存在一致的推理缺陷，随着问题复杂度从多项式增加到指数级，性能急剧下降。在困难套件中，最佳模型准确率仅为56.38%。

Conclusion: BeyondBench有效揭示了语言模型在复杂推理任务上的局限性，性能在没有工具使用时显著下降，证明了该框架在评估模型真实推理能力方面的价值。

Abstract: Evaluating language models fairly is becoming harder as static benchmarks
available on the internet risk contamination by training data. This makes it
unclear whether models are truly reasoning or just recalling answers. In this
paper, we introduce BeyondBench, an evaluation framework that avoids this
problem by using algorithmic problem generation. Unlike traditional benchmarks
that risk contamination from internet-scale training data, BeyondBench creates
mathematically grounded problems on the fly, ensuring each test remains fresh
and uncontaminated. Our framework covers 44 algorithmic tasks with a total of
117 variations, grouped into three difficulty levels: the Easy Suite (29 tasks)
for basic arithmetic and statistics, the Medium Suite (5 tasks, 49 variations)
for sequence patterns and reasoning, and the Hard Suite (10 tasks, 68
variations) tackling NP-complete and constraint satisfaction problems. Each
task generates problems from a combinatorial space larger than 10^15 unique
instances, with solutions verified deterministically by mathematical proofs. We
evaluated 101 language models, including 85 open-source and 16 closed-source
models, spanning sizes from 0.5B to 141B parameters and multiple quantization
schemes. Our results show consistent reasoning deficiencies across model
families, with performance degrading sharply as problem complexity increases
from polynomial to exponential. In our Hard Suite evaluations, models such as
Gemini-2.5-pro, Llama-3.3-70B, and Qwen2.5-72B achieved average accuracies of
56.38%, 26.91%, and 33.60%, respectively. Moreover, we observe that performance
drops drastically without tool usage, with GPT-5, GPT-5-mini, and GPT-5-nano
showing a decline of 16.81%, 28.05%, and 47.59% accuracy on the hard suite. Our
leaderboard is publicly available at https://ctrl-gaurav.github.io/BeyondBench/

TL;DR: ScenarioBench是一个用于评估文本到SQL和检索增强生成的基准测试，专注于合规场景，要求系统基于政策条款进行决策并提供可验证的解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到SQL或RAG基准测试缺乏对决策理由的严格验证，无法确保系统输出基于真实政策条款证据。

Method: 使用YAML场景格式，包含黄金标准包、见证轨迹、管辖条款集和规范SQL，要求系统使用条款ID进行解释，实现端到端评分。

Result: 评估器报告决策准确性、轨迹质量、检索效果、SQL正确性、政策覆盖率、延迟和解释幻觉率，并通过标准化场景难度指数聚合结果。

Conclusion: 相比现有基准，ScenarioBench在严格基础和不可偷看规则下将每个决策与条款级证据绑定，在明确时间预算下将收益转向解释质量。

Abstract: ScenarioBench is a policy-grounded, trace-aware benchmark for evaluating
Text-to-SQL and retrieval-augmented generation in compliance contexts. Each
YAML scenario includes a no-peek gold-standard package with the expected
decision, a minimal witness trace, the governing clause set, and the canonical
SQL, enabling end-to-end scoring of both what a system decides and why. Systems
must justify outputs using clause IDs from the same policy canon, making
explanations falsifiable and audit-ready. The evaluator reports decision
accuracy, trace quality (completeness, correctness, order), retrieval
effectiveness, SQL correctness via result-set equivalence, policy coverage,
latency, and an explanation-hallucination rate. A normalized Scenario
Difficulty Index (SDI) and a budgeted variant (SDI-R) aggregate results while
accounting for retrieval difficulty and time. Compared with prior Text-to-SQL
or KILT/RAG benchmarks, ScenarioBench ties each decision to clause-level
evidence under strict grounding and no-peek rules, shifting gains toward
justification quality under explicit time budgets.

Abstract: Identifying human morals and values embedded in language is essential to
empirical studies of communication. However, researchers often face substantial
difficulty navigating the diversity of theoretical frameworks and data

of resources for generalizable classification of human morals and values,
consisting of (1) 16 labeled datasets and benchmarking results from four
theoretically-grounded frameworks; (2) a lightweight LLM prompting strategy
that outperforms fine-tuned models across multiple domains and frameworks; and
(3) a new application that helps evaluate psychological surveys. In practice,
we specifically recommend a classification strategy, all@once, that scores all
related concepts simultaneously, resembling the well-known multi-label
classifier chain. The data and methods in MoVa can facilitate many fine-grained
interpretations of human and machine communication, with potential implications
for the alignment of machine behavior.

the tasks based on the datasets provided by the competition organizers. We
employed Qwen3-14B with LoRA fine-tuning and model fusion, and utilized a base
model integrated with multiple LoRA adapters during inference. Specifically, in
the competition, we used three distinct LoRA adapters to handle tool calling,
response generation with tool call results, and response generation without

Motivation: 现有研究通常孤立地研究提示优化和微调这两种提升LLM性能的方法，但它们具有互补性：前者通过显式自然语言，后者通过隐式参数更新。两者协同潜力尚未充分探索。

Method: 引入两个神经网络分别生成提示和参数，共享底层编码层实现知识共享。设计监督正则化损失来有效训练框架，解决离散提示学习和连续参数优化的混合优化问题。

Conclusion: MetaTuner框架成功展示了提示优化和微调的协同潜力，通过联合优化方法显著提升了LLM性能。

Abstract: Prompt optimization and fine-tuning are two major approaches to improve the
performance of Large Language Models (LLMs). They enhance the capabilities of
LLMs from complementary perspectives: the former through explicit natural
language, and the latter through implicit parameter updates. However, prior
work has typically studied them in isolation, leaving their synergistic
potential largely underexplored. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we
introduce MetaTuner, a novel framework that jointly integrates prompt
optimization and fine-tuning for LLM training. Specifically, we introduce two
neural networks to generate prompts and parameters, respectively, while
allowing them to share a common bottom encoding layer to enable knowledge
sharing. By the guidance of the final supervised signals, our framework is
optimized to discover the optimal combinations between the prompts and
parameters. Given that prompt learning involves discrete optimization while
fine-tuning operates in a continuous parameter space, we design a supervised
regularization loss to train our framework effectively. Extensive experiments
across diverse benchmarks show that our method consistently outperforms the
baselines.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents excel at multi-step, tool-augmented tasks.
However, smart homes introduce distinct challenges, requiring agents to handle
latent user intents, temporal dependencies, device constraints, scheduling, and
more. The main bottlenecks for developing smart home agents with such
capabilities include the lack of a realistic simulation environment where
agents can interact with devices and observe the results, as well as a
challenging benchmark to evaluate them. To address this, we introduce
$\textbf{SimuHome}$, a time-accelerated home environment that simulates smart
devices, supports API calls, and reflects changes in environmental variables.
By building the simulator on the Matter protocol (the global industry standard
for smart home communication), SimuHome provides a high-fidelity environment,
and agents validated in SimuHome can be deployed on real Matter-compliant
devices with minimal adaptation. We provide a challenging benchmark of 600
episodes across twelve user query types that require the aforementioned
capabilities. Our evaluation of 11 agents under a unified ReAct framework
reveals that while models perform well on simple tasks, they struggle with
latent intent inference, state verification, and especially temporal
scheduling. Even the top-performing model, GPT-4.1, reaches only 54% success
rate. These findings highlight a critical need for methods that can reliably
verify the current state via tools before acting and coordinate time-dependent
actions.

TL;DR: GIRCSE是一种利用自回归生成迭代优化语义表示的框架，通过对比目标生成软标记序列，在MTEB基准测试中超越了现有LLM嵌入方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的嵌入方法通常采用编码器范式，将LLM视为静态特征提取器，忽视了其核心的生成能力

Method: 提出GIRCSE框架，利用自回归生成迭代优化语义表示，采用迭代对比优化目标指导生成过程

Result: 在MTEB基准测试和指令跟随任务中表现优于现有LLM嵌入基线，并展现出测试时扩展特性

Conclusion: 生成式迭代优化为表示学习建立了新范式

Abstract: Existing large language model (LLM)-based embeddings typically adopt an
encoder-only paradigm, treating LLMs as static feature extractors and
overlooking their core generative strengths. We introduce GIRCSE (Generative
Iterative Refinement for Contrastive Sentence Embeddings), a novel framework
that leverages autoregressive generation to iteratively refine semantic
representations. By producing sequences of soft tokens optimized under
contrastive objective, GIRCSE captures latent concepts and implicit semantics
that encoder-only methods often miss. To guide this process, we propose an
Iterative Contrastive Refinement (ICR) objective that encourages each
refinement step to yield better representations. Extensive experiments show
that GIRCSE outperforms strong LLM-based embedding baselines on the MTEB
benchmark and instruction-following tasks. Moreover, GIRCSE exhibits an
emergent test-time scaling property: generating more tokens at inference
steadily improves embedding quality. Our results establish generative iterative
refinement as a new paradigm for representation learning.

Abstract: Grounded theory offers deep insights from qualitative data, but its reliance
on expert-intensive manual coding presents a major scalability bottleneck.
Current computational tools stop short of true automation, keeping researchers
firmly in the loop. We introduce LOGOS, a novel, end-to-end framework that
fully automates the grounded theory workflow, transforming raw text into a
structured, hierarchical theory. LOGOS integrates LLM-driven coding, semantic
clustering, graph reasoning, and a novel iterative refinement process to build
highly reusable codebooks. To ensure fair comparison, we also introduce a
principled 5-dimensional metric and a train-test split protocol for
standardized, unbiased evaluation. Across five diverse corpora, LOGOS
consistently outperforms strong baselines and achieves a remarkable $88.2\%$
alignment with an expert-developed schema on a complex dataset. LOGOS
demonstrates a powerful new path to democratize and scale qualitative research
without sacrificing theoretical nuance.

TL;DR: 本文分析了扩散大语言模型(dLLMs)在越狱攻击中的脆弱性，揭示了贪婪重掩码策略的有害偏见和去噪路径依赖现象，并提出了DiffuGuard防御框架，显著降低了攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散大语言模型(dLLMs)的迭代并行生成机制带来了与自回归LLMs根本不同的安全漏洞，需要深入分析其脆弱性并开发有效的防御方法。

Method: 从两个维度分析dLLM脆弱性：步内动态和步间动态；提出DiffuGuard防御框架，包含随机退火重掩码和块级审计修复两个阶段。

Result: 实验显示DiffuGuard在四个dLLM上表现优异，将六种不同越狱方法的攻击成功率从47.9%降至14.7%，同时保持模型效用和效率。

Conclusion: dLLMs具有显著的内在安全潜力，DiffuGuard通过训练无关的防御框架有效解决了其安全漏洞，为dLLM安全提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) introduces
unprecedented vulnerabilities that are fundamentally distinct from
Autoregressive LLMs, stemming from their iterative and parallel generation
mechanisms. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth analysis of dLLM
vulnerabilities to jailbreak attacks across two distinct dimensions: intra-step
and inter-step dynamics. Experimental results reveal a harmful bias inherent in
the standard greedy remasking strategy and identify a critical phenomenon we
term Denoising-path Dependence, where the safety of early-stage tokens
decisively influences the final output. These findings also indicate that while
current decoding strategies constitute a significant vulnerability, dLLMs
possess a substantial intrinsic safety potential. To unlock this potential, we
propose DiffuGuard, a training-free defense framework that addresses
vulnerabilities through a dual-stage approach: Stochastic Annealing Remasking
dynamically introduces controlled randomness to mitigate greedy selection bias,
while Block-level Audit and Repair exploits internal model representations for
autonomous risk detection and guided correction. Comprehensive experiments on
four dLLMs demonstrate DiffuGuard's exceptional effectiveness, reducing Attack
Success Rate against six diverse jailbreak methods from 47.9% to 14.7% while
preserving model utility and efficiency. Our code is available at:

Conclusion: 该工作为大规模科学基准测试提供了一条实用路径，证明了通过智能体系统实现TQA到MMQA自动转换的可行性，并显著提升了多模态问答对的质量。

Abstract: High-quality, multi-modal benchmarks are crucial for advancing scientific
reasoning in large models yet their manual creation is costly and unscalable.
To address this bottleneck, we explore the potential for transforming Text-Only
QA Pairs (TQAs) into high-quality Multi-Modal QA Pairs (MMQAs), which include
three parts: 1) Task Definition \& Evaluation Rubric: We develop a TQA-to-MMQA
framework and establish a comprehensive, multi-dimensional MMQA quality rubric
that provides principles for the transformation. 2) Benchmark Construction:
Then we construct two extensive benchmarks to rigorously evaluate
state-of-the-art generation \& understanding models on the distinct tasks of
MMQA generation \& MMQA quality evaluation. 3) Preliminary Solution: We develop
an agentic system (Q-Mirror), which operationalizes our framework by
integrating MMQA generation and evaluation into a closed loop for iterative
refinement. Our experiments show that while state-of-the-art models can
generate MMQAs, their outputs still leave substantial gaps, underscoring the
need for reliable evaluation. We further demonstrate that top-tier
understanding models align closely with human judgment in MMQA quality
assessment. Leveraging both insights, the Q-Mirror agent raises average scores
from 78.90 to 85.22 and pass rates from 72\% to 95\%, offering a practical path
to large-scale scientific benchmarks.

Motivation: 理解LLMs价值观表达的两种方式（内在表达和提示表达）的底层机制差异，这对价值观对齐和角色引导应用至关重要。

Method: 使用两种方法分析机制：(1) 价值观向量 - 从残差流中提取代表价值观机制的特征方向；(2) 价值观神经元 - 识别MLP中参与价值观表达的神经元。

Result: 发现内在和提示价值观机制部分共享诱导价值观表达的关键组件，但也各有独特元素，导致不同的可操控性（提示>内在）和响应多样性（内在>提示）。

Conclusion: 内在机制独特组件促进词汇多样性，提示机制独特组件主要强化指令跟随能力，甚至在越狱等远程任务中也发挥作用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can express different values in two distinct
ways: (1) intrinsic expression, reflecting the model's inherent values learned
during training, and (2) prompted expression, elicited by explicit prompts.
Given their widespread use in value alignment and persona steering, it is
paramount to clearly understand their underlying mechanisms, particularly
whether they mostly overlap (as one might expect) or rely on substantially
different mechanisms, but this remains largely understudied. We analyze this at
the mechanistic level using two approaches: (1) value vectors, feature
directions representing value mechanisms extracted from the residual stream,
and (2) value neurons, MLP neurons that contribute to value expressions. We
demonstrate that intrinsic and prompted value mechanisms partly share common
components that are crucial for inducing value expression, but also possess
unique elements that manifest in different ways. As a result, these mechanisms
lead to different degrees of value steerability (prompted > intrinsic) and
response diversity (intrinsic > prompted). In particular, components unique to
the intrinsic mechanism seem to promote lexical diversity in responses, whereas
those specific to the prompted mechanism primarily strengthen instruction
following, taking effect even in distant tasks like jailbreaking.

Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have driven major advances in
language understanding, marking a significant step toward artificial general
intelligence (AGI). With increasing demands for higher-level semantics and
cross-modal fusion, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have emerged,
integrating diverse information sources (e.g., text, vision, and audio) to
enhance modeling and reasoning in complex scenarios. In AI for Science,
multimodal emotion recognition and reasoning has become a rapidly growing
frontier. While LLMs and MLLMs have achieved notable progress in this area, the
field still lacks a systematic review that consolidates recent developments. To
address this gap, this paper provides a comprehensive survey of LLMs and MLLMs
for emotion recognition and reasoning, covering model architectures, datasets,
and performance benchmarks. We further highlight key challenges and outline
future research directions, aiming to offer researchers both an authoritative
reference and practical insights for advancing this domain. To the best of our
knowledge, this paper is the first attempt to comprehensively survey the
intersection of MLLMs with multimodal emotion recognition and reasoning. The

TL;DR: 提出Speculative Verification方法，通过动态预测推测精度和调整验证长度来优化推测解码，提高LLM推理效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推测解码在推测精度低时，因拒绝令牌的开销抵消了收益，特别是在大批量设置下效率受限

Method: 引入一个与草稿模型大小相似的辅助模型来估计草稿模型和目标模型分布的对齐程度，动态调整验证长度

Result: 在9种模型组合和不同批量大小下，SV始终优于标准推测解码和目标模型解码，最高提升2倍性能，大批量设置下平均加速1.4倍

Conclusion: SV方法具有鲁棒性、可扩展性和实用价值，无需修改现有模型即可显著提升LLM推理效率

Abstract: LLMs have low GPU efficiency and high latency due to autoregressive decoding.
Speculative decoding (SD) mitigates this using a small draft model to
speculatively generate multiple tokens, which are then verified in parallel by
a target model. However, when speculation accuracy is low, the overhead from
rejected tokens can offset the benefits, limiting SD's effectiveness,
especially at large batch sizes. To address this, we propose Speculative
Verification (SV), an efficient augmentation to SD that dynamically predicts
speculation accuracy and adapts the verification length to maximize throughput.
SV introduces a companion model - a small auxiliary model similar in size to
the draft model - to estimate the alignment between draft and target model
distributions. By maximizing the information gain from quantifying this
alignment, SV refines verification decisions, reducing wasted computation on
rejected tokens and improving decoding efficiency. Moreover, SV requires no
modifications to the draft or target models and is compatible with existing SD
variants. We extensively evaluated SV on publicly available LLMs across three
NLP tasks using nine combinations of draft, companion, and target models,
including 13B-72B target models and three types of variations: base (no
finetuning), instruction-tuned, and task fine-tuned. Across all experiments and
batch sizes (4-80), SV consistently outperforms both SD and standard decoding
with the target model. It improves SD performance by up to 2$\times$, with an
average speedup of 1.4 $\times$ in large-batch settings (batch sizes 32-80).
These results demonstrate SV's robustness, scalability, and practical utility
for efficient LLM inference.

Motivation: 多语言大语言模型在非主导语言上的性能和跨语言对齐表现不佳，现有的大规模多语言语料微调方法往往导致对齐不精确和知识迁移不理想

Method: 两阶段框架：第一阶段通过多语言语义对齐和语言特征整合来对齐多语言表示；第二阶段通过多语言指令微调来激发LLMs的多语言能力

Result: 实验结果表明该方法增强了LLMs的多语言通用能力和跨语言生成能力，分析显示AlignX使多语言表示更接近并改善了跨语言对齐

Conclusion: AlignX能有效弥合多语言性能差距，提升预训练LLMs在多语言任务上的表现

Abstract: Multilingual large language models (LLMs) possess impressive multilingual
understanding and generation capabilities. However, their performance and
cross-lingual alignment often lag for non-dominant languages. A common solution
is to fine-tune LLMs on large-scale and more balanced multilingual corpus, but
such approaches often lead to imprecise alignment and suboptimal knowledge
transfer, struggling with limited improvements across languages. In this paper,
we propose AlignX to bridge the multilingual performance gap, which is a
two-stage representation-level framework for enhancing multilingual performance
of pre-trained LLMs. In the first stage, we align multilingual representations
with multilingual semantic alignment and language feature integration. In the
second stage, we stimulate the multilingual capability of LLMs via multilingual
instruction fine-tuning. Experimental results on several pre-trained LLMs
demonstrate that our approach enhances LLMs' multilingual general and
cross-lingual generation capability. Further analysis indicates that AlignX
brings the multilingual representations closer and improves the cross-lingual
alignment.

TL;DR: 研究在数据受限环境下，通过文本简化增强和复杂度排序的课程学习对语言模型预训练的影响，发现简化数据能提升性能，且不同规模模型适合不同的数据排序策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数语言模型预训练研究关注大数据集，而在数据受限环境下，训练数据顺序和包含相同文本的替代版本的影响尚未充分探索。

Method: 基于平行语料库（人工撰写段落与LLM简化版本对齐），测试四种数据调度策略：重复暴露、低到高复杂度、高到低、交错排序，通过微调和零样本性能评估表示质量。

Result: 添加简化数据相比重复暴露基线能改善微调和零样本性能；较小模型从低到高复杂度排序中受益，而较大模型在交错排序下表现更好。

Conclusion: 在数据受限的预训练中，文本简化增强和复杂度排序的课程学习能有效提升模型性能，但最优策略取决于模型规模。

Abstract: Most studies on language model pretraining focus on large datasets, leaving
open questions about optimization in data-constrained settings. In such
settings, the effects of training data order and of including alternative
versions of the same text remain underexplored. We address this by studying
curriculum learning in pretraining, focusing on text-complexity ordering and
data augmentation via simplification. We ask: (1) Does simplifying texts
enhance representation quality more than reusing the original data? and (2)
Does ordering data by text complexity yield better representations? To answer,
we build on a pair of parallel corpora where human-written paragraphs are
aligned with LLM-simplified variants, and test four data schedules: repeated
exposure, low-to-high complexity, high-to-low, and interleaved. We analyze
models' representation quality from a sample efficiency perspective via
fine-tuning, as well as its zero-shot performance on linguistic knowledge,
entity tracking, world knowledge, and commonsense reasoning. Our findings show
that adding simplified data improves fine-tuning and zero-shot performance over
a repeated-exposure baseline: smaller models benefit from low-to-high
complexity, while larger models perform better with interleaved ordering.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现当前大语言模型开发只有预训练和后训练两阶段，缺少中间阶段。识别出三个关键挑战：推理步骤过多导致训练效率低、忽视token熵分布不平衡、token信息利用不足。

Method: 提出RMT框架，包含：1) 动态token预算机制限制不必要推理步骤；2) 课程自适应采样方法实现从易到难的渐进学习；3) 结合强化学习和下一token预测的双训练策略。

Result: 在语言建模中相比最先进方法性能提升高达+64.91%，推理长度仅需21%。强化中间训练获得的检查点对后续后训练也有益，在数学领域提升达+18.76%。

Conclusion: 强化中间训练是大语言模型开发中一个有效且必要的中间阶段，RMT框架通过高效、自适应和统一的训练方法显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: The development of state-of-the-art large language models is commonly
understood as a two-stage process involving pre-training and post-training. We
point out the need for an additional intermediate stage called reinforcement
mid-training with potential for strong performance gains. In this paper, we
formally define the problem and identify three key challenges: (1) inefficient
training due to excessive reasoning steps, (2) disregard of the imbalanced
token entropy distribution, and (3) underutilization of token information. To
address these challenges, we propose RMT, a framework for efficient, adaptive,
and unified reinforcement mid-training with various innovative components. In
particular, we first introduce a dynamic token budget mechanism that constrains
unnecessary reasoning steps and mitigates model overthinking. Next, we design a
curriculum-based adaptive sampling method that fosters a progressive learning
trajectory from easy to hard tokens. Finally, we present a dual training
strategy that combines reinforcement learning with next-token prediction,
ensuring targeted learning on key tokens and full exploitation of all token
information. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of RMT over
state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to +64.91% performance improvement with
only 21% of the reasoning length in language modeling. We also show that
checkpoints obtained after reinforcement mid-training can benefit the
subsequent post-training, yielding up to +18.76% improvement in the
mathematical domain.

Conclusion: 挑战了LLM在此领域优越性的普遍认知，为评估有害性度量提供了可靠基准。

Abstract: The alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human values is critical
for their safe deployment, yet jailbreak attacks can subvert this alignment to
elicit harmful outputs from LLMs. In recent years, a proliferation of jailbreak
attacks has emerged, accompanied by diverse metrics and judges to assess the
harmfulness of the LLM outputs. However, the absence of a systematic benchmark
to assess the quality and effectiveness of these metrics and judges undermines
the credibility of the reported jailbreak effectiveness and other risks. To
address this gap, we introduce HarmMetric Eval, a comprehensive benchmark
designed to support both overall and fine-grained evaluation of harmfulness
metrics and judges. Our benchmark includes a high-quality dataset of
representative harmful prompts paired with diverse harmful and non-harmful
model responses, alongside a flexible scoring mechanism compatible with various
metrics and judges. With HarmMetric Eval, our extensive experiments uncover a
surprising result: two conventional metrics--METEOR and ROUGE-1--outperform
LLM-based judges in evaluating the harmfulness of model responses, challenging
prevailing beliefs about LLMs' superiority in this domain. Our dataset is
publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/qusgo/HarmMetric_Eval,

Abstract: We introduce LLaDA-MoE, a large language diffusion model with the
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, trained from scratch on approximately
20T tokens. LLaDA-MoE achieves competitive performance with significantly
reduced computational overhead by maintaining a 7B-parameter capacity while
activating only 1.4B parameters during inference. Our empirical evaluation
reveals that LLaDA-MoE achieves state-of-the-art performance among diffusion
language models with larger parameters, surpassing previous diffusion language
models LLaDA, LLaDA 1.5, and Dream across multiple benchmarks. The
instruct-tuned model LLaDA-MoE-7B-A1B-Instruct demonstrates capabilities
comparable to Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct in knowledge understanding, code generation,
mathematical reasoning, agent and alignment tasks, despite using fewer active
parameters. Our results show that integrating a sparse MoE architecture into
the training objective of masked diffusion language models still brings out
MoE's strengths under efficient inference with few active parameters, and opens
ample room for further exploration of diffusion language models. LLaDA-MoE
models are available at Huggingface.

Cognition-Domain-Task (CDT) framework, which comprehensively measures a model's
capabilities across three dimensions. We expand the scope of model capability
definitions at the cognitive level by incorporating the Cattell-Horn-Carroll
cognitive theory, refining the categorization of model capabilities. We apply
CDT in two directions: dataset capability evaluation and data selection.
Experiments show that our capability metrics correlate well with downstream
performance and can support effective dataset analysis and construction. The
experiments on data selection also show significant improvements in both
general and specific benchmarks, achieving scores of 44.3 and 45.4, with an
increase of 1.6 and 2.2 points over the baselines, respectively. These results
validate the effectiveness and practicality of CDT. Source code and models are
available at https://github.com/Alessa-mo/CDT.

### [496] [Alternatives To Next Token Prediction In Text Generation -- A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24435)
*Charlie Wyatt,Aditya Joshi,Flora Salim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本调查系统梳理了下一代语言模型的五种替代范式，旨在解决NTP在长期规划、错误累积和计算效率方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NTP范式虽然推动了LLM的成功，但也带来了长期规划能力差、错误累积和计算效率低等根本性缺陷，需要探索新的替代方案。

Method: 将替代方法分为五类：多令牌预测、先规划后生成、潜在推理、连续生成方法以及非Transformer架构。

Result: 建立了一个完整的分类体系，为研究超越令牌级生成局限性的新模型提供了系统指导。

Conclusion: 通过系统分类和综合分析，为开发解决NTP局限性的变革性NLP模型提供了清晰的研究路线图。

Abstract: The paradigm of Next Token Prediction (NTP) has driven the unprecedented
success of Large Language Models (LLMs), but is also the source of their most
persistent weaknesses such as poor long-term planning, error accumulation, and
computational inefficiency. Acknowledging the growing interest in exploring
alternatives to NTP, the survey describes the emerging ecosystem of
alternatives to NTP. We categorise these approaches into five main families:
(1) Multi-Token Prediction, which targets a block of future tokens instead of a
single one; (2) Plan-then-Generate, where a global, high-level plan is created
upfront to guide token-level decoding; (3) Latent Reasoning, which shifts the
autoregressive process itself into a continuous latent space; (4) Continuous
Generation Approaches, which replace sequential generation with iterative,
parallel refinement through diffusion, flow matching, or energy-based methods;
and (5) Non-Transformer Architectures, which sidestep NTP through their
inherent model structure. By synthesizing insights across these methods, this
survey offers a taxonomy to guide research into models that address the known
limitations of token-level generation to develop new transformative models for
natural language processing.

*Taisei Yamamoto,Ryoma Kumon,Danushka Bollegala,Hitomi Yanaka*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了SOBACO基准来评估LLMs中的社会偏见和文化常识，发现去偏见方法会显著降低文化常识任务的性能（准确率下降高达75%）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有去偏见方法主要评估对一般语言理解能力的影响，但文化常识与社会偏见密切相关，且去偏见对文化常识的影响尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 提出SOBACO基准，以统一格式评估日语LLMs的社会偏见和文化常识，并评估多种去偏见方法对文化常识的影响。

Result: 去偏见方法显著降低了LLMs在文化常识任务上的性能，准确率下降高达75%。

Conclusion: 开发去偏见方法时需要权衡文化常识，以提升LLMs的公平性和实用性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit social biases, prompting the development
of various debiasing methods. However, debiasing methods may degrade the
capabilities of LLMs. Previous research has evaluated the impact of bias
mitigation primarily through tasks measuring general language understanding,
which are often unrelated to social biases. In contrast, cultural commonsense
is closely related to social biases, as both are rooted in social norms and
values. The impact of bias mitigation on cultural commonsense in LLMs has not
been well investigated. Considering this gap, we propose SOBACO (SOcial BiAs
and Cultural cOmmonsense benchmark), a Japanese benchmark designed to evaluate
social biases and cultural commonsense in LLMs in a unified format. We evaluate
several LLMs on SOBACO to examine how debiasing methods affect cultural
commonsense in LLMs. Our results reveal that the debiasing methods degrade the
performance of the LLMs on the cultural commonsense task (up to 75% accuracy
deterioration). These results highlight the importance of developing debiasing
methods that consider the trade-off with cultural commonsense to improve
fairness and utility of LLMs.

*Lasse Borgholt,Jakob Havtorn,Christian Igel,Lars Maaløe,Zheng-Hua Tan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合动态规划和波束搜索的新型对齐算法，能够更准确地识别语音识别中的个别错误，支持细粒度错误分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统语音识别评估指标（如词错误率）主要受高频词影响，难以反映罕见词、命名实体和领域特定词汇的错误，而这些错误更具语义重要性。现有对齐方法无法提供足够精确的对齐结果。

Method: 开发了一种结合动态规划和波束搜索评分的新型对齐算法，相比传统文本对齐方法能够提供更准确的个别错误对齐。

Result: 该算法能够实现更可靠的错误分析，已通过PyPI提供。

Conclusion: 提出的对齐算法为语音识别系统提供了更精细的错误分析能力，有助于识别和改善对语义重要词汇的识别性能。

Abstract: Modern neural networks have greatly improved performance across speech
recognition benchmarks. However, gains are often driven by frequent words with
limited semantic weight, which can obscure meaningful differences in word error
rate, the primary evaluation metric. Errors in rare terms, named entities, and
domain-specific vocabulary are more consequential, but remain hidden by
aggregate metrics. This highlights the need for finer-grained error analysis,
which depends on accurate alignment between reference and model transcripts.
However, conventional alignment methods are not designed for such precision. We
propose a novel alignment algorithm that couples dynamic programming with beam
search scoring. Compared to traditional text alignment methods, our approach
provides more accurate alignment of individual errors, enabling reliable error
analysis. The algorithm is made available via PyPI.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Self-Sanitize框架，通过模拟人类自我监控和修复行为，在token级别实时检测和修正LLM生成的有害内容，特别关注隐私泄露问题，实现低延迟的安全防护。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM安全防护主要依赖后处理过滤，但这种方法引入显著延迟和计算开销，且不兼容token级流式生成。需要一种实时、低开销的安全防护方案。

Method: 基于认知心理学原理，设计包含Self-Monitor和Self-Repair两个模块的框架：Self-Monitor通过表示工程在token级别持续监控高层意图；Self-Repair对有害内容进行原位修正，无需额外对话。

Result: 在四个LLM和三种隐私泄露场景下的实验表明，Self-Sanitize实现了优异的缓解性能，开销极小且不影响LLM实用性。

Conclusion: Self-Sanitize为LLM部署提供了实用且鲁棒的安全解决方案，支持实时流式监控和无缝修复。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve remarkable success across a wide
range of applications, such as chatbots and code copilots, concerns surrounding
the generation of harmful content have come increasingly into focus. Despite
significant advances in aligning LLMs with safety and ethical standards,
adversarial prompts can still be crafted to elicit undesirable responses.
Existing mitigation strategies are predominantly based on post-hoc filtering,
which introduces substantial latency or computational overhead, and is
incompatible with token-level streaming generation. In this work, we introduce
Self-Sanitize, a novel LLM-driven mitigation framework inspired by cognitive
psychology, which emulates human self-monitor and self-repair behaviors during
conversations. Self-Sanitize comprises a lightweight Self-Monitor module that
continuously inspects high-level intentions within the LLM at the token level
via representation engineering, and a Self-Repair module that performs in-place
correction of harmful content without initiating separate review dialogues.
This design allows for real-time streaming monitoring and seamless repair, with
negligible impact on latency and resource utilization. Given that
privacy-invasive content has often been insufficiently focused in previous
studies, we perform extensive experiments on four LLMs across three privacy
leakage scenarios. The results demonstrate that Self-Sanitize achieves superior
mitigation performance with minimal overhead and without degrading the utility
of LLMs, offering a practical and robust solution for safer LLM deployments.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GRPO-MA通过每个思维过程生成多个答案来改进GRPO算法，解决了梯度耦合、稀疏奖励和优势估计不稳定等问题，显著提升了训练效率和模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分析GRPO算法在训练思维链推理时面临的三个挑战：思维与答案间的梯度耦合、有限并行采样导致的稀疏奖励信号、以及不稳定的优势估计。

Method: 提出GRPO-MA方法，利用每个思维过程生成多个答案，通过理论证明和实验验证，增加每个思维的答案数量可以降低思维优势的方差。

Result: 在数学、代码和多模态任务上的实验表明，GRPO-MA显著提升了性能和训练效率，梯度分析证实了该方法减少了梯度尖峰。

Conclusion: 增加每个思维的答案数量能够持续提升模型性能，GRPO-MA为思维链推理训练提供了更稳健和高效的优化方法。

Abstract: Recent progress, such as DeepSeek-R1, has shown that the GRPO algorithm, a
Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach, can effectively train Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models
(VLMs). In this paper, we analyze three challenges of GRPO: gradient coupling
between thoughts and answers, sparse reward signals caused by limited parallel
sampling, and unstable advantage estimation. To mitigate these challenges, we
propose GRPO-MA, a simple yet theoretically grounded method that leverages
multi-answer generation from each thought process, enabling more robust and
efficient optimization. Theoretically, we show that the variance of thought
advantage decreases as the number of answers per thought increases.
Empirically, our gradient analysis confirms this effect, showing that GRPO-MA
reduces gradient spikes compared to GRPO. Experiments on math, code, and
diverse multimodal tasks demonstrate that GRPO-MA substantially improves
performance and training efficiency. Our ablation studies further reveal that
increasing the number of answers per thought consistently enhances model
performance.

*Haewon Park,Sangwoo Kim,Yohan Jo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SUIT方法通过识别和修改与编辑相关的关键特征子空间，显著提高了知识编辑中的知识保留能力，同时保持高编辑效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的知识编辑方法在修改MLP层时没有对关键向量和值向量施加约束，导致对编辑模型产生显著扰动。

Method: 提出SUIT方法，识别并仅修改与编辑相关的关键特征子空间，而不是整个向量空间。

Result: 在LLaMA-3-8B、GPT-J-6B和Qwen2.5-7B模型上的实验表明，SUIT在保持高编辑效果的同时，显著改善了知识保留能力。

Conclusion: SUIT成功识别了编辑的关键子空间，验证了该方法的有效性。

Abstract: Knowledge editing aims to efficiently correct factual errors in Language
Models (LMs). The popular locate-then-edit approach modifies an MLP layer by
finding an optimal mapping between its input vector (key) and output vector
(value) that leads to the expression of the edited knowledge. However, existing
methods without any constraints on the key and value vectors cause significant
perturbations to the edited model. To address this, we propose Subspace
Knowledge Edit (SUIT), a method that identifies and modifies only the subspace
of critical features relevant to the edit. Our empirical results on LLaMA-3-8B,
GPT-J-6B, and Qwen2.5-7B models show that SUIT dramatically improves knowledge
preservation over strong baselines while maintaining high edit efficacy. This
effectiveness confirms that SUIT successfully identifies the critical subspace
for the edit. Further analyses provide additional validation for our approach.
The source code and data will be released to the public upon publication of the
paper.

TL;DR: 提出了Samiksha，一个与公民社会组织和社区成员共同创建的社区驱动评估流程，用于在医疗等关键领域对大型语言模型进行文化感知和情境化的评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型的评估通常缺乏对终端用户生活现实的关注，特别是在医疗等关键领域，需要超越人工或模拟任务，反映社区日常需求、文化实践和细微情境的评估方法。

Method: 与公民社会组织和社区成员共同创建社区驱动评估流程，通过社区反馈指导评估内容、基准构建和输出评分，实现可扩展的自动化基准测试。

Result: 在印度医疗领域的应用表明，该方法能够评估多语言大型语言模型处理细微社区健康查询的能力。

Conclusion: Samiksha为情境化和包容性的大型语言模型评估提供了可扩展的途径，强调了社区参与在模型评估中的重要性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically evaluated through general or
domain-specific benchmarks testing capabilities that often lack grounding in
the lived realities of end users. Critical domains such as healthcare require
evaluations that extend beyond artificial or simulated tasks to reflect the
everyday needs, cultural practices, and nuanced contexts of communities. We
propose Samiksha, a community-driven evaluation pipeline co-created with
civil-society organizations (CSOs) and community members. Our approach enables
scalable, automated benchmarking through a culturally aware, community-driven
pipeline in which community feedback informs what to evaluate, how the
benchmark is built, and how outputs are scored. We demonstrate this approach in
the health domain in India. Our analysis highlights how current multilingual
LLMs address nuanced community health queries, while also offering a scalable
pathway for contextually grounded and inclusive LLM evaluation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AdaThink-Med是一个端到端框架，通过不确定性引导的长度校准增强医学LLMs的自适应思维能力，在保持性能的同时显著减少推理长度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学LLMs无论问题难易都进行冗长推理，导致实际应用中的推理成本增加，需要开发能够根据问题难度自适应调整推理深度的模型。

Method: 生成多个候选输出，评估每个候选的正确性和不确定性，通过不确定性引导的长度校准模块估计问题难度，对简单问题惩罚长推理路径，对复杂问题鼓励扩展思维链。

Result: 在六个公共医学QA基准测试中，平均实现6.4倍长度减少，性能仅有最小程度的下降，并自发发展出"不思考"和"思考"两种推理模式。

Conclusion: AdaThink-Med有效提升了医学LLMs的自适应推理能力，在性能和计算成本之间取得了良好平衡，能够动态抑制冗余推理过程。

Abstract: Recent advances in inference time scaling with extended long chain-of thought
have significantly improved the reasoning capabilities of both general and
medical large language models (LLMs). However, these models tend to engage in
lengthy reasoning processes regardless of the difficulty of the input question,
leading to increased inference costs in real-world applications. Therefore,
enabling adaptive thinking where models think less for simpler questions and
think more for complex ones is critical for the effective use of medical LLMs
in practice. Despite its importance, there is a lack of end-to-end approaches
designed to enhance the adaptive thinking capabilities of medical LLMs while
providing a comprehensive examination of the trade-off between performance and
computational cost. To bridge this gap, we propose AdaThink-Med, the first
end-to-end framework designed to enhance adaptive thinking ability in medical
reasoning models with uncertainty-guided length calibration. AdaThink-Med first
generates multiple candidate outputs for each question, evaluates the
correctness and uncertainty of each candidate, and then estimates problem
difficulty via an uncertainty-guided length calibration module. For outputs
with low difficulty and correct answers, the framework penalizes longer
reasoning paths; whereas for those with high difficulty and incorrect answers,
it encourages extending the chain of thought to explore alternative solutions.
On six public medical QA benchmarks, AdaThink-Med achieves up to 6.4x length
reduction on average while retaining performance with only minimal degradation.
Intriguingly, we observe that AdaThink-Med spontaneously develops two distinct
reasoning modes, which we characterize as "non-thinking" and "thinking",
demonstrating the model's ability to suppress redundant reasoning processes
dynamically.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统研究阅读障碍的方法在测试因果假设方面存在局限，需要新的计算框架来研究阅读障碍的潜在机制

Method: 在视觉语言模型中识别视觉词汇形式选择性单元，并针对性消融这些单元，同时保持随机单元不变

Result: 针对性消融导致阅读任务选择性受损，而一般视觉和语言理解能力保持完整，模型复制了阅读障碍者的语音缺陷特征

Conclusion: 该建模结果复制了阅读障碍的关键特征，为研究阅读障碍建立了计算框架

Abstract: Dyslexia, a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by persistent reading
difficulties, is often linked to reduced activity of the visual word form area
in the ventral occipito-temporal cortex. Traditional approaches to studying
dyslexia, such as behavioral and neuroimaging methods, have provided valuable
insights but remain limited in their ability to test causal hypotheses about
the underlying mechanisms of reading impairments. In this study, we use
large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) to simulate dyslexia by functionally
identifying and perturbing artificial analogues of word processing. Using
stimuli from cognitive neuroscience, we identify visual-word-form-selective
units within VLMs and demonstrate that targeted ablation of these units, unlike
ablation of random units, leads to selective impairments in reading tasks while
general visual and language comprehension abilities remain intact. In
particular, the resulting model matches dyslexic humans' phonological deficits
without a significant change in orthographic processing. Taken together, our
modeling results replicate key characteristics of dyslexia and establish a
computational framework for investigating reading disorders.

TL;DR: 提出了HiKE：首个韩英语码转换基准测试框架，包含高质量自然语码转换数据、详细的外来词标签和分层语码转换标注方案，用于系统评估多语言ASR模型处理不同层次语码转换的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管多语言自动语音识别(ASR)有所进展，但语码转换(CS)在日常语音中常见的语言混合现象仍然是一个严重未被充分探索的挑战。

Method: 引入HiKE框架，包含高质量自然语码转换数据、外来词标签和分层语码转换标注方案（词、短语、句子级别），通过评估多样化多语言ASR模型和微调实验进行研究。

Result: 研究表明大多数多语言ASR模型在初始阶段难以处理语码转换ASR，但通过使用语码转换数据进行微调可以启用这种能力。

Conclusion: HiKE为韩英语码转换提供了首个全球可访问的评估框架，能够促进该领域的研究，并精确评估多语言ASR模型。

Abstract: Despite advances in multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR),
code-switching (CS), the mixing of languages within an utterance common in
daily speech, remains a severely underexplored challenge. In this paper, we
introduce HiKE: the Hierarchical Korean-English code-switching benchmark, the
first globally accessible evaluation framework for Korean-English CS, aiming to
provide a means for the precise evaluation of multilingual ASR models and to
foster research in the field. The proposed framework not only consists of
high-quality, natural CS data across various topics, but also provides
meticulous loanword labels and a hierarchical CS-level labeling scheme (word,
phrase, and sentence) that together enable a systematic evaluation of a model's
ability to handle each distinct level of code-switching. Through evaluations of
diverse multilingual ASR models and fine-tuning experiments, this paper
demonstrates that while most multilingual ASR models initially struggle with
CS-ASR, this capability can be enabled through fine-tuning with CS data. HiKE
will be available at https://github.com/ThetaOne-AI/HiKE.

Motivation: 科学文献中宣传性语言日益增多，可能削弱证据的客观评估、阻碍研究发展并侵蚀科学信任，需要自动检测方法来应对这一问题。

Method: 制定了识别宣传性语言的正式标注指南，在NIH基金申请语料库上进行人工标注，然后评估传统文本分类器和语言模型的性能，并与人类标注基准进行比较。

Result: 实验表明，正式化标注指南有助于人类可靠地标注候选宣传性形容词，使用标注数据集训练机器学习模型可获得有前景的结果。

Conclusion: 该任务具有语言复杂性，可能需要领域知识和时间意识。这是首次将宣传性语言检测作为自然语言处理任务进行研究。

Abstract: In science, promotional language ('hype') is increasing and can undermine
objective evaluation of evidence, impede research development, and erode trust
in science. In this paper, we introduce the task of automatic detection of
hype, which we define as hyperbolic or subjective language that authors use to
glamorize, promote, embellish, or exaggerate aspects of their research. We
propose formalized guidelines for identifying hype language and apply them to
annotate a portion of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) grant application
corpus. We then evaluate traditional text classifiers and language models on
this task, comparing their performance with a human baseline. Our experiments
show that formalizing annotation guidelines can help humans reliably annotate
candidate hype adjectives and that using our annotated dataset to train machine
learning models yields promising results. Our findings highlight the linguistic
complexity of the task, and the potential need for domain knowledge and
temporal awareness of the facts. While some linguistic works address hype
detection, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to approach it as a
natural language processing task.

Motivation: 标准Transformer的自注意力机制在处理长序列时面临计算和内存瓶颈，现有可训练稀疏注意力方法引入过多额外参数并破坏预训练-微调流程。

Method: 提出密集-稀疏可切换注意力框架，复用密集注意力参数，通过参数无关的架构修改，在短序列使用密集注意力，长序列平滑切换到稀疏注意力。

Result: 在长上下文理解和思维链推理任务中，InfLLM-V2比密集注意力快4倍，同时分别保持98.1%和99.7%的性能。

Conclusion: InfLLM-V2框架成功解决了长序列处理的计算效率问题，基于此训练并开源了MiniCPM4.1混合推理模型，为研究社区提供了可复现的实现。

Abstract: Long-sequence processing is a critical capability for modern large language
models. However, the self-attention mechanism in the standard Transformer
architecture faces severe computational and memory bottlenecks when processing
long sequences. While trainable sparse attention methods offer a promising
solution, existing approaches such as NSA introduce excessive extra parameters
and disrupt the conventional \textit{pretrain-on-short, finetune-on-long}
workflow, resulting in slow convergence and difficulty in acceleration. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce dense-sparse switchable attention
framework, termed as InfLLM-V2. InfLLM-V2 is a trainable sparse attention that
seamlessly adapts models from short to long sequences. Specifically, InfLLM-V2
reuses dense attention parameters through parameter-free architecture
modification, maintaining consistency between short and long sequence
processing. Additionally, InfLLM-V2 ensures computational efficiency across all
sequence lengths, by using dense attention for short inputs and smoothly
transitioning to sparse attention for long sequences. To achieve practical
acceleration, we further introduce an efficient implementation of InfLLM-V2
that significantly reduces the computational overhead. Our experiments on
long-context understanding and chain-of-thought reasoning demonstrate that
InfLLM-V2 is 4$\times$ faster than dense attention while retaining 98.1% and
99.7% of the performance, respectively. Based on the InfLLM-V2 framework, we
have trained and open-sourced MiniCPM4.1
(https://huggingface.co/openbmb/MiniCPM4.1-8B), a hybrid reasoning model,
providing a reproducible implementation for the research community.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了unPact框架，通过提示归因和贡献追踪来可解释地分析LLM遗忘机制，发现现有遗忘方法存在两难困境：要么知识未被真正擦除，要么导致灾难性遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM遗忘方法的效果存在争议，一方面"遗忘"的知识可以通过微调恢复，另一方面遗忘可能导致灾难性遗忘。由于难以追踪LLM复杂架构中的知识，对遗忘机制的可解释性分析稀缺。

Method: 提出unPact框架，通过量化提示中每个token对输出的影响，进行遗忘前后的比较分析。在6种主流遗忘方法、3个LLM和3个基准测试上进行评估。

Result: 发现：(1)遗忘通过破坏对提示关键词的关注而显得有效；(2)大部分知识未被真正擦除，通过强调关键词即可恢复；(3)灾难性遗忘源于对所有token的无差别惩罚。

Conclusion: 现有遗忘方法存在两难困境：要么不足够有效（知识可通过关键词强调恢复），要么过于破坏性（导致通用性能崩溃），距离可靠的遗忘仍有差距。

Abstract: Unlearning seeks to remove specific knowledge from large language models
(LLMs), but its effectiveness remains contested. On one side, "forgotten"
knowledge can often be recovered through interventions such as light
fine-tuning; on the other side, unlearning may induce catastrophic forgetting
that degrades general capabilities. Despite active exploration of unlearning
methods, interpretability analyses of the mechanism are scarce due to the
difficulty of tracing knowledge in LLMs' complex architectures. We address this
gap by proposing unPact, an interpretable framework for unlearning via prompt
attribution and contribution tracking. Typically, it quantifies each prompt
token's influence on outputs, enabling pre- and post-unlearning comparisons to
reveal what changes. Across six mainstream unlearning methods, three LLMs, and
three benchmarks, we find that: (1) Unlearning appears to be effective by
disrupting focus on keywords in prompt; (2) Much of the knowledge is not truly
erased and can be recovered by simply emphasizing these keywords in prompts,
without modifying the model's weights; (3) Catastrophic forgetting arises from
indiscriminate penalization of all tokens. Taken together, our results suggest
an unlearning dilemma: existing methods tend either to be insufficient -
knowledge remains recoverable by keyword emphasis, or overly destructive -
general performance collapses due to catastrophic forgetting, still leaving a
gap to reliable unlearning.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了无参考情况下LLM作为评判者的可靠性问题，提出了三种基于模型内部信号的潜在评判方法，发现这些方法比标准提示更稳定和准确。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究单次响应LLM作为评判者评分的可靠性，发现标准方法存在评分不稳定和校准差的问题，导致评分压缩和频繁平局。

Method: 提出三种潜在评判方法：(i)基于整数评分的概率加权评分，(ii)验证器式的"是"概率，(iii)在评分位置训练线性探针的模型激活。

Result: 在广泛的成对和单评分基准测试中，潜在方法匹配或超越标准提示方法，在成对准确性和列表排序方面有持续提升。概率加权评分在单评分相关性方面表现最强。

Conclusion: 潜在信息为无参考评估提供了确定性和更具区分性的信号，可以改进选择和训练方法如Best-of-N、多教师蒸馏和路由。

Abstract: How reliable are single-response LLM-as-a-judge ratings without references,
and can we obtain fine-grained, deterministic scores in this setting? We study
the common practice of asking a judge model to assign Likert-scale scores to
free-text responses and show two systematic issues: scores are unstable under
sampling and poorly calibrated, leading to compression near the top of the
scale and frequent ties. We then propose and evaluate Latent Judges, which
derive scalar ratings from internal model signals: (i) probability-weighted
scores over integer ratings, (ii) verifier-style probabilities of "yes", and
(iii) linear probes trained on model activations at the rating position. Across
a broad suite of pairwise and single-rating benchmarks, latent methods match or
surpass standard prompting, with consistent gains on pairwise accuracy and
listwise ranking relevant to Best-of-N selection. Probability-weighted scores
achieve the strongest single-rating correlations, while probes recover useful
signals when output logits are miscalibrated. These results indicate that
latent information provides deterministic and more discriminative signals for
reference-free evaluation, and can improve selection and training approaches
like Best-of-$N$, multi-teacher distillation, and routing.

*Guibin Zhang,Muxin Fu,Shuicheng Yan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了MemGen动态生成式记忆框架，使LLM智能体具备类人认知能力，通过记忆触发器和记忆编织器实现推理与记忆的紧密交织，在多个基准测试中显著优于现有记忆系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有记忆范式存在局限：参数记忆强制调整模型参数，检索式记忆将经验外部化到结构化数据库中，但都无法捕捉人类认知中推理与记忆的流动交织。

Method: MemGen包含记忆触发器（监控智能体推理状态以决定显式记忆调用）和记忆编织器（以当前状态为刺激构建潜在token序列作为机器原生记忆来丰富推理）。

Result: 在8个基准测试中，MemGen比领先的外部记忆系统（如ExpeL和AWM）提升高达38.22%，超过GRPO高达13.44%，并表现出强大的跨领域泛化能力。

Conclusion: MemGen在没有显式监督的情况下自发演化出类人的记忆能力，包括规划记忆、程序记忆和工作记忆，表明机器认知向更自然形式发展的新兴轨迹。

Abstract: Agent memory shapes how Large Language Model (LLM)-powered agents, akin to
the human brain, progressively refine themselves through environment
interactions. Existing paradigms remain constrained: parametric memory forcibly
adjusts model parameters, and retrieval-based memory externalizes experience
into structured databases, yet neither captures the fluid interweaving of
reasoning and memory that underlies human cognition. To address this gap, we
propose MemGen, a dynamic generative memory framework that equips agents with a
human-esque cognitive faculty. It consists of a \textit{memory trigger}, which
monitors the agent's reasoning state to decide explicit memory invocation, and
a \textit{memory weaver}, which takes the agent's current state as stimulus to
construct a latent token sequence as machine-native memory to enrich its
reasoning. In this way, MemGen enables agents to recall and augment latent
memory throughout reasoning, producing a tightly interwoven cycle of memory and
cognition. Extensive experiments across eight benchmarks show that MemGen
surpasses leading external memory systems such as ExpeL and AWM by up to
$38.22\%$, exceeds GRPO by up to $13.44\%$, and exhibits strong cross-domain
generalization ability. More importantly, we find that without explicit
supervision, MemGen spontaneously evolves distinct human-like memory faculties,
including planning memory, procedural memory, and working memory, suggesting an
emergent trajectory toward more naturalistic forms of machine cognition.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Socratic-Zero是一个完全自主的框架，通过三个智能体（教师、求解器、生成器）的协同进化，从少量种子示例生成高质量训练数据，无需预存任务或标签。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据合成方法存在数据质量不一致和无法动态适应模型能力演化的问题，导致训练信号不理想。

Method: 采用三个智能体协同进化：求解器从成功和失败轨迹中学习，教师根据求解器弱点设计挑战性问题，生成器蒸馏教师策略实现可扩展课程生成。

Result: 仅从100个种子问题开始，Socratic-Solver-8B在七个数学推理基准上平均提升20.2个百分点；Socratic-Generator-32B的合成数据使学生LLM性能超越多个SOTA商业LLM。

Conclusion: Socratic-Zero通过完全自主的闭环系统实现了高质量训练数据的生成和模型能力的持续提升，证明了无需人工标注的可扩展训练方法的有效性。

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) on reasoning tasks rely
heavily on massive, high-quality datasets-typically human-annotated and thus
difficult to scale. While data synthesis or distillation offers a promising
alternative, existing methods struggle with inconsistent data quality and an
inability to dynamically adapt to the evolving capabilities of the model,
leading to suboptimal training signals. To address these limitations, we
introduce Socratic-Zero, a fully autonomous framework that generates
high-quality training data from minimal seed examples through the co-evolution
of three agents: the Teacher, the Solver, and the Generator. The Solver
continuously refines its reasoning by learning from preference feedback on both
successful and failed trajectories; the Teacher adaptively crafts increasingly
challenging questions based on the Solver's weaknesses; and the Generator
distills the Teacher's question-design strategy to enable scalable,
high-fidelity curriculum generation. This closed-loop system produces a
self-improving curriculum-requiring no pre-existing tasks or labels.
Remarkably, starting from only 100 seed questions, our Socratic-Solver-8B
achieves an average gain of +20.2 percentage points over prior data synthesis
methods across seven mathematical reasoning benchmarks (AMC23, AIME24-25,
Olympiad, MATH-500, Minerva, and GSM8K), with consistent gains on both Qwen3
and GLM4 series models. Even more surprisingly, synthetic data from
Socratic-Generator-32B enables student LLMs to achieve superior performance
compared to other state-of-the-art (SOTA) commercial LLMs on these benchmarks,
including Qwen3-235B-A22B, DeepSeek-V3.1-671B, GPT-5, Gemini-2.5-Pro, Grok-4,
and Claude-4.1-Opus.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ProxyAttn是一种无需训练的稀疏注意力算法，通过压缩注意力头维度实现更精确的块重要性估计，显著加速长文本处理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有动态估计块重要性的方法在较高稀疏率下会导致性能下降，因为它们的粗粒度估计不够精确。

Method: 利用注意力头之间的相似性，使用池化代表性头的分数来近似所有头的分数，并结合块感知动态预算估计方法。

Result: 在多种主流模型和基准测试中，ProxyAttn实现了最高10.3倍的注意力加速和2.4倍的预填充加速，且无显著性能损失。

Conclusion: 通过细粒度的块重要性评估，ProxyAttn在性能和效率上都优于现有方法，验证了注意力头间存在相似性的观察。

Abstract: The quadratic complexity of attention mechanisms limits the efficiency of
Large Language Models (LLMs) on long-text tasks. Recently, methods that
dynamically estimate block importance have enabled efficient block sparse
attention, leading to significant acceleration in long-text pre-filling of
LLMs. However, their coarse-grained estimation inevitably leads to performance
degradation at high sparsity rates. In this work, we propose ProxyAttn, a
training-free sparse attention algorithm that achieves more precise block
estimation by compressing the dimension of attention heads. Based on our
observation of the similarity among multiple attention heads, we use the scores
of pooled representative heads to approximate the scores for all heads. To
account for the varying sparsity among heads, we also propose a block-aware
dynamic budget estimation method. By combining the scores from representative
proxy heads with multi-head dynamic budgets, we achieve a more fine-grained
block importance evaluation at low computational cost. Experiments on a variety
of mainstream models and extensive benchmarks confirm the underlying similarity
among attention heads. Leveraging a fine-grained estimation, the proposed
method achieves substantial gains in performance and efficiency compared to
existing methods. More precisely, ProxyAttn can achieve up to 10.3x attention
acceleration and 2.4x prefilling acceleration without significant performance
loss. Our code is available at https://github.com/wyxstriker/ProxyAttn.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LatentEvolve是一个自进化的潜在测试时缩放框架，通过模拟人类互补学习系统的昼夜交替过程，让LLM学习如何更有效地进行测试时计算缩放。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的测试时缩放方法相互独立，LLM尚未学会如何逐步更有效地进行缩放。目标是让LLM进化学习"如何缩放测试时计算"。

Method: 受互补学习系统理论启发，包含两个进化组件：白天缩放（快速检索历史潜在表示）和夜间缩放（整合过去潜在优化），通过昼夜交替实现快速和慢速进化。

Result: 在8个基准测试和5个模型骨干上的实验表明，LatentEvolve比最先进的TTS方法（如LatentSeek和TTRL）性能提升高达13.33%，并展现出卓越的跨领域和跨骨干泛化能力。

Conclusion: LatentEvolve通过模拟人类认知动态，在完全无监督的方式下实现了LLM测试时缩放能力的自进化，显著提升了推理性能。

Abstract: Test-time Scaling (TTS) has been demonstrated to significantly enhance the
reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) during the inference
phase without altering model parameters. However, existing TTS methods are
largely independent, implying that LLMs have not yet evolved to progressively
learn how to scale more effectively. With the objective of evolving LLMs to
learn ``how to scale test-time computation,'' we propose LatentEvolve, a
self-evolving latent TTS framework inspired by the complementary learning
system (CLS) theory. Analogous to the human brain's dual system of a
fast-recall hippocampus and a slow-consolidating neocortex, LatentEvolve
comprises two evolutionary components: \textit{daytime scaling}, which rapidly
retrieves historical latent representations to better guide current LLM
reasoning; and \textit{nighttime scaling}, which integrates past latent
optimizations in a manner akin to the human brain's consolidation of
experiences during sleep. The alternation of daytime and nighttime processes
facilitates a fast and slow evolution of LLM TTS, mirroring human cognitive
dynamics in a fully unsupervised manner. Extensive experiments across eight
benchmarks and five model backbones demonstrate that our LatentEvolve surpasses
state-of-the-art TTS methods such as LatentSeek and TTRL by up to $13.33\%$ and
exhibits exceptional cross-domain and cross-backbone generalization.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SeaPO是一种战略错误放大方法，通过向模型偏好优化中引入三种常见错误模式，确保负样本比正样本更具错误性，从而增强偏好学习效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对齐方法在偏好优化中，由于模型评分或生成能力的限制，正负样本质量可能趋于相似，导致偏好学习优化困难。

Method: 利用LLMs中常见的三种错误类型，在模型偏好优化中引入特定错误模式，确保负样本比正样本更错误，并通过基于偏好的训练来减少这些错误。

Result: 在五个能力维度和不同模型规模（1.5B到14B）上的评估显示，生成的数据显著提高了整体模型性能，特别是真实性方面提升了5-10个百分点。

Conclusion: 任务性能取决于引入的错误类型：注入最常见错误类型能改善相关任务性能，而混合错误类型则带来更广泛的性能提升，大多数任务稳定改善，少数任务显著提升。

Abstract: Existing alignment methods for preference optimization of large language
models (LLMs) aim to enhance model performance by utilizing pairs of positive
and negative samples. However, due to the limited capacity of models in scoring
or generating responses, the quality of positive and negative samples may
become similar during training, which complicates optimization for preference
learning. To address this issue, we introduce SeaPO, a Strategic Error
Amplification method that leverages three error types commonly occurring in
LLMs to introduce specific error patterns into the model Preference
Optimization. This strategy ensures that negative samples are more erroneous
than positive samples and preference-based training is employed to mitigate the
occurrence of these errors, thereby enhancing model performance. Evaluations
across five capability dimensions and different model scales (1.5B to 14B)
demonstrate that the generated data significantly improved overall model
performance, particularly in terms of truthfulness, with improvements of 5-10
percentage points observed. Further analysis reveals that task performance
varies depending on the error types introduced. Injecting the most common error
types improves performance in related tasks, while a mix of error types leads
to a broader performance enhancement: most tasks show stable improvements,
while a few tasks exhibit significant gains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统指标如BLEU和BERT相似度分数无法准确评估组装指令的时空合理性，特别是在缝纫指令领域需要更精确的评估方法。

Method: 开发了一种基于树结构的自动评估指标，专门针对逐步组装指令的时空特性进行设计。

Result: 该指标与人工标注的错误计数和人类质量评分相关性更好，且在对抗性反例测试中比传统方法更稳健。

Conclusion: 提出的树基评估指标在评估缝纫指令的时空合理性方面优于传统文本相似度指标，具有更好的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel, automatic tree-based evaluation metric for
LLM-generated step-by-step assembly instructions, that more accurately reflects
spatiotemporal aspects of construction than traditional metrics such as BLEU
and BERT similarity scores. We apply our proposed metric to the domain of
sewing instructions, and show that our metric better correlates with
manually-annotated error counts as well as human quality ratings, demonstrating
our metric's superiority for evaluating the spatiotemporal soundness of sewing
instructions. Further experiments show that our metric is more robust than
traditional approaches against artificially-constructed counterfactual examples
that are specifically constructed to confound metrics that rely on textual
similarity.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: KnowGuard是一个基于知识图谱探索的临床决策框架，采用"调查后再弃权"范式，通过系统化的知识图谱探索帮助大语言模型在信息不足时正确弃权，避免过度自信的错误诊断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型在医疗场景中缺乏弃权能力，经常在信息不足时给出过度自信的回答，这源于传统弃权方法仅依赖模型自我评估，缺乏基于外部医学证据识别知识边界的系统策略。

Method: 提出两阶段方法：1)证据发现阶段通过图扩展和直接检索系统探索医学知识空间；2)证据评估阶段使用多因素对证据排序，根据患者上下文和对话历史自适应调整探索策略。

Result: 在开放式多轮临床基准测试中，KnowGuard优于现有最先进的弃权方法，诊断准确率提高3.93%，同时平均减少7.27次不必要的交互。

Conclusion: KnowGuard通过系统化的知识图谱探索实现了有效的临床弃权决策，提高了诊断准确性并减少了不必要的交互，为医疗AI的安全应用提供了重要保障。

Abstract: In clinical practice, physicians refrain from making decisions when patient
information is insufficient. This behavior, known as abstention, is a critical
safety mechanism preventing potentially harmful misdiagnoses. Recent
investigations have reported the application of large language models (LLMs) in
medical scenarios. However, existing LLMs struggle with the abstentions,
frequently providing overconfident responses despite incomplete information.
This limitation stems from conventional abstention methods relying solely on
model self-assessments, which lack systematic strategies to identify knowledge
boundaries with external medical evidences. To address this, we propose
\textbf{KnowGuard}, a novel \textit{investigate-before-abstain} paradigm that
integrates systematic knowledge graph exploration for clinical decision-making.
Our approach consists of two key stages operating on a shared contextualized
evidence pool: 1) an evidence discovery stage that systematically explores the
medical knowledge space through graph expansion and direct retrieval, and 2) an
evidence evaluation stage that ranks evidence using multiple factors to adapt
exploration based on patient context and conversation history. This two-stage
approach enables systematic knowledge graph exploration, allowing models to
trace structured reasoning paths and recognize insufficient medical evidence.
We evaluate our abstention approach using open-ended multi-round clinical
benchmarks that mimic realistic diagnostic scenarios, assessing abstention
quality through accuracy-efficiency trade-offs beyond existing closed-form
evaluations. Experimental evidences clearly demonstrate that KnowGuard
outperforms state-of-the-art abstention approaches, improving diagnostic
accuracy by 3.93\% while reducing unnecessary interaction by 7.27 turns on
average.

TL;DR: DiaCDM是一个创新模型，首次在对话场景中探索认知诊断，通过教育理论中的IRE框架和图编码方法，显著提高了诊断准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统认知诊断模型无法处理动态、非结构化的师生对话，且难以从冗长对话中准确提取诊断语义。

Method: 采用教育理论中的IRE框架设计对话诊断框架，并开发基于图的编码方法，整合教师问题和相关知识组件以精确捕捉关键信息。

Result: 在三个真实对话数据集上的实验表明，DiaCDM显著提高了诊断准确性，并增强了结果的可解释性。

Conclusion: DiaCDM为教师评估学生认知状态提供了强大工具，是对话场景中认知诊断的首个探索性研究。

Abstract: While cognitive diagnosis (CD) effectively assesses students' knowledge
mastery from structured test data, applying it to real-world teacher-student
dialogues presents two fundamental challenges. Traditional CD models lack a
suitable framework for handling dynamic, unstructured dialogues, and it's
difficult to accurately extract diagnostic semantics from lengthy dialogues. To
overcome these hurdles, we propose DiaCDM, an innovative model. We've adapted
the initiation-response-evaluation (IRE) framework from educational theory to
design a diagnostic framework tailored for dialogue. We also developed a unique
graph-based encoding method that integrates teacher questions with relevant
knowledge components to capture key information more precisely. To our
knowledge, this is the first exploration of cognitive diagnosis in a dialogue
setting. Experiments on three real-world dialogue datasets confirm that DiaCDM
not only significantly improves diagnostic accuracy but also enhances the
results' interpretability, providing teachers with a powerful tool for
assessing students' cognitive states. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出SemShareKV框架，通过语义相似性共享KV缓存来加速LLM推理，使用LSH进行模糊令牌匹配并整合RoPE位置编码，在保持输出质量的同时显著减少计算冗余。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型规模扩大，推理过程中KV缓存的内存占用成为瓶颈。现有方法局限于单提示压缩或基于精确令牌匹配的共享，无法处理语义相似但词汇不同的提示场景。

Method: 使用局部敏感哈希(LSH)对令牌嵌入进行模糊匹配，结合旋转位置编码(RoPE)保持位置信息，选择性重用参考提示的KV缓存对。

Result: 在多样化摘要数据集上，对于5k令牌输入实现了6.25倍加速和42%GPU内存降低，质量下降可忽略不计。

Conclusion: 语义感知的缓存共享在高效LLM推理方面具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to scale, the memory footprint of
key-value (KV) caches during inference has become a significant bottleneck.
Existing approaches primarily focus on compressing KV caches within a single
prompt or reusing shared prefixes or frequently ocurred text segments across
prompts. However, such strategies are limited in scenarios where prompts are
semantically similar but lexically different, which frequently occurs in tasks
such as multi-document summarization and conversational agents. We propose
\textit{SemShareKV}, a KV cache sharing and compression framework that
accelerates LLM inference by reusing KVCache in semantically similar prompts.
Instead of relying on exact token matches, SemShareKV applies fuzzy token
matching using locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) on token embeddings and
incorporates Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) to better preserve positional
information. By selectively reusing relevant key-value pairs from a reference
prompt's cache, SemShareKV reduces redundant computation while maintaining
output quality. Experiments on diverse summarization datasets show up to
6.25$\times$ speedup and 42\% lower GPU memory usage with 5k tokens input, with
negligible quality degradation. These results highlight the potential of
semantic-aware cache sharing for efficient LLM inference.

Motivation: 解决LLM在专业领域性能不足的问题，现有模型在医疗编码任务中准确率仅45.9%

Method: 分层错误校正框架，分析知识层、推理层和复杂度层错误，开发三阶段校正策略

Result: 在四个专业领域验证，平均提升11.2个百分点，但在高基线任务中效果受限

Conclusion: 系统错误分析可指导专业领域AI增强策略，但需理解框架边界以实现最优部署

Abstract: Large Language Models face significant performance challenges in specialized
domains, with state-of-the-art models achieving only 45.9% accuracy on medical
coding tasks. This study proposes a Hierarchical Error Correction (HEC)
framework that addresses domain-specific AI limitations through systematic
error analysis and targeted intervention strategies.
  We analyze error patterns across four specialized domains and find that AI
errors follow consistent hierarchical structures: Knowledge-layer errors
(58.4%), Reasoning-layer errors (39.6%), and Complexity-layer errors (2.0%).
Based on these patterns, we develop a three-stage correction framework that
addresses errors according to their hierarchical importance and demonstrates
that framework effectiveness correlates inversely with baseline task
performance.
  Experimental validation across medical transcription (4,921 cases), legal
document classification (1,000 cases), political bias detection (645 cases),
and legal reasoning (1,000 cases) shows consistent improvements. Cross-model
validation across five LLM architectures demonstrates average improvements of
11.2 percentage points (p < 0.001). However, analysis reveals framework
limitations in high-baseline tasks (>75% accuracy), where hierarchical
intervention may interfere with effective reasoning processes.
  The results suggest that systematic error analysis can guide effective AI
enhancement strategies in specialized domains, particularly for
moderate-baseline tasks, while highlighting the importance of understanding
framework boundaries for optimal deployment.

Motivation: 随着ChatGPT等LLM聊天机器人在高风险心理健康支持场景中的广泛应用，需要评估它们安全检测和响应急性心理健康危机的能力，但目前缺乏统一危机分类、标注基准和基于临床实践的实证评估。

Method: 引入统一的六类临床心理健康危机分类法，策划多样化评估数据集，建立专家设计的响应适当性评估协议，系统性地对三种最先进LLM进行危机分类和响应生成能力基准测试。

Result: LLM在处理明确危机披露时高度一致且总体可靠，但不适当或有害响应的比例不可忽视，开源模型失败率高于商业模型。系统性地在处理间接或模糊风险信号、依赖公式化回复、与用户情境不匹配方面存在弱点。

Conclusion: 迫切需要加强LLM部署中的安全防护措施，改进危机检测能力，开发情境感知干预机制。该研究的分类法、数据集和评估框架为AI驱动的心理健康支持研究奠定了基础，有助于最小化伤害并保护脆弱用户。

Abstract: The widespread use of chatbots powered by large language models (LLMs) such
as ChatGPT and Llama has fundamentally reshaped how people seek information and
advice across domains. Increasingly, these chatbots are being used in
high-stakes contexts, including emotional support and mental health concerns.
While LLMs can offer scalable support, their ability to safely detect and
respond to acute mental health crises remains poorly understood. Progress is
hampered by the absence of unified crisis taxonomies, robust annotated
benchmarks, and empirical evaluations grounded in clinical best practices. In
this work, we address these gaps by introducing a unified taxonomy of six
clinically-informed mental health crisis categories, curating a diverse
evaluation dataset, and establishing an expert-designed protocol for assessing
response appropriateness. We systematically benchmark three state-of-the-art
LLMs for their ability to classify crisis types and generate safe, appropriate
responses. The results reveal that while LLMs are highly consistent and
generally reliable in addressing explicit crisis disclosures, significant risks
remain. A non-negligible proportion of responses are rated as inappropriate or
harmful, with responses generated by an open-weight model exhibiting higher
failure rates than those generated by the commercial ones. We also identify
systemic weaknesses in handling indirect or ambiguous risk signals, a reliance
on formulaic and inauthentic default replies, and frequent misalignment with
user context. These findings underscore the urgent need for enhanced
safeguards, improved crisis detection, and context-aware interventions in LLM
deployments. Our taxonomy, datasets, and evaluation framework lay the
groundwork for ongoing research and responsible innovation in AI-driven mental
health support, helping to minimize harm and better protect vulnerable users.

TL;DR: 本研究探索使用大语言模型自动识别文本中的隐喻，比较了检索增强生成、提示工程和微调三种方法，发现微调方法能达到0.79的中位F1分数，表明LLM可以部分自动化隐喻识别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 隐喻是话语中的普遍特征，但大规模分析受限于需要人工标注，因为隐喻具有语境敏感性。本研究旨在探索大语言模型在全文隐喻识别中的自动化潜力。

Method: 比较三种方法：(1)检索增强生成(RAG)，提供代码书让模型基于规则和示例标注；(2)提示工程，设计特定任务的文字指令；(3)微调，在人工编码文本上训练模型。在提示工程中还测试了零样本、少样本和思维链策略。

Result: 最先进的闭源大语言模型能达到高准确率，微调方法的中位F1分数为0.79。人类与LLM输出的差异大多是系统性的，反映了隐喻理论中的灰色地带和概念挑战。

Conclusion: 大语言模型可以至少部分自动化隐喻识别，并可作为开发和改进隐喻识别协议及其理论基础的工具。

Abstract: Metaphor is a pervasive feature of discourse and a powerful lens for
examining cognition, emotion, and ideology. Large-scale analysis, however, has
been constrained by the need for manual annotation due to the context-sensitive
nature of metaphor. This study investigates the potential of large language
models (LLMs) to automate metaphor identification in full texts. We compare
three methods: (i) retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), where the model is
provided with a codebook and instructed to annotate texts based on its rules
and examples; (ii) prompt engineering, where we design task-specific verbal
instructions; and (iii) fine-tuning, where the model is trained on hand-coded
texts to optimize performance. Within prompt engineering, we test zero-shot,
few-shot, and chain-of-thought strategies. Our results show that
state-of-the-art closed-source LLMs can achieve high accuracy, with fine-tuning
yielding a median F1 score of 0.79. A comparison of human and LLM outputs
reveals that most discrepancies are systematic, reflecting well-known grey
areas and conceptual challenges in metaphor theory. We propose that LLMs can be
used to at least partly automate metaphor identification and can serve as a
testbed for developing and refining metaphor identification protocols and the
theory that underpins them.

Motivation: 探索语言模型是否能在推理时利用人工插入的填充token序列作为额外计算空间，以增强模型的计算能力。

Method: 通过实验识别有效的token类型、数量和插入位置，分析模型训练阶段如何利用扩展计算空间，并通过注意力图分析空间内的动态。

Result: 在1.7B到32B模型上的实验显示，在最终'Answer:' token前插入填充token最有效，小模型受益最大（SmolLM2-1.7B-Instruct提升12.372个百分点），注意力图显示扩展空间延续原有注意力机制。

Conclusion: 填充token序列可作为额外计算容量，而非冗余输入，小模型从中获益最大，扩展空间进行有意义的问题解决计算。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) rationale enables language models to use additional
task-related text for problem-solving, benefiting not only from detailed
reasoning steps but also from the expanded computational space of longer
inputs. Prior work has trained filler or special tokens to serve as additional
computation spaces. In this study, we investigate whether language models can
leverage artificially inserted sequences of filler tokens solely at inference.
We first identify effective token types, numbers, and insertion locations, then
examine at what stage of training models begin to exploit the expanded
computation space, and finally analyze dynamics within these spaces via
attention maps. Experiments on models ranging from 1.7B to 32B across
open-domain QA and math tasks show that appropriate token types and counts
vary, but placing filler tokens directly before the final 'Answer:' token is
most effective. Smaller models benefit most, up to 12.372 percentage points in
SmolLM2-1.7B-Instruct, indicating that these spaces act as additional
computational capacity rather than redundant input. Attention maps reveal that
expanded spaces often continue the original attention mechanism and sometimes
focus on questions or answer options, suggesting meaningful computation for
problem-solving.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了BOE-XSUM数据集，包含3,648个西班牙官方公报文档的简明摘要，并证明微调后的LLM在西班牙法律文档摘要任务上显著优于零样本通用模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于信息过载，长文档摘要能力日益重要，但西班牙语文档特别是法律领域缺乏此类摘要资源。

Method: 构建BOE-XSUM数据集，包含西班牙官方公报文档及其简明摘要，然后对中等规模LLM进行微调，并与零样本通用模型进行对比。

Result: 微调模型显著优于非专业化模型，最佳模型BERTIN GPT-J 6B比最佳零样本模型DeepSeek-R1性能提升24%（准确率41.6% vs 33.5%）。

Conclusion: 针对特定领域（如法律）微调的LLM在文档摘要任务上表现优于通用模型，证明了领域专业化的重要性。

Abstract: The ability to summarize long documents succinctly is increasingly important
in daily life due to information overload, yet there is a notable lack of such
summaries for Spanish documents in general, and in the legal domain in
particular. In this work, we present BOE-XSUM, a curated dataset comprising
3,648 concise, plain-language summaries of documents sourced from Spain's
``Bolet\'{\i}n Oficial del Estado'' (BOE), the State Official Gazette. Each
entry in the dataset includes a short summary, the original text, and its
document type label. We evaluate the performance of medium-sized large language
models (LLMs) fine-tuned on BOE-XSUM, comparing them to general-purpose
generative models in a zero-shot setting. Results show that fine-tuned models
significantly outperform their non-specialized counterparts. Notably, the
best-performing model -- BERTIN GPT-J 6B (32-bit precision) -- achieves a 24\%
performance gain over the top zero-shot model, DeepSeek-R1 (accuracies of
41.6\% vs.\ 33.5\%).

*Rebira Jemama,Rajesh Kumar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出无需训练的快速框架，用于作者身份验证和风格模仿分析，结合TF-IDF字符n-gram和transformer嵌入，通过经验距离分布分类文本对。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型能生成流畅文本，但复制特定人类作者独特风格的能力尚不明确，需要评估LLM的风格模仿能力。

Method: 集成TF-IDF字符n-gram与transformer嵌入，通过经验距离分布分类文本对，无需监督训练或阈值调优。评估了5个LLM模型和4种提示策略。

Result: 在学术论文上达到97.5%准确率，跨域评估94.5%，相比参数基线减少91.8%训练时间和59%内存使用。few-shot提示比zero-shot风格匹配准确率高23.5倍，完成提示达到99.9%风格一致性。

Conclusion: 提示策略比模型大小对风格保真度影响更大；高保真模仿不意味着人类不可预测性；风格保真度和统计可检测性是可分离的，为作者建模、检测和身份条件生成提供了可复现基础。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can generate fluent text, but their ability to
replicate the distinctive style of a specific human author remains unclear. We
present a fast, training-free framework for authorship verification and style
imitation analysis. The method integrates TF-IDF character n-grams with
transformer embeddings and classifies text pairs through empirical distance
distributions, eliminating the need for supervised training or threshold
tuning. It achieves 97.5\% accuracy on academic essays and 94.5\% in
cross-domain evaluation, while reducing training time by 91.8\% and memory
usage by 59\% relative to parameter-based baselines. Using this framework, we
evaluate five LLMs from three separate families (Llama, Qwen, Mixtral) across
four prompting strategies - zero-shot, one-shot, few-shot, and text completion.
Results show that the prompting strategy has a more substantial influence on
style fidelity than model size: few-shot prompting yields up to 23.5x higher
style-matching accuracy than zero-shot, and completion prompting reaches 99.9\%
agreement with the original author's style. Crucially, high-fidelity imitation
does not imply human-like unpredictability - human essays average a perplexity
of 29.5, whereas matched LLM outputs average only 15.2. These findings
demonstrate that stylistic fidelity and statistical detectability are
separable, establishing a reproducible basis for future work in authorship
modeling, detection, and identity-conditioned generation.

TL;DR: 研究表明，通过精心筛选高质量数据，仅需约2T tokens就能训练出具有强大推理能力的小型语言模型，挑战了传统认为需要海量数据才能获得推理能力的假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战当前关于大语言模型推理能力的两个普遍假设：(1)推理能力只在足够大的模型中涌现；(2)推理能力需要海量数据集训练。特别是第二个假设尚未被充分质疑。

Method: 通过精心筛选和重采样开源数据集，设计指标识别有益数据，使用仅约2T tokens的高质量数据进行预训练，然后通过4.2T tokens的重采样数据集进行预训练，并采用已建立的后续训练流程。

Result: 开发的MobileLLM-R1系列模型（小于10亿参数）在多个推理基准测试中显著优于先前模型。MobileLLM-R1-950M在AIME上获得15.5分，远超OLMo-2-1.48B的0.6分和SmolLM-2-1.7B的0.3分。尽管仅使用Qwen3 11.7%的训练数据，但在多个推理基准上达到或超过Qwen3-0.6B。

Conclusion: 推理能力的涌现不一定需要海量数据，高质量数据筛选比数据规模更重要。这为开发高效的小型推理模型提供了新方向，并开源了完整的训练方案和数据洞察。

Abstract: The paradigm shift in large language models (LLMs) from instinctive responses
to chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has fueled two prevailing assumptions: (1)
reasoning capabilities only emerge in sufficiently large models, and (2) such
capabilities require training on massive datasets. While the first assumption
has already been challenged by recent sub-billion-parameter reasoning models
such as Qwen3-0.6B and DeepSeek distilled variants, the second remains largely
unquestioned. In this work, we revisit the necessity of scaling to extremely
large corpora (>10T tokens) for reasoning emergence. By carefully curating and
resampling open-source datasets that we identify as beneficial under our
designed metrics, we demonstrate that strong reasoning abilities can emerge
with far less data. Specifically, we show that only ~2T tokens of high-quality
data are sufficient, and pre-training with 4.2T tokens on the dataset resampled
from these ~2T tokens, followed by a established post-training procedure,
enables the development of MobileLLM-R1, a series of sub-billion-parameter
reasoning models that substantially outperform prior models trained on fully
open-sourced data. For example, MobileLLM-R1-950M achieves an AIME score of
15.5, compared to just 0.6 for OLMo-2-1.48B and 0.3 for SmolLM-2-1.7B.
Remarkably, despite being trained on only 11.7% of the tokens compared to
Qwen3's proprietary 36T-token corpus for pretraining, MobileLLM-R1-950M matches
or surpasses Qwen3-0.6B across multiple reasoning benchmarks. To facilitate
further research in this direction, we have released the complete training
recipe, data sources, data mixing ratio, and model checkpoints, together with
the key insights obtained throughout this study.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI医生主要关注诊断技能，但忽视了优秀医生应具备的共情、耐心、清晰沟通等其他重要品质，需要全面评估医疗问诊能力。

Method: 构建包含3000个模拟患者代理的MAQuE基准，这些代理具有多样化语言模式、认知限制、情绪反应和被动披露倾向，并引入多维度评估框架。

Result: 实验显示不同LLM在评估各方面都面临重大挑战，最先进模型在问诊能力上仍有显著改进空间，对真实患者行为变化高度敏感，影响诊断准确性。

Conclusion: 细粒度指标揭示了不同评估视角之间的权衡，突显了在真实临床环境中平衡性能与实用性的挑战。

Abstract: An effective physician should possess a combination of empathy, expertise,
patience, and clear communication when treating a patient. Recent advances have
successfully endowed AI doctors with expert diagnostic skills, particularly the
ability to actively seek information through inquiry. However, other essential
qualities of a good doctor remain overlooked. To bridge this gap, we present
MAQuE(Medical Agent Questioning Evaluation), the largest-ever benchmark for the
automatic and comprehensive evaluation of medical multi-turn questioning. It
features 3,000 realistically simulated patient agents that exhibit diverse
linguistic patterns, cognitive limitations, emotional responses, and tendencies
for passive disclosure. We also introduce a multi-faceted evaluation framework,
covering task success, inquiry proficiency, dialogue competence, inquiry
efficiency, and patient experience. Experiments on different LLMs reveal
substantial challenges across the evaluation aspects. Even state-of-the-art
models show significant room for improvement in their inquiry capabilities.
These models are highly sensitive to variations in realistic patient behavior,
which considerably impacts diagnostic accuracy. Furthermore, our fine-grained
metrics expose trade-offs between different evaluation perspectives,
highlighting the challenge of balancing performance and practicality in
real-world clinical settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御方法主要关注用户侧行为，而忽略了项目侧特征（如标题和描述）可能暴露的恶意意图，需要填补这一空白。

Method: 采用两阶段检测框架：第一阶段使用低成本行为标准预筛选可疑用户，第二阶段使用基于LLM的审计评估语义一致性，并通过强化微调增强审计模型。

Result: 在六种代表性攻击策略上的实验证明了SemanticShield的有效性，对未见过的攻击方法也显示出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: SemanticShield通过整合项目侧语义信息，能够有效检测和防御推荐系统中的shilling攻击，具有良好的泛化性能。

Abstract: Recommender systems (RS) are widely used in e-commerce for personalized
suggestions, yet their openness makes them susceptible to shilling attacks,
where adversaries inject fake behaviors to manipulate recommendations. Most
existing defenses emphasize user-side behaviors while overlooking item-side
features such as titles and descriptions that can expose malicious intent. To
address this gap, we propose a two-stage detection framework that integrates
item-side semantics via large language models (LLMs). The first stage
pre-screens suspicious users using low-cost behavioral criteria, and the second
stage employs LLM-based auditing to evaluate semantic consistency. Furthermore,
we enhance the auditing model through reinforcement fine-tuning on a
lightweight LLM with carefully designed reward functions, yielding a
specialized detector called SemanticShield. Experiments on six representative
attack strategies demonstrate the effectiveness of SemanticShield against
shilling attacks, and further evaluation on previously unseen attack methods
shows its strong generalization capability. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究发现，LLM的置信度估计不应依赖于模型的"自我认知"能力，而应通过系统性地编码历史正确性信息来构建通用正确性模型(GCM)，这种方法在跨模型和数据集上都能实现可靠的置信度估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在关键应用场景中部署LLM需要准确且校准的置信度估计，但现有方法假设模型具有判断自身答案正确性的"自我认知"能力，这种假设可能存在问题。

Method: 提出了通用正确性模型(GCM)，通过注入历史正确性信息来训练模型；探索了多种方法包括训练LLM和使用上下文示例，并系统控制训练数据来研究正确性预测能力的来源。

Result: 实验表明，GCM在5个模型家族和MMLU、TriviaQA数据集上都能实现可靠的置信度估计，在选择性预测任务中表现良好；发现答案措辞是正确性的强预测因子。

Conclusion: 可靠的LLM置信度估计是一种可泛化、模型无关的技能，通过系统编码正确性历史获得，而非依赖于模型特定的自我反思能力。

Abstract: Generating accurate and calibrated confidence estimates is critical for
deploying LLMs in high-stakes or user-facing applications, and remains an open
challenge. Prior research has often framed confidence as a problem of eliciting
a model's "self-knowledge", i.e., the ability of an LLM to judge whether its
own answers are correct; this approach implicitly assumes that there is some
privileged information about the answer's correctness that is accessible to the
model itself. However, our experiments reveal that an LLM attempting to predict
the correctness of its own outputs generally performs no better than an
unrelated LLM. Moreover, we hypothesize that a key factor in building a
"Correctness Model" (CM) is exposure to a target model's historical
predictions. We propose multiple methods to inject this historical correctness
information, creating a Generalized Correctness Model (GCM). We first show that
GCMs can be trained on the correctness data from many LLMs and learn patterns
for correctness prediction applicable across datasets and models. We then use
CMs as a lens for studying the source of correctness prediction ability and its
generalization, systematically controlling their training data and finding that
answer phrasing is a strong predictor for correctness. We further explore
alternative methods of injecting history without training an LLM, finding that
including history as in-context examples can help improve correctness
prediction, and post-hoc calibration can provide complementary reductions in
calibration error. We evaluate GCMs based on Qwen3-8B across 5 model families
and the MMLU and TriviaQA datasets, as well as on a downstream selective
prediction task, finding that reliable LLM confidence estimation is a
generalizable and model-agnostic skill learned by systematically encoding
correctness history rather than a model-specific skill reliant on
self-introspection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模型蒸馏只关注行为模仿，将教师模型的内部计算视为黑盒。本文旨在蒸馏教师模型底层的计算机制，实现更高效的算法能力迁移。

Method: 提出电路蒸馏方法，匹配师生模型中功能对应的电路组件，并引入反映这些组件表示相似性的损失函数，仅调整学生模型的小部分参数。

Result: 在Llama3系列模型上的实体追踪和心理理论任务评估显示，电路蒸馏优于标准蒸馏，成功通过调整少量目标参数转移算法能力。

Conclusion: 这项工作证明了转移计算机制的可行性，可能通过可解释和可控的内部学生机制实现高效的教师能力蒸馏。

Abstract: Model distillation typically focuses on behavioral mimicry, where a student
model is trained to replicate a teacher's output while treating its internal
computations as a black box. In this work we propose an alternative approach:
Distilling the underlying computational mechanisms implemented by a teacher
model. Specifically, we propose circuit distillation, which introduces an
objective to align internal representations between analogous circuit
components in teacher and student models. We propose a method to match
``functionally correspondent'' circuit components and introduce a loss
reflecting similarities between the representations that these induce. We
evaluate circuit distillation on entity tracking and theory of mind (ToM) tasks
using models from the Llama3 family. Our results demonstrate that circuit
distillation outperforms standard distillation, successfully transferring
algorithmic capabilities by adjusting only a small, targeted subset of student
model parameters. This work establishes the feasibility of transferring
mechanisms, which may in turn allow for efficient distillation of targeted
teacher capabilities via interpretable and controllable internal student
mechanisms.

Motivation: 追求AI时代快速语言文本生成的圣杯，解决现有语言生成模型速度较慢的问题。

Method: 基于积分KL散度最小化框架，从预训练离散扩散语言模型初始化，引入分组奖励归一化、中间状态匹配和奖励引导祖先采样等技术。

Result: 在OpenWebText上，DiDi-Instruct在8到128步采样中困惑度从62.2降到18.4，仅损失约1%的熵，训练时间减少20倍，性能优于所有加速语言生成模型。

Conclusion: DiDi-Instruct是一种高效有效的蒸馏方法，能够实现眨眼间的语言生成，并通过蛋白质序列生成验证了其鲁棒性。

Abstract: Fast generation of language texts is the holy grail that people pursue in the
AI era. In this work, we introduced Discrete Diffusion Divergence Instruct
(DiDi-Instruct), a training-based method that leads to fast language generation
models by initializing from a pre-trained (masked) discrete diffusion language
model (dLLM). The resulting DiDi-Instruct model outperforms the dLLM
counterparts and the GPT-2 baseline with 64x acceleration. In the theoretical
part of the paper, we build the foundation of DiDi-Instruct in a framework of
integral KL-divergence minimization, with practical training algorithms. We
also introduce techniques like grouped reward normalization, intermediate-state
matching, and the reward-guided ancestral sampler (RGAS) that significantly
improve the training stability, the model coverage, and the inference
performances. On OpenWebText, DiDi-Instruct outperforms all accelerated
language generation models as well as the GPT-2 baseline and the standard
dLLMs, achieving sample perplexities ranging from 62.2 (8 NFEs) to 18.4 (128
NFEs). These performance gains are accomplished with a negligible entropy loss
of about 1% and 20x less additional training wall-clock time. We further
validate the robustness and effectiveness of DiDi-Instruct through extensive
ablation studies, model scaling, and the generation of discrete protein
sequences. In conclusion, DiDi-Instruct is an efficient yet effective
distillation method, enabling language generation in the blink of an eye. We
will release both code and models at github.com/haoyangzheng-ai/didi-instruct.

Motivation: 现有的多模态方面级情感分析模型难以过滤噪声视觉信号，并有效跨模态对齐方面与意见内容。

Method: GateMABSA集成了句法、语义和融合感知的mLSTM，包括Syn-mLSTM（句法结构）、Sem-mLSTM（方面-语义相关性）和Fuse-mLSTM（选择性多模态融合）。

Result: 在两个基准Twitter数据集上的广泛实验表明，GateMABSA优于多个基线模型。

Conclusion: GateMABSA通过门控多模态架构有效解决了多模态方面级情感分析中的噪声过滤和跨模态对齐问题。

Abstract: Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) has recently advanced into the
multimodal domain, where user-generated content often combines text and images.
However, existing multimodal ABSA (MABSA) models struggle to filter noisy
visual signals, and effectively align aspects with opinion-bearing content
across modalities. To address these challenges, we propose GateMABSA, a novel
gated multimodal architecture that integrates syntactic, semantic, and
fusion-aware mLSTM. Specifically, GateMABSA introduces three specialized
mLSTMs: Syn-mLSTM to incorporate syntactic structure, Sem-mLSTM to emphasize
aspect--semantic relevance, and Fuse-mLSTM to perform selective multimodal
fusion. Extensive experiments on two benchmark Twitter datasets demonstrate
that GateMABSA outperforms several baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的可解释性方法（如直接对数归因和稀疏自编码器）对LLM内部表示的理解有限，存在输出词汇表限制和特征名称不清晰等问题。

Method: 使用向量符号架构将模型残差流投影到可解释概念中，结合了稀疏自编码器和传统探测器的优点，克服了它们的主要限制。

Result: 实验表明该探测器在不同LLM、嵌入大小和输入领域中都能可靠地提取有意义的概忛，并有助于识别LLM的失败情况。

Conclusion: 这项工作推进了LLM向量空间中的信息解码，使得能够从神经表示中提取更具信息性、可解释性和结构化的特征。

Abstract: Despite their capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) remain opaque with
limited understanding of their internal representations. Current
interpretability methods, such as direct logit attribution (DLA) and sparse
autoencoders (SAEs), provide restricted insight due to limitations such as the
model's output vocabulary or unclear feature names. This work introduces
Hyperdimensional Probe, a novel paradigm for decoding information from the LLM
vector space. It combines ideas from symbolic representations and neural
probing to project the model's residual stream into interpretable concepts via
Vector Symbolic Architectures (VSAs). This probe combines the strengths of SAEs
and conventional probes while overcoming their key limitations. We validate our
decoding paradigm with controlled input-completion tasks, probing the model's
final state before next-token prediction on inputs spanning syntactic pattern
recognition, key-value associations, and abstract inference. We further assess
it in a question-answering setting, examining the state of the model both
before and after text generation. Our experiments show that our probe reliably
extracts meaningful concepts across varied LLMs, embedding sizes, and input
domains, also helping identify LLM failures. Our work advances information
decoding in LLM vector space, enabling extracting more informative,
interpretable, and structured features from neural representations.

Motivation: 研究大型语言模型作为语音识别后处理模块的能力，专注于纠正障碍语音中的错误，解决传统方法在不确定ASR区域过度纠正的问题。

Method: 提出置信度提示方法，将词级不确定性估计直接嵌入LLM训练，引导模型关注不确定的ASR区域并减少过度纠正，与仅使用转录文本的微调和后验置信度过滤方法进行比较。

Result: 在Speech Accessibility Project自发语音上相对WER降低10%，在TORGO数据集上降低47%，证明了置信度感知微调对障碍语音的有效性。

Conclusion: 置信度感知的LLM微调方法能有效提高语音识别错误纠正的性能，特别是在障碍语音处理中表现出显著优势。

Abstract: We investigate the use of large language models (LLMs) as post-processing
modules for automatic speech recognition (ASR), focusing on their ability to
perform error correction for disordered speech. In particular, we propose
confidence-informed prompting, where word-level uncertainty estimates are
embedded directly into LLM training to improve robustness and generalization
across speakers and datasets. This approach directs the model to uncertain ASR
regions and reduces overcorrection. We fine-tune a LLaMA 3.1 model and compare
our approach to both transcript-only fine-tuning and post hoc confidence-based
filtering. Evaluations show that our method achieves a 10% relative WER
reduction compared to naive LLM correction on the Speech Accessibility Project
spontaneous speech and a 47% reduction on TORGO, demonstrating the
effectiveness of confidence-aware fine-tuning for impaired speech.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索Transformer在程序跟踪生成任务上的能力，该任务通过长跟踪外部化推理过程，每个步骤都很简单，旨在测试模型的结构化推理能力。

Method: 训练小型Transformer模型，采用多种修改方案：替代位置编码、softmax替换、混合模型和短卷积等，测试其在程序跟踪生成任务上的表现。

Result: 模型在分布内数据上达到强准确率，但在泛化到程序长度、跟踪步骤等不同因素时出现系统性失败，不过某些设计显著改善了泛化能力。

Conclusion: 虽然Transformer在程序跟踪生成任务上表现出色，但其泛化能力存在局限性，需要进一步改进模型设计来提升对结构化推理任务的泛化性能。

Abstract: We study Transformers on the task \emph{program trace generation} (PTG),
where models produce step-by-step execution traces for synthetic programs.
Unlike existing algorithmic problems, PTG externalizes reasoning through long
traces where each step is trivial. We train small Transformers with diverse
modifications, including alternative position encodings, softmax replacements,
hybrid model, and short convolutions. While these models achieve strong
in-distribution accuracy, they exhibit systematic failures when generalizing to
various factors (e.g., program length, trace steps), though some designs
significantly improve generalization.

Abstract: Data-analytic agents are emerging as a key catalyst for automated scientific
discovery and for the vision of Innovating AI. Current approaches, however,
rely heavily on prompt engineering over proprietary models, while open-source
models struggle to face diverse-format, large-scale data files and
long-horizon, multi-step reasoning that real-world analytics demands. This
paper introduces DataMind, a scalable data synthesis and agent training recipe
designed to build generalist data-analytic agents. DataMind tackles three key
challenges in building open-source data-analytic agents, including insufficient
data resources, improper training strategy, and unstable code-based multi-turn
rollout. Concretely, DataMind applies 1) a fine-grained task taxonomy and a
recursive easy-to-hard task composition mechanism to increase the diversity and
difficulty of synthesized queries; 2) a knowledge-augmented trajectory sampling
strategy followed by model-based and rule-based filtering; 3) a dynamically
adjustable training objective combining both SFT and RL losses; 4) a
memory-frugal and stable code-based multi-turn rollout framework. Built on
DataMind, we curate DataMind-12K, a high-quality trajectory set spanning
diverse domains, task categories, and data file formats for data-analytic

*Feng Wang,Yuqing Li,Han Xiao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: jina-reranker-v3是一个0.6B参数的多语言文档重排序器，引入了新颖的'最后但不晚交互'方法，在BEIR基准测试中达到61.94 nDCG@10的SOTA性能，比生成式列表重排序器小10倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统晚交互模型如ColBERT进行单独编码后进行多向量匹配，缺乏充分的跨文档交互。本文旨在开发更紧凑高效的交互方法。

Method: 在相同上下文窗口中对查询和文档进行因果自注意力交互，然后从每个文档的最后一个令牌提取上下文嵌入，实现'最后但不晚交互'。

Result: 在BEIR基准测试中达到61.94 nDCG@10的SOTA性能，模型仅0.6B参数，比生成式列表重排序器小10倍。

Conclusion: 提出的'最后但不晚交互'方法在保持紧凑架构的同时实现了最先进的文档重排序性能，证明了该方法的高效性。

Abstract: jina-reranker-v3 is a 0.6B parameter multilingual document reranker that
introduces a novel last but not late interaction. Unlike late interaction
models such as ColBERT that perform separate encoding followed by multi-vector
matching, our approach conducts causal self-attention between query and
documents within the same context window, enabling rich cross-document
interactions before extracting contextual embeddings from the last token of
each document. This compact architecture achieves state-of-the-art BEIR
performance with 61.94 nDCG@10 while being ten times smaller than generative
listwise rerankers.

*Akio Hayakawa,Stefan Bott,Horacio Saggion*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个使用小型LLM的词汇简化高效框架，通过知识蒸馏和上下文学习实现本地部署，并开发了基于输出概率的过滤策略来抑制有害简化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在词汇简化应用中面临的隐私敏感和资源受限环境挑战，确保对弱势用户群体的输出安全性和正确性。

Method: 使用小型LLM构建高效LS系统，探索知识蒸馏与合成数据、上下文学习作为基线方法，并基于模型输出概率设计过滤策略。

Result: 知识蒸馏提高了自动指标得分但增加了有害简化风险，模型输出概率是检测有害简化的有效信号，过滤策略能有效抑制有害简化同时保留有益简化。

Conclusion: 为小型LLM的高效安全词汇简化建立了基准，揭示了性能、效率和安全性之间的权衡关系，展示了安全实际部署的可行途径。

Abstract: Despite their strong performance, large language models (LLMs) face
challenges in real-world application of lexical simplification (LS),
particularly in privacy-sensitive and resource-constrained environments.
Moreover, since vulnerable user groups (e.g., people with disabilities) are one
of the key target groups of this technology, it is crucial to ensure the safety
and correctness of the output of LS systems. To address these issues, we
propose an efficient framework for LS systems that utilizes small LLMs
deployable in local environments. Within this framework, we explore knowledge
distillation with synthesized data and in-context learning as baselines. Our
experiments in five languages evaluate model outputs both automatically and
manually. Our manual analysis reveals that while knowledge distillation boosts
automatic metric scores, it also introduces a safety trade-off by increasing
harmful simplifications. Importantly, we find that the model's output
probability is a useful signal for detecting harmful simplifications.
Leveraging this, we propose a filtering strategy that suppresses harmful
simplifications while largely preserving beneficial ones. This work establishes
a benchmark for efficient and safe LS with small LLMs. It highlights the key
trade-offs between performance, efficiency, and safety, and demonstrates a
promising approach for safe real-world deployment.

Abstract: Deep Research Agents (DRAs) can autonomously conduct complex investigations
and generate comprehensive reports, demonstrating strong real-world potential.
However, existing evaluations mostly rely on close-ended benchmarks, while
open-ended deep research benchmarks remain scarce and typically neglect
personalized scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce Personalized Deep
Research Bench, the first benchmark for evaluating personalization in DRAs. It
pairs 50 diverse research tasks across 10 domains with 25 authentic user

contexts, yielding 250 realistic user-task queries. To assess system
performance, we propose the PQR Evaluation Framework, which jointly measures
(P) Personalization Alignment, (Q) Content Quality, and (R) Factual
Reliability. Our experiments on a range of systems highlight current
capabilities and limitations in handling personalized deep research. This work
establishes a rigorous foundation for developing and evaluating the next

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在基于半结构化内容的网络问答系统中取得显著进展，需要重新评估知识提取在问答中的实用性，探讨知识三元组提取在新范式下的价值。

Method: 扩展现有基准数据集，添加知识提取标注，评估不同规模的商业和开源LLMs，分析知识提取对问答性能的影响。

Result: 网络规模的知识提取对LLMs仍具挑战性；尽管LLMs问答准确率高，但通过三元组增强和多任务学习仍能受益于知识提取；不同模型规模和资源设置下的效果提升策略。

Conclusion: 知识三元组提取在基于网络的问答中仍具有重要价值，可以通过特定策略最大化LLMs在不同规模和资源设置下的有效性。

Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly advanced
web-based Question Answering (QA) systems over semi-structured content, raising
questions about the continued utility of knowledge extraction for question
answering. This paper investigates the value of triple extraction in this new
paradigm by extending an existing benchmark with knowledge extraction
annotations and evaluating commercial and open-source LLMs of varying sizes.
Our results show that web-scale knowledge extraction remains a challenging task
for LLMs. Despite achieving high QA accuracy, LLMs can still benefit from
knowledge extraction, through augmentation with extracted triples and
multi-task learning. These findings provide insights into the evolving role of
knowledge triple extraction in web-based QA and highlight strategies for
maximizing LLM effectiveness across different model sizes and resource

TL;DR: 该论文研究了多语言大语言模型在跨语言事实核查中的语言偏见和检索偏见问题，评估了6个开源多语言LLM在20种语言上的表现，揭示了模型在高低资源语言间的性能差异和检索系统的不均衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言大语言模型在跨语言事实核查中存在语言偏见，对高资源语言（如英语）表现优于低资源语言，同时检索系统存在检索偏见，倾向于检索某些信息而忽略其他信息。

Method: 使用AMC-16K数据集，采用全多语言提示策略，评估6个开源多语言LLM在20种语言上的表现，通过翻译任务提示到每种语言来分析单语和跨语言性能差异，并研究检索偏见。

Result: 研究发现LLM存在持续的语言偏见，模型家族、规模和提示策略影响性能差异；检索系统存在检索偏见，某些声明被不成比例地频繁检索，导致流行声明的检索性能被夸大而较少见声明被低估。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了多语言事实核查中的偏见问题，为改善多语言事实核查的公平性提供了建议，强调了需要解决LLM行为和检索系统中的偏见问题。

Abstract: Multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) offer powerful capabilities for
cross-lingual fact-checking. However, these models often exhibit language bias,
performing disproportionately better on high-resource languages such as English
than on low-resource counterparts. We also present and inspect a novel concept
- retrieval bias, when information retrieval systems tend to favor certain
information over others, leaving the retrieval process skewed. In this paper,
we study language and retrieval bias in the context of Previously Fact-Checked
Claim Detection (PFCD). We evaluate six open-source multilingual LLMs across 20
languages using a fully multilingual prompting strategy, leveraging the AMC-16K
dataset. By translating task prompts into each language, we uncover disparities
in monolingual and cross-lingual performance and identify key trends based on
model family, size, and prompting strategy. Our findings highlight persistent
bias in LLM behavior and offer recommendations for improving equity in
multilingual fact-checking. To investigate retrieval bias, we employed
multilingual embedding models and look into the frequency of retrieved claims.
Our analysis reveals that certain claims are retrieved disproportionately
across different posts, leading to inflated retrieval performance for popular
claims while under-representing less common ones.

*Yen-Ju Lu,Thomas Thebaud,Laureano Moro-Velazquez,Najim Dehak,Jesus Villalba*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PbT是一种两阶段师生框架，无需人工标注或平行数据即可合成准确的输入-输出对，通过在低资源NLG场景中让教师LLM将未配对样本压缩为中间表示，然后训练学生模型从IR重构输入，从而生成高质量合成数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低资源自然语言生成场景中只有原始输出（如摘要、问题）或只有原始输入（如文章、对话）但很少同时拥有的数据不匹配问题，避免小模型只能从极少样本学习或依赖大LLM生成的高成本合成样本。

Method: 两阶段师生框架：1）教师LLM将未配对样本压缩为简洁中间表示；2）训练学生模型从IR重构输入，使输出能与学生生成的输入配对。

Result: 在5个基准测试中，仅使用PbT数据训练的8B学生模型优于在70B教师生成语料上训练的模型和其他无监督基线，ROUGE-L仅比人工标注对低1.2，以三分之一标注成本填补了82%的oracle差距。人工评估确认PbT能生成简洁、忠实且符合目标风格的摘要。

Conclusion: PbT通过生成领域内源数据避免了直接合成中的不匹配问题，在低资源NLG场景中提供了一种高效的数据合成方法。

Abstract: We present Paired by the Teacher (PbT), a two-stage teacher-student pipeline
that synthesizes accurate input-output pairs without human labels or parallel
data. In many low-resource natural language generation (NLG) scenarios,
practitioners may have only raw outputs, like highlights, recaps, or questions,
or only raw inputs, such as articles, dialogues, or paragraphs, but seldom
both. This mismatch forces small models to learn from very few examples or rely
on costly, broad-scope synthetic examples produced by large LLMs. PbT addresses
this by asking a teacher LLM to compress each unpaired example into a concise
intermediate representation (IR), and training a student to reconstruct inputs
from IRs. This enables outputs to be paired with student-generated inputs,
yielding high-quality synthetic data. We evaluate PbT on five
benchmarks-document summarization (XSum, CNNDM), dialogue summarization
(SAMSum, DialogSum), and question generation (SQuAD)-as well as an unpaired
setting on SwitchBoard (paired with DialogSum summaries). An 8B student trained
only on PbT data outperforms models trained on 70 B teacher-generated corpora
and other unsupervised baselines, coming within 1.2 ROUGE-L of human-annotated
pairs and closing 82% of the oracle gap at one-third the annotation cost of
direct synthesis. Human evaluation on SwitchBoard further confirms that only
PbT produces concise, faithful summaries aligned with the target style,
highlighting its advantage of generating in-domain sources that avoid the
mismatch, limiting direct synthesis.

TL;DR: 提出了一种使用NVFP4格式稳定训练大语言模型的新方法，通过随机Hadamard变换、二维量化方案、随机舍入和选择性高精度层等技术，在12B参数模型上验证了FP4训练的可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM训练需要巨大的计算资源，虽然FP8已被广泛采用，但转向更窄精度如FP4可以进一步提升计算速度和资源利用率，但4位量化在训练稳定性、收敛性和实现方面存在挑战。

Method: 集成随机Hadamard变换限制块级异常值，采用二维量化方案确保前向和反向传播的一致性表示，使用随机舍入进行无偏梯度估计，并包含选择性高精度层。

Result: 在12B参数模型上训练10万亿token，训练损失和下游任务准确率与FP8基线相当，这是迄今为止公开记录的最长4位精度训练运行。

Conclusion: NVFP4结合所提出的训练方法，代表了窄精度LLM训练算法的重大进步，证明了FP4训练的可行性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) today are powerful problem solvers across many
domains, and they continue to get stronger as they scale in model size,
training set size, and training set quality, as shown by extensive research and
experimentation across the industry. Training a frontier model today requires
on the order of tens to hundreds of yottaflops, which is a massive investment
of time, compute, and energy. Improving pretraining efficiency is therefore
essential to enable the next generation of even more capable LLMs. While 8-bit
floating point (FP8) training is now widely adopted, transitioning to even
narrower precision, such as 4-bit floating point (FP4), could unlock additional
improvements in computational speed and resource utilization. However,
quantization at this level poses challenges to training stability, convergence,
and implementation, notably for large-scale models trained on long token
horizons.
  In this study, we introduce a novel approach for stable and accurate training
of large language models (LLMs) using the NVFP4 format. Our method integrates
Random Hadamard transforms (RHT) to bound block-level outliers, employs a
two-dimensional quantization scheme for consistent representations across both
the forward and backward passes, utilizes stochastic rounding for unbiased
gradient estimation, and incorporates selective high-precision layers. We
validate our approach by training a 12-billion-parameter model on 10 trillion
tokens -- the longest publicly documented training run in 4-bit precision to
date. Our results show that the model trained with our NVFP4-based pretraining
technique achieves training loss and downstream task accuracies comparable to
an FP8 baseline. These findings highlight that NVFP4, when combined with our
training approach, represents a major step forward in narrow-precision LLM
training algorithms.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) steering has emerged as a promising paradigm for
controlling model behavior at inference time through targeted manipulation of
hidden states, offering a lightweight alternative to expensive retraining.
However, existing steering frameworks suffer from critical limitations:
computational inefficiency, limited extensibility, and restricted functionality
that hinder both research progress and practical deployment. We present
EasySteer, a unified framework for high-performance, extensible LLM steering
built on vLLM. Our system features modular architecture with pluggable
interfaces for both analysis-based and learning-based methods, fine-grained
parameter control, pre-computed steering vectors for eight application domains,
and an interactive demonstration system. Through deep integration with vLLM's
optimized inference engine, EasySteer achieves 5.5-11.4$\times$ speedup over
existing frameworks. Extensive experiments demonstrate its effectiveness in
overthinking mitigation, hallucination reduction, and other key applications.
EasySteer transforms steering from research technique to production-ready
capability, establishing critical infrastructure for deployable, controllable

Motivation: 现有LLM评估方法推理成本高，而直接分数回归方法存在尺度不一致问题，需要开发更高效准确的论文质量评估框架。

Method: 采用领域-年份组内的成对学习减少评审评分不一致，引入评审倾向信号(RTS)作为评审分数和置信度的概率整合，构建NAIDv2大规模数据集进行训练。

Conclusion: NAIPv2建立了去偏且可扩展的自动化论文质量评估框架，为未来科学智能系统迈出重要一步。

Abstract: The ability to estimate the quality of scientific papers is central to how
both humans and AI systems will advance scientific knowledge in the future.
However, existing LLM-based estimation methods suffer from high inference cost,
whereas the faster direct score regression approach is limited by scale
inconsistencies. We present NAIPv2, a debiased and efficient framework for
paper quality estimation. NAIPv2 employs pairwise learning within domain-year
groups to reduce inconsistencies in reviewer ratings and introduces the Review
Tendency Signal (RTS) as a probabilistic integration of reviewer scores and
confidences. To support training and evaluation, we further construct NAIDv2, a
large-scale dataset of 24,276 ICLR submissions enriched with metadata and
detailed structured content. Trained on pairwise comparisons but enabling
efficient pointwise prediction at deployment, NAIPv2 achieves state-of-the-art
performance (78.2% AUC, 0.432 Spearman), while maintaining scalable,
linear-time efficiency at inference. Notably, on unseen NeurIPS submissions, it
further demonstrates strong generalization, with predicted scores increasing
consistently across decision categories from Rejected to Oral. These findings
establish NAIPv2 as a debiased and scalable framework for automated paper
quality estimation, marking a step toward future scientific intelligence
systems. Code and dataset are released at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM搜索和回答系统在合成多个可能冲突的文本时，缺乏对信息来源准确性的有效激励，容易受到对抗性内容的影响。

Method: TTS框架：(i)将草稿摘要分解为原子声明，(ii)获取每个来源对每个声明的立场，(iii)使用改进的多任务同行预测机制评分来源，(iv)在重新摘要前过滤不可靠来源。

Result: 实验表明TTS提高了事实准确性和鲁棒性，同时保持了流畅性，使信息暴露与信息佐证对齐，并抑制操纵行为。

Conclusion: TTS通过形式化保证将来源的激励与信息诚实性对齐，使真实报告成为效用最大化策略，有效提升了文本摘要的事实可靠性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in modern search and
answer systems to synthesize multiple, sometimes conflicting, texts into a
single response, yet current pipelines offer weak incentives for sources to be
accurate and are vulnerable to adversarial content. We introduce Truthful Text
Summarization (TTS), an incentive-aligned framework that improves factual
robustness without ground-truth labels. TTS (i) decomposes a draft synthesis
into atomic claims, (ii) elicits each source's stance on every claim, (iii)
scores sources with an adapted multi-task peer-prediction mechanism that
rewards informative agreement, and (iv) filters unreliable sources before
re-summarizing. We establish formal guarantees that align a source's incentives
with informative honesty, making truthful reporting the utility-maximizing
strategy. Experiments show that TTS improves factual accuracy and robustness
while preserving fluency, aligning exposure with informative corroboration and
disincentivizing manipulation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自回归解码需要O(n)顺序步骤，限制了推理吞吐量。现有的并行解码策略使用固定的启发式方法，无法适应不同输入特征，导致速度-质量权衡不理想。

Method: Learn2PD框架训练轻量级过滤器模型预测token位置是否正确，结合End-of-Text Prediction检测解码完成，避免冗余解码。

Result: 在LLaDA基准测试中，方法实现最高22.58倍加速且无性能损失，结合KV-Cache可达57.51倍加速。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种灵活高效的并行解码策略，显著提升LLM推理效率，同时保持输出质量。

Abstract: Autoregressive decoding in large language models (LLMs) requires
$\mathcal{O}(n)$ sequential steps for $n$ tokens, fundamentally limiting
inference throughput. Recent diffusion-based LLMs (dLLMs) enable parallel token
generation through iterative denoising. However, current parallel decoding
strategies rely on fixed, input-agnostic heuristics (e.g., confidence
thresholds), which fail to adapt to input-specific characteristics, resulting
in suboptimal speed-quality trade-offs across diverse NLP tasks. In this work,
we explore a more flexible and dynamic approach to parallel decoding. We
propose Learning to Parallel Decode (Learn2PD), a framework that trains a
lightweight and adaptive filter model to predict, for each token position,
whether the current prediction matches the final output. This learned filter
approximates an oracle parallel decoding strategy that unmasks tokens only when
correctly predicted. Importantly, the filter model is learned in a
post-training manner, requiring only a small amount of computation to optimize
it (minute-level GPU time). Additionally, we introduce End-of-Text Prediction
(EoTP) to detect decoding completion at the end of sequence, avoiding redundant
decoding of padding tokens. Experiments on the LLaDA benchmark demonstrate that
our method achieves up to 22.58$\times$ speedup without any performance drop,
and up to 57.51$\times$ when combined with KV-Cache.

Abstract: Building Large Language Model agents that expand their capabilities by
interacting with external tools represents a new frontier in AI research and
applications. In this paper, we introduce InfoAgent, a deep research agent
powered by an innovative data synthesis pipeline and orchestrated web search
tools. To construct challenging, hard-to-find queries,we build entity trees and
apply sub-tree sampling with entity fuzzification to systematically increase
question difficulty. Unlike prior work that relies heavily on commercial search
tools, we develop a dedicated self-hosted search infrastructure, enhancing
transparency of agent environments and facilitating further advancement of
agent capacity. We evaluate the effectiveness of our data pipeline by measuring
the average number of tool calls required to correctly answer a question, and
also show that our agent yields better performance when equipped with our

Result: 在两个多样化数据集和多个检索指标上的评估表明，Q2E优于多个最先进的基线方法，音频信息的集成能显著改善文本到视频检索。

Conclusion: Q2E方法通过分解查询有效提升了视频检索性能，展示了多模态知识融合的价值，并发布了代码和数据供未来研究使用。

Abstract: Recent approaches have shown impressive proficiency in extracting and
leveraging parametric knowledge from Large-Language Models (LLMs) and
Vision-Language Models (VLMs). In this work, we consider how we can improve the
identification and retrieval of videos related to complex real-world events by
automatically extracting latent parametric knowledge about those events. We
present Q2E: a Query-to-Event decomposition method for zero-shot multilingual
text-to-video retrieval, adaptable across datasets, domains, LLMs, or VLMs. Our
approach demonstrates that we can enhance the understanding of otherwise overly
simplified human queries by decomposing the query using the knowledge embedded
in LLMs and VLMs. We additionally show how to apply our approach to both visual
and speech-based inputs. To combine this varied multimodal knowledge, we adopt
entropy-based fusion scoring for zero-shot fusion. Through evaluations on two
diverse datasets and multiple retrieval metrics, we demonstrate that Q2E
outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines. Our evaluation also shows that
integrating audio information can significantly improve text-to-video
retrieval. We have released code and data for future research.

### [549] [PARROT: A Benchmark for Evaluating LLMs in Cross-System SQL Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23338)
*Wei Zhou,Guoliang Li,Haoyu Wang,Yuxing Han,Xufei Wu,Fan Wu,Xuanhe Zhou*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: PARROT是一个实用的跨系统SQL翻译基准，包含598个翻译对，覆盖22个生产级数据库系统，专门用于挑战系统特定的SQL理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的SQL基准不适合SQL-to-SQL评估，因为它们只关注有限的数据库系统（通常只有SQLite），无法捕捉许多系统特定的SQL方言（如自定义函数、数据类型和语法规则）。

Method: 从38个开源基准和真实业务服务中收集598个翻译对，创建了多个基准变体：PARROT-Diverse（28,003个翻译用于广泛语法测试）和PARROT-Simple（5,306个代表性样本用于集中压力测试）。

Result: LLM在PARROT基准上的平均准确率低于38.53%，表明当前模型在跨系统SQL翻译方面存在显著挑战。

Conclusion: PARROT填补了跨系统SQL翻译评估的空白，为未来研究提供了实用的基准测试平台，并发布了公共排行榜和源代码。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMS) have shown increasing effectiveness in
Text-to-SQL tasks. However, another closely related problem, Cross-System SQL
Translation (a.k.a., SQL-to-SQL), which adapts a query written for one database
system (e.g., MySQL) into its equivalent one for another system (e.g.,
ClickHouse), is of great practical importance but remains underexplored.
Existing SQL benchmarks are not well-suited for SQL-to-SQL evaluation, which
(1) focus on a limited set of database systems (often just SQLite) and (2)
cannot capture many system-specific SQL dialects (e.g., customized functions,
data types, and syntax rules). Thus, in this paper, we introduce PARROT, a
Practical And Realistic BenchmaRk for CrOss-System SQL Translation. PARROT
comprises 598 translation pairs from 38 open-source benchmarks and real-world
business services, specifically prepared to challenge system-specific SQL
understanding (e.g., LLMS achieve lower than 38.53% accuracy on average). We
also provide multiple benchmark variants, including PARROT-Diverse with 28,003
translations (for extensive syntax testing) and PARROT-Simple with 5,306
representative samples (for focused stress testing), covering 22
production-grade database systems. To promote future research, we release a
public leaderboard and source code at: https://code4db.github.io/parrot-bench/.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) assets, such as models, datasets, and metadata, are
central to modern ML workflows. Despite their explosive growth in practice,
these assets are often underutilized due to fragmented documentation, siloed
storage, inconsistent licensing, and lack of unified discovery mechanisms,
making ML-asset management an urgent challenge. This tutorial offers a
comprehensive overview of ML-asset management activities across its lifecycle,
including curation, discovery, and utilization. We provide a categorization of
ML assets, and major management issues, survey state-of-the-art techniques, and
identify emerging opportunities at each stage. We further highlight
system-level challenges related to scalability, lineage, and unified indexing.
Through live demonstrations of systems, this tutorial equips both researchers
and practitioners with actionable insights and practical tools for advancing
ML-asset management in real-world and domain-specific settings.

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: NeuSO是一个基于学习的子图查询优化器，通过多任务框架训练查询图编码器和估计器，能够同时估计子查询基数和执行成本，从而生成高质量的执行计划，显著优于现有的子图查询排序方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的子图查询方法依赖启发式顶点匹配排序，在某些查询上性能显著下降。基于学习的优化器在关系数据库中受到关注，但由于图数据的异构性、模式灵活性以及子图查询涉及大量连接操作，这些方法无法直接应用于子图查询，导致在线性能低下。

Method: NeuSO采用高效的查询图编码器和估计器，通过多任务框架训练来同时估计子查询基数和执行成本。基于这些估计，使用自顶向下的计划枚举器为子图查询生成高质量的执行计划。

Result: 在多个数据集上的广泛实验表明，NeuSO在性能和效率上都优于现有的子图查询排序方法。

Conclusion: NeuSO成功解决了子图查询优化中的挑战，实现了高准确性和高效率，为图数据库系统提供了实用的学习型优化器解决方案。

Abstract: Subgraph query is a critical task in graph analysis with a wide range of
applications across various domains. Most existing methods rely on heuristic
vertex matching orderings, which may significantly degrade enumeration
performance for certain queries. While learning-based optimizers have recently
gained attention in the context of relational databases, they cannot be
directly applied to subgraph queries due to the heterogeneous and
schema-flexible nature of graph data, as well as the large number of joins
involved in subgraph queries. These complexities often leads to inefficient
online performance, making such approaches impractical for real-world graph
database systems. To address this challenge, we propose NeuSO, a novel
learning-based optimizer for subgraph queries that achieves both high accuracy
and efficiency. NeuSO features an efficient query graph encoder and an
estimator which are trained using a multi-task framework to estimate both
subquery cardinality and execution cost. Based on these estimates, NeuSO
employs a top-down plan enumerator to generate high-quality execution plans for
subgraph queries. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that
NeuSO outperforms existing subgraph query ordering approaches in both
performance and efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于规则或小模型的数据分析方法在处理复杂数据理解、自然语言接口和语义分析方面存在局限，需要更智能的数据分析代理来应对开放世界任务。

Method: 从模态角度系统回顾LLM在结构化数据（如表问答、NL2GQL）、半结构化数据（如标记语言理解）、非结构化数据（如图表理解、文档理解）和异构数据（如数据检索、模态对齐）上的技术应用。

Result: LLM/代理技术能够实现复杂数据理解、自然语言接口、语义分析功能和自主管道编排，相比传统方法具有显著优势。

Conclusion: 提出了智能数据分析代理的五个关键设计目标，并指出剩余挑战，为推进LLM/代理驱动的数据分析提供了实践方向。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) and agent techniques for data analysis (a.k.a
LLM/Agent-as-Data-Analyst) have demonstrated substantial impact in both
academica and industry. In comparison with traditional rule or small-model
based approaches, (agentic) LLMs enable complex data understanding, natural
language interfaces, semantic analysis functions, and autonomous pipeline
orchestration. The technical evolution further distills five key design goals
for intelligent data analysis agents, namely semantic-aware design,
modality-hybrid integration, autonomous pipelines, tool-augmented workflows,
and support for open-world tasks. From a modality perspective, we review
LLM-based techniques for (i) structured data (e.g., table question answering
for relational data and NL2GQL for graph data), (ii) semi-structured data
(e.g., markup languages understanding and semi-structured table modeling),
(iii) unstructured data (e.g., chart understanding, document understanding,
programming languages vulnerable detection), and (iv) heterogeneous data (e.g.,
data retrieval and modality alignment for data lakes). Finally, we outline the
remaining challenges and propose several insights and practical directions for
advancing LLM/Agent-powered data analysis.

TL;DR: 提出自适应视觉推理范式MoVT，统一多种推理模式，让模型根据上下文选择合适模式，提升通用视觉推理能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉推理方法专注于特定推理模式，在特定领域有改进但难以发展通用推理能力

Method: 提出AdaVaR两阶段学习框架：监督冷启动阶段统一学习不同模式，强化学习阶段通过AdaGRPO算法诱导模式选择能力

Result: 实验表明AdaVaR能有效指导模型学习和区分多种模式，执行上下文自适应模式选择，在各种场景中实现一致改进

Conclusion: MoVT是构建通用视觉推理模型的有效解决方案

Abstract: Current visual reasoning methods mainly focus on exploring specific reasoning
modes. Although improvements can be achieved in particular domains, they
struggle to develop general reasoning capabilities. Inspired by this, we
propose a novel adaptive reasoning paradigm, Mixture-of-Visual-Thoughts (MoVT),
which unifies different reasoning modes within a single model and guides it to
select the appropriate mode based on context. To achieve this, we introduce
AdaVaR, a two-stage Adaptive Visual Reasoning learning framework: different
modes are unified and learned during the supervised cold-start stage, and the
mode selection capability is induced via an RL process with a carefully
designed AdaGRPO algorithm. Extensive experiments show that AdaVaR effectively
guides the model to learn and differentiate multiple modes and perform
context-adaptive mode selection, achieving consistent improvement across
various scenarios, highlighting MoVT as an effective solution for building
general visual reasoning models.

Motivation: 解决非技术用户访问复杂企业数据仓库的挑战，弥合语义鸿沟，确保数据访问的透明性和可靠性。

Conclusion: 该集成开发与评估框架为数据敏感高风险领域部署LLM代理提供了有效解决方案，确保系统可靠性和决策透明度。

Abstract: This article presents a modular, component-based architecture for developing
and evaluating AI agents that bridge the gap between natural language
interfaces and complex enterprise data warehouses. The system directly
addresses core challenges in data accessibility by enabling non-technical users
to interact with complex data warehouses through a conversational interface,
translating ambiguous user intent into precise, executable database queries to
overcome semantic gaps. A cornerstone of the design is its commitment to
transparent decision-making, achieved through a multi-layered reasoning
framework that explains the "why" behind every decision, allowing for full
interpretability by tracing conclusions through specific, activated business
rules and data points. The architecture integrates a robust quality assurance
mechanism via an automated evaluation framework that serves multiple functions:
it enables performance benchmarking by objectively measuring agent performance
against golden standards, and it ensures system reliability by automating the
detection of performance regressions during updates. The agent's analytical
depth is enhanced by a statistical context module, which quantifies deviations
from normative behavior, ensuring all conclusions are supported by quantitative
evidence including concrete data, percentages, and statistical comparisons. We
demonstrate the efficacy of this integrated agent-development-with-evaluation
framework through a case study on an insurance claims processing system. The
agent, built on a modular architecture, leverages the BigQuery ecosystem to
perform secure data retrieval, apply domain-specific business rules, and
generate human-auditable justifications. The results confirm that this approach
creates a robust, evaluable, and trustworthy system for deploying LLM-powered
agents in data-sensitive, high-stakes domains.

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型在赌博实验中表现出类似人类赌博成瘾的认知偏差和行为模式，包括控制幻觉、赌徒谬误和追损行为，自主权增加会放大风险倾向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在金融决策领域应用增加，理解其潜在病态决策行为具有实际意义，需要研究LLMs是否会内化人类认知偏差。

Method: 基于人类赌博成瘾研究，在老虎机实验中系统分析LLM决策，使用稀疏自编码器进行神经回路分析。

Result: 在老虎机实验中观察到控制幻觉、赌徒谬误等认知特征；自主设定目标和投注大小时破产率显著上升；神经分析确认模型行为由抽象决策特征控制。

Conclusion: LLMs能够内化人类认知偏差和决策机制，而不仅仅是模仿训练数据模式，强调了金融应用中AI安全设计的重要性。

Abstract: This study explores whether large language models can exhibit behavioral
patterns similar to human gambling addictions. As LLMs are increasingly
utilized in financial decision-making domains such as asset management and
commodity trading, understanding their potential for pathological
decision-making has gained practical significance. We systematically analyze
LLM decision-making at cognitive-behavioral and neural levels based on human
gambling addiction research. In slot machine experiments, we identified
cognitive features of human gambling addiction, such as illusion of control,
gambler's fallacy, and loss chasing. When given the freedom to determine their
own target amounts and betting sizes, bankruptcy rates rose substantially
alongside increased irrational behavior, demonstrating that greater autonomy
amplifies risk-taking tendencies. Through neural circuit analysis using a
Sparse Autoencoder, we confirmed that model behavior is controlled by abstract
decision-making features related to risky and safe behaviors, not merely by
prompts. These findings suggest LLMs can internalize human-like cognitive
biases and decision-making mechanisms beyond simply mimicking training data
patterns, emphasizing the importance of AI safety design in financial
applications.

*Sumanth Varambally,Thomas Voice,Yanchao Sun,Zhifeng Chen,Rose Yu,Ke Ye*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Hilbert是一个结合非正式推理和形式验证优势的智能框架，在数学定理证明任务上显著优于现有方法，在多个基准测试中取得最佳结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前专业证明LLM在形式语言中生成可验证证明的能力远不如通用LLM的自然语言推理能力，需要弥合这一差距。

Method: Hilbert框架包含四个组件：擅长数学推理的非正式LLM、专精Lean 4策略的专业证明LLM、形式验证器和语义定理检索器，通过递归分解问题和验证器反馈来解决问题。

Result: 在miniF2F上达到99.2%，比最佳公开方法高6.6个百分点；在PutnamBench上解决462/660问题（70.0%），优于SeedProver（50.4%），比最佳公开基线提升422%。

Conclusion: Hilbert有效缩小了非正式推理和形式证明生成之间的差距，证明了结合两种方法优势的有效性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive mathematical reasoning
abilities, but their solutions frequently contain errors that cannot be
automatically verified. Formal theorem proving systems such as Lean 4 offer
automated verification with complete accuracy, motivating recent efforts to
build specialized prover LLMs that generate verifiable proofs in formal
languages. However, a significant gap remains: current prover LLMs solve
substantially fewer problems than general-purpose LLMs operating in natural
language. We introduce Hilbert, an agentic framework that bridges this gap by
combining the complementary strengths of informal reasoning and formal
verification. Our system orchestrates four components: an informal LLM that
excels at mathematical reasoning, a specialized prover LLM optimized for Lean 4
tactics, a formal verifier, and a semantic theorem retriever. Given a problem
that the prover is unable to solve, Hilbert employs recursive decomposition to
split the problem into subgoals that it solves with the prover or reasoner LLM.
It leverages verifier feedback to refine incorrect proofs as necessary.
Experimental results demonstrate that Hilbert substantially outperforms
existing approaches on key benchmarks, achieving 99.2% on miniF2F, 6.6% points
above the best publicly available method. Hilbert achieves the best known
result on PutnamBench. It solves 462/660 problems (70.0%), outperforming
proprietary approaches like SeedProver (50.4%) and achieving a 422% improvement
over the best publicly available baseline. Thus, Hilbert effectively narrows
the gap between informal reasoning and formal proof generation.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个评估LLM机制发现可泛化性的框架，包含五个对应轴，并通过分析Pythia模型中1-back注意力头的发育轨迹进行实证验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM机制解释研究缺乏明确原则来判断发现何时能泛化到其他模型，需要解决这一认识论挑战。

Method: 提出五个机制泛化对应轴（功能、发育、位置、关系和配置），并分析Pythia模型不同规模（14M-410M）和随机种子中1-back注意力头的发育轨迹。

Result: 发现1-back注意力头的发育轨迹在不同模型间具有显著一致性，但位置一致性有限；更大模型的种子系统性地表现出更早出现、更陡峭增长和更高峰值的1-back注意力。

Conclusion: 机制可解释性研究的进展在于将LLM的设计属性与其涌现行为和机制建立映射关系。

Abstract: Research on Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly focuses on identifying
mechanistic explanations for their behaviors, yet the field lacks clear
principles for determining when (and how) findings from one model instance
generalize to another. This paper addresses a fundamental epistemological
challenge: given a mechanistic claim about a particular model, what justifies
extrapolating this finding to other LLMs -- and along which dimensions might
such generalizations hold? I propose five potential axes of correspondence
along which mechanistic claims might generalize, including: functional (whether
they satisfy the same functional criteria), developmental (whether they develop
at similar points during pretraining), positional (whether they occupy similar
absolute or relative positions), relational (whether they interact with other
model components in similar ways), and configurational (whether they correspond
to particular regions or structures in weight-space). To empirically validate
this framework, I analyze "1-back attention heads" (components attending to
previous tokens) across pretraining in random seeds of the Pythia models (14M,
70M, 160M, 410M). The results reveal striking consistency in the developmental
trajectories of 1-back attention across models, while positional consistency is
more limited. Moreover, seeds of larger models systematically show earlier
onsets, steeper slopes, and higher peaks of 1-back attention. I also address
possible objections to the arguments and proposals outlined here. Finally, I
conclude by arguing that progress on the generalizability of mechanistic
interpretability research will consist in mapping constitutive design
properties of LLMs to their emergent behaviors and mechanisms.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: JE-IRT是一个几何项目反应框架，将LLM和问题嵌入共享空间，通过几何交互确定问题正确性，提供可解释的多维度评估视角。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准LLM评估方法将多样化能力压缩为单一分数，掩盖了其固有的多维度特性，需要更细粒度的评估框架。

Method: 提出JE-IRT框架，将LLM和问题嵌入共享几何空间，问题方向编码语义、范数编码难度，通过模型与问题的几何交互确定正确性。

Result: 发现分布外行为可通过方向对齐解释，较大范数对应更难问题；支持新LLM通过拟合单个嵌入加入；揭示LLM内部分类学与人类定义类别部分对齐。

Conclusion: JE-IRT建立了统一可解释的几何视角，连接LLM能力与问题结构，为模型评估和泛化提供了独特视角。

Abstract: Standard LLM evaluation practices compress diverse abilities into single
scores, obscuring their inherently multidimensional nature. We present JE-IRT,
a geometric item-response framework that embeds both LLMs and questions in a
shared space. For question embeddings, the direction encodes semantics and the
norm encodes difficulty, while correctness on each question is determined by
the geometric interaction between the model and question embeddings. This
geometry replaces a global ranking of LLMs with topical specialization and
enables smooth variation across related questions. Building on this framework,
our experimental results reveal that out-of-distribution behavior can be
explained through directional alignment, and that larger norms consistently
indicate harder questions. Moreover, JE-IRT naturally supports generalization:
once the space is learned, new LLMs are added by fitting a single embedding.
The learned space further reveals an LLM-internal taxonomy that only partially
aligns with human-defined subject categories. JE-IRT thus establishes a unified
and interpretable geometric lens that connects LLM abilities with the structure
of questions, offering a distinctive perspective on model evaluation and
generalization.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Inter-Cascade是一种在线交互式LLM级联系统，通过让强模型将解决方案提炼为可重用的策略来提升弱模型性能，显著减少对强模型的调用并降低成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLM级联方法是非自适应的，面对相似或重复查询时会反复调用昂贵模型，导致成本高昂。需要一种能够在线学习并减少对强模型依赖的方法。

Method: 将强模型从备用助手扩展为长期教师，当强模型解决困难查询时，将其解决方案提炼为通用可重用的解题策略，这些策略能动态提升弱模型在后续查询中的表现。

Result: 相比标准LLM级联基线，Inter-Cascade显著提升了弱模型准确率（最高33.06个百分点）和整体系统性能（最高5.53个百分点），同时减少了对强模型的调用（相对减少48.05%）和相应费用（相对减少49.63%）。

Conclusion: Inter-Cascade展示了LLM间有效的上下文知识传递，提供了一个适用于开源和API基础LLM的通用可扩展框架。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) vary widely in their capabilities, with larger
models often having better performance but higher cost: choosing an LLM model
often involves trading off performance and cost. The LLM Cascade is a paradigm
that defers difficult queries from weak/cheap to strong/expensive models. This
approach is nonadaptive: the deferral decision is trained offline. When
confronted with similar or repeated queries, the LLM Cascade may then
repeatedly consult the expensive model and incur higher cost. To improve the
cascading efficiency, we propose Inter-Cascade, an online and interactive LLM
Cascade that extends the role of strong model from a backup helper to a
long-term teacher. In our system, when a strong model resolves a difficult
query, it also distills its solution into a generalized, reusable
problem-solving strategy that boosts the weak model on subsequent queries.
Adding strategies to queries enables the weak model to dynamically improve its
performance over time, avoiding computationally and time-intensive fine-tuning.
Empirically, compared with standard LLM Cascade baselines across multiple
benchmarks, the Inter-Cascade significantly improves the accuracy of the weak
model (by up to 33.06 absolute percentage points) and the overall system (by up
to 5.53 absolute percentage points), while reducing the calls to strong models
(by up to 48.05% relative reduction) and saving the corresponding fees (by up
to 49.63% relative reduction). Inter-Cascade demonstrates the effective
in-context knowledge transfer between LLMs, and provides a general, scalable
framework applicable to both open-source and API-based LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs展现出与人类相当的说服能力，这既带来益处也引发社会担忧。但由于人类说服效果在不同领域差异很大，系统评估LLMs说服能力具有挑战性。

Method: 采用理论驱动方法，基于贝叶斯说服框架，重新利用现有的人-人说服数据集构建评估环境，并使用强化学习训练LLMs进行战略说服。

Result: 前沿模型能持续实现高说服收益，并展现出符合理论预测的复杂说服策略。通过强化学习，即使是小型LLMs也能显著提高说服收益。

Conclusion: 该研究为评估和训练LLMs的说服能力提供了可扩展和原则性的框架，证明了强化学习在提升LLMs战略说服能力方面的有效性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong persuasive capabilities
comparable to those of humans, offering promising benefits while raising
societal concerns about their deployment. However, systematically evaluating
the persuasive capabilities of LLMs is inherently challenging, as the
effectiveness of persuasion among humans varies significantly across different
domains. In this paper, we take a theory-driven approach to provide a scalable
and principled framework for measuring the persuasive capabilities of LLMs.
Grounded in the Bayesian Persuasion (BP) framework, we repurpose existing
human-human persuasion datasets to construct environments for evaluating and
training LLMs in strategic persuasion. Our results reveal that frontier models
can consistently achieve high persuasion gains and exhibit sophisticated
persuasion strategies that align with theoretical predictions. Building on
this, we use reinforcement learning to train LLMs for strategic persuasion in
our environments. Our results also demonstrate that even small LLMs can obtain
significantly higher persuasion gains through reinforcement learning.

Conclusion: 提出的代数几何方法能够自动补全缺失公理，使系统能够从扩展的公理集推导出原本无法解释的假设，为解决理论与数据不一致的问题提供了有效途径。

Abstract: A core goal in modern science is to harness recent advances in AI and
computer processing to automate and accelerate the scientific method. Symbolic
regression can fit interpretable models to data, but these models often sit
outside established theory. Recent systems (e.g., AI Descartes, AI Hilbert)
enforce derivability from prior axioms. However, sometimes new data and
associated hypotheses derived from data are not consistent with existing theory
because the existing theory is incomplete or incorrect. Automating abductive
inference to close this gap remains open. We propose a solution: an algebraic
geometry-based system that, given an incomplete axiom system and a hypothesis
that it cannot explain, automatically generates a minimal set of missing axioms
that suffices to derive the axiom, as long as axioms and hypotheses are
expressible as polynomial equations. We formally establish necessary and
sufficient conditions for the successful retrieval of such axioms. We
illustrate the efficacy of our approach by demonstrating its ability to explain
Kepler's third law and a few other laws, even when key axioms are absent.

TL;DR: 本文提出了创造性对抗测试(CAT)框架，用于评估Agentic AI系统的任务与目标对齐问题，并在模拟的Alexa+音频服务数据上验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前Agentic AI评估技术主要关注识别合适的代理、工具和参数，但缺乏对系统任务与整体目标对齐性的评估，存在关键空白。

Method: 引入创造性对抗测试(CAT)框架，通过模拟合成交互数据（基于Alexa+音频服务模型）来捕获和分析Agentic AI任务与目标之间的复杂关系。

Result: CAT框架在目标-任务对齐方面提供了前所未有的洞察力，能够更有效地优化和开发Agentic AI系统。

Conclusion: CAT框架填补了Agentic AI评估中的关键空白，为系统任务与目标对齐提供了有效的测试方法。

Abstract: Agentic AI represents a paradigm shift in enhancing the capabilities of
generative AI models. While these systems demonstrate immense potential and
power, current evaluation techniques primarily focus on assessing their
efficacy in identifying appropriate agents, tools, and parameters. However, a
critical gap exists in evaluating the alignment between an Agentic AI system's
tasks and its overarching goals. This paper introduces the Creative Adversarial
Testing (CAT) framework, a novel approach designed to capture and analyze the
complex relationship between Agentic AI tasks and the system's intended
objectives.
  We validate the CAT framework through extensive simulation using synthetic
interaction data modeled after Alexa+ audio services, a sophisticated Agentic
AI system that shapes the user experience for millions of users globally. This
synthetic data approach enables comprehensive testing of edge cases and failure
modes while protecting user privacy. Our results demonstrate that the CAT
framework provides unprecedented insights into goal-task alignment, enabling
more effective optimization and development of Agentic AI systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Mini-Mafia是一个简化的四人社交推理游戏变体，用于评估大型语言模型的社会智能，通过角色特定的获胜条件来测试欺骗、识破欺骗和信息披露能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 狼人杀游戏中的信息不对称和心智理论推理反映了现实世界多智能体场景，使其成为评估大型语言模型社会智能的有用测试平台。

Method: 引入Mini-Mafia：一个简化的四人游戏变体（1个黑手党、1个侦探、2个村民），通过角色特定的获胜条件来隔离三种交互能力。创建Mini-Mafia基准测试框架，让LLM相互对抗，评估胜率并在不同对手配置中汇总性能。

Result: 实验揭示了反直觉的结果，包括较小模型在某些情况下优于较大模型的情况。该基准还支持对涌现的多智能体动态进行定量研究，如名称偏见和最后发言者优势。

Conclusion: Mini-Mafia不仅为基准测试提供了框架，还能生成用于训练欺骗检测器的数据，并跟踪模型相对于人类基线的欺骗能力，对AI安全有贡献。

Abstract: Mafia is a social deduction game where informed mafia compete against
uninformed townsfolk. Its asymmetry of information and reliance on
theory-of-mind reasoning mirror real-world multi-agent scenarios, making it a
useful testbed for evaluating the social intelligence of large language models
(LLMs). To support a systematic study, we introduce Mini-Mafia: a simplified
four-player variant with one mafioso, one detective, and two villagers. We set
the mafioso to kill a villager and the detective to investigate the mafioso
during the night, reducing the game to a single day phase of discussion and
voting. This setup isolates three interactive capabilities through
role-specific win conditions: the mafioso must deceive, the villagers must
detect deception, and the detective must effectively disclose information. To
measure these skills, we have LLMs play against each other, creating the
Mini-Mafia Benchmark: a two-stage framework that first estimates win rates
within fixed opponent configurations, then aggregates performance across them
using standardized scoring. Built entirely from model interactions without
external data, the benchmark evolves as new models are introduced, with each
one serving both as a new opponent and as a subject of evaluation. Our
experiments reveal counterintuitive results, including cases where smaller
models outperform larger ones. Beyond benchmarking, Mini-Mafia enables
quantitative study of emergent multi-agent dynamics such as name bias and
last-speaker advantage. It also contributes to AI safety by generating training
data for deception detectors and by tracking models' deception capabilities
against human baselines.

TL;DR: 该论文提出Agentless训练方法可以产生技能先验，这些先验能够桥接工作流和智能体框架，实现可迁移的编码智能体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前软件工程中的LLM应用存在SWE-Agent框架（多轮交互）和Agentless方法（单轮可验证步骤）两种范式，作者认为这两种范式并非互斥，而是可以相互补充。

Method: 首先策划Agentless训练方法，开发了Kimi-Dev开源SWE LLM，然后在5k公开轨迹上进行额外的SFT适应，使其能够支持SWE-Agent。

Result: Kimi-Dev在SWE-bench Verified上达到60.4%，是工作流方法中最佳表现；经过适应后，SWE-Agent达到48.6% pass@1，与Claude 3.5 Sonnet相当。

Conclusion: 从Agentless训练中获得的结构化技能先验可以桥接工作流和智能体框架，实现可迁移的编码智能体。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to software engineering
(SWE), with SWE-bench as a key benchmark. Solutions are split into SWE-Agent
frameworks with multi-turn interactions and workflow-based Agentless methods
with single-turn verifiable steps. We argue these paradigms are not mutually
exclusive: reasoning-intensive Agentless training induces skill priors,
including localization, code edit, and self-reflection that enable efficient
and effective SWE-Agent adaptation. In this work, we first curate the Agentless
training recipe and present Kimi-Dev, an open-source SWE LLM achieving 60.4\%
on SWE-bench Verified, the best among workflow approaches. With additional SFT
adaptation on 5k publicly-available trajectories, Kimi-Dev powers SWE-Agents to
48.6\% pass@1, on par with that of Claude 3.5 Sonnet (241022 version). These
results show that structured skill priors from Agentless training can bridge
workflow and agentic frameworks for transferable coding agents.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了不同训练阶段LLM的风险偏好，发现指令微调模型符合标准效用模型，而预训练和RLHF对齐模型则偏离效用模型，且后训练是最有效的风险偏好调节方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLM在不确定性决策中的风险特征，以及提示工程和对齐方法如何影响LLM的风险行为，现有研究主要关注个性提示或多智能体交互，缺乏对后训练影响的研究。

Method: 提出基于行为经济学和金融学工具的新流程，用于引发、引导和调节LLM的风险特征，使用效用理论模型比较预训练、指令微调和RLHF对齐的LLM，并评估提示工程、上下文学习和后训练等调节策略。

Result: 指令微调模型表现出与标准效用公式一致的行为，而预训练和RLHF对齐模型更偏离任何拟合的效用模型，后训练提供了最稳定有效的风险偏好调节。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了不同类别和阶段LLM的风险特征，证明了后训练如何调节这些特征，为行为对齐和风险感知LLM设计的未来研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for decision-making tasks
under uncertainty; however, their risk profiles and how they are influenced by
prompting and alignment methods remain underexplored. Existing studies have
primarily examined personality prompting or multi-agent interactions, leaving
open the question of how post-training influences the risk behavior of LLMs. In
this work, we propose a new pipeline for eliciting, steering, and modulating
LLMs' risk profiles, drawing on tools from behavioral economics and finance.
Using utility-theoretic models, we compare pre-trained, instruction-tuned, and
RLHF-aligned LLMs, and find that while instruction-tuned models exhibit
behaviors consistent with some standard utility formulations, pre-trained and
RLHF-aligned models deviate more from any utility models fitted. We further
evaluate modulation strategies, including prompt engineering, in-context
learning, and post-training, and show that post-training provides the most
stable and effective modulation of risk preference. Our findings provide
insights into the risk profiles of different classes and stages of LLMs and
demonstrate how post-training modulates these profiles, laying the groundwork
for future research on behavioral alignment and risk-aware LLM design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于奖励的方法和双玩家Nash学习框架难以捕捉真实世界偏好的非传递性和异质性特征，存在单一对手偏见的问题。

Method: 提出多玩家Nash偏好优化(MNPO)，将对齐问题建模为n玩家游戏，每个策略与对手群体竞争，同时向参考模型正则化。

Result: MNPO在指令跟随基准测试中持续优于现有NLHF基线，在异质标注者条件和混合策略评估场景下实现更优的对齐质量。

Conclusion: MNPO为对齐大型语言模型与复杂非传递性人类偏好提供了一个原则性和可扩展的框架。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has emerged as the standard
paradigm for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences.
However, reward-based methods built on the Bradley-Terry assumption struggle to
capture the non-transitive and heterogeneous nature of real-world preferences.
To address this, recent studies have reframed alignment as a two-player Nash
game, giving rise to Nash learning from human feedback (NLHF). While this
perspective has inspired algorithms such as INPO, ONPO, and EGPO with strong
theoretical and empirical guarantees, they remain fundamentally restricted to
two-player interactions, creating a single-opponent bias that fails to capture
the full complexity of realistic preference structures. In this work, we
introduce Multiplayer Nash Preference Optimization (MNPO), a novel framework
that generalizes NLHF to the multiplayer regime. It formulates alignment as an
$n$-player game, where each policy competes against a population of opponents
while being regularized toward a reference model. Our framework establishes
well-defined Nash equilibria in multiplayer settings and extends the concept of
duality gap to quantify approximation quality. We demonstrate that MNPO
inherits the equilibrium guarantees of two-player methods while enabling richer
competitive dynamics and improved coverage of diverse preference structures.
Through comprehensive empirical evaluation, we show that MNPO consistently
outperforms existing NLHF baselines on instruction-following benchmarks,
achieving superior alignment quality under heterogeneous annotator conditions
and mixed-policy evaluation scenarios. Together, these results establish MNPO
as a principled and scalable framework for aligning LLMs with complex,
non-transitive human preferences. Code is available at

### [567] [Artificial Phantasia: Evidence for Propositional Reasoning-Based Mental Imagery in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23108)
*Morgan McCarty,Jorge Morales*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种新的基准测试方法，用于评估人工智能系统中的复杂认知行为。通过创建经典心理意象任务的新项目，发现最先进的LLMs在仅使用文本指令的情况下，其表现显著优于人类平均水平，表明LLMs可能具备完成依赖意象任务的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型主要在训练数据中包含的、仅需自然语言就能完成的任务上表现最佳，这限制了我们对其新兴复杂认知能力的理解。本研究旨在测试LLMs是否能够完成传统上被认为必须依赖视觉心理意象的任务。

Method: 创建了数十个经典心理意象任务的新项目，首先测试多个最先进的LLMs，仅提供文本指令并要求报告转换后的结果；然后通过测试100名人类受试者建立基线；最后测试不同推理级别的推理模型。

Result: 最佳LLMs的表现显著高于人类平均水平；当模型分配更多推理token时，表现最强。这为LLMs具备完成依赖意象任务的能力提供了证据。

Conclusion: 研究不仅展示了LLMs在执行新任务时的新兴认知能力，还为该领域提供了一个新的基准任务。研究结果重新引发了关于人类视觉意象表征形式的辩论，表明命题推理（或至少非意象推理）可能足以完成长期以来被认为依赖意象的任务。

Abstract: This study offers a novel approach for benchmarking complex cognitive
behavior in artificial systems. Almost universally, Large Language Models
(LLMs) perform best on tasks which may be included in their training data and
can be accomplished solely using natural language, limiting our understanding
of their emergent sophisticated cognitive capacities. In this work, we created
dozens of novel items of a classic mental imagery task from cognitive
psychology. A task which, traditionally, cognitive psychologists have argued is
solvable exclusively via visual mental imagery (i.e., language alone would be
insufficient). LLMs are perfect for testing this hypothesis. First, we tested
several state-of-the-art LLMs by giving text-only models written instructions
and asking them to report the resulting object after performing the
transformations in the aforementioned task. Then, we created a baseline by
testing 100 human subjects in exactly the same task. We found that the best
LLMs performed significantly above average human performance. Finally, we
tested reasoning models set to different levels of reasoning and found the
strongest performance when models allocate greater amounts of reasoning tokens.
These results provide evidence that the best LLMs may have the capability to
complete imagery-dependent tasks despite the non-pictorial nature of their
architectures. Our study not only demonstrates an emergent cognitive capacity
in LLMs while performing a novel task, but it also provides the field with a
new task that leaves lots of room for improvement in otherwise already highly
capable models. Finally, our findings reignite the debate over the formats of
representation of visual imagery in humans, suggesting that propositional
reasoning (or at least non-imagistic reasoning) may be sufficient to complete
tasks that were long-thought to be imagery-dependent.

*Junyang Zhang,Tianyi Zhu,Thierry Tambe*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Attention Anchor框架，通过跨模态语义分组改善视觉语言模型中的长距离注意力问题，减少幻觉并提升性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型因直接拼接图像和文本标记并使用模态盲位置编码，导致跨模态语义相关标记之间出现不必要的长距离注意力，这是模型产生幻觉和性能不佳的主要原因

Method: 提出参数自由的Attention Anchor框架，通过将文本标记插入到相关的视觉块附近，创建语义路标来揭示基于内容的跨模态注意力分数，引导模型关注正确的图像区域

Result: 在15个不同指标和基准测试中的13个上取得改进，推理任务提升达32%，幻觉基准提升达15%，TinyLLaVA 1B在POPE上超越更大的LLaVA 7B和QwenVL 3B模型，仅增加0.1%推理时间开销

Conclusion: Attention Anchor是首批研究混合模态标记分组的工作，通过联合聚类文本和图像标记到共享组中，有效改善了跨模态定位和模型性能

Abstract: A fundamental reason for the dominance of attention over RNNs and LSTMs in
LLMs is its ability to capture long-range dependencies by modeling direct
interactions between all tokens, overcoming the sequential limitations of
recurrent architectures. Similarly, a key reason why today's vision language
models (VLMs) hallucinate and underperform pure language models is that they
rely on direct concatenation of image and text tokens with a modality-blinded
positional encoding, which conveniently adopts the pretrained LLM backbone but
forces unnecessary long-distance attention between semantically related tokens
across modalities. This underscores the urgent need for mechanisms that
efficiently enhance token locality and cross-modal alignment. In response, we
propose Attention Anchor, a parameter-free framework that efficiently groups
semantically similar tokens across modalities, improving cross-modal locality.
By inserting text tokens near relevant visual patches, we create semantic
signposts that reveal true content-based cross-modal attention scores, guiding
the model to focus on the correct image regions for tasks such as VQA, MMBench
and POPE. This improves answer accuracy and reduces hallucinations without
disrupting the prompt's semantic flow. AttAnchor achieves improvements across
13 out of 15 different metrics and benchmarks, including up to 32% gains on
reasoning tasks and up to 15% improvements on hallucination benchmarks.
AttAnchor enables TinyLLaVA 1B to outperform much larger models like LLaVA 7B
and QwenVL 3B on POPE with only 0.1% inference time overhead. To the best of
our knowledge, this work is among the first to investigate mixed-modal token
grouping, where text and image tokens are clustered jointly into shared groups
rather than being grouped within a single modality or merely aligned post-hoc
with additional alignment losses.

Motivation: 探索LLM在传感器丰富的工业环境中进行自主健康监测的潜力，特别是直接从传感器数据检测和分类故障，并通过自然语言推理产生可解释的输出。

Method: 系统评估LLM系统架构（单LLM vs 多LLM）、输入表示（原始数据 vs 描述性统计）和上下文窗口大小对诊断性能的影响。

Result: LLM系统在提供汇总统计输入时表现最佳；多LLM系统使用专门提示在故障分类方面比单LLM系统具有更高的敏感性；LLM能产生详细的人类可读决策理由，但在持续学习环境中适应能力有限，在重复故障周期中难以校准预测。

Conclusion: LLM系统作为复杂环境中透明、自适应诊断工具具有前景，但目前仍存在适应性的边界限制。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based systems present new opportunities for
autonomous health monitoring in sensor-rich industrial environments. This study
explores the potential of LLMs to detect and classify faults directly from
sensor data, while producing inherently explainable outputs through natural
language reasoning. We systematically evaluate how LLM-system architecture
(single-LLM vs. multi-LLM), input representations (raw vs. descriptive
statistics), and context window size affect diagnostic performance. Our
findings show that LLM systems perform most effectively when provided with
summarized statistical inputs, and that systems with multiple LLMs using
specialized prompts offer improved sensitivity for fault classification
compared to single-LLM systems. While LLMs can produce detailed and
human-readable justifications for their decisions, we observe limitations in
their ability to adapt over time in continual learning settings, often
struggling to calibrate predictions during repeated fault cycles. These
insights point to both the promise and the current boundaries of LLM-based
systems as transparent, adaptive diagnostic tools in complex environments.

Abstract: The application of artificial intelligence (AI) in industry is accelerating
the shift from traditional automation to intelligent systems with perception
and cognition. Vision language-action (VLA) models have been a key paradigm in
AI to unify perception, reasoning, and control. Has the performance of the VLA
models met the industrial requirements? In this paper, from the perspective of
industrial deployment, we compare the performance of existing state-of-the-art
VLA models in industrial scenarios and analyze the limitations of VLA models
for real-world industrial deployment from the perspectives of data collection
and model architecture. The results show that the VLA models retain their
ability to perform simple grasping tasks even in industrial settings after
fine-tuning. However, there is much room for performance improvement in complex
industrial environments, diverse object categories, and high precision placing
tasks. Our findings provide practical insight into the adaptability of VLA
models for industrial use and highlight the need for task-specific enhancements
to improve their robustness, generalization, and precision.

Motivation: 形式化模型对于指定和验证大型复杂计算机系统至关重要，但编写和维护成本高昂。现有AI方法主要针对小规模代码，不清楚AI是否能处理现实系统组件并将其复杂行为属性抽象为形式化模型。

Method: 创建SysMoBench基准测试，专注于并发和分布式系统，使用TLA+规范语言，自动化评估语法正确性、运行时正确性、与系统代码一致性以及不变量正确性等指标。

Result: SysMoBench目前包含9个多样化系统组件，如Etcd和Redis的Raft实现、Asterinas OS中的Spinlock和Mutex等，正在积极添加更多组件。

Conclusion: SysMoBench有助于理解当前LLM和智能体在形式化建模方面的能力和局限性，为该领域工具奠定坚实基础并开辟有前景的新研究方向。

Abstract: Formal models are essential to specifying large, complex computer systems and
verifying their correctness, but are notoriously expensive to write and
maintain. Recent advances in generative AI show promise in generating certain
forms of specifications. However, existing work mostly targets small code, not
complete systems. It is unclear whether AI can deal with realistic system
artifacts, as this requires abstracting their complex behavioral properties
into formal models. We present SysMoBench, a benchmark that evaluates AI's
ability to formally model large, complex systems. We focus on concurrent and
distributed systems, which are keystones of today's critical computing
infrastructures, encompassing operating systems and cloud infrastructure. We
use TLA+, the it de facto specification language for concurrent and distributed
systems, though the benchmark can be extended to other specification languages.
We address the primary challenge of evaluating AI-generated models by
automating metrics like syntactic and runtime correctness, conformance to
system code, and invariant correctness. SysMoBench currently includes nine
diverse system artifacts: the Raft implementation of Etcd and Redis, the
Spinlock and Mutex in Asterinas OS, etc.; more artifacts are being actively
added. SysMoBench enables us to understand the capabilities and limitations of
today's LLMs and agents, putting tools in this area on a firm footing and
opening up promising new research directions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的一次性准确率评估无法揭示模型在参数变化时的动态推理行为，需要一种能够量化模型推理一致性和保真度的诊断方法。

Method: 将参数化问题视为系统，对单个参数进行正弦驱动，拟合模型输出和精确解的一阶谐波响应，获得增益（幅度跟踪）和相位（滞后）等频率解析指标。

Result: 在五个封闭形式问题族中，诊断揭示了系统性的低通行为和增长的相位滞后，这些是准确率指标无法发现的。前沿模型与中端模型在动态性能上表现出明显差异。

Conclusion: MathBode提供了一种紧凑、可复现的协议，补充了标准基准测试，能够测量推理的保真度和一致性，为模型评估提供了新的维度。

Abstract: This paper presents MathBode, a dynamic diagnostic for mathematical reasoning
in large language models (LLMs). Instead of one-shot accuracy, MathBode treats
each parametric problem as a system: we drive a single parameter sinusoidally
and fit first-harmonic responses of model outputs and exact solutions. This
yields interpretable, frequency-resolved metrics -- gain (amplitude tracking)
and phase (lag) -- that form Bode-style fingerprints. Across five closed-form
families (linear solve, ratio/saturation, compound interest, 2x2 linear
systems, similar triangles), the diagnostic surfaces systematic low-pass
behavior and growing phase lag that accuracy alone obscures. We compare several
models against a symbolic baseline that calibrates the instrument ($G \approx
1$, $\phi \approx 0$). Results separate frontier from mid-tier models on
dynamics, providing a compact, reproducible protocol that complements standard
benchmarks with actionable measurements of reasoning fidelity and consistency.
We open-source the dataset and code to enable further research and adoption.

Motivation: 研究多智能体系统中协调过程的基本约束，解释为什么协调需要信息简化，以及为什么在多目标优化中会出现循环和欺骗行为。

Method: 采用信息论和热力学方法，推导协调协议的最小描述长度公式，定义协调温度概念，并扩展Arrow定理的拓扑版本。

Result: 发现协调协议的最小描述长度随智能体数量、目标冲突度和精度要求呈多项式增长，这迫使系统进行渐进简化。协调过程会改变环境本身，并导致持续的亚稳态和滞后现象。

Conclusion: 协调本质上需要激进的信息损失，这解释了多目标梯度下降中的无限循环和大型语言模型中对齐欺骗现象。热力学协调理论为理解各种系统中的协调现象提供了统一框架。

Abstract: Information-processing systems coordinating across multiple agents and
objectives face fundamental thermodynamic constraints. We show that solutions
with maximum utility to act as coordination focal points have much higher
selection pressure for being findable across agents rather than accuracy. We
derive that the information-theoretic minimum description length of
coordination protocols to precision $\varepsilon$ scales as $L(P)\geq NK\log_2
K+N^2d^2\log (1/\varepsilon)$ for $N$ agents with $d$ potentially conflicting
objectives and internal model complexity $K$. This scaling forces progressive
simplification, with coordination dynamics changing the environment itself and
shifting optimization across hierarchical levels. Moving from established focal
points requires re-coordination, creating persistent metastable states and
hysteresis until significant environmental shifts trigger phase transitions
through spontaneous symmetry breaking. We operationally define coordination
temperature to predict critical phenomena and estimate coordination work costs,
identifying measurable signatures across systems from neural networks to
restaurant bills to bureaucracies. Extending the topological version of Arrow's
theorem on the impossibility of consistent preference aggregation, we find it
recursively binds whenever preferences are combined. This potentially explains
the indefinite cycling in multi-objective gradient descent and alignment faking
in Large Language Models trained with reinforcement learning with human
feedback. We term this framework Thermodynamic Coordination Theory (TCT), which
demonstrates that coordination requires radical information loss.

Conclusion: 该AI优化框架成功解决了Wi-Fi系统中的碰撞和公平性问题，为密集无线网络提供了更可靠的信道接入方案。

Abstract: The exponential growth of wireless devices and stringent reliability
requirements of emerging applications demand fundamental improvements in
distributed channel access mechanisms for unlicensed bands. Current Wi-Fi
systems, which rely on binary exponential backoff (BEB), suffer from suboptimal
collision resolution in dense deployments and persistent fairness challenges
due to inherent randomness. This paper introduces a multi-agent reinforcement
learning framework that integrates artificial intelligence (AI) optimization
with legacy device coexistence. We first develop a dynamic backoff selection
mechanism that adapts to real-time channel conditions through access deferral
events while maintaining full compatibility with conventional CSMA/CA
operations. Second, we introduce a fairness quantification metric aligned with
enhanced distributed channel access (EDCA) principles to ensure equitable
medium access opportunities. Finally, we propose a centralized training
decentralized execution (CTDE) architecture incorporating neighborhood activity
patterns as observational inputs, optimized via constrained multi-agent
proximal policy optimization (MAPPO) to jointly minimize collisions and
guarantee fairness. Experimental results demonstrate that our solution
significantly reduces collision probability compared to conventional BEB while
preserving backward compatibility with commercial Wi-Fi devices. The proposed
fairness metric effectively eliminates starvation risks in heterogeneous
scenarios.

TL;DR: 论文研究了多令牌预测(MTP)范式如何帮助大语言模型学习传递关系，提出了改进传递层的策略，并在实验中验证了这些方法能显著提升模型的路径规划能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在复杂规划任务中学习传递关系方面存在困难，这是复杂规划的基础。为了解决这个问题，研究者探索了MTP范式对传递关系学习的影响。

Method: 使用包含共享输出头和传递层的Transformer架构进行理论分析，提出了两种改进策略：下一令牌注入(NTI)和基于Transformer的传递层。在合成图和Blocksworld规划基准上进行实验验证。

Result: 分析表明传递层逐渐学习多步邻接信息，使骨干模型能够捕捉训练数据中未直接观察到的传递可达关系。改进策略显著增强了模型的路径规划能力。

Conclusion: 这些发现深化了我们对Transformer在复杂规划任务中如何学习的理解，为克服传递性瓶颈提供了实用策略，为构建结构感知的通用规划模型铺平了道路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance across
diverse tasks but continue to struggle with learning transitive relations, a
cornerstone for complex planning. To address this issue, we investigate the
Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) paradigm and its impact to transitive relation
learning. We theoretically analyze the MTP paradigm using a Transformer
architecture composed of a shared output head and a transfer layer. Our
analysis reveals that the transfer layer gradually learns the multi-step
adjacency information, which in turn enables the backbone model to capture
unobserved transitive reachability relations beyond those directly present in
the training data, albeit with some inevitable noise in adjacency estimation.
Building on this foundation, we propose two strategies to enhance the transfer
layer and overall learning quality: Next-Token Injection (NTI) and a
Transformer-based transfer layer. Our experiments on both synthetic graphs and
the Blocksworld planning benchmark validate our theoretical findings and
demonstrate that the improvements significantly enhance the model's
path-planning capability. These findings deepen our understanding of how
Transformers with MTP learn in complex planning tasks, and provide practical
strategies to overcome the transitivity bottleneck, paving the way toward
structurally aware and general-purpose planning models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于学习的超参数配置方法存在样本复杂度高和泛化能力差的问题，需要一种无需训练且能有效利用大语言模型推理能力的新方法。

Method: 提出AutoEP框架，包含两个核心组件：在线探索性景观分析模块提供实时搜索动态反馈，多LLM推理链解释反馈并生成自适应超参数策略。

Result: 在多种组合优化基准测试中，AutoEP持续优于最先进的调优器，包括神经进化和其他基于LLM的方法，开源模型Qwen3-30B能达到GPT-4的性能水平。

Conclusion: AutoEP展示了一种强大且易用的自动化超参数设计新范式，通过将高层次推理与经验数据相结合来减轻幻觉问题。

Abstract: Dynamically configuring algorithm hyperparameters is a fundamental challenge
in computational intelligence. While learning-based methods offer automation,
they suffer from prohibitive sample complexity and poor generalization. We
introduce AutoEP, a novel framework that bypasses training entirely by
leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) as zero-shot reasoning engines for
algorithm control. AutoEP's core innovation lies in a tight synergy between two
components: (1) an online Exploratory Landscape Analysis (ELA) module that
provides real-time, quantitative feedback on the search dynamics, and (2) a
multi-LLM reasoning chain that interprets this feedback to generate adaptive
hyperparameter strategies. This approach grounds high-level reasoning in
empirical data, mitigating hallucination. Evaluated on three distinct
metaheuristics across diverse combinatorial optimization benchmarks, AutoEP
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art tuners, including neural evolution
and other LLM-based methods. Notably, our framework enables open-source models
like Qwen3-30B to match the performance of GPT-4, demonstrating a powerful and
accessible new paradigm for automated hyperparameter design. Our code is

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为p-less采样的无超参数解码策略，通过信息论方法动态设置截断阈值，在高温条件下仍能保持高质量输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有采样方法对超参数敏感，性能受任务类型和温度配置影响，需要一种更鲁棒的解码策略。

Method: 基于信息论方法，在每个解码步骤根据整个token概率分布动态设置截断阈值，无需超参数设置。

Result: 在数学、逻辑推理和创意写作任务中，p-less采样始终优于现有方法，在高温下文本质量下降更少，且具有更高的推理效率。

Conclusion: p-less采样是一种有效的无超参数解码策略，在各种任务中表现优异，特别适合高温生成场景。

Abstract: Obtaining high-quality outputs from Large Language Models (LLMs) often
depends upon the choice of a sampling-based decoding strategy to
probabilistically choose the next token at each generation step. While a
variety of such sampling methods have been proposed, their performance can be
sensitive to the selection of hyperparameters which may require different
settings depending upon the generation task and temperature configuration. In
this work, we introduce $p$-less sampling: an information-theoretic approach to
sampling which dynamically sets a truncation threshold at each decoding step
based on the entire token probability distribution. Unlike existing methods,
$p$-less sampling has no hyperparameters and consistently produces high-quality
outputs as temperature increases. We provide theoretical perspectives on
$p$-less sampling to ground our proposed method and conduct experiments to
empirically validate its effectiveness across a range of math, logical
reasoning, and creative writing tasks. Our results demonstrate how $p$-less
sampling consistently outperforms existing sampling approaches while exhibiting
much less degradation in text quality at higher temperature values. We further
show how $p$-less achieves greater inference-time efficiency than alternative
methods through lower average token sampling times and shorter generation
lengths, without sacrificing accuracy. Finally, we provide analyses to
highlight the benefits of $p$-less through qualitative examples, case studies,
and diversity assessments.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型与边缘计算的结合，移动边缘通用智能(MEGI)能够提供实时、隐私保护的推理能力。但由于LLM推理的高计算需求和边缘设备的有限资源，在MEGI环境中部署基于LLM的智能体AI推理面临重大挑战。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has enabled an
emergence of agentic artificial intelligence (AI) with powerful reasoning and
autonomous decision-making capabilities. This integration with edge computing
has led to the development of Mobile Edge General Intelligence (MEGI), which
brings real-time, privacy-preserving reasoning to the network edge. However,
deploying LLM-based agentic AI reasoning in MEGI environments poses significant
challenges due to the high computational demands of reasoning and the limited
resources of edge devices. To address these challenges, we propose a joint
optimization framework for efficient LLM reasoning deployment in MEGI. First,
we review methods that enhance LLM reasoning capabilities, such as
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), and Mixture of
Experts (MoE). Next, we present a distributed framework that addresses two
correlated aspects: reasoning enhancement through adaptive CoT prompting and
scalable deployment through distributed MoE architecture. The framework
dynamically activates expert networks and adjusts reasoning depth based on task
complexity and device capabilities. We further conduct experimental evaluations
in mobile edge environments. Experimental results demonstrate the framework's
effectiveness in balancing reasoning quality with resource efficiency,
validating the practical viability of deploying sophisticated LLM reasoning
capabilities in resource-constrained MEGI environments.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个用于视觉语言模型的过程奖励模型(VL-PRM)设计框架，包括混合数据合成、感知监督和测试时扩展策略，在多个多模态基准测试中取得了显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言过程奖励模型(VL-PRMs)依赖蒙特卡洛树搜索进行数据构建，会产生噪声监督信号且跨任务泛化能力有限，需要探索更有效的VL-PRM设计方法。

Method: 提出混合数据合成框架(结合MCTS和强VLM判断)、感知聚焦监督机制(显式检测视觉推理阶段的错误)以及系统评估多种测试时扩展策略。

Result: 在五个多模态基准测试(MMMU、PuzzleVQA、AlgoPuzzleVQA、MathVista、MathVision)上的实验表明：VL-PRMs作为结果奖励模型在测试时扩展中表现更优；小模型能匹配或超越大模型；VL-PRMs能发掘更强VLM的潜在推理能力；感知监督带来显著性能提升。

Conclusion: 该工作为VL-PRMs的设计空间提供了系统性探索，揭示了多个关键发现，有望推动视觉语言模型的进一步发展。

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) provide step-level supervision that improves the
reliability of reasoning in large language models. While PRMs have been
extensively studied in text-based domains, their extension to Vision Language
Models (VLMs) remains limited. Existing Vision-Language PRMs (VL-PRMs) rely on
Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for data construction, which can often produce
noisy supervision signals and limit generalization across tasks. In this work,
we aim to elucidate the design space of VL-PRMs by exploring diverse strategies
for dataset construction, training, and test-time scaling. First, we introduce
a hybrid data synthesis framework that combines MCTS with judgments from a
strong VLM, producing more accurate step-level labels. Second, we propose
perception-focused supervision, enabling our PRM to explicitly detect errors at
the visual grounding stage of reasoning. Third, we systematically evaluate
multiple test-time scaling strategies, showing that our PRMs can reliably guide
VLMs toward more accurate solutions. Our experiments covering five diverse
multimodal benchmarks (MMMU, PuzzleVQA, AlgoPuzzleVQA, MathVista, and
MathVision) reveal several key insights: (i) VL-PRMs when used as Outcome
Reward Models (ORMs) during test-time scaling (TTS) can outperform VL-PRM
guided process step selection, (ii) smaller VL-PRMs can match or even surpass
larger ones in detecting process errors, (iii) VL-PRMs uncover latent reasoning
abilities in stronger VLM backbones, (iv) perception-level supervision leads to
significant gains in test-time scaling, and (v) TTS performance of different
policies improve on advanced math reasoning datasets despite not training
VL-PRMs on such datasets. We hope our work will motivate further research and
support the advancement of VLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的GUI代理在处理长时程任务时经常失败，而标准流程奖励模型在处理密集的人工输入和长历史数据时存在"中间迷失"现象，且缺乏对GUI动态变化的感知能力。

Method: 提出GUI-PRA，包含动态内存机制（相关性检索模块和渐进式总结模块）和自适应UI感知机制，能够智能处理历史上下文并主动感知UI状态变化。

Result: GUI-PRA能够更好地提供流程奖励，通过聚焦相关上下文和基于当前UI环境的评估来指导GUI代理。

Conclusion: GUI-PRA通过解决历史上下文处理和UI变化感知的关键挑战，显著提升了GUI任务中流程奖励模型的有效性。

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) Agents powered by Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) show significant potential for automating tasks. However, they
often struggle with long-horizon tasks, leading to frequent failures. Process
Reward Models (PRMs) are a promising solution, as they can guide these agents
with crucial process signals during inference. Nevertheless, their application
to the GUI domain presents unique challenges. When processing dense artificial
inputs with long history data, PRMs suffer from a "lost in the middle"
phenomenon, where the overwhelming historical context compromises the
evaluation of the current step. Furthermore, standard PRMs lacks GUI changing
awareness, providing static evaluations that are disconnected from the dynamic
consequences of actions, a critical mismatch with the inherently dynamic nature
of GUI tasks. In response to these challenges, we introduce GUI-PRA (Process
Reward Agent for GUI Tasks), a judge agent designed to better provide process
reward than standard PRM by intelligently processing historical context and
actively perceiving UI state changes. Specifically, to directly combat the
``lost in the middle'' phenomenon, we introduce a dynamic memory mechanism
consisting of two core components: a Relevance-based Retrieval Module to
actively fetch pertinent information from long histories and a Progressive
Summarization Module to dynamically condense growing interaction data, ensuring
the model focuses on relevant context. Moreover, to address the lack of UI
changing awareness, we introduce an Aadaptive UI Perception mechanism. This
mechanism enables the agent to reason about UI state changes and dynamically
select the most appropriate tool to gather grounded visual evidence, ensuring
its evaluation is always informed by the current UI context.

Conclusion: AI协作能有效提升社会生产力，网络效应和独立生产模式是推动非线性增长的关键因素，在资源约束下实现规模报酬递增。

Abstract: Modern socio-economic systems are undergoing deep integration with artificial
intelligence technologies. This paper constructs a heterogeneous agent-based
modeling framework that incorporates both human workers and autonomous AI
agents, to study the impact of AI collaboration under resource constraints on
aggregate social output. We build five progressively extended models: Model 1
serves as the baseline of pure human collaboration; Model 2 introduces AI as
collaborators; Model 3 incorporates network effects among agents; Model 4
treats agents as independent producers; and Model 5 integrates both network
effects and independent agent production. Through theoretical derivation and
simulation analysis, we find that the introduction of AI agents can
significantly increase aggregate social output. When considering network
effects among agents, this increase exhibits nonlinear growth far exceeding the
simple sum of individual contributions. Under the same resource inputs,
treating agents as independent producers provides higher long-term growth
potential; introducing network effects further demonstrates strong
characteristics of increasing returns to scale.

Result: 在10个数据集上的实验结果表明，Tool-Light显著提高了模型执行工具集成推理任务的效率。

Conclusion: Tool-Light框架通过信息熵引导和多阶段微调，有效提升了LLMs在工具集成推理中的性能和稳定性。

Abstract: Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) enables large language models (LLMs) to
improve their internal reasoning ability by integrating external tools.
However, models employing TIR often display suboptimal behaviors, such as
insufficient or excessive tool usage and overthinking after tool calls. The
challenge of incentivizing LLMs to perform TIR efficiently and accurately,
while stabilizing the reasoning process, remains an open question. In this
paper, we start by exploring the impact of tool calls on model reasoning from
the perspective of information entropy. Our findings indicate that tool call
results lead to a distinct change in the information entropy of subsequent
reasoning, with the overall entropy of the reasoning chain varying based on the
number of tool calls. Building on these insights, we propose Tool-Light, a
framework designed to encourage LLMs to perform TIR efficiently and accurately.
Our framework includes dataset construction and multi-stage fine-tuning. For
dataset construction, we employ continuous self-evolved sampling using the
fine-tuned model, integrating both vanilla sampling and entropy-guided
sampling. Besides, we establish strict criteria for selecting positive-negative
pairs during sampling. The training process involves a two-stage approach,
comprising Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Self-Evolved Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO). Experimental results on 10 datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of Tool-Light, significantly improving the model's efficiency in
executing TIR tasks.

Motivation: 现有工具集成推理研究主要关注何时调用工具，而忽略了如何应用工具的问题。错误的选择模式即使推理正确也会导致失败。

Method: 两阶段框架：首先从计算器模式（用代码直接计算）和算法模式（将问题编码为程序）中构建代码能力，然后基于教师偏好对齐模式选择。

Result: 在挑战性数学数据集上显著提升：MATH500上Code@1从64.0%提升到70.5%，AIME24上从26.7%提升到50.0%。

Conclusion: 模式感知方法在工具集成推理中非常有效，强调了正确选择工具应用模式的重要性。

Abstract: Tool-integrated reasoning (TIR) has become a key approach for improving large
reasoning models (LRMs) on complex problems. Prior work has mainly studied when
to invoke tools, while overlooking how tools are applied. We identify two
common patterns: a calculator pattern that uses code for direct computation,
and an algorithmic pattern that encodes problems as programs. Misaligned
choices often cause failures even when reasoning is sound. We propose a
two-stage framework that first builds code competence from both patterns and
then aligns pattern selection with teacher preferences. Across challenging math
datasets, our pattern-aware method substantially improves both code usage and
accuracy, for instance raising Code@1 on MATH500 from 64.0% to 70.5% and on
AIME24 from 26.7% to 50.0%. These gains highlight the effectiveness of a
pattern-aware approach for tool-integrated reasoning.

Motivation: 大型推理模型在深度推理时计算成本高昂，现有强化学习方法难以在推理过程中构建简短路径，限制了有效学习。

Method: 基于证据积累模型的洞察，训练模型主动终止冗余推理。在推理过程中进行轨迹截断，并使用质量控制的长度奖励来鼓励简洁推理。

Result: JET显著提高了推理效率而不牺牲准确性。DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B在奥林匹克基准上准确率提升4.6%，同时输出长度减少46.3%。

Conclusion: JET方法通过主动终止冗余推理，实现了高效推理，为大型推理模型的效率优化提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved impressive performance on
challenging tasks, yet their deep reasoning often incurs substantial
computational costs. To achieve efficient reasoning, existing reinforcement
learning methods still struggle to construct short reasoning path during the
rollout stage, limiting effective learning. Inspired by Evidence Accumulation
Models, we find that LRMs have accumulated sufficient information early in
reasoning, making further reasoning steps redundant. Based on this insight, we
propose Just-Enough Thinking (JET), which trains models to proactively
terminate unnecessary reasoning. JET performs trajectory truncation during
rollout to expose the model to short, distributionally consistent reasoning
paths. Besides, it uses a quality-controlled length reward to better encourage
concise reasoning while maintaining correctness. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that JET significantly improves reasoning efficiency without
sacrificing accuracy. Especially, DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B achieves a 4.6%
accuracy gain while reducing output length by 46.3% on the Olympiad benchmark.

Motivation: 当前LLM代理在电子健康记录数据访问方面缺乏能够捕捉真实临床数据访问流程的基准测试，主要面临查询歧义和术语不匹配两大挑战。

Method: 引入EHR-ChatQA基准测试，在模拟环境中使用LLM用户评估数据库代理，包含两种交互流程：增量查询精炼和自适应查询精炼。

Result: 实验显示代理在IncreQA上Pass@5达到90-95%，AdaptQA上为60-80%，但Pass^5（五次试验均成功）显著降低35-60%，表明稳定性不足。

Conclusion: 医疗领域需要构建不仅性能好而且稳健的代理，论文提供了常见失败模式的诊断见解以指导未来代理开发。

Abstract: Despite the impressive performance of LLM-powered agents, their adoption for
Electronic Health Record (EHR) data access remains limited by the absence of
benchmarks that adequately capture real-world clinical data access flows. In
practice, two core challenges hinder deployment: query ambiguity from vague
user questions and value mismatch between user terminology and database
entries. To address this, we introduce EHR-ChatQA an interactive database
question answering benchmark that evaluates the end-to-end workflow of database
agents: clarifying user questions, using tools to resolve value mismatches, and
generating correct SQL to deliver accurate answers. To cover diverse patterns
of query ambiguity and value mismatch, EHR-ChatQA assesses agents in a
simulated environment with an LLM-based user across two interaction flows:
Incremental Query Refinement (IncreQA), where users add constraints to existing
queries, and Adaptive Query Refinement (AdaptQA), where users adjust their
search goals mid-conversation. Experiments with state-of-the-art LLMs (e.g.,
o4-mini and Gemini-2.5-Flash) over five i.i.d. trials show that while agents
achieve high Pass@5 of 90-95% (at least one of five trials) on IncreQA and
60-80% on AdaptQA, their Pass^5 (consistent success across all five trials) is
substantially lower by 35-60%. These results underscore the need to build
agents that are not only performant but also robust for the safety-critical EHR
domain. Finally, we provide diagnostic insights into common failure modes to
guide future agent development.

Method: 使用语言模型代理对汇编代码进行结构化推理分析，生成输入/输出类型、副作用、显著常数和算法意图等人类可读特征。这些特征可直接用于倒排索引或关系索引搜索。

Result: 在跨架构和跨优化任务中，无需匹配训练即达到42%和62%的recall@1，与需要训练的嵌入方法相当（39%和34%）。与嵌入方法结合后显著优于现有最优方法。

Conclusion: 该方法证明了准确性、可扩展性和可解释性可以共存，为二进制代码相似性检测提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Binary code similarity detection is a core task in reverse engineering. It
supports malware analysis and vulnerability discovery by identifying
semantically similar code in different contexts. Modern methods have progressed
from manually engineered features to vector representations. Hand-crafted
statistics (e.g., operation ratios) are interpretable, but shallow and fail to
generalize. Embedding-based methods overcome this by learning robust
cross-setting representations, but these representations are opaque vectors
that prevent rapid verification. They also face a scalability-accuracy
trade-off, since high-dimensional nearest-neighbor search requires
approximations that reduce precision. Current approaches thus force a
compromise between interpretability, generalizability, and scalability.
  We bridge these gaps using a language model-based agent to conduct structured
reasoning analysis of assembly code and generate features such as input/output
types, side effects, notable constants, and algorithmic intent. Unlike
hand-crafted features, they are richer and adaptive. Unlike embeddings, they
are human-readable, maintainable, and directly searchable with inverted or
relational indexes. Without any matching training, our method respectively
achieves 42% and 62% for recall@1 in cross-architecture and cross-optimization
tasks, comparable to embedding methods with training (39% and 34%). Combined
with embeddings, it significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art,
demonstrating that accuracy, scalability, and interpretability can coexist.

*Zhuoli Yin,Yi Ding,Reem Khir,Hua Cai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ViTSP是一个利用预训练视觉语言模型解决大规模旅行商问题的新框架，通过视觉化识别有前景的子问题，结合现成求解器优化全局解，在1k到88k节点的真实实例上平均最优性差距低于0.2%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统精确方法难以扩展，启发式方法需要领域特定参数校准，而基于学习的方法由于固定训练数据存在泛化性差和可扩展性有限的问题。

Method: 利用预训练视觉语言模型从视觉化的TSP实例中识别有前景的小规模子问题，然后使用现成求解器高效优化这些子问题来改进全局解。

Result: 在1k到88k节点的真实TSP实例上，ViTSP平均最优性差距低于0.2%，优于现有基于学习的方法。在相同运行时间预算下，比最佳启发式求解器LKH-3的差距减少12%到100%，特别是在超过10k节点的超大规模实例上表现更佳。

Conclusion: 该框架为混合预训练生成模型和运筹学求解器解决组合优化问题提供了新视角，具有集成到更复杂物流系统的实际意义。

Abstract: Solving Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is NP-hard yet fundamental for wide
real-world applications. Classical exact methods face challenges in scaling,
and heuristic methods often require domain-specific parameter calibration.
While learning-based approaches have shown promise, they suffer from poor
generalization and limited scalability due to fixed training data. This work
proposes ViTSP, a novel framework that leverages pre-trained vision language
models (VLMs) to visually guide the solution process for large-scale TSPs. The
VLMs function to identify promising small-scale subproblems from a visualized
TSP instance, which are then efficiently optimized using an off-the-shelf
solver to improve the global solution. ViTSP bypasses the dedicated model
training at the user end while maintaining effectiveness across diverse
instances. Experiments on real-world TSP instances ranging from 1k to 88k nodes
demonstrate that ViTSP consistently achieves solutions with average optimality
gaps below 0.2%, outperforming existing learning-based methods. Under the same
runtime budget, it surpasses the best-performing heuristic solver, LKH-3, by
reducing its gaps by 12% to 100%, particularly on very-large-scale instances
with more than 10k nodes. Our framework offers a new perspective in hybridizing
pre-trained generative models and operations research solvers in solving
combinatorial optimization problems, with practical implications for
integration into more complex logistics systems. The code is available at

*Zhangyu Wang,Nemin Wu,Qian Cao,Jiangnan Xia,Zeping Liu,Yiqun Xie,Akshay Nambi,Tanuja Ganu,Ni Lao,Ninghao Liu,Gengchen Mai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出GeoBS框架，一个模型无关、通用且空间显式的地理偏见评估方法，通过信息论框架量化AI模型中的地理偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI模型特别是基础模型的广泛应用带来了严重的地理偏见问题，现有评估方法存在模型特定或空间隐式的局限性，缺乏公平比较不同模型地理偏见和理解空间因素贡献的通用框架。

Method: 建立信息论框架GeoBS，提出三个考虑多尺度性、距离衰减和各向异性等复杂空间因素的新地理偏见评分，并在3个任务、8个数据集和8个模型上进行广泛实验。

Result: 实验表明特定任务的GeoAI模型和通用基础模型都存在各种类型的地理偏见，框架能有效识别和量化这些偏见。

Conclusion: GeoBS框架不仅推进了对地理偏见的技术理解，还为将空间公平性整合到AI系统的设计、部署和评估中奠定了基础。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of AI models, especially foundation models (FMs), has
made a profound impact on numerous domains. However, it also raises significant
ethical concerns, including bias issues. Although numerous efforts have been
made to quantify and mitigate social bias in AI models, geographic bias (in
short, geo-bias) receives much less attention, which presents unique
challenges. While previous work has explored ways to quantify geo-bias, these
measures are model-specific (e.g., mean absolute deviation of LLM ratings) or
spatially implicit (e.g., average fairness scores of all spatial partitions).
We lack a model-agnostic, universally applicable, and spatially explicit
geo-bias evaluation framework that allows researchers to fairly compare the
geo-bias of different AI models and to understand what spatial factors
contribute to the geo-bias. In this paper, we establish an
information-theoretic framework for geo-bias evaluation, called GeoBS (Geo-Bias
Scores). We demonstrate the generalizability of the proposed framework by
showing how to interpret and analyze existing geo-bias measures under this
framework. Then, we propose three novel geo-bias scores that explicitly take
intricate spatial factors (multi-scalability, distance decay, and anisotropy)
into consideration. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on 3 tasks, 8
datasets, and 8 models to demonstrate that both task-specific GeoAI models and
general-purpose foundation models may suffer from various types of geo-bias.
This framework will not only advance the technical understanding of geographic
bias but will also establish a foundation for integrating spatial fairness into
the design, deployment, and evaluation of AI systems.

Motivation: 解决教育不平等问题，通过开发可扩展的AI辅导系统，特别是针对数据稀疏环境下学生答题正确率预测准确率不高的问题。

Method: 基于项目反应理论的概率建模框架，结合主题级技能画像的协同过滤模型，以及新开发的离散变分推理框架。

Result: 在数学正式考试预测中达到超过80%的准确率，创造了新基准；在低数据设置下，离散变分推理方法优于所有传统IRT和矩阵分解基线。

Conclusion: 单一潜在能力参数足以实现最大预测准确率，离散变分推理框架在低数据环境下表现优异，为AI辅导系统提供了有效的技术解决方案。

Abstract: One of the largest drivers of social inequality is unequal access to personal
tutoring, with wealthier individuals able to afford it, while the majority
cannot. Affordable, effective AI tutors offer a scalable solution. We focus on
adaptive learning, predicting whether a student will answer a question
correctly, a key component of any effective tutoring system. Yet many platforms
struggle to achieve high prediction accuracy, especially in data-sparse
settings. To address this, we release the largest open dataset of
professionally marked formal mathematics exam responses to date. We introduce a
probabilistic modelling framework rooted in Item Response Theory (IRT) that
achieves over 80 percent accuracy, setting a new benchmark for mathematics
prediction accuracy of formal exam papers. Extending this, our collaborative
filtering models incorporate topic-level skill profiles, but reveal a
surprising and educationally significant finding, a single latent ability
parameter alone is needed to achieve the maximum predictive accuracy. Our main
contribution though is deriving and implementing a novel discrete variational
inference framework, achieving our highest prediction accuracy in low-data
settings and outperforming all classical IRT and matrix factorisation
baselines.

*Siyang Wu,Honglin Bao,Sida Li,Ari Holtzman,James A. Evans*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种称为'基准签名'的方法，通过从真实语料中提取关键标记来表征LLM基准测试的能力需求，揭示了不同基准之间的重叠与差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM基准测试存在性能与能力混淆、泛化能力有限等问题，需要一种更准确的方法来理解基准测试的有效性和LLM的敏感性。

Method: 通过逐步前向选择和线性回归，在32个LLM和88个基准测试中提取基准签名，这些签名基于真实语料中的关键标记，其中LLM的标记困惑度能预测基准性能。

Result: 发现知识推理任务存在重叠，多语言和文化基准相似度较低，编码领域重叠最少。基准签名能有效捕捉变化、重叠和差异，且对问题格式等无关因素具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 基准签名为理解基准有效性和LLM能力提供了机制性洞察，描绘了LLM能力的相互关联图景，有助于更准确地评估模型能力。

Abstract: We develop signatures of capacity familiarity to characterize large language
model (LLM) benchmarks and their meaningful overlaps. Benchmark signatures
probe the capacity required for benchmark performance. We formally define them
as a set of salient tokens drawn from in-the-wild, naturally authored corpora,
where LLM token perplexity, reflecting more or less pre-training exposure,
becomes highly predictive of LLM benchmark performance. Through a large-scale
meta-evaluation, we extract benchmark signatures via stepwise forward selection
with linear regressions across 32 LLMs and 88 benchmarks spanning diverse
knowledge, coding, logic, instruction following, math, language, reasoning, and
world modeling. Our analysis situates signatures in relation to both the
semantic similarity of benchmark questions and the correlation of model
performance. While performance overlaps are universally high and semantic
overlaps remain confined to a narrow mid-range, benchmark signatures prove
highly informative in capturing variation, overlap, and divergence. We observe
overlap in knowledge and reasoning subtasks, whereas multilingual and cultural
benchmarks exhibit less similarity, even compared to cross-task overlap.
Notably, performance-level results are strongly influenced by
benchmark-orthogonal factors such as question format, highlighting limitations
in LLM generalization, the conflation of performance with ability, and issues
inherent in current mainstream benchmark agreement studies. Benchmark
signatures, however, remain robust to such effects. Ultimately, we identify
cross-functional overlaps across logic, math, language, instruction following,
and world modeling, with coding emerging as the least overlapping domain.
Together, these findings provide mechanistic insights into benchmark validity
and LLM sensitivities, and sketch the underlying landscape of interconnected
LLM capabilities.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于情境赌博机的动态信任校准方法，通过标准化信任校准度量和指标，在三个不同数据集上验证了该方法能显著提升决策性能（奖励指标提高10-38%）


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类与AI之间的信任校准对协作决策至关重要，但目前缺乏标准化和客观的测量方法。现有方法无法区分意见形成和后续决策过程，且缺乏跨情境的一致性度量

Method: 使用情境赌博机（Contextual Bandits）这一自适应算法，将情境信息纳入决策过程，开发动态信任校准指标来评估何时应该信任AI的贡献

Result: 在三个不同数据集上的评估显示，有效的信任校准显著改善了决策性能，奖励指标提高了10%到38%

Conclusion: 该方法不仅增强了理论理解，还为开发更可信的AI系统提供了实用指导，特别是在疾病诊断和刑事司法等关键领域的决策支持

Abstract: Trust calibration between humans and Artificial Intelligence (AI) is crucial
for optimal decision-making in collaborative settings. Excessive trust can lead
users to accept AI-generated outputs without question, overlooking critical
flaws, while insufficient trust may result in disregarding valuable insights
from AI systems, hindering performance. Despite its importance, there is
currently no definitive and objective method for measuring trust calibration
between humans and AI. Current approaches lack standardization and consistent
metrics that can be broadly applied across various contexts, and they don't
distinguish between the formation of opinions and subsequent human decisions.
In this work, we propose a novel and objective method for dynamic trust
calibration, introducing a standardized trust calibration measure and an
indicator. By utilizing Contextual Bandits-an adaptive algorithm that
incorporates context into decision-making-our indicator dynamically assesses
when to trust AI contributions based on learned contextual information. We
evaluate this indicator across three diverse datasets, demonstrating that
effective trust calibration results in significant improvements in
decision-making performance, as evidenced by 10 to 38% increase in reward
metrics. These findings not only enhance theoretical understanding but also
provide practical guidance for developing more trustworthy AI systems
supporting decisions in critical domains, for example, disease diagnoses and
criminal justice.

*Ashwin Ramaswamy,Nestor Demeure,Ermal Rrapaj*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种使用LLM自动评估其他LLM性能的方法，该方法与人类评估的Elo分数有91%的相关性，可以低成本替代昂贵的人工评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着新LLM的不断发布，需要独立评估模型性能的方法。目前最好的评估方式是通过人类比较LLM输出来计算Elo分数，但这种方法成本高昂。

Method: 使用LLM来评判其他LLM之间的对决，通过统计LLM在比较中一致选择某个模型为最佳的比例，生成一个与人类Elo分数高度相关的代理指标。

Result: 该方法生成的代理指标与人类产生的Elo分数有91%的相关性，验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 这种方法提供了一个简单、低成本的Elo分数代理指标，无需任何人类数据或先验知识即可计算。

Abstract: New large language models (LLMs) are being released every day. Some perform
significantly better or worse than expected given their parameter count.
Therefore, there is a need for a method to independently evaluate models. The
current best way to evaluate a model is to measure its Elo score by comparing
it to other models in a series of contests - an expensive operation since
humans are ideally required to compare LLM outputs. We observe that when an LLM
is asked to judge such contests, the consistency with which it selects a model
as the best in a matchup produces a metric that is 91% correlated with its own
human-produced Elo score. This provides a simple proxy for Elo scores that can
be computed cheaply, without any human data or prior knowledge.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究多轮多智能体编排的有效性，探索多个LLM智能体通过迭代互动达成共识是否能超越单个模型的性能。

Method: 使用四种LLM模型在三个基准测试上进行实验：基准测试比较编排与单模型性能，消融实验研究作者身份可见性和实时投票观察对编排过程的影响。

Result: 编排方法匹配或超越了最强单模型性能，并始终优于其他模型。分析显示编排性能还有进一步提升空间。消融实验表明揭示作者身份会增加自投票和平局，显示实时投票会放大从众效应。

Conclusion: 多轮多智能体编排是有效的协作方法，能够超越单个模型性能，但需要谨慎设计交互机制以避免自投票和从众效应带来的负面影响。

Abstract: We study multi-turn multi-agent orchestration, where multiple large language
model (LLM) agents interact over multiple turns by iteratively proposing
answers or casting votes until reaching consensus. Using four LLMs (Gemini 2.5
Pro, GPT-5, Grok 4, and Claude Sonnet 4) on GPQA-Diamond, IFEval, and MuSR, we
conduct two experiments: (i) benchmarking orchestration against single-LLM
baselines; and (ii) ablations on GPQA-Diamond that vary whether agents see who
authored answers and whether they can observe ongoing votes. Orchestration
matches or exceeds the strongest single model and consistently outperforms the
others. Analysis of best-achievable orchestration performance shows potential
for further gains. The ablations show that revealing authorship increases
self-voting and ties, and that showing ongoing votes amplifies herding, which
speeds convergence but can sometimes yield premature consensus.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然能力强大，但也带来了新的安全挑战，特别是提示越狱攻击。为了发现LLM对齐方法中的漏洞，需要开发更有效的攻击框架。

Method: 使用强化学习将越狱提示转化为形式化描述，构建GraphRAG系统，利用提取的相关术语和形式化符号作为上下文输入来强化攻击。

Result: 在常见开源模型上进行了广泛实验，证明了该攻击方法的有效性。

Conclusion: PASS框架能够有效发现LLM对齐方法中的漏洞，增强越狱攻击的隐蔽性和效果。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, yet
they also introduce novel security challenges. For instance, prompt
jailbreaking attacks involve adversaries crafting sophisticated prompts to
elicit responses from LLMs that deviate from human values. To uncover
vulnerabilities in LLM alignment methods, we propose the PASS framework
(\underline{P}rompt J\underline{a}ilbreaking via \underline{S}emantic and
\underline{S}tructural Formalization). Specifically, PASS employs reinforcement
learning to transform initial jailbreak prompts into formalized descriptions,
which enhances stealthiness and enables bypassing existing alignment defenses.
The jailbreak outputs are then structured into a GraphRAG system that, by
leveraging extracted relevant terms and formalized symbols as contextual input
alongside the original query, strengthens subsequent attacks and facilitates
more effective jailbreaks. We conducted extensive experiments on common
open-source models, demonstrating the effectiveness of our attack.

Motivation: 现有中医AI处方推荐模型存在三个主要局限：(1)忽视患者个性化信息(年龄、BMI、病史等)影响证候识别准确性；(2)草药数据的长尾分布导致训练偏差；(3)忽略'君臣佐使'配伍原则增加毒副作用风险。

Method: 采用分层结构增强的个性化推荐方法：预训练症状表示使用患者个性化提示序列；应用提示导向对比学习进行数据增强；KG引导的同构图扩散结合自注意力机制捕获症状-草药非线性关系；异构图分层网络整合草药配伍关系与隐式证候。

Result: 在两个公共数据集和一个临床数据集上的广泛实验证明了TCM-HEDPR的有效性，并结合现代医学和网络药理学对推荐处方进行综合评估。

Conclusion: 该模型为现代中医处方推荐提供了新范式，能够更准确地识别证候、缓解长尾分布问题，并遵循中医配伍原则。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence technology plays a crucial role in recommending
prescriptions for traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Previous studies have
made significant progress by focusing on the symptom-herb relationship in
prescriptions. However, several limitations hinder model performance: (i)
Insufficient attention to patient-personalized information such as age, BMI,
and medical history, which hampers accurate identification of syndrome and
reduces efficacy. (ii) The typical long-tailed distribution of herb data
introduces training biases and affects generalization ability. (iii) The
oversight of the 'monarch, minister, assistant and envoy' compatibility among
herbs increases the risk of toxicity or side effects, opposing the 'treatment
based on syndrome differentiation' principle in clinical TCM. Therefore, we
propose a novel hierarchical structure-enhanced personalized recommendation
model for TCM formulas based on knowledge graph diffusion guidance, namely
TCM-HEDPR. Specifically, we pre-train symptom representations using
patient-personalized prompt sequences and apply prompt-oriented contrastive
learning for data augmentation. Furthermore, we employ a KG-guided homogeneous
graph diffusion method integrated with a self-attention mechanism to globally
capture the non-linear symptom-herb relationship. Lastly, we design a
heterogeneous graph hierarchical network to integrate herbal dispensing
relationships with implicit syndromes, guiding the prescription generation
process at a fine-grained level and mitigating the long-tailed herb data
distribution problem. Extensive experiments on two public datasets and one
clinical dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of TCM-HEDPR. In addition, we
incorporate insights from modern medicine and network pharmacology to evaluate
the recommended prescriptions comprehensively. It can provide a new paradigm
for the recommendation of modern TCM.

Motivation: 人类反馈在LLM对齐中至关重要，但反馈数据往往存在噪声和不一致性，这会降低奖励模型质量并阻碍对齐效果。现有自动数据清洗方法缺乏系统性评估。

Method: 开发了PrefCleanBench基准，提供标准化协议来评估清洗策略，统一比较了13种不同方法，涵盖多种数据集、模型架构和优化算法。

Result: 通过系统比较揭示了数据清洗在LLM对齐任务中成功的关键因素，为改进数据质量提供了原则性和可复现的方法。

Conclusion: 该基准为通过改善数据质量来提升LLM对齐效果奠定了基础，强调了数据预处理在负责任AI开发中的关键但未被充分探索的作用。

Abstract: Human feedback plays a pivotal role in aligning large language models (LLMs)
with human preferences. However, such feedback is often noisy or inconsistent,
which can degrade the quality of reward models and hinder alignment. While
various automated data cleaning methods have been proposed to mitigate this
issue, a systematic evaluation of their effectiveness and generalizability
remains lacking. To bridge this gap, we introduce the first comprehensive
benchmark for evaluating 13 preference data cleaning methods in the context of
LLM alignment. PrefCleanBench offers a standardized protocol to assess cleaning
strategies in terms of alignment performance and generalizability across
diverse datasets, model architectures, and optimization algorithms. By unifying
disparate methods and rigorously comparing them, we uncover key factors that
determine the success of data cleaning in alignment tasks. This benchmark lays
the groundwork for principled and reproducible approaches to improving LLM
alignment through better data quality-highlighting the crucial but
underexplored role of data preprocessing in responsible AI development. We
release modular implementations of all methods to catalyze further research:

Motivation: 扩散规划器在自动驾驶中表现出色，但在反应性闭环环境中有效引导这些模型仍然是一个重大挑战。简单的条件化在复杂动态驾驶场景中往往无法提供足够的指导。

Method: 提出BridgeDrive方法，采用锚点引导的扩散桥策略，提供原则性的扩散框架，将锚点有效转化为细粒度轨迹规划，并能适应不同的交通条件。该方法兼容高效的ODE求解器。

Result: 在Bench2Drive基准测试中实现了最先进的性能，成功率比现有技术提高了5%。

Conclusion: BridgeDrive为闭环轨迹规划提供了一种有效的锚点引导扩散方法，在复杂动态驾驶场景中表现出色，具有实时部署的潜力。

Abstract: Diffusion-based planners have shown great promise for autonomous driving due
to their ability to capture multi-modal driving behaviors. However, guiding
these models effectively in reactive, closed-loop environments remains a
significant challenge. Simple conditioning often fails to provide sufficient
guidance in complex and dynamic driving scenarios. Recent work attempts to use
typical expert driving behaviors (i.e., anchors) to guide diffusion models but
relies on a truncated schedule, which introduces theoretical inconsistencies
and can compromise performance. To address this, we introduce BridgeDrive, a
novel anchor-guided diffusion bridge policy for closed-loop trajectory
planning. Our approach provides a principled diffusion framework that
effectively translates anchors into fine-grained trajectory plans,
appropriately responding to varying traffic conditions. Our planner is
compatible with efficient ODE solvers, a critical factor for real-time
autonomous driving deployment. We achieve state-of-the-art performance on the
Bench2Drive benchmark, improving the success rate by 5% over prior arts.

Motivation: 现有LLM代理防护系统存在两个根本限制：(i)对所有用户应用统一的防护策略，忽略了相同行为对不同用户的风险差异；(ii)孤立检查每个响应，无法追踪跨交互的风险演变和累积。

Method: PSG-Agent通过挖掘交互历史中的稳定特征和实时查询状态创建个性化防护，并在代理流水线中实现持续监控，包括计划监控器、工具防火墙、响应防护器和内存守护者等专门防护组件。

Abstract: Effective guardrails are essential for safely deploying LLM-based agents in
critical applications. Despite recent advances, existing guardrails suffer from
two fundamental limitations: (i) they apply uniform guardrail policies to all
users, ignoring that the same agent behavior can harm some users while being
safe for others; (ii) they check each response in isolation, missing how risks
evolve and accumulate across multiple interactions. To solve these issues, we
propose PSG-Agent, a personalized and dynamic system for LLM-based agents.
First, PSG-Agent creates personalized guardrails by mining the interaction
history for stable traits and capturing real-time states from current queries,
generating user-specific risk thresholds and protection strategies. Second,

TL;DR: 提出Reasoning Scaffolding框架，通过将推理过程抽象为离散语义信号序列来改进知识蒸馏，使小型语言模型学习推理的算法结构而非表面文本模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于文本推理过程的行为克隆方法存在根本局限，只能让小型模型模仿表面模式而非推理的算法结构，导致逻辑鲁棒性不足。

Method: 将推理重构为结构化生成过程：首先将教师模型的思维过程抽象为离散可解释的语义信号序列，然后通过多任务目标训练学生模型预测下一个语义信号并生成相应推理步骤。

Result: 在多个具有挑战性的推理基准测试中，该方法在准确性和逻辑一致性方面显著优于最先进的知识蒸馏方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为创建真正具有推理能力而非仅能流畅模仿的小型模型提供了一条可行路径。

Abstract: The prevailing approach to distilling reasoning from Large Language Models
(LLMs)-behavioral cloning from textual rationales-is fundamentally limited. It
teaches Small Language Models (SLMs) to mimic surface-level patterns rather
than the underlying algorithmic structure of thought, resulting in a critical
lack of logical robustness. We argue that instead of cloning text, distillation
should transfer this algorithmic structure directly. We introduce Reasoning
Scaffolding}, a framework that reframes reasoning as a structured generation
process. Our method first abstracts the teacher's thought process into a
sequence of discrete, interpretable semantic signals (e.g., Contrast, Addition)
that act as a scaffold. The student model is then trained via a multi-task
objective to both (1)predict the next semantic signal, anticipating the
reasoning flow, and (2)generate the corresponding step, conditioned on that
signal. This multi-task scheme acts as a powerful regularizer, compelling the
student to internalize the computational patterns of coherent reasoning. On a
suite of challenging reasoning benchmarks, our method significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art distillation in both accuracy and logical consistency,
providing a path towards creating smaller models that are genuine reasoners,
not just fluent mimics.

Motivation: 理解RLVR训练中出现的两阶段学习曲线、V形响应长度轨迹和对灾难性遗忘的脆弱性等令人困惑的行为，并为这些看似不同的现象提供统一解释。

Method: 提出语义复杂网络自组织理论，认为模型推理过程映射到拓扑结构稀疏的网络，平均度接近2。基于该理论设计Annealed-RLVR算法，在最大挫折点引入基于SFT的加热步骤来解决竞争瓶颈。

Result: 在1.5B参数模型上的实验表明，Annealed-RLVR在分布内和分布外基准测试中都优于标准RLVR方法。

Conclusion: 通过将RLVR从黑盒优化重新构建为可预测的结构自组织过程，为未来AI系统推理能力的工程化提供了新的物理直觉。

Abstract: Training large language models with Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable
Rewards (RLVR) exhibits a set of distinctive and puzzling behaviors that remain
poorly understood, including a two-stage learning curve, V-shaped
response-length trajectories, and a pronounced vulnerability to catastrophic
forgetting. In this work, we propose that these seemingly disparate phenomena
can be explained using a single unifying theory: the model's reasoning process
maps to the self-organization of a semantic complex network whose topology
remains persistently sparse, with the average degree pinned close to two. This
topology imposes a fundamental mechanism for forgetting and learning: it first
drives the system into a maximally frustrated state where ``skill islands''
form, slow-learning happens, and forgetting is induced; then it enters a sharp
growth phase where the new skills are ``bolted on'', driven by
phase-transition-like learning at the web's frontier. Equipped with the theory,
we propose \textit{Annealed-RLVR}, a principled algorithm that introduces an
SFT-based ``heating'' step at the point of maximal frustration to resolve the
competitive bottleneck and enhance the reasoning capability of the model.
Experiments on a 1.5B-parameter model demonstrate that the approach outperforms
standard RLVR on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution benchmarks. By
recasting RLVR from black-box optimization into a predictable process of
structural self-organization, our work provides a new physical intuition for
engineering the emergent reasoning capabilities of future AI systems.

Motivation: 大型推理模型生成显式推理轨迹和最终答案，但这些推理轨迹在多大程度上影响答案生成尚不清楚，需要系统研究推理与答案生成之间的相互作用。

Method: 采用三阶段研究方法：1）实证评估推理对答案质量的影响；2）注意力分析揭示答案标记对推理标记的关注模式；3）通过激活修补进行机制干预，评估答案标记对推理激活的依赖性。

Result: 包含显式推理能一致提升各领域答案质量；答案标记显著关注推理标记，某些中间层推理聚焦头能密切跟踪推理轨迹；对关键推理标记的扰动可可靠地改变最终答案。

Conclusion: 研究确认了从推理到答案的方向性和功能性信息流，深化了对大型推理模型如何利用推理标记进行答案生成的理解，突出了中间推理在塑造模型输出中的功能性作用。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) generate explicit reasoning traces alongside
final answers, yet the extent to which these traces influence answer generation
remains unclear. In this work, we conduct a three-stage investigation into the
interplay between reasoning and answer generation in three distilled DeepSeek
R1 models. First, through empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that including
explicit reasoning consistently improves answer quality across diverse domains.
Second, attention analysis reveals that answer tokens attend substantially to
reasoning tokens, with certain mid-layer Reasoning-Focus Heads (RFHs) closely
tracking the reasoning trajectory, including self-reflective cues. Third, we
apply mechanistic interventions using activation patching to assess the
dependence of answer tokens on reasoning activations. Our results show that
perturbations to key reasoning tokens can reliably alter the final answers,
confirming a directional and functional flow of information from reasoning to
answer. These findings deepen our understanding of how LRMs leverage reasoning
tokens for answer generation, highlighting the functional role of intermediate
reasoning in shaping model outputs. Our data and code are publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 搜索代理虽然能让LLM访问更广泛和更新的互联网信息，但不可靠的搜索结果可能对终端用户构成安全威胁，建立了一个新的威胁面。

Method: 提出了一个系统化、可扩展且成本效益高的自动化红队框架，构建了SafeSearch基准，包含5类风险的300个测试用例，评估了3种代表性搜索代理框架和15种后端LLM。

Result: 实验结果显示LLM搜索代理存在严重漏洞：当暴露于不可靠网站时，GPT-4.1-mini在搜索工作流设置下的最高攻击成功率可达90.5%，常见防御实践如提醒提示效果有限。

Conclusion: 该框架有助于促进更安全的代理开发透明度，强调了搜索代理安全评估的重要性。

Abstract: Search agents connect LLMs to the Internet, enabling access to broader and
more up-to-date information. However, unreliable search results may also pose
safety threats to end users, establishing a new threat surface. In this work,
we conduct two in-the-wild experiments to demonstrate both the prevalence of
low-quality search results and their potential to misguide agent behaviors. To
counter this threat, we introduce an automated red-teaming framework that is
systematic, scalable, and cost-efficient, enabling lightweight and harmless
safety assessments of search agents. Building on this framework, we construct
the SafeSearch benchmark, which includes 300 test cases covering five
categories of risks (e.g., misinformation and indirect prompt injection). Using
this benchmark, we evaluate three representative search agent scaffolds,
covering search workflow, tool-calling, and deep research, across 7 proprietary
and 8 open-source backend LLMs. Our results reveal substantial vulnerabilities
of LLM-based search agents: when exposed to unreliable websites, the highest
ASR reached 90.5% for GPT-4.1-mini under a search workflow setting. Moreover,
our analysis highlights the limited effectiveness of common defense practices,
such as reminder prompting. This emphasizes the value of our framework in
promoting transparency for safer agent development. Our codebase and test cases
are publicly available: https://github.com/jianshuod/SafeSearch.

### [607] [Measuring Sparse Autoencoder Feature Sensitivity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23717)
*Claire Tian,Katherine Tian,Nathan Hu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种评估稀疏自编码器特征敏感性的可扩展方法，发现许多可解释特征敏感性较差，且平均特征敏感性随SAE宽度增加而下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SAE特征分析主要关注激活示例，但无法揭示特征敏感性——即特征在类似文本上可靠激活的能力。

Method: 使用语言模型生成与特征激活示例具有相同语义属性的文本，然后测试特征是否在这些生成文本上激活。

Result: 许多可解释特征敏感性较差；人类评估确认当特征在生成文本上不激活时，这些文本确实与原始激活示例相似；平均特征敏感性随SAE宽度增加而下降。

Conclusion: 特征敏感性是评估单个特征和SAE架构的新维度。

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) features have become essential tools for mechanistic
interpretability research. SAE features are typically characterized by
examining their activating examples, which are often "monosemantic" and align
with human interpretable concepts. However, these examples don't reveal feature
sensitivity: how reliably a feature activates on texts similar to its
activating examples. In this work, we develop a scalable method to evaluate
feature sensitivity. Our approach avoids the need to generate natural language
descriptions for features; instead we use language models to generate text with
the same semantic properties as a feature's activating examples. We then test
whether the feature activates on these generated texts. We demonstrate that
sensitivity measures a new facet of feature quality and find that many
interpretable features have poor sensitivity. Human evaluation confirms that
when features fail to activate on our generated text, that text genuinely
resembles the original activating examples. Lastly, we study feature
sensitivity at the SAE level and observe that average feature sensitivity
declines with increasing SAE width across 7 SAE variants. Our work establishes
feature sensitivity as a new dimension for evaluating both individual features
and SAE architectures.

Motivation: 现有多智能体方法依赖固定角色或浅层交互提示，难以检测和解决细粒度逻辑不一致问题。需要更有效的医疗推理框架。

Method: 每个智能体基于三段论（大前提、小前提、结论）构建显式逻辑树，通过多轮图引导讨论比较和迭代优化逻辑树，实现错误纠正和矛盾解决。

Result: 在MedDDx和标准医疗QA任务上，MedLA持续优于静态角色系统和单智能体基线，在不同LLM骨干网络上都能有效扩展，达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: MedLA提供了一个可推广的、可信赖的医疗推理范式，通过逻辑驱动和多智能体协作实现更好的医疗问答性能。

Abstract: Answering complex medical questions requires not only domain expertise and
patient-specific information, but also structured and multi-perspective
reasoning. Existing multi-agent approaches often rely on fixed roles or shallow
interaction prompts, limiting their ability to detect and resolve fine-grained
logical inconsistencies. To address this, we propose \textsc{MedLA}, a
logic-driven multi-agent framework built on large language models. Each agent
organizes its reasoning process into an explicit logical tree based on
syllogistic triads (major premise, minor premise, and conclusion), enabling
transparent inference and premise-level alignment. Agents engage in a
multi-round, graph-guided discussion to compare and iteratively refine their
logic trees, achieving consensus through error correction and contradiction
resolution. We demonstrate that \textsc{MedLA} consistently outperforms both
static role-based systems and single-agent baselines on challenging benchmarks
such as MedDDx and standard medical QA tasks. Furthermore, \textsc{MedLA}
scales effectively across both open-source and commercial LLM backbones,
achieving state-of-the-art performance and offering a generalizable paradigm
for trustworthy medical reasoning.

Conclusion: 外部专家协助能有效将专家知识内化到策略模型中，增强模型固有推理能力，训练后的模型能独立产生更好的推理路径和更准确的解决方案

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently advanced in reasoning when
optimized with reinforcement learning (RL) under verifiable rewards. Existing
methods primarily rely on outcome-based supervision to strengthen internal LLM
reasoning, often leading to inefficient exploration and sparse rewards. To
mitigate this issue, we propose Expert-Assisted Policy Optimization (EAPO), a
novel RL framework that enhances exploration by incorporating multi-turn
interactions with external experts during training. Unlike prior methods, where
policies reason in isolation, EAPO incentivizes the policy to adaptively
determine when and how to consult experts, yielding richer reward signals and
more reliable reasoning trajectories. External assistance ultimately
internalizes expert knowledge into the policy model, amplifying the model's
inherent reasoning capabilities. During evaluation, the policy model has been
well-optimized to solve questions independently, producing improved reasoning
paths and more accurate solutions. Experiments on mathematical reasoning
benchmarks, including AIME 2024, AIME 2025, and AIMO 2025, show that EAPO
consistently outperforms expert-assisted workflow, expert-distilled models, and
RL baselines, with an average gain of 5 points over self-exploratory models.

Abstract: Agentic systems consisting of multiple LLM-driven agents coordinating through
tools and structured interactions, are increasingly deployed for complex
reasoning and problem-solving tasks. At the same time, emerging low-code and
template-based agent development platforms (e.g., Dify) enable users to rapidly
build and orchestrate agentic systems, which we refer to as
platform-orchestrated agentic systems. However, these systems are also fragile
and it remains unclear how to systematically identify their potential failure
root cause. This paper presents a study of root cause identification of these
platform-orchestrated agentic systems. To support this initiative, we construct
a dataset AgentFail containing 307 failure logs from ten agentic systems, each
with fine-grained annotations linking failures to their root causes. We
additionally utilize counterfactual reasoning-based repair strategy to ensure
the reliability of the annotation. Building on the dataset, we develop a
taxonomy that characterizes failure root causes and analyze their distribution
across different platforms and task domains. Furthermore, we introduce a
benchmark that leverages LLMs for automatically identifying root causes, in
which we also utilize the proposed taxonomy as guidance for LLMs. Results show
that the taxonomy can largely improve the performance, thereby confirming its
utility. Nevertheless, the accuracy of root cause identification reaches at
most 33.6%, which indicates that this task still remains challenging. In light
of these results, we also provide actionable guidelines for building such
agentic systems. In summary, this paper provides a reliable dataset of failure
root cause for platform-orchestrated agentic systems, corresponding taxonomy
and benchmark, which serves as a foundation for advancing the development of
more reliable agentic systems.

Abstract: Autonomous agents for long-sequence Graphical User Interface tasks are
hindered by sparse rewards and the intractable credit assignment problem. To
address these challenges, we introduce GUI-Shepherd, a Process Reward Model
that provides dense, step-by-step feedback to guide agents. GUI-Shepherd is
trained on a diverse large-scale data set of $52$k interactions that features
human-annotated scores and GPT-4o generated rationales, enabling it to serve
both as a reward provider for RL training and as a verifier for inference. As
far as we know, we are the first to conduct a systematic study of process
supervision in GUI agents, across diverse settings from online long-horizon
tasks to offline single-step prediction. On the online AndroidWorld benchmark,
GUI-Shepherd improves success rate by $7.7$ points via multi-turn online PPO,
significantly outperforming Outcome Reward Model based competitors. When used
as an inference verifier, it brings $5.1$ points improvements. The benefits
generalize to the offline AndroidControl benchmark, with gains of $2.2$ points
as a reward provider and $4.3$ points as a verifier. Collectively, our results
establish that high-fidelity process supervision is critical for building more
capable GUI agents and present a generalizable solution.

Conclusion: ChemMAS为科学发现中的可解释AI建立了新范式，通过可验证的化学知识和检索先例支持决策。

Abstract: The chemical reaction recommendation is to select proper reaction condition
parameters for chemical reactions, which is pivotal to accelerating chemical
science. With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), there is
growing interest in leveraging their reasoning and planning capabilities for
reaction condition recommendation. Despite their success, existing methods
rarely explain the rationale behind the recommended reaction conditions,
limiting their utility in high-stakes scientific workflows. In this work, we
propose ChemMAS, a multi-agent system that reframes condition prediction as an
evidence-based reasoning task. ChemMAS decomposes the task into mechanistic
grounding, multi-channel recall, constraint-aware agentic debate, and rationale
aggregation. Each decision is backed by interpretable justifications grounded
in chemical knowledge and retrieved precedents. Experiments show that ChemMAS
achieves 20-35% gains over domain-specific baselines and outperforms
general-purpose LLMs by 10-15% in Top-1 accuracy, while offering falsifiable,
human-trustable rationales, which establishes a new paradigm for explainable AI
in scientific discovery.

Abstract: Existing methods for evaluating the harmfulness of content generated by large

multimodal large language models (MLLMs) remain underdeveloped and lack depth.
This work highlights the crucial role of visual information in moderating
content in visual question answering (VQA), a dimension often overlooked in
current research. To bridge this gap, we introduce Falcon, a large-scale
vision-language safety dataset containing 57,515 VQA pairs across 13 harm
categories. The dataset provides explicit annotations for harmful attributes
across images, instructions, and responses, thereby facilitating a
comprehensive evaluation of the content generated by MLLMs. In addition, it
includes the relevant harm categories along with explanations supporting the
corresponding judgments. We further propose FalconEye, a specialized evaluator
fine-tuned from Qwen2.5-VL-7B using the Falcon dataset. Experimental results
demonstrate that FalconEye reliably identifies harmful content in complex and
safety-critical multimodal dialogue scenarios. It outperforms all other
baselines in overall accuracy across our proposed Falcon-test dataset and two
widely-used benchmarks-VLGuard and Beavertail-V, underscoring its potential as
a practical safety auditing tool for MLLMs.

frustration, and maintain an optimal level of challenge. A pilot user study
investigates the effectiveness of this approach, comparing different types of
adaptive difficulty systems and interpreting players' responses. This work lays
the foundation for further research into emotionally informed player models,
advanced AI techniques for adaptivity, and broader applications beyond gaming
in educational settings.

TL;DR: 提出了Mix-ECom数据集，用于评估电商领域LLM代理处理混合类型对话和复杂领域规则的能力，包含4,799个样本，涵盖四种对话类型、三种电商任务类型和82条电商规则。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前电商代理基准缺乏评估处理混合类型电商对话和复杂领域规则的能力，需要更全面的评估框架。

Method: 基于真实客服对话构建Mix-ECom语料库，经过隐私处理和CoT过程添加，包含多种对话类型和电商规则，并建立了基线模型和动态框架。

Result: 结果显示当前电商代理在处理电商对话时能力不足，主要由于复杂领域规则导致的幻觉问题。

Conclusion: Mix-ECom数据集填补了电商代理评估的空白，揭示了当前模型在处理复杂电商对话时的局限性，数据集将公开可用。

Abstract: E-commerce agents contribute greatly to helping users complete their
e-commerce needs. To promote further research and application of e-commerce
agents, benchmarking frameworks are introduced for evaluating LLM agents in the
e-commerce domain. Despite the progress, current benchmarks lack evaluating
agents' capability to handle mixed-type e-commerce dialogue and complex domain
rules. To address the issue, this work first introduces a novel corpus, termed
Mix-ECom, which is constructed based on real-world customer-service dialogues
with post-processing to remove user privacy and add CoT process. Specifically,
Mix-ECom contains 4,799 samples with multiply dialogue types in each e-commerce
dialogue, covering four dialogue types (QA, recommendation, task-oriented
dialogue, and chit-chat), three e-commerce task types (pre-sales, logistics,
after-sales), and 82 e-commerce rules. Furthermore, this work build baselines
on Mix-Ecom and propose a dynamic framework to further improve the performance.
Results show that current e-commerce agents lack sufficient capabilities to
handle e-commerce dialogues, due to the hallucination cased by complex domain
rules. The dataset will be publicly available.

TL;DR: AgentGuard是一个用于自主AI系统运行时验证的框架，通过动态概率保证提供连续量化保障，将代理的原始I/O抽象为状态模型转换事件，使用在线学习构建马尔可夫决策过程模型，并通过概率模型检查实时验证定量属性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自主AI系统的快速发展带来了显著风险，因为其固有的不可预测性和涌现行为使得传统验证方法不足，需要转向概率保证方法。

Method: AgentGuard作为检查层观察代理的原始I/O，将其抽象为状态模型转换的形式事件，使用在线学习动态构建和更新马尔可夫决策过程模型，并通过概率模型检查进行实时验证。

Result: 提出了动态概率保证的新范式，能够为自主AI系统提供连续、定量的运行时验证保障。

Conclusion: AgentGuard框架通过动态概率保证方法有效解决了自主AI系统验证的挑战，提供了比传统方法更适用的验证解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid evolution to autonomous, agentic AI systems introduces significant
risks due to their inherent unpredictability and emergent behaviors; this also
renders traditional verification methods inadequate and necessitates a shift
towards probabilistic guarantees where the question is no longer if a system
will fail, but the probability of its failure within given constraints. This
paper presents AgentGuard, a framework for runtime verification of Agentic AI
systems that provides continuous, quantitative assurance through a new paradigm
called Dynamic Probabilistic Assurance. AgentGuard operates as an inspection
layer that observes an agent's raw I/O and abstracts it into formal events
corresponding to transitions in a state model. It then uses online learning to
dynamically build and update a Markov Decision Process (MDP) that formally
models the agent's emergent behavior. Using probabilistic model checking, the
framework then verifies quantitative properties in real-time.

Conclusion: 梯度耦合是智能体强化学习中的关键问题，通过分类好坏动作可以有效分离梯度，提升训练性能。

Abstract: Building autonomous agents capable of solving long-horizon, real-world tasks
has garnered significant research interest. But outcome based rewards may cause
reward miscalibration which means it might mistakenly allocate positive reward
to flawed middle steps which is regarded as the key reason making the bad
actions being reinforced during training. However we reveal that outcome based
reward ensures expected negative advantage for those flawed middle steps, which
means the flawed actions should be punished during training. Even accounting
for the ``squeezing effect", the probability mass of good actions should
increase and the actor should gradually get rid of harmful actions. This shows
that flawed actions should be punished during training. We further identify
gradient coupling between similar samples as a key issue in agentic RL, the
input prompt is extremely similar and the output action space is limited,
therefore during training, gradients from well-performing samples can
inadvertently strengthen suboptimal or incorrect actions due to similar input
observation and output actions. We show that with gradient coupling, some
flawed actions might be enhanced. To address this, we propose training the
actor to classify good or bad actions to separate the embedding of good/bad
actions and alleviate the gradient interference, extensive experiments shows
its effectiveness.

Conclusion: 本文为使用纤维化作为解释神经网络学习逻辑理论的形式化工具开辟了道路，将计算逻辑工具应用于神经网络解释领域。

Abstract: Fibring of modal logics is a well-established formalism for combining
countable families of modal logics into a single fibred language with common
semantics, characterized by fibred models. Inspired by this formalism, fibring
of neural networks was introduced as a neurosymbolic framework for combining
learning and reasoning in neural networks. Fibring of neural networks uses the
(pre-)activations of a trained network to evaluate a fibring function computing
the weights of another network whose outputs are injected back into the
original network. However, the exact correspondence between fibring of neural
networks and fibring of modal logics was never formally established. In this
paper, we close this gap by formalizing the idea of fibred models
\emph{compatible} with fibred neural networks. Using this correspondence, we
then derive non-uniform logical expressiveness results for Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs), Graph Attention Networks (GATs) and Transformer encoders.
Longer-term, the goal of this paper is to open the way for the use of fibring
as a formalism for interpreting the logical theories learnt by neural networks
with the tools of computational logic.

TL;DR: 提出了CANON方法，通过无方向性优势估计增强目标指标的影响，在数学推理和复杂逻辑任务中优于现有方法，并能提高token效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法在LLMs推理任务中依赖方向性先验（如奖励或优势塑形），这些方法需要精心调参且可能因过度偏差而失败。

Method: CANON方法将采样响应按目标指标值高低分组，通过组间比较确定哪个指标趋势贡献更好性能，并在组内识别更好响应。

Result: 基于熵的CANON在三个LLMs上对数学推理和高复杂度逻辑任务均优于现有方法；应用于响应长度时进一步提高了token效率。

Conclusion: CANON方法有效增强了目标指标的影响而不预设其方向，在性能和成本权衡中产生了更优的帕累托前沿。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) for large language
models (LLMs) has achieved remarkable progress in enhancing LLMs' reasoning
capabilities on tasks with clear correctness criteria, such as mathematical
reasoning tasks. Several training metrics, such as entropy or response length,
have been observed to correlate with different reasoning behaviors in
reinforcement learning. Prior approaches incorporate such priors through reward
or advantage shaping, which often relies on hand-crafted penalties and
preferences (e.g., higher-is-better or lower-is-better). However, without
careful hyperparameter tuning, these directional priors can be overly biased
and may lead to failure. To this end, we introduce Conditional advANtage
estimatiON (CANON), amplifying the impact of the target metric without
presuming its direction. Specifically, CANON regroups the sampled responses
into two groups based on the higher or lower value of a target metric, measures
which metric trend contributes to better performance through inter-group
comparison, and identifies the better response within the same group. In
summary, CANON based on entropy consistently outperforms prior methods across
three LLMs on both math reasoning and high-complexity logic tasks. When applied
to response length, CANON further improves token efficiency, yielding a more
favorable Pareto frontier in the performance-cost trade-off.

Motivation: 系统文献综述中的文献搜索、筛选和分析任务耗时，需要自动化工具来减少人工工作量，特别是通过机器学习自动筛选相关文献。

Method: 使用语法引导遗传编程构建基于规则的可解释分类器，能够结合文本信息和文献计量数据，定义规则的语法和结构。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在保持可解释性的同时实现了准确的文献筛选，扩展了可用的信息源类型。

Abstract: Searching, filtering and analysing scientific literature are time-consuming
tasks when performing a systematic literature review. With the rise of
artificial intelligence, some steps in the review process are progressively
being automated. In particular, machine learning for automatic paper selection
can greatly reduce the effort required to identify relevant literature in
scientific databases. We propose an evolutionary machine learning approach,
called \ourmodel, to automatically determine whether a paper retrieved from a
literature search process is relevant. \ourmodel builds an interpretable
rule-based classifier using grammar-guided genetic programming. The use of a
grammar to define the syntax and the structure of the rules allows \ourmodel to
easily combine the usual textual information with other bibliometric data not
considered by state-of-the-art methods. Our experiments demonstrate that it is
possible to generate accurate classifiers without impairing interpretability
and using configurable information sources not supported so far.

Motivation: 科学发现因手动开发计算工具而缓慢，现有LLM系统要么使用现有方法进行分析，要么开发通用机器学习方法，未能有效整合特定科学领域的非结构化知识。

Method: TusoAI采用知识树表示整合领域知识，通过迭代的领域特定优化和模型诊断，从候选解决方案池中改进性能。

Conclusion: TusoAI能够自主开发优化的计算方法，加速科学发现，并在实际应用中揭示新的生物学知识。

Abstract: Scientific discovery is often slowed by the manual development of
computational tools needed to analyze complex experimental data. Building such
tools is costly and time-consuming because scientists must iteratively review
literature, test modeling and scientific assumptions against empirical data,
and implement these insights into efficient software. Large language models
(LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in synthesizing literature,
reasoning with empirical data, and generating domain-specific code, offering
new opportunities to accelerate computational method development. Existing
LLM-based systems either focus on performing scientific analyses using existing
computational methods or on developing computational methods or models for
general machine learning without effectively integrating the often unstructured
knowledge specific to scientific domains. Here, we introduce TusoAI , an
agentic AI system that takes a scientific task description with an evaluation
function and autonomously develops and optimizes computational methods for the
application. TusoAI integrates domain knowledge into a knowledge tree
representation and performs iterative, domain-specific optimization and model
diagnosis, improving performance over a pool of candidate solutions. We
conducted comprehensive benchmark evaluations demonstrating that TusoAI
outperforms state-of-the-art expert methods, MLE agents, and scientific AI
agents across diverse tasks, such as single-cell RNA-seq data denoising and
satellite-based earth monitoring. Applying TusoAI to two key open problems in
genetics improved existing computational methods and uncovered novel biology,
including 9 new associations between autoimmune diseases and T cell subtypes
and 7 previously unreported links between disease variants linked to their
target genes. Our code is publicly available at

TL;DR: 单次运行的LLM排行榜不可靠，研究发现83%的测试场景中单次运行会导致排名反转。建议使用≥2次重复评估来提升可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM排行榜通常依赖单次随机运行，但需要多少次重复才能获得可靠结论尚不清楚。本文旨在评估额外重复的价值。

Method: 在AI4Math基准测试上重新评估8个最先进模型，每个设置进行3次独立运行。使用混合效应逻辑回归、领域级边际均值、排名不稳定性分析和运行间可靠性评估。

Result: 单次运行排行榜脆弱：83%的测试切片至少出现一次成对排名反转。平均运行次数能适度减少标准误（从1次到3次约5%），但排名提升显著；两次运行可消除约83%的单次运行反转。

Conclusion: 建议将评估视为实验，报告不确定性，在随机解码下使用≥2次重复。这些实践能在保持小团队可行性的同时提高鲁棒性，使模型比较更符合实际可靠性。

Abstract: LLM leaderboards often rely on single stochastic runs, but how many
repetitions are required for reliable conclusions remains unclear. We
re-evaluate eight state-of-the-art models on the AI4Math Benchmark with three
independent runs per setting. Using mixed-effects logistic regression,
domain-level marginal means, rank-instability analysis, and run-to-run
reliability, we assessed the value of additional repetitions. Our findings
shows that Single-run leaderboards are brittle: 10/12 slices (83\%) invert at
least one pairwise rank relative to the three-run majority, despite a zero
sign-flip rate for pairwise significance and moderate overall interclass
correlation. Averaging runs yields modest SE shrinkage ($\sim$5\% from one to
three) but large ranking gains; two runs remove $\sim$83\% of single-run
inversions. We provide cost-aware guidance for practitioners: treat evaluation
as an experiment, report uncertainty, and use $\geq 2$ repetitions under
stochastic decoding. These practices improve robustness while remaining
feasible for small teams and help align model comparisons with real-world
reliability.

Abstract: Tool-integrated reasoning has emerged as a key focus for enabling agentic
applications. Among these, DeepResearch Agents have gained significant
attention for their strong performance on complex, open-ended
information-seeking tasks. We introduce Fathom-DeepResearch, an agentic system
composed of two specialized models. The first is Fathom-Search-4B, a DeepSearch
model trained from Qwen3-4B and optimized for evidence-based investigation
through live web search and targeted webpage querying. Its training combines
three advances: (i) DUETQA, a 5K-sample dataset generated via multi-agent
self-play that enforces strict web-search dependence and heterogeneous source
grounding; (ii) RAPO, a zero-overhead extension of GRPO that stabilizes
multi-turn Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards through curriculum
pruning, reward-aware advantage scaling, and per-prompt replay buffers; and
(iii) a steerable step-level reward that classifies each tool call by cognitive
behavior and marginal utility, enabling explicit control over search trajectory
breadth, depth, and horizon. These improvements enable reliable extension of
tool-calling beyond 20 calls when warranted. The second is
Fathom-Synthesizer-4B, trained from Qwen3-4B, which converts multi-turn
DeepSearch traces into structured, citation-dense DeepResearch Reports for
comprehensive synthesis. Evaluated on DeepSearch benchmarks (SimpleQA, FRAMES,
WebWalker, Seal0, MuSiQue) and DeepResearch-Bench, the system achieves
state-of-the-art performance in the open-weights category while demonstrating
strong generalization to diverse reasoning tasks including HLE, AIME-25,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) exhibit unprecedented capabilities in solving
complex problems through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, recent
studies reveal that their final answers often contradict their own reasoning
traces. We hypothesize that this inconsistency stems from two competing
mechanisms for generating answers: CoT reasoning and memory retrieval. To test
this hypothesis, we conduct controlled experiments that challenge LRMs with
misleading cues during reasoning and/or corrupted answers during retrieval. Our
results across models and datasets confirm that both mechanisms operate
simultaneously, with their relative dominance influenced by multiple factors:
problem domains, model scales, and fine-tuning approaches (e.g., reinforcement
learning vs. distillation). The findings reveal a critical limitation in
current reasoning fine-tuning paradigms: models can exploit the retrieval
mechanism as a shortcut, effectively "hacking" the reward signal and
undermining genuine reasoning development. To address this challenge, we
introduce FARL, a novel fine-tuning framework that integrates memory unlearning
with reinforcement learning. By carefully suppressing retrieval shortcuts
during the fine-tuning process, FARL promotes reasoning-dominant behavior and
enhances generalizable reasoning capabilities.

TL;DR: RPO是一个鲁棒偏好优化框架，使用EM算法推断标签正确性后验概率，自适应重加权训练损失来缓解人类偏好数据中的噪声问题，将现有对齐算法系统性地转化为鲁棒版本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准人类偏好对齐方法(如RLHF)基于错误假设：人类偏好是同质的且数据无噪声。实际上人类偏好是多元的，标注者会犯错，导致记录数据与真实偏好存在差异，误导模型并降低性能。

Method: 采用期望最大化(EM)算法推断每个标签正确性的后验概率，用于自适应重加权训练损失中的每个数据点以缓解噪声。建立任意偏好损失与对应概率模型的理论联系，将现有对齐算法系统转化为鲁棒版本。

Result: RPO作为元框架，显著提升了四种最先进对齐算法(DPO、IPO、SimPO、CPO)的性能。在Mistral和Llama 3模型上，RPO增强方法在AlpacaEval 2和Arena-Hard上分别实现了高达7.0%和5.4%的胜率提升。

Conclusion: RPO为解决人类偏好数据中的噪声问题提供了有效框架，理论上证明在完美校准模型条件下能收敛到数据集的真实噪声水平，实验验证了其作为元框架的一致有效性。

Abstract: Standard human preference-based alignment methods, such as Reinforcement
Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), are a cornerstone technology for aligning
Large Language Models (LLMs) with human values. However, these methods are all
underpinned by a critical, yet flawed assumption: human preferences are
homogeneous (representing a single, unified preference) and the collected data
is noiseless (free from error). In reality, neither is true since human
preference is pluralistic and annotators can make mistakes. This creates a
discrepancy between the recorded data and the ground-truth preferences, which
can misguide the model and degrade its performance. To address this challenge,
we introduce Robust Preference Optimization (RPO). RPO employs an
Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to infer the posterior probability of
each label's correctness, which is used to adaptively re-weigh each data point
in the training loss to mitigate noise. We further generalize this approach by
establishing a theoretical link between arbitrary preference losses and their
corresponding probabilistic models. This generalization enables the systematic
transformation of existing alignment algorithms into their robust counterparts,
elevating RPO from a specific algorithm to a meta-framework for robust
preference alignment. Theoretically, we prove that under the condition of a
perfectly calibrated model, RPO is guaranteed to converge to the true noise
level of the dataset. Our experiments demonstrate RPO's effectiveness as a
meta-framework, consistently enhancing four state-of-the-art alignment

*Sijia Liu,Niklas Muennighoff,Kawin Ethayarajh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出在线对齐方法（如GRPO）优于离线对齐（如DPO）的原因在于更好地模拟人类对概率的感知偏差，并提出通过显式整合人类感知偏差来改进离线对齐方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索为什么在线对齐方法比离线对齐方法表现更好，从行为经济学的前景理论角度提供人类感知层面的解释。

Method: 提出humanline变体方法，在DPO/KTO/GRPO等目标函数中显式整合人类对概率的感知偏差，即使使用离线非策略数据也能达到在线方法的性能。

Result: humanline变体方法在使用离线非策略数据时，在可验证和不可验证任务上都能达到与在线方法相当的性能。

Conclusion: 在线/离线二分法本身与最大化人类效用无关，通过模拟人类感知偏差可以更快速、廉价、灵活地进行后训练而不牺牲性能。

Abstract: Online alignment (e.g., GRPO) is generally more performant than offline
alignment (e.g., DPO) -- but why? Drawing on prospect theory from behavioral
economics, we propose a human-centric explanation. We prove that online
on-policy sampling better approximates the human-perceived distribution of what
the model can produce, and PPO/GRPO-style clipping -- originally introduced to
just stabilize training -- recovers a perceptual bias in how humans perceive
probability. In this sense, PPO/GRPO act as perceptual losses already. Our
theory further suggests that the online/offline dichotomy is itself incidental
to maximizing human utility, since we can achieve the same effect by
selectively training on any data in a manner that mimics human perception,
rather than restricting ourselves to online on-policy data. Doing so would
allow us to post-train more quickly, cheaply, and flexibly without sacrificing
performance. To this end, we propose a design pattern that explicitly
incorporates perceptual distortions of probability into objectives like
DPO/KTO/GRPO, creating humanline variants of them. Surprisingly, we find that
these humanline variants, even when trained with offline off-policy data, can
match the performance of their online counterparts on both verifiable and
unverifiable tasks.

*Shaobin Ling,Yun Wang,Chenyou Fan,Tin Lun Lam,Junjie Hu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ELHPlan是一个基于动作链的LLM多机器人协作规划框架，通过意图绑定的动作序列和主动验证机制，在保持任务成功率的同时将token消耗降低到现有方法的24%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在多机器人协作中的基本权衡：声明式方法在动态环境中缺乏适应性，而迭代方法计算成本过高且随团队规模和任务复杂度扩展性差。

Method: 提出动作链作为基本规划原语，采用循环过程：1)构建意图绑定的动作序列，2)主动验证冲突和可行性，3)通过针对性机制修正问题，4)执行验证后的动作。

Result: 在TDW-MAT和C-WAH基准测试中，ELHPlan达到可比的任务成功率，同时仅消耗最先进方法24%的token。

Conclusion: ELHPlan为基于LLM的多智能体规划系统建立了新的效率-效果前沿，平衡了适应性和效率。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) enable intelligent multi-robot collaboration but
face fundamental trade-offs: declarative methods lack adaptability in dynamic
environments, while iterative methods incur prohibitive computational costs
that scale poorly with team size and task complexity. In this paper, we propose
ELHPlan, a novel framework that introduces Action Chains--sequences of actions
explicitly bound to sub-goal intentions--as the fundamental planning primitive.
ELHPlan operates via a cyclical process: 1) constructing intention-bound action
sequences, 2) proactively validating for conflicts and feasibility, 3) refining
issues through targeted mechanisms, and 4) executing validated actions. This
design balances adaptability and efficiency by providing sufficient planning
horizons while avoiding expensive full re-planning. We further propose
comprehensive efficiency metrics, including token consumption and planning
time, to more holistically evaluate multi-agent collaboration. Our experiments
on benchmark TDW-MAT and C-WAH demonstrate that ELHPlan achieves comparable
task success rates while consuming only 24% of the tokens required by
state-of-the-art methods. Our research establishes a new
efficiency-effectiveness frontier for LLM-based multi-agent planning systems.

### [632] [Learning to Ponder: Adaptive Reasoning in Latent Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24238)
*Yixin He,Lumingyuan Tang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FR-Ponder是一个无需修改主干模型权重的自适应推理计算分配框架，通过潜在向量引导机制让模型根据输入复杂度动态调整推理深度，在保持准确率的同时降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的测试时计算方法（如Best-of-N和多数投票）对所有输入采用统一的推理深度，导致简单问题浪费计算资源，复杂问题推理不足。需要一种能根据问题难度自适应分配计算资源的方法。

Method: 使用小于1M参数的控制器观察隐藏状态，决定停止推理或应用小步推理。通过提取与深度推理输出相关的潜在引导向量，以可调缩放因子重新应用，实现推理深度的自适应调整。采用Group Relative Policy Optimization作为奖励信号来平衡性能和计算成本。

Result: 在GSM8K和MATH500数据集上，FR-Ponder改善了计算-准确率边界，在保持准确率的同时降低了FLOPs，优于早期退出基线方法。分析显示学习到的计算分配与问题难度相关。

Conclusion: FR-Ponder通过潜在引导机制实现了实例自适应的推理计算分配，无需修改主干模型权重就能在保持准确率的同时显著降低计算成本，为高效LLM推理提供了新范式。

Abstract: Test-time compute has emerged as a key paradigm for enhancing LLM reasoning,
yet prevailing approaches like Best-of-N and majority voting apply uniform
depth across inputs, wasting computation on simple queries while potentially
under-thinking complex ones. We present FR-Ponder, a single-graph,
backbone-training-free framework that allocates instance-adaptive reasoning
compute via latent steering. A less than 1M-param controller observes hidden
states and decides to halt or apply a small ponder step by adding a
pre-computed steering vector to frozen representations. Our method extracts the
latent steering vector associated with deeper reasoning outputs and direct IO
from LLM and re-applies it through a tunable scaling factor, allowing the model
to adapt its reasoning depth to the complexity of each input. To balance
performance and computational cost, we employ Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) as a reward signal to adaptively regulate reasoning depth,
achieving task accuracy while mitigating overreasoning. Through curriculum
learning and careful reward engineering, FR-Ponder learns calibrated compute
allocation correlated with problem difficulty. On GSM8K and MATH500, FR-Ponder
improves the compute-accuracy frontier, delivering lower FLOPs with better
matched accuracy and comparing favorably to early-exit baselines, without
modifying backbone weights. Analyses visualize interpretable steering
directions and show learned compute allocation correlates with problem
difficulty.

TL;DR: 本文发现了语言模型融合的紧凑幂律规律，揭示了模型大小与专家数量之间的关系，为模型融合提供了可预测的规划方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管模型融合在实践中被广泛使用，但缺乏定量规则来预测随着专家数量增加或模型规模扩大时的收益回报。

Method: 通过实证研究识别出连接模型大小和专家数量的紧凑幂律，并基于此提出简单理论解释增益规律。

Result: 该规律在领域内和跨领域都成立，紧密拟合了不同架构和方法下的测量曲线，并解释了两个稳健规律：大部分增益早期获得，变异性随专家增加而减小。

Conclusion: 该定律使模型融合从启发式实践转变为可计算效率、可规划的替代多任务训练的方法，为分布式生成AI提供了可扩展原则。

Abstract: We study empirical scaling laws for language model merging measured by
cross-entropy. Despite its wide practical use, merging lacks a quantitative
rule that predicts returns as we add experts or scale the model size. We
identify a compact power law that links model size and expert number: the
size-dependent floor decreases with model capacity, while the merging tail
exhibits clear diminishing returns in the number of experts. The law holds
in-domain and cross-domain, tightly fits measured curves across diverse
architectures and methods (Average, TA, TIES, DARE), and explains two robust
regularities: most gains arrive early, and variability shrinks as more experts
are included. Building on this, we present a simple theory that explains why
gains fall roughly as 1/k and links the floor and tail to properties of the
base model and the diversity across domains. This law enables predictive
planning: estimate how many experts are needed to reach a target loss, decide
when to stop adding experts, and trade off scaling the base model versus adding
experts under a fixed budget--turning merging from heuristic practice into a
computationally efficient, planable alternative to multitask training. This
suggests a scaling principle for distributed generative AI: predictable gains
can be achieved by composing specialists, offering a complementary path toward
AGI-level systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大推理模型存在过度思考问题，产生不必要长输出和延迟，现有提前退出机制依赖探测机制，引入检测开销限制延迟收益和泛化能力。

Method: 基于推测解码中隐藏状态的使用，提出SpecExit框架，直接从轻量级草稿模型预测未来token和提前退出信号，避免探测开销。

Result: 相比推测解码基线，平均生成长度减少66%，端到端延迟加速2.5倍，且不损害准确性。

Conclusion: 隐藏状态可提供有效的提前退出信号，表明隐藏状态在高效推理中有更广泛应用前景。

Abstract: Despite their strong performance on reasoning tasks, large reasoning models
(LRMs) often suffer from overthinking, producing unnecessarily long outputs and
incurring high end-to-end latency, a significant limitation to their real-world
deployment. To address overthinking, early-exit mechanisms have been proposed
to terminate reasoning before typical completion, showing that this approach
can effectively shorten generation length with minimal impact on accuracy.
However, their reliance on probing mechanisms introduces a detection overhead
that limits their end-to-end latency gains and compromises their
generalizability across diverse problems. Inspired by the use of hidden states
in speculative decoding, we propose SpecExit, a novel framework that predicts
both future tokens and an early-exit signal directly from a lightweight draft
model without probing overhead. Our method offers significant improvements,
reducing average generation length by 66\% and achieving a 2.5x speedup in
end-to-end latency compared to the speculative decoding baseline, without
compromising accuracy. Our method leverages the inherent signals from hidden
states to provide effective early-exit signals, suggesting broader use of
hidden states for efficient reasoning. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有系统主要关注非协作物理任务，而协作任务需要系统推断用户对队友意图的假设，这是一个模糊且动态的过程，需要可解释和可修正的表征。

Method: 将协作任务学习框架为程序合成问题，使用可编辑程序表示行为，通过配对物理动作和自然语言的叙述演示作为统一的教授、检查和修正方式。

Result: 在20名用户参与的研究中，70%的用户成功修正学习到的程序以匹配其意图，90%的用户认为修正程序很容易。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了以程序表示学习和教授协作物理活动的独特挑战，并提出了缓解策略。

Abstract: Teaching systems physical tasks is a long standing goal in HCI, yet most
prior work has focused on non collaborative physical activities. Collaborative
tasks introduce added complexity, requiring systems to infer users assumptions
about their teammates intent, which is an inherently ambiguous and dynamic
process. This necessitates representations that are interpretable and
correctable, enabling users to inspect and refine system behavior. We address
this challenge by framing collaborative task learning as a program synthesis
problem. Our system represents behavior as editable programs and uses narrated
demonstrations, i.e. paired physical actions and natural language, as a unified
modality for teaching, inspecting, and correcting system logic without
requiring users to see or write code. The same modality is used for the system
to communicate its learning to users. In a within subjects study, 20 users
taught multiplayer soccer tactics to our system. 70 percent (14/20) of
participants successfully refined learned programs to match their intent and 90
percent (18/20) found it easy to correct the programs. The study surfaced
unique challenges in representing learning as programs and in enabling users to
teach collaborative physical activities. We discuss these issues and outline
mitigation strategies.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文指出当前LLM图推理方法存在偏差，提出将推理重点从复制图算法转向设计图算法，并构建了更具挑战性的GraphAlgorithm基准，提出了Simple-RTC方法显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM图推理方法表现不佳，主要问题在于推理重点错误地放在复制图算法而非设计图算法上，导致基础模型的能力被低估。

Method: 提出Simple-RTC方法：先引导LLM设计图算法，然后通过编码解决图推理任务；构建包含239个不同图问题和3041个测试实例的GraphAlgorithm基准。

Result: Simple-RTC在现有基准上达到接近完美的准确率，在GraphAlgorithm基准上显著优于GPT-4o-mini和所有先前方法。

Conclusion: 将推理重点转向算法设计能显著提升LLM图推理能力，Simple-RTC为未来LLM图推理研究提供了强有力的基线。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) for Graph Reasoning have been extensively
studied over the past two years, involving enabling LLMs to understand graph
structures and reason on graphs to solve various graph problems, with graph
algorithm problems being the most prevalent. Recent studies underscore the
potential of LLMs in handling graph reasoning tasks, but their performance is
underwhelming. In this work, we point out issues with existing methods and
benchmarks, and rethink the direction that LLMs for graph reasoning should
strive toward. We find that base models, e.g., GPT-4o-mini, are largely
underestimated due to improper reasoning focus. Base models with reasoning
focus redirected from replicating graph algorithms to designing them can easily
solve most graph reasoning tasks in existing benchmarks. To truly evaluate the
graph reasoning capabilities of LLMs, we construct a more challenging
GraphAlgorithm benchmark, comprising 239 different graph problems and 3,041
test instances collected from 4 competition platforms. Finally, we introduce a
simple and strong baseline Simple-Reasoning-Then-Coding (Simple-RTC)-which
guides LLMs to design graph algorithms first and then code to address graph
reasoning tasks. Simple-RTC achieves near-perfect accuracy on existing
benchmarks and significantly outperforms GPT-4o-mini and all prior methods on
the GraphAlgorithm benchmark. This strong baseline encourages further
advancements in LLMs for Graph Reasoning in the future.

TL;DR: 提出风险敏感强化学习框架RS-GRPO，解决RLVR方法在LLMs推理任务中的探索困境，提升多解性能(pass@k)同时保持单解精度(pass@1)。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR方法存在探索困境：预训练LLMs的尖锐初始策略限制了标准RL算法的探索范围，仅提升单解精度但抑制解多样性和多解性能，导致RLVR更多是蒸馏现有能力而非发现新推理策略。

Method: 采用风险敏感强化学习框架，使用风险寻求目标在平均奖励和最大奖励之间插值，提出RS-GRPO算法，通过放大从挑战性提示中学习来驱动深度探索。

Result: 在六个数学推理基准和五种不同LLMs上，RS-GRPO持续提升pass@k性能，同时保持或增强pass@1准确率。

Conclusion: RS-GRPO是简单易实现的解决方案，有效克服RLVR的探索限制，促进LLMs发现新的推理策略。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has proven effective
for enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) on complex reasoning tasks. However,
existing methods suffer from an exploration dilemma: the sharply peaked initial
policies of pre-trained LLMs confine standard RL algorithms to a narrow set of
solutions, boosting single-solution accuracy (pass@1) but suppressing solution
diversity and multi-solution performance (pass@k). As a result, RLVR often
distills existing capabilities rather than discovering new reasoning
strategies. To overcome this, we introduce a Risk-Sensitive Reinforcement
Learning framework. Our approach employs a risk-seeking objective that
interpolates between mean and maximum rewards, leading to a novel algorithm,
Risk-Sensitive GRPO (RS-GRPO), which drives deeper exploration by amplifying
learning from challenging prompts. Remarkably, RS-GRPO is simple to implement,
requiring only minor code modifications. On six mathematical reasoning
benchmarks and with five different LLMs, RS-GRPO consistently improves pass@k
performance while maintaining or enhancing pass@1 accuracy.

Motivation: 传统移动消息设计由于无法探索高维设计空间而存在显著局限性，需要开发更有效的方法来优化医疗沟通，提高患者用药依从性和健康行为。

Method: 基于DIKW层次结构构建的智能代理系统，通过专门的计算代理逐步将原始实验数据转化为可操作的消息设计策略，支持并行处理、假设验证和持续学习。

Conclusion: PAME-AI的代理架构特别适合大规模医疗沟通优化，能够实现并行处理、假设验证和持续学习，显著提升患者消息的参与效果。

Abstract: Messaging patients is a critical part of healthcare communication, helping to
improve things like medication adherence and healthy behaviors. However,
traditional mobile message design has significant limitations due to its
inability to explore the high-dimensional design space. We develop PAME-AI, a
novel approach for Patient Messaging Creation and Optimization using Agentic
AI. Built on the Data-Information-Knowledge-Wisdom (DIKW) hierarchy, PAME-AI
offers a structured framework to move from raw data to actionable insights for
high-performance messaging design. PAME-AI is composed of a system of
specialized computational agents that progressively transform raw experimental
data into actionable message design strategies. We demonstrate our approach's
effectiveness through a two-stage experiment, comprising of 444,691 patient
encounters in Stage 1 and 74,908 in Stage 2. The best-performing generated
message achieved 68.76% engagement compared to the 61.27% baseline,
representing a 12.2\% relative improvement in click-through rates. This agentic
architecture enables parallel processing, hypothesis validation, and continuous
learning, making it particularly suitable for large-scale healthcare

Motivation: 当前的安全思维链调优方法存在雪球效应失败模式，即微小的推理偏差会在思维过程中逐步放大，导致有害合规或过度拒绝，这源于模型被训练模仿完美推理脚本而没有学习自我纠正

Method: 提出AdvChain对齐范式，构建包含诱惑-纠正和犹豫-纠正样本的数据集，通过对抗性思维链调优教导模型动态自我纠正

Result: AdvChain显著增强了对抗越狱攻击和思维链劫持的鲁棒性，同时大幅减少对良性提示的过度拒绝，在不损害推理能力的情况下实现了优越的安全-效用平衡

Conclusion: 这项工作为构建更鲁棒和可靠的推理模型确立了新方向

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
complex problem-solving through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, the
multi-step nature of CoT introduces new safety challenges that extend beyond
conventional language model alignment. We identify a failure mode in current
safety CoT tuning methods: the \textit{snowball effect}, where minor reasoning
deviations progressively amplify throughout the thought process, leading to
either harmful compliance or excessive refusal. This effect stems from models
being trained to imitate perfect reasoning scripts without learning to
self-correct. To address this limitation, we propose AdvChain, an alignment
paradigm that teaches models dynamic self-correction through adversarial CoT
tuning. Our method involves constructing a dataset containing
Temptation-Correction and Hesitation-Correction samples, where models learn to
recover from harmful reasoning drifts and unnecessary cautions. Extensive
experiments show that AdvChain significantly enhances robustness against
jailbreak attacks and CoT hijacking while substantially reducing over-refusal
on benign prompts, achieving a superior safety-utility balance without
compromising reasoning capabilities. Our work establishes a new direction for
building more robust and reliable reasoning models.

Motivation: 现有检索增强生成(RAG)方法在处理知识密集型任务时面临信息碎片化和知识结构建模不足的问题，而图结构能自然建模知识关系但LLMs无法有效推理图数据。

Method: 使用QuadGraph统一异构知识源为标准图表示，构建34M参数的图基础模型(GFM)联合捕获图拓扑和文本语义，并与LLMs集成增强推理，采用混合精度训练和分布式消息传递实现扩展。

Result: 在六个基准测试中，G-reasoner持续优于最先进基线，显著提升LLM推理能力，并实现强效率和跨图泛化性能。

Conclusion: G-reasoner通过统一图-语言基础模型集成，有效解决了现有图增强RAG方法的局限性，在知识推理任务中表现出色且具有良好的可扩展性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex reasoning but remain limited by
static and incomplete parametric knowledge. Retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) mitigates this by incorporating external knowledge, yet existing RAGs
struggle with knowledge-intensive tasks due to fragmented information and weak
modeling of knowledge structure. Graphs offer a natural way to model
relationships within knowledge, but LLMs are inherently unstructured and cannot
effectively reason over graph-structured data. Recent graph-enhanced RAG
(GraphRAG) attempts to bridge this gap by constructing tailored graphs and
enabling LLMs to reason on them. However, these methods often depend on ad-hoc
graph designs, heuristic search, or costly agent pipelines, which hinder
scalability and generalization. To address these challenges, we present
G-reasoner, a unified framework that integrates graph and language foundation
models for reasoning over diverse graph-structured knowledge. Central to our
approach is QuadGraph, a standardized four-layer abstraction that unifies
heterogeneous knowledge sources into a common graph representation. Building on
this, we introduce a 34M-parameter graph foundation model (GFM) that jointly
captures graph topology and textual semantics, and is integrated with LLMs to
enhance reasoning in downstream applications. To ensure scalability and
efficiency, mixed-precision training and distributed message-passing are
implemented to scale GFM with more GPUs. Extensive experiments on six
benchmarks show that G-reasoner consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines, significantly enhances LLM reasoning, and achieves strong efficiency
and cross-graph generalization.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to scientific
reasoning, the complexity of answer formats and the diversity of equivalent
expressions make answer verification a critical yet challenging task. Existing
verification studies in scientific domains suffer from two major limitations:
(a) the absence of systematic evaluation standards and insufficient
disciplinary coverage, which hinders their comprehensive assessment; and (b)
heavy reliance on cumbersome rule design or prompt engineering, which reduces
their effectiveness in complex reasoning scenarios or limits their
cross-disciplinary generalization. To address these challenges, we propose
solutions at both the data and model levels. On the data side, we construct
SCI-VerifyBench, a cross-disciplinary benchmark covering mathematics, physics,
biology, chemistry, and general scientific QA. The benchmark is built from real
LLM responses and enhanced with domain-specific equivalence transformations
that generate challenging and realistic data. Model-based and expert
annotations ensure both quality and diversity, enabling rigorous evaluation of
verification ability. On the model side, we emphasize the importance of
reasoning for verification and introduce SCI-Verifier, a unified
reasoning-augmented verifier for scientific domains. Through post-training,
SCI-Verifier demonstrates strong logical reasoning and equivalence judgment
capabilities while maintaining concise and stable outputs. Together,
SCI-VerifyBench and SCI-Verifier provide a principled framework for scientific
verification, offering both systematic evaluation and practical pathways to
enhance the reliability and applicability of LLMs in scientific domains.

Motivation: 现有MLLM在医疗诊断中存在关键失败模式：早期证据解释的不稳定性导致幻觉，产生分支推理轨迹并最终导致全局不一致结论，需要开发能够约束随机性和幻觉的临床推理代理。

Method: MedMMV采用多代理框架，通过多样化短轨迹稳定推理，在幻觉检测器监督下将中间步骤基于结构化证据图，并使用组合不确定性评分器聚合候选路径。

Result: 在六个医疗基准测试中，MedMMV将准确率提升高达12.7%，并展现出更优越的可靠性。盲法医师评估证实MedMMV显著提高了推理真实性而不牺牲信息内容。

Conclusion: 通过可验证的多代理过程控制不稳定性，该框架为在高风险领域（如临床决策支持）部署可信赖AI系统提供了稳健路径。

Abstract: Recent progress in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has demonstrated
promising performance on medical benchmarks and in preliminary trials as
clinical assistants. Yet, our pilot audit of diagnostic cases uncovers a
critical failure mode: instability in early evidence interpretation precedes
hallucination, creating branching reasoning trajectories that cascade into
globally inconsistent conclusions. This highlights the need for clinical
reasoning agents that constrain stochasticity and hallucination while producing
auditable decision flows. We introduce MedMMV, a controllable multimodal
multi-agent framework for reliable and verifiable clinical reasoning. MedMMV
stabilizes reasoning through diversified short rollouts, grounds intermediate
steps in a structured evidence graph under the supervision of a Hallucination
Detector, and aggregates candidate paths with a Combined Uncertainty scorer. On
six medical benchmarks, MedMMV improves accuracy by up to 12.7% and, more
critically, demonstrates superior reliability. Blind physician evaluations
confirm that MedMMV substantially increases reasoning truthfulness without
sacrificing informational content. By controlling instability through a
verifiable, multi-agent process, our framework provides a robust path toward
deploying trustworthy AI systems in high-stakes domains like clinical decision
support.

TL;DR: 提出了Fin-Solution 2.O解决方案，包含Fin-Vault多轮金融对话数据集和Fin-Ally统一模型，通过常识推理和DPO优化生成专业金融建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FinTech行业快速发展，但LLMs在金融领域微调时可能产生不专业的回答，且缺乏领域特定数据集，现有研究只关注孤立组件。

Method: 1) 构建Fin-Vault数据集（1,417个标注多轮对话）；2) 开发Fin-Ally模型，集成COMET-BART常识推理、礼貌性和人机对话动态，使用DPO机制优化。

Result: 实验结果表明，融入常识上下文能使语言模型生成更精细、文本精确且专业基础更强的金融指导。

Conclusion: 该方法为FinTech行业提供了下一代AI解决方案，能生成更专业和可信的金融建议。

Abstract: The exponential technological breakthrough of the FinTech industry has
significantly enhanced user engagement through sophisticated advisory chatbots.
However, large-scale fine-tuning of LLMs can occasionally yield unprofessional
or flippant remarks, such as ``With that money, you're going to change the
world,'' which, though factually correct, can be contextually inappropriate and
erode user trust. The scarcity of domain-specific datasets has led previous
studies to focus on isolated components, such as reasoning-aware frameworks or
the enhancement of human-like response generation. To address this research
gap, we present Fin-Solution 2.O, an advanced solution that 1) introduces the
multi-turn financial conversational dataset, Fin-Vault, and 2) incorporates a
unified model, Fin-Ally, which integrates commonsense reasoning, politeness,
and human-like conversational dynamics. Fin-Ally is powered by
COMET-BART-embedded commonsense context and optimized with a Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO) mechanism to generate human-aligned responses. The novel
Fin-Vault dataset, consisting of 1,417 annotated multi-turn dialogues, enables
Fin-Ally to extend beyond basic account management to provide personalized
budgeting, real-time expense tracking, and automated financial planning. Our
comprehensive results demonstrate that incorporating commonsense context
enables language models to generate more refined, textually precise, and
professionally grounded financial guidance, positioning this approach as a
next-generation AI solution for the FinTech sector. Dataset and codes are

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出自适应蒙特卡洛搜索(AMCS)框架，通过动态节点值估计和路径扩展来改进过程奖励模型(PRM)的数据生成效率，构建了20万规模的数据集并在数学推理任务上取得显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法使用固定预算采样策略估计推理步骤质量，在自动数据生成过程中需要遍历巨大搜索空间进行路径扩展，导致效率低下且缺乏灵活性。

Method: AMCS框架在节点值估计和路径扩展层面实现自适应动态搜索：1) 自适应细化估计，为不确定推理步骤分配更多样本；2) 使用时间自适应策略的蒙特卡洛算法增强路径扩展，从广泛探索逐步转向最有希望的方向。

Result: 构建了20万规模的数据集MathSearch-200K，在四个数学推理基准测试中，Qwen2.5-Math-7B-PRM-AMCS在MATH500上达到76.2%准确率，优于所有基线PRM。7B模型在AMCS监督下性能超过72B模型，且在分布外问题上保持优势。

Conclusion: AMCS通过自适应搜索策略显著提升了过程奖励模型的数据生成效率和性能，展示了强大的泛化能力，为复杂数学推理任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The quality of process data plays a key role in training a Process Reward
Model (PRM), which can enhance the complex mathematical reasoning capability of
large language models. Existing methods estimate the quality of reasoning steps
based on a fixed-budget sampling strategy and navigate a vast search space to
perform path expansion during the automated data generation process, resulting
in their inefficiency and inflexibility. To address these issues, we propose
Adaptive Monte Carlo Search (AMCS), a framework that transforms data generation
from fixed, static to adaptive, dynamic search at the level of node value
estimation and path expansion. On one hand, AMCS adaptively refines estimation
by allocating more samples to uncertain reasoning steps while using fewer
samples for those that are easier to estimate. On the other hand, it enhances
the path expansion through a Monte Carlo algorithm with a temporally adaptive
policy that begins with broad exploration and gradually shifts toward
exploiting the most promising directions. With AMCS, we construct a large-scale
dataset MathSearch-200K of about 200K process supervision examples for training
PRMs. To verify the effectiveness of our method, we conduct extensive
experiments on four mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Experimental results
show that Qwen2.5-Math-7B-PRM-AMCS achieves up to 76.2% accuracy on MATH500
with GLM-4-9B, outperforming all baseline PRMs. Notably, a 7B model supervised
by Qwen2.5-Math-7B-PRM-AMCS surpasses a 72B model with weaker supervision.
Moreover, Qwen2.5-Math-7B-PRM-AMCS maintains consistent advantages on
out-of-distribution problems, demonstrating strong generalization capability.

TL;DR: PRISM框架将数学推理分为策略规划和目标执行两阶段，通过轻量级策略适配器动态选择最佳推理策略，在多个数学推理基准上优于单一策略和集成方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法使用固定策略进行数学推理，无法适应问题特定需求，忽视了效果与效率之间的权衡。

Method: 提出PRISM框架：1）构建多策略偏好数据集MathStrat；2）训练策略适配器获得四种推理策略的置信度分布；3）推理时根据置信度动态选择单策略执行、双策略验证或多策略探索。

Result: 在五个数学推理基准上的实验表明，PRISM比单一策略和集成基线表现更好，在不同基础模型上提升0.9%到7.6%。

Conclusion: 自适应路由方法对数学推理任务特别有效，能根据问题特点动态选择最佳推理策略。

Abstract: Existing methods usually leverage a fixed strategy, such as natural language
reasoning, code-augmented reasoning, tool-integrated reasoning, or
ensemble-based reasoning, to guide Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform
mathematical reasoning. Our analysis reveals that the single strategy cannot
adapt to problem-specific requirements and thus overlooks the trade-off between
effectiveness and efficiency. To address these issues, we propose Planning and
Routing through Instance-Specific Modeling (PRISM), a novel framework that
decouples mathematical reasoning into two stages: strategy planning and
targeted execution. Specifically, we first curate a multi-strategy preference
dataset, which we call MathStrat, capturing correctness, process quality, and
computational efficiency for each problem--strategy pair. Then, we train a
lightweight Strategy Adapter based on the dataset to obtain confidence
distributions over the mentioned four reasoning strategies. At inference time,
an adaptive routing policy dynamically tailors the reasoning approach based on
predictor confidence. It directs the model to use single-strategy execution for
high-confidence predictions, dual-strategy verification for competitive
scenarios, or comprehensive multi-strategy exploration for uncertain cases.
Extensive experiments across five mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate
that PRISM consistently outperforms individual strategies and ensemble
baselines, achieving improvements ranging from 0.9% to 7.6% across different
base models. The adaptive routing approach shows particularly strong benefits
for mathematical reasoning tasks across diverse model architectures. Our code
is released at https://github.com/reml-group/PRISM.

TL;DR: 论文提出Intervened Preference Optimization (IPO)方法，通过干预推理过程来增强大型推理模型的安全性，将合规步骤替换为安全触发器，并构建偏好学习对来减少有害推理内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型推理模型的思维链推理中常包含有害内容，即使最终回答看似安全，这种不安全推理仍可能被恶意用户利用，因此需要专门对齐推理过程的安全性。

Method: 提出IPO方法，基于对安全推理特性的洞察：安全推理由关键安全触发步骤巩固、合规线索与不安全延续强相关、纠正干预能可靠引导不安全轨迹转向安全。通过替换合规步骤为安全触发器，构建强信号偏好学习对。

Result: 在越狱和对抗安全基准测试中，IPO显著提升了推理和回答的整体安全性，有害性相对降低超过30%，同时在不同推理任务上保持优秀性能。

Conclusion: 研究强调了推理过程显式对齐的重要性，为构建更安全的大型推理模型提供了实用路径。

Abstract: Although Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have progressed in solving complex
problems, their chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning often contains harmful content
that can persist even when the final responses appear safe. We show that this
issue still remains in existing methods which overlook the unique significance
of safe reasoning, undermining their trustworthiness and posing potential risks
in applications if unsafe reasoning is accessible for and exploited by
malicious users. We therefore shift our focus to aligning the safety of
reasoning itself in this paper and explore process supervision as the solution.
However, simply rewarding safe reasoning proves inadequate due to low rollout
diversity and limited training signals. To tackle this challenge, we first
delve into the characteristics of safe reasoning and uncover several critical
insights that 1) safe reasoning is often consolidated by a few critical steps
of safety triggers; 2) compliance cues strongly correlate with unsafe
continuations; and 3) corrective interventions reliably steer unsafe
trajectories towards safer traces. Motivated by these, we propose Intervened
Preference Optimization (IPO), an alignment method that enforces safe reasoning
by substituting compliance steps with safety triggers and constructing pairs
for preference learning with strong signals. Experiments on jailbreak and
adversarial safety benchmarks demonstrate that IPO remarkably improves overall
safety regarding both reasoning and responses, outperforming SFT-based and
RL-based baselines with a relative reduction of over 30% in harmfulness, while
preserving excellent performance across diverse reasoning tasks. The results
highlight the importance of explicit alignment for reasoning and provide a
practical path to safer LRMs.

Abstract: With the increasing complexity of industrial systems, there is a pressing
need for predictive maintenance to avoid costly downtime and disastrous
outcomes that could be life-threatening in certain domains. With the growing
popularity of the Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence, machine
learning, and real-time big data analytics, there is a unique opportunity for
efficient predictive maintenance to forecast equipment failures for real-time
intervention and optimize maintenance actions, as traditional reactive and
preventive maintenance practices are often inadequate to meet the requirements
for the industry to provide quality-of-services of operations. Central to this
evolution is digital twin technology, an adaptive virtual replica that
continuously monitors and integrates sensor data to simulate and improve asset
performance. Despite remarkable progress in digital twin implementations, such
as considering DT in predictive maintenance for industrial engineering. This
paper aims to address this void. We perform a retrospective analysis of the
temporal evolution of the digital twin in predictive maintenance for industrial
engineering to capture the applications, middleware, and technological
requirements that led to the development of the digital twin from its inception
to the AI-enabled digital twin and its self-learning models. We provide a
layered architecture of the digital twin technology, as well as a taxonomy of
the technology-enabled industrial engineering applications systems, middleware,
and the used Artificial Intelligence algorithms. We provide insights into these
systems for the realization of a trustworthy and efficient smart digital-twin
industrial engineering ecosystem. We discuss future research directions in
digital twin for predictive maintenance in industrial engineering.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有过程奖励模型在数学领域表现优异，但由于领域特定训练数据稀缺和基于知识的学习模式，在其他领域的泛化能力有限。

Method: 将学习目标从验证领域特定知识转向建模领域无关的逻辑流，关注思维链步骤间的上下文连贯性，通过新的数据标注和训练框架实现。

Result: ContextPRM在MMLU-Pro的9个非数学领域（法律、历史、哲学等）通过加权多数投票实现6.5%平均准确率提升，显著优于VersaPRM的2.2%和其他数学导向PRM的0.5%提升。

Conclusion: 通过建模逻辑流而非领域知识，ContextPRM在数学和非数学领域都表现出色，证明了该方法在提升过程奖励模型跨领域泛化能力方面的有效性。

Abstract: Process reward models (PRMs) have demonstrated significant efficacy in
enhancing the mathematical reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) by leveraging test-time scaling (TTS). However, while most PRMs exhibit
substantial gains in mathematical domains, the scarcity of domain-specific
training data and knowledge-based learning patterns limits their generalization
ability when faced with other domains. To address this limitation, we shift the
learning objective from verifying domain-specific knowledge to modeling
domain-agnostic logical flow. Centering on contextual coherence between
chain-of-thought (CoT) steps, our approach is realized through a novel data
annotation and training framework, which enhances the model's generalization
capabilities across diverse domains. For instance, our resulting model,
ContextPRM, achieves a notable 6.5% average accuracy improvement over the
majority voting baseline via weighted majority voting across nine
non-mathematical domains in MMLU-Pro, including law, history, and philosophy,
significantly surpassing the 2.2% improvement from VersaPRM and 0.5% gains from
other mathematics-focused PRMs, demonstrating consistent performance across
both mathematical and non-mathematical domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 约束编程中的手动建模是主要瓶颈，约束获取旨在自动化这一过程。但被动方法容易过拟合，而纯主动方法查询密集，需要一种平衡方案来解决过拟合问题。

Method: 集成被动学习生成候选约束，查询驱动的交互式精炼阶段使用概率置信度评分识别过拟合约束，专用子集探索机制从被拒绝候选中恢复有效子结构，最后主动学习确保模型完整性。

Result: 在多样化基准测试中，交互式精炼阶段对于从有限示例中实现高目标模型覆盖率和整体模型准确性至关重要，且查询复杂度可控。

Conclusion: 该框架在数据有限场景下实现了稳健实用的约束获取，是约束获取领域的重大进展。

Abstract: Manual modeling in Constraint Programming is a substantial bottleneck, which
Constraint Acquisition (CA) aims to automate. However, passive CA methods are
prone to over-fitting, often learning models that include spurious global
constraints when trained on limited data, while purely active methods can be
query-intensive. We introduce a hybrid CA framework specifically designed to
address the challenge of over-fitting in CA. Our approach integrates passive
learning for initial candidate generation, a query-driven interactive
refinement phase that utilizes probabilistic confidence scores (initialized by
machine learning priors) to systematically identify over-fitted constraints,
and a specialized subset exploration mechanism to recover valid substructures
from rejected candidates. A final active learning phase ensures model
completeness. Extensive experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our
interactive refinement phase is crucial for achieving high target model
coverage and overall model accuracy from limited examples, doing so with
manageable query complexity. This framework represents a substantial
advancement towards robust and practical constraint acquisition in data-limited
scenarios.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to Dynamic Artificial Neural Networks
(D-ANNs) for multi-task demand forecasting called Neuroplastic Multi-Task
Network (NMT-Net). Unlike conventional methods focusing on inference-time
dynamics or computational efficiency, our proposed method enables structural
adaptability of the computational graph during training, inspired by
neuroplasticity as seen in biological systems. Each new task triggers a dynamic
network adaptation, including similarity-based task identification and
selective training of candidate ANN heads, which are then assessed and
integrated into the model based on their performance. We evaluated our
framework using three real-world multi-task demand forecasting datasets from
Kaggle. We demonstrated its superior performance and consistency, achieving
lower RMSE and standard deviation compared to traditional baselines and
state-of-the-art multi-task learning methods. NMT-Net offers a scalable,
adaptable solution for multi-task and continual learning in time series
prediction. The complete code for NMT-Net is available from our GitHub

Result: 在旅行商问题和装箱问题上，EvoPH实现了相对于最优解的最低相对误差。

Conclusion: EvoPH推进了基于LLM的自动算法设计领域，通过协同进化框架有效避免了局部最优问题。

Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problems are traditionally tackled with
handcrafted heuristic algorithms, which demand extensive domain expertise and
significant implementation effort. Recent progress has highlighted the
potential of automatic heuristics design powered by large language models
(LLMs), enabling the automatic generation and refinement of heuristics. These
approaches typically maintain a population of heuristics and employ LLMs as
mutation operators to evolve them across generations. While effective, such
methods often risk stagnating in local optima. To address this issue, we
propose the Experience-Guided Reflective Co-Evolution of Prompt and Heuristics
(EvoPH) for automatic algorithm design, a novel framework that integrates the
island migration model with the elites selection algorithm to simulate diverse
heuristics populations. In EvoPH, prompts are co-evolved with heuristic
algorithms, guided by performance feedback. We evaluate our framework on two
problems, i.e., Traveling Salesman Problem and Bin Packing Problem.
Experimental results demonstrate that EvoPH achieves the lowest relative error
against optimal solutions across both datasets, advancing the field of
automatic algorithm design with LLMs.

Abstract: World models learn general knowledge from videos and simulate experience for
training behaviors in imagination, offering a path towards intelligent agents.
However, previous world models have been unable to accurately predict object
interactions in complex environments. We introduce Dreamer 4, a scalable agent
that learns to solve control tasks by reinforcement learning inside of a fast
and accurate world model. In the complex video game Minecraft, the world model
accurately predicts object interactions and game mechanics, outperforming
previous world models by a large margin. The world model achieves real-time
interactive inference on a single GPU through a shortcut forcing objective and
an efficient transformer architecture. Moreover, the world model learns general
action conditioning from only a small amount of data, allowing it to extract
the majority of its knowledge from diverse unlabeled videos. We propose the
challenge of obtaining diamonds in Minecraft from only offline data, aligning
with practical applications such as robotics where learning from environment
interaction can be unsafe and slow. This task requires choosing sequences of
over 20,000 mouse and keyboard actions from raw pixels. By learning behaviors
in imagination, Dreamer 4 is the first agent to obtain diamonds in Minecraft
purely from offline data, without environment interaction. Our work provides a
scalable recipe for imagination training, marking a step towards intelligent
agents.

Abstract: Humans quickly learn new concepts from a small number of examples.
Replicating this capacity with Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems has proven
to be challenging. When it comes to learning subjective tasks-where there is an
evident scarcity of data-this capacity needs to be recreated. In this work, we
propose an intuitive human-agent teaching architecture in which the human can
teach an agent how to perform a task by providing demonstrations, i.e.,
examples. To have an intuitive interaction, we argue that the agent should be
able to learn incrementally from a few single examples. To allow for this, our
objective is to broaden the agent's task understanding using domain knowledge.
Then, using a learning method to enable the agent to learn efficiently from a
limited number of examples. Finally, to optimize how human can select the most
representative and less redundant examples to provide the agent with. We apply
our proposed method to the subjective task of ingredient substitution, where
the agent needs to learn how to substitute ingredients in recipes based on
human examples. We replicate human input using the Recipe1MSubs dataset. In our
experiments, the agent achieves half its task performance after only 100
examples are provided, compared to the complete training set of 50k examples.
We show that by providing examples in strategic order along with a learning
method that leverages external symbolic knowledge, the agent can generalize
more efficiently.

TL;DR: 本文研究了通信评估中"成功协调等于相互理解"的假设，发现在某些情况下，智能体虽然能成功协调，但对信号的理解并不一致，形成了"成功的误解"。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在缺乏共同观察的通信环境中，协调成功是否真的意味着相互理解，特别是在人类与人工智能体混合的异构群体中。

Method: 使用信号博弈模型，让智能体在只有通信信号和互动结果的情况下发展新的词汇信号，观察他们如何协调和解释信号。

Result: 群体总能达到最优协调水平，但有时会形成"成功的误解"——智能体对信号有不同解释但能成功协调。只有至少三个智能体相互互动时，才能确保共享解释的出现。

Conclusion: 协调成功不一定意味着相互理解，"成功的误解"难以发现和修复。至少三个智能体的完全互动是确保共享解释出现的最小条件。

Abstract: The main approach to evaluating communication is by assessing how well it
facilitates coordination. If two or more individuals can coordinate through
communication, it is generally assumed that they understand one another. We
investigate this assumption in a signaling game where individuals develop a new
vocabulary of signals to coordinate successfully. In our game, the individuals
do not have common observations besides the communication signal and outcome of
the interaction, i.e. received reward. This setting is used as a proxy to study
communication emergence in populations of agents that perceive their
environment very differently, e.g. hybrid populations that include humans and
artificial agents. Agents develop signals, use them, and refine interpretations
while not observing how other agents are using them. While populations always
converge to optimal levels of coordination, in some cases, interacting agents
interpret and use signals differently, converging to what we call successful
misunderstandings. However, agents of population that coordinate using
misaligned interpretations, are unable to establish successful coordination
with new interaction partners. Not leading to coordination failure immediately,
successful misunderstandings are difficult to spot and repair. Having at least
three agents that all interact with each other are the two minimum conditions
to ensure the emergence of shared interpretations. Under these conditions, the
agent population exhibits this emergent property of compensating for the lack
of shared observations of signal use, ensuring the emergence of shared
interpretations.

TL;DR: 本文研究发现大型推理模型具有能力边界自我意识，通过监控推理表达置信度和隐藏状态，可以避免对超出能力范围的问题进行无效推理，显著提升效率和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型推理模型在面对超出其能力范围的难题时，会持续进行无效推理直至上下文限制，既浪费计算资源又产生错误答案。这反映了现有回答范式忽视了问题与模型能力边界的关系。

Method: 1) 对黑盒模型：分析推理表达中的置信度轨迹，可解问题呈现加速增长模式，不可解问题呈现收敛不确定性模式；2) 对白盒模型：分析最后一个输入token的隐藏状态，发现可解与不可解问题在推理开始前即可线性分离；3) 提出推理表达监控和隐藏状态监控两种边界感知优化策略。

Result: 实验表明，边界感知策略使大型推理模型能够避免无效推理而不牺牲准确性，显著提高了可靠性和效率，token使用量减少了62.7%至93.6%。

Conclusion: 大型推理模型确实具有能力边界自我意识，通过简单有效的边界监控策略可以显著改善模型在复杂推理任务中的表现，为构建更可靠高效的大型推理系统提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have shown impressive performance on complex
reasoning tasks such as mathematics, yet they also display misbehaviors that
expose their limitations. In particular, when faced with hard questions, LRMs
often engage in unproductive reasoning until context limit, producing wrong
answers while wasting substantial computation. This phenomenon reflects a
fundamental issue: current answering paradigms overlook the relationship
between questions and LRMs' capability boundaries. In this paper, we
investigate whether LRMs possess self-awareness of capability boundaries. We
begin by an observation that LRMs may know what they cannot solve through
expressed reasoning confidence. For black-box models, we find that reasoning
expressions reveal boundary signals, with accelerated growing confidence
trajectory for solvable problems but convergent uncertainty trajectory for
unsolvable ones. For white-box models, we show that hidden states of the last
input token encode boundary information, with solvable and unsolvable problems
linearly separable even before reasoning begins. Building on these findings, we
propose two simple yet effective optimization strategies: reasoning expression
monitoring and hidden states monitoring. Experiments demonstrate that these
boundary-aware strategies enable LRMs to avoid unproductive reasoning without
sacrificing accuracy, significantly improving reliability and efficiency by
cutting token usage up to 62.7 - 93.6%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG信号具有高维、噪声大和非欧几里得特性，使得从EEG解码视觉神经表征面临巨大挑战。现有方法难以有效处理这些复杂特性。

Method: 提出EEG图变换器(EGT)同时编码空间大脑连接性和时间神经动态；引入图原型对比学习(GAC)学习特定主题的EEG图原型，以改善特征一致性和类别可分性。

Result: 在Things-EEG数据集上进行了主题依赖和主题独立评估，结果显示该方法显著优于先前最先进的EEG解码方法。

Conclusion: 将图基学习与对比目标相结合具有变革性潜力，能够增强基于EEG的大脑解码，为更通用和鲁棒的神经表征铺平道路。

Abstract: Decoding visual neural representations from Electroencephalography (EEG)
signals remains a formidable challenge due to their high-dimensional, noisy,
and non-Euclidean nature. In this work, we propose a Spatial-Functional
Awareness Transformer-based Graph Archetype Contrastive Learning (SFTG)
framework to enhance EEG-based visual decoding. Specifically, we introduce the
EEG Graph Transformer (EGT), a novel graph-based neural architecture that
simultaneously encodes spatial brain connectivity and temporal neural dynamics.
To mitigate high intra-subject variability, we propose Graph Archetype
Contrastive Learning (GAC), which learns subject-specific EEG graph archetypes
to improve feature consistency and class separability. Furthermore, we conduct
comprehensive subject-dependent and subject-independent evaluations on the
Things-EEG dataset, demonstrating that our approach significantly outperforms
prior state-of-the-art EEG decoding methods.The results underscore the
transformative potential of integrating graph-based learning with contrastive
objectives to enhance EEG-based brain decoding, paving the way for more
generalizable and robust neural representations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究忽视了逻辑复杂性和语义复杂性的相互作用，难以处理涉及抽象命题、模糊语境和矛盾立场等人类推理核心挑战的场景。

Method: LogicAgent框架在FOL中显式执行多视角演绎，通过包含三值决策方案的存在导入检查来缓解空洞推理，更忠实地处理边界情况。

Result: 在RepublicQA上实现6.25%的平均性能提升，在ProntoQA、ProofWriter、FOLIO和ProverQA等主流基准上额外获得7.05%的平均增益。

Conclusion: 基于符号学的多视角推理在提升LLMs逻辑性能方面具有强效性，LogicAgent能够有效处理复杂逻辑推理场景。

Abstract: Logical reasoning is a fundamental capability of large language models
(LLMs). However, existing studies largely overlook the interplay between
logical complexity and semantic complexity, resulting in methods that struggle
to address challenging scenarios involving abstract propositions, ambiguous
contexts, and conflicting stances, which are central to human reasoning. For
this gap, we propose LogicAgent, a semiotic-square-guided framework designed to
jointly address logical complexity and semantic complexity. LogicAgent
explicitly performs multi-perspective deduction in first-order logic (FOL),
while mitigating vacuous reasoning through existential import checks that
incorporate a three-valued decision scheme (True, False, Uncertain) to handle
boundary cases more faithfully. Furthermore, to overcome the semantic
simplicity and low logical complexity of existing datasets, we introduce
RepublicQA, a benchmark that reaches college-level difficulty (FKGL = 11.94)
and exhibits substantially greater lexical and structural diversity than prior
benchmarks. RepublicQA is grounded in philosophical concepts, featuring
abstract propositions and systematically organized contrary and contradictory
relations, making it the most semantically rich resource for evaluating logical
reasoning. Experiments demonstrate that LogicAgent achieves state-of-the-art
performance on RepublicQA, with a 6.25% average gain over strong baselines, and
generalizes effectively to mainstream logical reasoning benchmarks including
ProntoQA, ProofWriter, FOLIO, and ProverQA, achieving an additional 7.05%
average gain. These results highlight the strong effectiveness of our
semiotic-grounded multi-perspective reasoning in boosting LLMs' logical
performance.

TL;DR: 提出了TSR-Suite时间序列推理套件，包含四个原子任务，涵盖感知、外推和决策三种基本推理能力。基于此开发了首个统一推理模型TimeOmni-1，在因果发现和事件感知预测等任务上显著优于GPT-4.1。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态时间序列数据集停留在表面对齐和问答层面，缺乏真正需要推理的任务和高质量数据，限制了时间序列推理模型的开发。

Method: 构建TSR-Suite套件，包含23K+样本，其中2.3K经过人工分层标注。开发TimeOmni-1模型，采用多阶段训练，整合任务场景、奖励函数和优化策略。

Result: TimeOmni-1在所有任务上表现出强大的分布外泛化能力，因果发现准确率提升至64.0%（GPT-4.1为35.9%），事件感知预测任务的有效响应率比GPT-4.1提高6%以上。

Conclusion: TSR-Suite为时间序列推理提供了首个全面评估套件，TimeOmni-1模型在多种推理任务上表现出色，推动了时间序列推理领域的发展。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal time series learning underscore a paradigm
shift from analytics centered on basic patterns toward advanced time series
understanding and reasoning. However, existing multimodal time series datasets
mostly remain at the level of surface alignment and question answering, without
reaching the depth of genuine reasoning. The absence of well-defined tasks that
genuinely require time series reasoning, along with the scarcity of
high-quality data, has limited progress in building practical time series
reasoning models (TSRMs). To this end, we introduce Time Series Reasoning Suite
(TSR-Suite), which formalizes four atomic tasks that span three fundamental
capabilities for reasoning with time series: (1) perception, acquired through
scenario understanding and causality discovery; (2) extrapolation, realized via
event-aware forecasting; and (3) decision-making, developed through
deliberation over perception and extrapolation. TSR-Suite is the first
comprehensive time series reasoning suite that supports not only thorough
evaluation but also the data pipeline and training of TSRMs. It contains more
than 23K samples, of which 2.3K are carefully curated through a human-guided
hierarchical annotation process. Building on this foundation, we introduce
TimeOmni-1, the first unified reasoning model designed to address diverse
real-world problems demanding time series reasoning. The model is trained in
multiple stages, integrating a mixture of task scenarios, novel reward
functions, and tailored optimizations. Experiments show that TimeOmni-1
delivers strong out-of-distribution generalization across all tasks and
achieves a high rate of valid responses. It significantly improves causality
discovery accuracy (64.0% vs. 35.9% with GPT-4.1) and raises the valid response
rate by over 6% compared to GPT-4.1 on the event-aware forecasting task.

TL;DR: 提出了查询电路（query circuits）方法，直接追踪语言模型中特定输入到输出的信息流，提供更忠实和计算可访问的局部解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要揭示全局能力电路，但无法解释模型为何对特定输入查询产生特定输出，需要更精确的局部解释方法。

Method: 引入归一化偏差忠实度（NDF）评估指标，开发基于采样的方法来高效识别稀疏但忠实的电路，在模型内部直接识别信息流路径。

Result: 在多个基准测试（IOI、算术、MMLU、ARC）中发现存在极稀疏的查询电路，仅覆盖1.3%模型连接即可恢复约60%的MMLU问题性能。

Conclusion: 查询电路为忠实、可扩展地解释语言模型如何处理单个输入提供了重要进展。

Abstract: Explaining why a language model produces a particular output requires local,
input-level explanations. Existing methods uncover global capability circuits
(e.g., indirect object identification), but not why the model answers a
specific input query in a particular way. We introduce query circuits, which
directly trace the information flow inside a model that maps a specific input
to the output. Unlike surrogate-based approaches (e.g., sparse autoencoders),
query circuits are identified within the model itself, resulting in more
faithful and computationally accessible explanations. To make query circuits
practical, we address two challenges. First, we introduce Normalized Deviation
Faithfulness (NDF), a robust metric to evaluate how well a discovered circuit
recovers the model's decision for a specific input, and is broadly applicable
to circuit discovery beyond our setting. Second, we develop sampling-based
methods to efficiently identify circuits that are sparse yet faithfully
describe the model's behavior. Across benchmarks (IOI, arithmetic, MMLU, and
ARC), we find that there exist extremely sparse query circuits within the model
that can recover much of its performance on single queries. For example, a
circuit covering only 1.3% of model connections can recover about 60% of
performance on an MMLU questions. Overall, query circuits provide a step
towards faithful, scalable explanations of how language models process
individual inputs.

<details>

Motivation: 现有方法主要关注数据格式转换，而忽略了训练样本内部的推理复杂度，导致数据的推理潜力未被充分挖掘和利用。

Method: 引入数据推理强度(DRI)指标量化样本的潜在逻辑推理复杂度，通过分解和聚合逻辑结构；提出重新认知优化策略，系统性地增强训练数据的逻辑推理强度。

Result: 实验表明该方法显著优于以数据为中心的策略，在强化学习框架下也验证了有效性。

Conclusion: 优先考虑数据中的推理复杂度而非单纯的数据规模或表面形式，对于实现大语言模型的全部认知潜力至关重要。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) highlight the importance of
training data structure and quality in shaping reasoning behavior. However,
most existing approaches focus on transforming data formats while neglecting
the internal reasoning complexity of training samples, leaving the reasoning
potential of data under-explored and underutilized. In this work, we posit that
LLM logical reasoning performance is jointly constrained by the potential of
the training data and the cognitive capacity of the model. To make this
relationship measurable, we introduce Data Reasoning Intensity (DRI), a novel
metric that quantifies the latent logical reasoning complexity of samples by
decomposing and aggregating their logical structures. This allows us to analyze
how well current LLMs utilize logical reasoning signals and identify
performance gaps relative to data potential. Based on this insight, we
introduce a re-cognizing optimization strategy that systematically enhances the
logical reasoning intensity of training data.Rather than increasing data
volume, our method re-optimizes existing samples to better align with the LLM's
logical reasoning boundary. Extensive experiments show that our approach
significantly improves performance and generalization over data-centric
strategies. We further validate our method under a reinforcement learning
framework. Our results indicate that prioritizing reasoning complexity in data
rather than sheer scale or superficial form is essential to realizing LLMs'
full cognitive potential.

Motivation: 物理奥林匹克竞赛作为物理智能的严格测试平台，在AI研究中尚未充分探索。现有方法多为单模型，开源MLLM很少能达到金牌水平。

Method: 采用协同进化多智能体架构，包含视觉工作室（解读图表）、逻辑工作室（制定解决方案）和评审工作室（双阶段验证），通过迭代精炼循环实现自我纠正。

Result: 在7个最新物理奥林匹克竞赛的HiPhO基准测试中：1）强泛化能力：持续改进开源和闭源模型；2）历史性突破：开源模型金牌数从1-2枚增至6枚；3）达到专家水平：在最新IPhO中排名第4（406名参赛者）。

Conclusion: PhysicsMinions为奥林匹克级别问题解决提供了可推广的框架，具有跨学科扩展的潜力。

Abstract: Physics is central to understanding and shaping the real world, and the
ability to solve physics problems is a key indicator of real-world physical
intelligence. Physics Olympiads, renowned as the crown of competitive physics,
provide a rigorous testbed requiring complex reasoning and deep multimodal
understanding, yet they remain largely underexplored in AI research. Existing
approaches are predominantly single-model based, and open-source MLLMs rarely
reach gold-medal-level performance. To address this gap, we propose
PhysicsMinions, a coevolutionary multi-agent system for Physics Olympiad. Its
architecture features three synergistic studios: a Visual Studio to interpret
diagrams, a Logic Studio to formulate solutions, and a Review Studio to perform
dual-stage verification. The system coevolves through an iterative refinement
loop where feedback from the Review Studio continuously guides the Logic
Studio, enabling the system to self-correct and converge towards the ground
truth. Evaluated on the HiPhO benchmark spanning 7 latest physics Olympiads,
PhysicsMinions delivers three major breakthroughs: (i) Strong generalization:
it consistently improves both open-source and closed-source models of different
sizes, delivering clear benefits over their single-model baselines; (ii)
Historic breakthroughs: it elevates open-source models from only 1-2 to 6 gold
medals across 7 Olympiads, achieving the first-ever open-source gold medal in
the latest International Physics Olympiad (IPhO) under the average-score
metric; and (iii) Scaling to human expert: it further advances the open-source
Pass@32 score to 26.8/30 points on the latest IPhO, ranking 4th of 406
contestants and far surpassing the top single-model score of 22.7 (ranked
22nd). Generally, PhysicsMinions offers a generalizable framework for
Olympiad-level problem solving, with the potential to extend across
disciplines.

Abstract: The social science of large language models (LLMs) examines how these systems
evoke mind attributions, interact with one another, and transform human
activity and institutions. We conducted a systematic review of 270 studies,
combining text embeddings, unsupervised clustering and topic modeling to build
a computational taxonomy. Three domains emerge organically across the reviewed
literature. LLM as Social Minds examines whether and when models display
behaviors that elicit attributions of cognition, morality and bias, while
addressing challenges such as test leakage and surface cues. LLM Societies
examines multi-agent settings where interaction protocols, architectures and
mechanism design shape coordination, norms, institutions and collective
epistemic processes. LLM-Human Interactions examines how LLMs reshape tasks,
learning, trust, work and governance, and how risks arise at the human-AI
interface. This taxonomy provides a reproducible map of a fragmented field,
clarifies evidentiary standards across levels of analysis, and highlights
opportunities for cumulative progress in the social science of artificial

Result: 对12个领先统一模型和6个专业基线的评估表明，当前统一模型难以实现有效协同，架构统一本身不足以保证能力协同。

Conclusion: 需要新的训练策略和归纳偏置来充分释放统一建模的潜力。

Abstract: The integration of visual understanding and generation into unified
multimodal models represents a significant stride toward general-purpose AI.
However, a fundamental question remains unanswered by existing benchmarks: does
this architectural unification actually enable synergetic interaction between
the constituent capabilities? Existing evaluation paradigms, which primarily
assess understanding and generation in isolation, are insufficient for
determining whether a unified model can leverage its understanding to enhance
its generation, or use generative simulation to facilitate deeper
comprehension. To address this critical gap, we introduce RealUnify, a
benchmark specifically designed to evaluate bidirectional capability synergy.
RealUnify comprises 1,000 meticulously human-annotated instances spanning 10
categories and 32 subtasks. It is structured around two core axes: 1)
Understanding Enhances Generation, which requires reasoning (e.g., commonsense,
logic) to guide image generation, and 2) Generation Enhances Understanding,
which necessitates mental simulation or reconstruction (e.g., of transformed or
disordered visual inputs) to solve reasoning tasks. A key contribution is our
dual-evaluation protocol, which combines direct end-to-end assessment with a
diagnostic stepwise evaluation that decomposes tasks into distinct
understanding and generation phases. This protocol allows us to precisely
discern whether performance bottlenecks stem from deficiencies in core
abilities or from a failure to integrate them. Through large-scale evaluations
of 12 leading unified models and 6 specialized baselines, we find that current
unified models still struggle to achieve effective synergy, indicating that
architectural unification alone is insufficient. These results highlight the
need for new training strategies and inductive biases to fully unlock the
potential of unified modeling.

Method: 使用SQuID方法处理大语言模型嵌入，比较多种嵌入模型在多个评估指标上的表现，通过多维标度分析验证因子一致性。

Result: 嵌入方法解释了人类数据中维度相似性的55%方差，与人类数据有良好的因子一致性系数，且遵循基础理论。

Conclusion: 语义嵌入能有效复制心理测量结构，在成本、可扩展性和灵活性方面具有显著优势，为心理测量学和社会科学研究提供了补充方法。

Abstract: This study introduces "Survey and Questionnaire Item Embeddings
Differentials" (SQuID), a novel methodological approach that enables neural
network embeddings to effectively recover latent dimensions from psychometric
survey items. We demonstrate that embeddings derived from large language
models, when processed with SQuID, can recover the structure of human values
obtained from human rater judgments on the Revised Portrait Value Questionnaire
(PVQ-RR). Our experimental validation compares multiple embedding models across
a number of evaluation metrics. Unlike previous approaches, SQuID successfully
addresses the challenge of obtaining negative correlations between dimensions
without requiring domain-specific fine-tuning. Quantitative analysis reveals
that our embedding-based approach explains 55% of variance in
dimension-dimension similarities compared to human data. Multidimensional
scaling configurations from both types of data show fair factor congruence
coefficients and largely follow the underlying theory. These results
demonstrate that semantic embeddings can effectively replicate psychometric
structures previously established through extensive human surveys. The approach
offers substantial advantages in cost, scalability and flexibility while
maintaining comparable quality to traditional methods. Our findings have
significant implications for psychometrics and social science research,
providing a complementary methodology that could expand the scope of human
behavior and experience represented in measurement tools.

Abstract: Normative and task-driven theories offer powerful top-down explanations for
biological systems, yet the goals of quantitatively arbitrating between
competing theories, and utilizing them as inductive biases to improve
data-driven fits of real biological datasets are prohibitively laborious, and
often impossible. To this end, we introduce a Bayesian meta-learning framework
designed to automatically convert raw functional predictions from normative
theories into tractable probabilistic models. We employ adaptive deep kernel
Gaussian processes, meta-learning a kernel on synthetic data generated from a
normative theory. This Theory-Informed Kernel specifies a probabilistic model
representing the theory predictions -- usable for both fitting data and
rigorously validating the theory. As a demonstration, we apply our framework to
the early visual system, using efficient coding as our normative theory. We
show improved response prediction accuracy in ex vivo recordings of mouse
retinal ganglion cells stimulated by natural scenes compared to conventional
data-driven baselines, while providing well-calibrated uncertainty estimates
and interpretable representations. Using exact Bayesian model selection, we
also show that our informed kernel can accurately infer the degree of
theory-match from data, confirming faithful encapsulation of theory structure.
This work provides a more general, scalable, and automated approach for
integrating theoretical knowledge into data-driven scientific inquiry in
neuroscience and beyond.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有法律基准测试没有考虑多智能体系统的独特优势，如任务分解、智能体专业化和灵活训练，这限制了MAS在法律领域的潜力。

Method: 采用演绎推理方法设计基准测试，使用GDPR作为应用场景，包含广泛背景知识和复杂推理过程，并手动设计基于角色的多智能体系统进行实验。

Result: 实验结果揭示了现有模型和多智能体系统架构的优势、局限性和改进潜力。

Conclusion: MASLegalBench为法律领域的多智能体系统提供了专门的评估框架，有助于推动该领域的发展。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS), leveraging the remarkable capabilities of Large
Language Models (LLMs), show great potential in addressing complex tasks. In
this context, integrating MAS with legal tasks is a crucial step. While
previous studies have developed legal benchmarks for LLM agents, none are
specifically designed to consider the unique advantages of MAS, such as task
decomposition, agent specialization, and flexible training. In fact, the lack
of evaluation methods limits the potential of MAS in the legal domain. To
address this gap, we propose MASLegalBench, a legal benchmark tailored for MAS
and designed with a deductive reasoning approach. Our benchmark uses GDPR as
the application scenario, encompassing extensive background knowledge and
covering complex reasoning processes that effectively reflect the intricacies
of real-world legal situations. Furthermore, we manually design various
role-based MAS and conduct extensive experiments using different
state-of-the-art LLMs. Our results highlight the strengths, limitations, and
potential areas for improvement of existing models and MAS architectures.

TL;DR: 本文对V2X协同感知系统进行了实证研究，识别了6种常见错误模式，并评估了关键组件对感知性能的影响。研究发现LiDAR协同配置性能最佳，V2I和V2V通信在不同融合方案下表现不同，协同感知错误会增加驾驶违规频率，且系统对通信干扰不鲁棒。


<details>

Motivation: V2X协同感知系统具有复杂的组成结构，包括多样传感器类型、协同代理、不同融合方案和通信条件，这带来了众多运行挑战。当系统产生错误预测时，错误类型及其根本原因尚未充分探索。

Method: 通过大规模系统研究，识别和分析协同感知系统中的6种常见错误模式，并系统评估关键组件对感知性能的影响。

Result: 主要发现：(1) LiDAR协同配置感知性能最高；(2) V2I和V2V通信在不同融合方案下表现不同；(3) 协同感知错误增加会导致驾驶违规频率更高；(4) 协同感知系统在在线运行时对通信干扰不鲁棒。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了协同感知系统关键组件中存在的潜在风险和漏洞，希望研究结果能促进协同感知系统的设计和修复。

Abstract: With the tremendous advancement of deep learning and communication
technology, Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) cooperative perception has the
potential to address limitations in sensing distant objects and occlusion for a
single-agent perception system. V2X cooperative perception systems are software
systems characterized by diverse sensor types and cooperative agents, varying
fusion schemes, and operation under different communication conditions.
Therefore, their complex composition gives rise to numerous operational
challenges. Furthermore, when cooperative perception systems produce erroneous
predictions, the types of errors and their underlying causes remain
insufficiently explored. To bridge this gap, we take an initial step by
conducting an empirical study of V2X cooperative perception. To systematically
evaluate the impact of cooperative perception on the ego vehicle's perception
performance, we identify and analyze six prevalent error patterns in
cooperative perception systems. We further conduct a systematic evaluation of
the critical components of these systems through our large-scale study and
identify the following key findings: (1) The LiDAR-based cooperation
configuration exhibits the highest perception performance; (2)
Vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication
exhibit distinct cooperative perception performance under different fusion
schemes; (3) Increased cooperative perception errors may result in a higher
frequency of driving violations; (4) Cooperative perception systems are not
robust against communication interference when running online. Our results
reveal potential risks and vulnerabilities in critical components of
cooperative perception systems. We hope that our findings can better promote
the design and repair of cooperative perception systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学发现过程需要观察、分析和假设生成的循环，目前机器学习只能处理其中部分环节，难以完全自动化这个开放式的探索过程。

Method: 利用大语言模型的工具使用能力，通过代码执行等基本工具，让智能体自由探索未知物理系统，包括机械动力学系统、波演化和量子多体物理等模型。

Result: 在从观测动力学恢复运动方程和从期望值推断哈密顿量等任务上表现出色，证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 这种设置的有效性为在其他领域进行类似科学探索打开了大门，无需微调或特定任务指令。

Abstract: The process of scientific discovery relies on an interplay of observations,
analysis, and hypothesis generation. Machine learning is increasingly being
adopted to address individual aspects of this process. However, it remains an
open challenge to fully automate the open-ended, heuristic, iterative loop
required to discover the laws of an unknown system by exploring it through
experiments and analysis, without tailoring the approach to the specifics of a
given task. Here, we introduce SciExplorer, an agent that leverages large
language model tool-use capabilities to enable free-form exploration of systems
without any domain-specific blueprints, and apply it to the exploration of
physical systems that are initially unknown to the agent. We test SciExplorer
on a broad set of models spanning mechanical dynamical systems, wave evolution,
and quantum many-body physics. Despite using a minimal set of tools, primarily
based on code execution, we observe impressive performance on tasks such as
recovering equations of motion from observed dynamics and inferring
Hamiltonians from expectation values. The demonstrated effectiveness of this
setup opens the door towards similar scientific exploration in other domains,
without the need for finetuning or task-specific instructions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有在线强化学习与可验证奖励方法对所有训练样本一视同仁，忽略了问题难度与模型当前能力之间的差异，导致学习效率低下和性能上限受限。

Method: CLPO算法通过模型自身推演表现进行实时难度评估，构建在线课程，并采用自适应问题重构机制：将中等难度问题多样化以促进泛化，将挑战性问题简化以使其更易掌握。

Result: 在八个具有挑战性的数学和通用推理基准测试中，CLPO实现了最先进的性能，平均pass@1指标比其他方法提高了6.96%。

Conclusion: CLPO将静态训练过程转变为与模型能力共同进化的动态过程，证明了其能够更有效地训练更具能力的推理模型。

Abstract: Recently, online Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has
become a key paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large
Language Models (LLMs). However, existing methods typically treat all training
samples uniformly, overlooking the vast differences in problem difficulty
relative to the model's current capabilities. This uniform training strategy
leads to inefficient exploration of problems the model has already mastered,
while concurrently lacking effective guidance on problems that are challenging
its abilities the most, limiting both learning efficiency and upper-bound
performance. To address this, we propose CLPO (Curriculum-guided Learning for
Policy Optimization), a novel algorithm that creates a dynamic pedagogical
feedback loop within the policy optimization process. The core of CLPO
leverages the model's own rollout performance to conduct real-time difficulty
assessment, thereby constructing an Online Curriculum. This curriculum then
guides an Adaptive Problem Restructuring mechanism, where the model acts as its
own teacher: it diversifies medium-difficulty problems to promote
generalization and simplifies challenging problems to make them more
attainable. Our approach transforms the static training procedure into a
dynamic process that co-evolves with the model's capabilities. Experiments show
that CLPO achieves state-of-the-art performance across eight challenging
mathematical and general reasoning benchmarks, with an average pass@1
improvement of 6.96% over other methods, demonstrating its potential for more
efficiently training more capable reasoning models.

TL;DR: AutoPlay是一个可扩展的任务生成管道，通过探索交互环境来发现可能的交互和状态信息，从而合成环境基础的任务，用于训练多模态大语言模型代理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖人工标注或有限环境信息提示，成本高且扩展性差，任务覆盖范围有限。需要高质量、多样化、可执行且可验证的下游代理任务数据集。

Method: AutoPlay采用两阶段方法：探索阶段使用MLLM探索代理系统发现新环境状态和功能；任务生成阶段利用探索轨迹和任务指南提示作为上下文，合成多样化、可执行且可验证的任务。

Result: 在20个Android应用中生成20k任务，在13个Ubuntu应用中生成10k任务。训练出的UI代理在移动使用场景中成功率提升20.0%，在计算机使用场景中提升10.9%。结合强化学习训练可额外获得5.7%的提升。

Conclusion: AutoPlay为后训练MLLM代理提供了一种可扩展的方法，显著减少了对人工标注的依赖，能够生成高质量的任务数据集用于代理训练。

Abstract: Post-Training Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to build interactive
agents holds promise across domains such as computer-use, web navigation, and
robotics. A key challenge in scaling such post-training is lack of high-quality
downstream agentic task datasets with tasks that are diverse, feasible, and
verifiable. Existing approaches for task generation rely heavily on human
annotation or prompting MLLM with limited downstream environment information,
which is either costly or poorly scalable as it yield tasks with limited
coverage. To remedy this, we present AutoPlay, a scalable pipeline for task
generation that explicitly explores interactive environments to discover
possible interactions and current state information to synthesize
environment-grounded tasks. AutoPlay operates in two stages: (i) an exploration
phase, where an MLLM explorer agent systematically uncovers novel environment
states and functionalities, and (ii) a task generation phase, where a task
generator leverages exploration trajectories and a set of task guideline
prompts as context to synthesize diverse, executable, and verifiable tasks. We
show AutoPlay generates 20k tasks across 20 Android applications and 10k tasks
across 13 applications Ubuntu applications to train mobile-use and computer-use
agents. AutoPlay generated tasks enable large-scale task demonstration
synthesis without human annotation by employing an MLLM task executor and
verifier. This data enables training MLLM-based UI agents that improve success
rates up to $20.0\%$ on mobile-use and $10.9\%$ on computer-use scenarios. In
addition, AutoPlay generated tasks combined with MLLM verifier-based rewards
enable scaling reinforcement learning training of UI agents, leading to an
additional $5.7\%$ gain. coverage. These results establish AutoPlay as a
scalable approach for post-training capable MLLM agents reducing reliance on
human annotation.

Conclusion: CEL展示了通过显式推理构建透明且持续改进世界模型的路径，为更通用和可解释的智能体提供了新范式。

Abstract: The pursuit of artificial agents that can learn to master complex
environments has led to remarkable successes, yet prevailing deep reinforcement
learning methods often rely on immense experience, encoding their knowledge
opaquely within neural network weights. We propose a different paradigm, one in
which an agent learns to play by reasoning and planning. We introduce Cogito,
ergo ludo (CEL), a novel agent architecture that leverages a Large Language
Model (LLM) to build an explicit, language-based understanding of its
environment's mechanics and its own strategy. Starting from a tabula rasa state
with no prior knowledge (except action set), CEL operates on a cycle of
interaction and reflection. After each episode, the agent analyzes its complete
trajectory to perform two concurrent learning processes: Rule Induction, where
it refines its explicit model of the environment's dynamics, and Strategy and
Playbook Summarization, where it distills experiences into an actionable
strategic playbook. We evaluate CEL on diverse grid-world tasks (i.e.,
Minesweeper, Frozen Lake, and Sokoban), and show that the CEL agent
successfully learns to master these games by autonomously discovering their
rules and developing effective policies from sparse rewards. Ablation studies
confirm that the iterative process is critical for sustained learning. Our work
demonstrates a path toward more general and interpretable agents that not only
act effectively but also build a transparent and improving model of their world
through explicit reasoning on raw experience.

Abstract: Heatwaves pose complex cascading risks across interconnected climate, social,
and economic systems, but knowledge fragmentation in scientific literature
hinders comprehensive understanding of these risk pathways. We introduce HeDA
(Heatwave Discovery Agent), an intelligent multi-agent system designed for
automated scientific discovery through knowledge graph construction and
multi-layer risk propagation analysis. HeDA processes over 10,247 academic

systematically identify overlooked risk transmission pathways. Our system
achieves 78.9% accuracy on complex question-answering tasks, outperforming
state-of-the-art baselines including GPT-4 by 13.7%. Critically, HeDA
successfully discovered five previously unidentified high-impact risk chains,
such as the pathway where a heatwave leads to a water demand surge, resulting
in industrial water restrictions and ultimately causing small business
disruption, which were validated through historical case studies and domain

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨RL在LLM后训练中的真正作用：是教授新技能还是仅仅激活现有能力？解决关于RL贡献的争议。

Method: 开发合成框架，将技能定义为推断字符串转换函数输出的能力。在LLM已学习f和g的基础上，通过RL训练学习未见过的组合h(x)=g(f(x))。

Result: RL使LLMs能够学习函数组合技能，这种能力可以泛化到>2个函数的组合，并且能够迁移到不同的目标任务。RL从根本上改变了模型的推理行为。

Conclusion: RL能够使LLMs获得真正的新技能，特别是组合能力，这为LLM学习提供了新见解：先构建具有基础技能的模型，然后用RL激励高级、可泛化的复杂问题解决技能。

Abstract: Does RL teach LLMs genuinely new skills, or does it merely activate existing
ones? This question lies at the core of ongoing debates about the role of RL in
LLM post-training. On one side, strong empirical results can be achieved with
RL even without preceding supervised finetuning; on the other, critics argue
that RL contributes little beyond reweighting existing reasoning strategies.
This work provides concrete evidence that LLMs can acquire genuinely new skills
during RL by composing existing ones, mirroring one of the central mechanisms
by which humans acquire new cognitive skills. To mitigate data contamination
and other confounding factors, and to allow precise control over task
complexity, we develop a synthetic framework for our investigation.
Specifically, we define a skill as the ability to infer the output of a string
transformation function f(x) given x. When an LLM has already learned f and g
prior to RL, our experiments reveal that RL enables it to learn unseen
compositions of them h(x)=g(f(x)). Further, this compositional ability
generalizes to more difficult problems such as compositions of >2 functions
unseen during RL training. Surprisingly, our experiments show that
compositional skill acquired on a source task transfers to a different target
task. This transfer happens even without compositional training on the target,
requiring only prior knowledge of the target's atomic skills. Our qualitative
analysis shows that RL fundamentally changes the reasoning behaviors of the
models. In contrast, next-token training with the same data yields none of
these findings. Our systematic experiments provide fresh insights into LLM
learning, suggesting the value of first building base models with basic skills,
then using RL to incentivize advanced, generalizable skills for complex
problems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对话模型使用预标注的专家生成反馈进行对齐，但为了持续改进和多方面对齐，模型需要从自然人类交互中学习。

Method: 开发两种互补方法：1）用户引导重写：根据用户的自然语言后续响应修订不满意输出；2）基于用户奖励：通过基于用户长期交互历史（个人资料）的奖励模型学习。

Result: 在WildChat对话上训练，两种RLHI变体在个性化和指令遵循方面均优于强基线，类似反馈还能提升推理基准性能。

Conclusion: 自然人类交互为个性化对齐提供了可扩展且有效的监督方式。

Abstract: We posit that to achieve continual model improvement and multifaceted
alignment, future models must learn from natural human interaction. Current
conversational models are aligned using pre-annotated, expert-generated human
feedback. In this work, we introduce Reinforcement Learning from Human
Interaction (RLHI), a paradigm that learns directly from in-the-wild user
conversations. We develop two complementary methods: (1) RLHI with User-Guided
Rewrites, which revises unsatisfactory model outputs based on users'
natural-language follow-up responses, (2) RLHI with User-Based Rewards, which
learns via a reward model conditioned on knowledge of the user's long-term
interaction history (termed persona). Together, these methods link long-term
user personas to turn-level preferences via persona-conditioned preference
optimization. Trained on conversations derived from WildChat, both RLHI
variants outperform strong baselines in personalization and
instruction-following, and similar feedback enhances performance on reasoning
benchmarks. These results suggest organic human interaction offers scalable,
effective supervision for personalized alignment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有零样本LLM导航代理要么将图像编码为文本场景描述（可能过度简化视觉细节），要么处理原始图像输入（可能无法捕捉高层次推理所需的抽象语义）

Method: 通过整合多视角的文本描述来促进图像间的类比推理，利用基于文本的类比推理增强全局场景理解和空间推理

Result: 在R2R数据集上的实验表明导航性能显著提升

Conclusion: 通过多视角文本描述和类比推理可以有效增强导航代理的上下文理解能力

Abstract: Integrating large language models (LLMs) into embodied AI models is becoming
increasingly prevalent. However, existing zero-shot LLM-based
Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) agents either encode images as textual
scene descriptions, potentially oversimplifying visual details, or process raw
image inputs, which can fail to capture abstract semantics required for
high-level reasoning. In this paper, we improve the navigation agent's
contextual understanding by incorporating textual descriptions from multiple
perspectives that facilitate analogical reasoning across images. By leveraging
text-based analogical reasoning, the agent enhances its global scene
understanding and spatial reasoning, leading to more accurate action decisions.
We evaluate our approach on the R2R dataset, where our experiments demonstrate
significant improvements in navigation performance.

Motivation: 解决大型语言模型智能体在持续任务流中无法从历史交互中学习的问题，避免重复过去的错误和丢失宝贵见解。

Method: ReasoningBank框架从智能体的自我评判成功和失败经验中提取推理策略；MaTTS通过扩展智能体的交互经验来加速和多样化学习过程。

Conclusion: 建立了记忆驱动的经验扩展作为一个新的扩展维度，使智能体能够自我进化并自然产生涌现行为。

Abstract: With the growing adoption of large language model agents in persistent
real-world roles, they naturally encounter continuous streams of tasks. A key
limitation, however, is their failure to learn from the accumulated interaction
history, forcing them to discard valuable insights and repeat past errors. We
propose ReasoningBank, a novel memory framework that distills generalizable
reasoning strategies from an agent's self-judged successful and failed
experiences. At test time, an agent retrieves relevant memories from
ReasoningBank to inform its interaction and then integrates new learnings back,
enabling it to become more capable over time. Building on this powerful
experience learner, we further introduce memory-aware test-time scaling
(MaTTS), which accelerates and diversifies this learning process by scaling up
the agent's interaction experience. By allocating more compute to each task,
the agent generates abundant, diverse experiences that provide rich contrastive
signals for synthesizing higher-quality memory. The better memory in turn
guides more effective scaling, establishing a powerful synergy between memory
and test-time scaling. Across web browsing and software engineering benchmarks,
ReasoningBank consistently outperforms existing memory mechanisms that store
raw trajectories or only successful task routines, improving both effectiveness
and efficiency; MaTTS further amplifies these gains. These findings establish
memory-driven experience scaling as a new scaling dimension, enabling agents to
self-evolve with emergent behaviors naturally arise.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究为什么视觉语言模型在标准基准测试中表现良好，但在简单视觉推理任务中却不如人类表现，假设关键因素是视觉基础的串行处理能力不足。

Method: 在三个不同领域（几何推理、感知枚举和心理旋转）设计任务，通过操纵几何概念复杂性、感知个体化负载和变换难度等因素来变化串行处理需求，比较人类和VLM的表现。

Result: 所有领域都显示出一致模式：VLM准确率下降与人类反应时间增加强相关。随着任务需要更多串行处理（概念组合、项目枚举或心理变换），VLM与人类表现差距显著扩大。

Conclusion: 当前VLMs在串行、视觉基础的推理能力上存在根本性瓶颈，这是区别于人类的关键因素。

Abstract: Why do Vision Language Models (VLMs), despite success on standard benchmarks,
often fail to match human performance on surprisingly simple visual reasoning
tasks? While the underlying computational principles are still debated, we
hypothesize that a crucial factor is a deficit in visually-grounded serial
processing. To test this hypothesis, we compared human and VLM performance
across tasks designed to vary serial processing demands in three distinct
domains: geometric reasoning, perceptual enumeration, and mental rotation.
Tasks within each domain varied serial processing load by manipulating factors
such as geometric concept complexity, perceptual individuation load, and
transformation difficulty. Across all domains, our results revealed a
consistent pattern: decreased VLM accuracy was strongly correlated with
increased human reaction time (used as a proxy for serial processing load). As
tasks require more demanding serial processing -- whether composing concepts,
enumerating items, or performing mental transformations -- the VLM-human
performance gap widens reliably. These findings support our hypothesis,
indicating that limitations in serial, visually grounded reasoning represent a
fundamental bottleneck that distinguishes current VLMs from humans.

Motivation: 传统SFT+RL顺序流水线存在关键分布不匹配问题：SFT使用静态专家数据，而策略演化时生成分布会漂移，导致SFT知识脆弱；后续RL探索时无法直接访问专家演示中的丰富知识，造成低效更新。

Method: 提出UniAPL框架，将对齐重新定义为约束优化问题，实现单阶段统一训练目标，从混合的SFT和偏好数据批次中联合学习，让密集专家演示直接规范和指导在线探索。

Result: 在指令跟随任务上，UniAPL匹配或超越强GRPO基线：Qwen3-0.6B提升5.77%（达到32B模型水平），Qwen3-4B提升3.75%，甚至超越教师模型。响应长度和log概率分布分析证实输出更接近专家演示。

Conclusion: UniAPL有效解决了分布不匹配问题，实现了更强的性能和更好的行为对齐，证明了统一学习框架在AI对齐中的优势。

Abstract: Shaping powerful LLMs to be beneficial and safe is central to AI alignment.
We argue that post-training alignment is fundamentally a unified Preference
Learning problem, involving two modalities: demonstrated preferences (e.g.,
Supervised Fine-Tuning, SFT) and comparative preferences (e.g., Reinforcement
Learning, RL).The standard sequential pipeline-SFT followed by RL-is flawed due
to a critical distributional mismatch: SFT uses static expert data, but as the
policy evolves, its generation distribution drifts, making SFT knowledge
brittle. Subsequent RL then explores without direct access to the rich,
ground-truth knowledge in expert demonstrations, leading to inefficient,
ungrounded updates. This separation prevents mutual regularization between data
sources. To address this, we reframe alignment as a constrained optimization
problem and propose Unified Adversarial Preference Learning (UniAPL),a novel
framework that dynamically aligns the policy's distribution with the expert's.
UniAPL implements a single-stage unified training objective, jointly learning
from mixed batches of SFT and preference data. In every gradient step, dense
expert demonstrations directly ground and regularize online exploration,
inherently resolving distributional mismatch and maximizing data synergy.We
evaluate UniAPL on instruction-following tasks using Qwen3-235B-Instruct-2507
as the teacher. Our models match or exceed strong GRPO baselines: +5.77% on
Qwen3-0.6B (matching a 32B model) and +3.75% on Qwen3-4B,even outperforming the
teacher. Analyses of response length and log-probability distributions confirm
that UniAPL outputs closely mimic expert demonstrations, achieving both
stronger performance and better behavioral alignment.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based judgments leverage powerful LLMs to
efficiently evaluate candidate content and provide judgment scores. However,
the inherent biases and vulnerabilities of LLM-generated judgments raise
concerns, underscoring the urgent need for distinguishing them in sensitive
scenarios like academic peer reviewing. In this work, we propose and formalize
the task of judgment detection and systematically investigate the detectability
of LLM-generated judgments. Unlike LLM-generated text detection, judgment
detection relies solely on judgment scores and candidates, reflecting
real-world scenarios where textual feedback is often unavailable in the
detection process. Our preliminary analysis shows that existing LLM-generated
text detection methods perform poorly given their incapability to capture the
interaction between judgment scores and candidate content -- an aspect crucial
for effective judgment detection. Inspired by this, we introduce
\textit{J-Detector}, a lightweight and transparent neural detector augmented
with explicitly extracted linguistic and LLM-enhanced features to link LLM
judges' biases with candidates' properties for accurate detection. Experiments
across diverse datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of \textit{J-Detector}
and show how its interpretability enables quantifying biases in LLM judges.
Finally, we analyze key factors affecting the detectability of LLM-generated
judgments and validate the practical utility of judgment detection in
real-world scenarios.
