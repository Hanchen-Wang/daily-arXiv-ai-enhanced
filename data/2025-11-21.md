TL;DR: UniFit是一个基于多模态大语言模型的通用虚拟试穿框架，通过语义对齐模块和两阶段训练策略，解决了文本指令与参考图像之间的语义鸿沟和数据稀缺问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多任务虚拟试穿框架存在两个关键限制：(1) 文本指令与参考图像之间的语义鸿沟；(2) 复杂场景下的数据稀缺问题。

Method: 提出MLLM引导的语义对齐模块(MGSA)，通过多模态输入整合和语义对齐损失来捕捉跨模态语义关系；采用两阶段渐进训练策略和自合成流程。

Result: UniFit不仅支持多服装和模型到模型试穿等多种VTON任务，而且实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: UniFit通过MLLM驱动的语义对齐和渐进训练策略，有效解决了虚拟试穿中的语义鸿沟和数据稀缺问题，构建了一个通用的VTON框架。

Abstract: Image-based virtual try-on (VTON) aims to synthesize photorealistic images of a person wearing specified garments. Despite significant progress, building a universal VTON framework that can flexibly handle diverse and complex tasks remains a major challenge. Recent methods explore multi-task VTON frameworks guided by textual instructions, yet they still face two key limitations: (1) semantic gap between text instructions and reference images, and (2) data scarcity in complex scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose UniFit, a universal VTON framework driven by a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). Specifically, we introduce an MLLM-Guided Semantic Alignment Module (MGSA), which integrates multimodal inputs using an MLLM and a set of learnable queries. By imposing a semantic alignment loss, MGSA captures cross-modal semantic relationships and provides coherent and explicit semantic guidance for the generative process, thereby reducing the semantic gap. Moreover, by devising a two-stage progressive training strategy with a self-synthesis pipeline, UniFit is able to learn complex tasks from limited data. Extensive experiments show that UniFit not only supports a wide range of VTON tasks, including multi-garment and model-to-model try-on, but also achieves state-of-the-art performance. The source code and pretrained models are available at https://github.com/zwplus/UniFit.

### [2] [EfficientSAM3: Progressive Hierarchical Distillation for Video Concept Segmentation from SAM1, 2, and 3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15833)
*Chengxi Zeng,Yuxuan Jiang,Aaron Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了EfficientSAM3模型系列，通过渐进式分层蒸馏方法将SAM3的能力转移到轻量级学生模型中，实现高效的图像和视频概念分割与跟踪。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM3虽然在视觉理解方面取得了进展，但其统一架构对于设备端使用来说过于庞大和昂贵，需要开发更高效的模型。

Method: 采用渐进式分层蒸馏(PHD)方法，分三个阶段：编码器蒸馏、时序记忆蒸馏和端到端微调，使用RepViT、TinyViT和EfficientViT等轻量级骨干网络。

Result: 在流行的VOS数据集上进行了基准测试，与相关工作相比，实现了强大的性能-效率权衡。

Conclusion: EfficientSAM3系列模型能够在保持与教师模型高度一致性的同时，实现设备端的概念分割和跟踪，为实际应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model 3 (SAM3) advances visual understanding with Promptable Concept Segmentation (PCS) across images and videos, but its unified architecture (shared vision backbone, DETR-style detector, dense-memory tracker) remains prohibitive for on-device use. We present EfficientSAM3, a family of efficient models built on Progressive Hierarchical Distillation (PHD) that transfers capability from SAM3 to lightweight students in three stages: (1) Encoder Distillation aligns image features via prompt-in-the-loop training on SA-1B; (2) Temporal Memory Distillation replaces dense memory with a compact Perceiver-based module trained on SA-V to compress and retrieve spatiotemporal features efficiently; and (3) End-to-End Fine-Tuning refines the full pipeline on the official SAM3 PCS data to preserve concept-level performance. PHD yields a spectrum of student variants using RepViT, TinyViT, and EfficientViT backbones, enabling on-device concept segmentation and tracking while maintaining high fidelity to teacher behavior. We benchmark on popular VOS datasets, and compare with varies of releated work, achieing strong performance-efficiency trade-offs.

### [3] [WALDO: Where Unseen Model-based 6D Pose Estimation Meets Occlusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15874)
*Sajjad Pakdamansavoji,Yintao Ma,Amir Rasouli,Tongtong Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了四种改进模型基6D物体姿态估计的新方法：动态非均匀密集采样、多假设推理机制、迭代精炼和遮挡增强训练，显著提升了遮挡场景下的姿态估计精度和速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有6D物体姿态估计方法在遮挡场景下容易出错的问题，传统多阶段流水线在遮挡情况下早期阶段容易产生错误并传播，影响整体性能。

Method: 使用动态非均匀密集采样聚焦可见区域，多假设推理保留多个姿态候选，迭代精炼逐步提升精度，以及遮挡增强训练提升鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了遮挡场景下的6D姿态估计问题，显著提升了精度和效率，并提出了新的加权可见性评估指标。

Abstract: Accurate 6D object pose estimation is vital for robotics, augmented reality, and scene understanding. For seen objects, high accuracy is often attainable via per-object fine-tuning but generalizing to unseen objects remains a challenge. To address this problem, past arts assume access to CAD models at test time and typically follow a multi-stage pipeline to estimate poses: detect and segment the object, propose an initial pose, and then refine it. Under occlusion, however, the early-stage of such pipelines are prone to errors, which can propagate through the sequential processing, and consequently degrade the performance. To remedy this shortcoming, we propose four novel extensions to model-based 6D pose estimation methods: (i) a dynamic non-uniform dense sampling strategy that focuses computation on visible regions, reducing occlusion-induced errors; (ii) a multi-hypothesis inference mechanism that retains several confidence-ranked pose candidates, mitigating brittle single-path failures; (iii) iterative refinement to progressively improve pose accuracy; and (iv) series of occlusion-focused training augmentations that strengthen robustness and generalization. Furthermore, we propose a new weighted by visibility metric for evaluation under occlusion to minimize the bias in the existing protocols. Via extensive empirical evaluations, we show that our proposed approach achieves more than 5% improvement in accuracy on ICBIN and more than 2% on BOP dataset benchmarks, while achieving approximately 3 times faster inference.

### [4] [Automatic Uncertainty-Aware Synthetic Data Bootstrapping for Historical Map Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15875)
*Lukas Arzoumanidis,Julius Knechtel,Jan-Henrik Haunert,Youness Dehbi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种自动生成合成历史地图的方法，通过将原始历史地图的制图风格转移到矢量数据上，解决历史地图分析中训练数据稀缺的问题，并用于领域自适应语义分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 历史地图分析缺乏足够的标注训练数据，而合成训练数据往往缺乏真实性和多样性。本文旨在通过生成逼真的合成历史地图来解决这一问题。

Method: 提出了自动深度生成方法和替代性手动随机退化技术，模拟历史地图扫描中的视觉不确定性和噪声，生成无限数量的合成历史地图。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效解决历史地图分析中训练数据稀缺的问题，生成的合成数据适用于机器学习和语义分割任务。

Abstract: The automated analysis of historical documents, particularly maps, has drastically benefited from advances in deep learning and its success across various computer vision applications. However, most deep learning-based methods heavily rely on large amounts of annotated training data, which are typically unavailable for historical maps, especially for those belonging to specific, homogeneous cartographic domains, also known as corpora. Creating high-quality training data suitable for machine learning often takes a significant amount of time and involves extensive manual effort. While synthetic training data can alleviate the scarcity of real-world samples, it often lacks the affinity (realism) and diversity (variation) necessary for effective learning. By transferring the cartographic style of an original historical map corpus onto vector data, we bootstrap an effectively unlimited number of synthetic historical maps suitable for tasks such as land-cover interpretation of a homogeneous historical map corpus. We propose an automatic deep generative approach and a alternative manual stochastic degradation technique to emulate the visual uncertainty and noise, also known as data-dependent uncertainty, commonly observed in historical map scans. To quantitatively evaluate the effectiveness and applicability of our approach, the generated training datasets were employed for domain-adaptive semantic segmentation on a homogeneous map corpus using a Self-Constructing Graph Convolutional Network, enabling a comprehensive assessment of the impact of our data bootstrapping methods.

### [5] [Box6D : Zero-shot Category-level 6D Pose Estimation of Warehouse Boxes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15884)
*Yintao Ma,Sajjad Pakdamansavoji,Amir Rasouli,Tongtong Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Box6D是一种针对仓库场景中存储箱的类别级6D姿态估计方法，通过单次RGB-D观测快速推断箱子尺寸并估计姿态，在保持精度的同时显著降低推理时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决仓库自动化、分拣等场景中，现有6D姿态估计方法在灵活性、精度和实用性方面的不足，特别是模型依赖、环境适应性差和计算成本高的问题。

Method: 使用快速二分搜索推断箱子尺寸，基于类别CAD模板而非实例特定模型进行姿态估计，采用深度合理性过滤器和早停策略来降低计算成本。

Result: 在真实仓库场景和公共基准测试中，Box6D实现了竞争性或更优的6D姿态精度，同时将推理时间减少了约76%。

Conclusion: Box6D为仓库环境中的存储箱6D姿态估计提供了一种高效实用的解决方案，在精度和效率之间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: Accurate and efficient 6D pose estimation of novel objects under clutter and occlusion is critical for robotic manipulation across warehouse automation, bin picking, logistics, and e-commerce fulfillment. There are three main approaches in this domain; Model-based methods assume an exact CAD model at inference but require high-resolution meshes and transfer poorly to new environments; Model-free methods that rely on a few reference images or videos are more flexible, however often fail under challenging conditions; Category-level approaches aim to balance flexibility and accuracy but many are overly general and ignore environment and object priors, limiting their practicality in industrial settings.
  To this end, we propose Box6d, a category-level 6D pose estimation method tailored for storage boxes in the warehouse context. From a single RGB-D observation, Box6D infers the dimensions of the boxes via a fast binary search and estimates poses using a category CAD template rather than instance-specific models. Suing a depth-based plausibility filter and early-stopping strategy, Box6D then rejects implausible hypotheses, lowering computational cost. We conduct evaluations on real-world storage scenarios and public benchmarks, and show that our approach delivers competitive or superior 6D pose precision while reducing inference time by approximately 76%.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种两阶段自改进范式，通过让视觉语言模型生成详细文本推理来弥合领域特定视频分类中的语义差距，无需新标注即可显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在领域特定视频分类任务中表现不佳，特别是在数据有限的情况下，这源于复杂的时空内容与抽象分类标签之间的语义距离无法被稀疏领域数据充分弥合。

Method: 两阶段方法：1) 让VLM为每个视频生成详细文本推理，强制其表达领域特定逻辑；2) 在这些自生成推理上微调VLM，利用中间监督使其表示与目标领域对齐，然后进行常规监督微调。

Result: 在多样化数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法显著优于直接监督微调，验证了自生成推理作为适应VLM到领域特定视频分析的有效且标注高效的范式。

Conclusion: 自生成推理是一种有效的、标注高效的方法，能够成功弥合视觉语言模型在领域特定视频分析中的语义差距，显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) are becoming increasingly integral to multimedia understanding; however, they often struggle with domain-specific video classification tasks, particularly in cases with limited data. This stems from a critical \textit{rationale gap}, where sparse domain data is insufficient to bridge the semantic distance between complex spatio-temporal content and abstract classification labels. We propose a two-stage self-improvement paradigm to bridge this gap without new annotations. First, we prompt the VLMs to generate detailed textual rationales for each video, compelling them to articulate the domain-specific logic. The VLM is then fine-tuned on these self-generated rationales, utilizing this intermediate supervision to align its representations with the nuances of the target domain. Second, conventional supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is performed on the task labels, achieving markedly higher effectiveness as a result of the model's pre-acquired domain reasoning. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms direct SFT, validating self-generated rationale as an effective, annotation-efficient paradigm for adapting VLMs to domain-specific video analysis.

### [7] [Boosting Medical Visual Understanding From Multi-Granular Language Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15943)
*Zihan Li,Yiqing Wang,Sina Farsiu,Paul Kinahan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了MGLL框架，通过多粒度语言学习改进多标签和跨粒度对齐，在医学影像等领域超越现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP等现有方法专注于单标签单粒度对齐，但在医学影像等复杂领域，图像通常对应多个高层标签和不同粒度注释，需要更强大的多标签跨粒度对齐能力

Method: MGLL框架利用结构化多标签监督，整合跨粒度文本描述，引入带点约束的软标签监督来增强对齐，使用平滑KL散度确保跨粒度一致性，作为即插即用模块保持计算效率

Result: 在构建的大规模多粒度数据集上预训练，并在多个数据集上评估，MGLL在下游任务中优于其他最先进方法

Conclusion: MGLL有效解决了多标签和跨粒度对齐问题，在复杂视觉理解任务中表现出色，为医学影像等领域的多模态学习提供了有力工具

Abstract: Recent advances in image-text pretraining have significantly enhanced visual understanding by aligning visual and textual representations. Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) has played a pivotal role in multimodal learning. However, its focus on single-label, single-granularity alignment limits its effectiveness in complex domains such as medical imaging, where images often correspond to multiple high-level labels (e.g., disease categories) across different annotation granularities (e.g., diagnostic description, clinical explanation). To address this, we propose Multi-Granular Language Learning (MGLL), a contrastive learning framework designed to improve both multi-label and cross-granularity alignment. MGLL leverages structured multi-label supervision, integrates textual descriptions across granularities, and introduces soft-label supervision with point-wise constraints to enhance alignment. MGLL employs smooth Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to ensure cross-granularity consistency while maintaining computational efficiency as a plug-and-play module for vision-language models. Pretrained on our constructed large-scale multi-granular datasets and evaluated across multiple datasets, MGLL outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in downstream tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统心脏超声依赖2D视频，而3D超声心动图能简化采集过程并改善离轴特征的评估，但医生习惯使用2D视图进行诊断。

Method: 应用深度学习视图分类器和基于解剖标志的下游启发式算法，结合心脏病专家提供的启发式规则，重建标准超声心动图视图。

Result: 在来自2家医院的1600个视频中，三位心脏病专家盲法评估准确率达96%。提取的2D视频保留了空间校准和诊断特征，能够检测心脏异常并生成临床级测量。

Conclusion: 该方法使医生能够在保持其习惯的2D视图格式的同时，受益于3D扫描的速度和可用性，实现了从3D体积中获取准确真实世界解释的能力。

Abstract: Although the heart has complex three-dimensional (3D) anatomy, conventional medical imaging with cardiac ultrasound relies on a series of 2D videos showing individual cardiac structures. 3D echocardiography is a developing modality that now offers adequate image quality for clinical use, with potential to streamline acquisition and improve assessment of off-axis features. We propose an automated method to select standard 2D views from 3D cardiac ultrasound volumes, allowing physicians to interpret the data in their usual format while benefiting from the speed and usability of 3D scanning. Applying a deep learning view classifier and downstream heuristics based on anatomical landmarks together with heuristics provided by cardiologists, we reconstruct standard echocardiography views. This approach was validated by three cardiologists in blinded evaluation (96\% accuracy in 1,600 videos from 2 hospitals). The downstream 2D videos were also validated in their ability to detect cardiac abnormalities using AI echocardiography models (EchoPrime and PanEcho) as well as ability to generate clinical-grade measurements of cardiac anatomy (EchoNet-Measurement). We demonstrated that the extracted 2D videos preserve spatial calibration and diagnostic features, allowing clinicians to obtain accurate real-world interpretations from 3D volumes. We release the code and a dataset of 29 3D echocardiography videos https://github.com/echonet/3d-echo .

*Raphael Ruschel,Hardikkumar Prajapati,Awsafur Rahman,B. S. Manjunath*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Click2Graph是首个用于全景视频场景图生成(PVSG)的交互式框架，通过单一用户提示(如点击或边界框)实现跨时间分割跟踪、自主发现交互对象并预测三元组，形成时间一致的场景图。

Conclusion: Click2Graph实现了可控和可解释的视频场景理解，将人类提示与全景定位和关系推理相结合，为交互式视频场景图生成提供了新范式。

Abstract: State-of-the-art Video Scene Graph Generation (VSGG) systems provide structured visual understanding but operate as closed, feed-forward pipelines with no ability to incorporate human guidance. In contrast, promptable segmentation models such as SAM2 enable precise user interaction but lack semantic or relational reasoning. We introduce Click2Graph, the first interactive framework for Panoptic Video Scene Graph Generation (PVSG) that unifies visual prompting with spatial, temporal, and semantic understanding. From a single user cue, such as a click or bounding box, Click2Graph segments and tracks the subject across time, autonomously discovers interacting objects, and predicts <subject, object, predicate> triplets to form a temporally consistent scene graph. Our framework introduces two key components: a Dynamic Interaction Discovery Module that generates subject-conditioned object prompts, and a Semantic Classification Head that performs joint entity and predicate reasoning. Experiments on the OpenPVSG benchmark demonstrate that Click2Graph establishes a strong foundation for user-guided PVSG, showing how human prompting can be combined with panoptic grounding and relational inference to enable controllable and interpretable video scene understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InfoCLIP通过信息论方法改进CLIP在开放词汇语义分割中的微调，避免过拟合并保持预训练的多模态对齐能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在有限类别上微调CLIP会导致过拟合和破坏预训练的视觉-语言对齐能力，需要稳定的模态对齐迁移方法。

Method: 基于互信息设计两个目标：压缩像素-文本模态对齐以减少噪声，最大化预训练CLIP与微调模型之间的对齐知识互信息。

Result: 在多个基准测试中验证了InfoCLIP在增强CLIP开放词汇语义分割微调方面的有效性。

Conclusion: InfoCLIP展示了在不对称迁移中的适应性和优越性，能够有效提升CLIP在分割任务中的性能。

Abstract: Recently, the strong generalization ability of CLIP has facilitated open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, which labels pixels using arbitrary text. However, existing methods that fine-tune CLIP for segmentation on limited seen categories often lead to overfitting and degrade the pretrained vision-language alignment. To stabilize modality alignment during fine-tuning, we propose InfoCLIP, which leverages an information-theoretic perspective to transfer alignment knowledge from pretrained CLIP to the segmentation task. Specifically, this transfer is guided by two novel objectives grounded in mutual information. First, we compress the pixel-text modality alignment from pretrained CLIP to reduce noise arising from its coarse-grained local semantic representations learned under image-text supervision. Second, we maximize the mutual information between the alignment knowledge of pretrained CLIP and the fine-tuned model to transfer compact local semantic relations suited for the segmentation task. Extensive evaluations across various benchmarks validate the effectiveness of InfoCLIP in enhancing CLIP fine-tuning for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, demonstrating its adaptability and superiority in asymmetric transfer.

Abstract: Multi-task learning can suffer from destructive task interference, where jointly trained models underperform single-task baselines and limit generalization. To improve generalization performance in breast ultrasound-based tumor segmentation via multi-task learning, we propose a novel consistency regularization approach that mitigates destructive interference between segmentation and classification. The consistency regularization approach is composed of differentiable BI-RADS-inspired morphological features. We validated this approach by training all models on the BrEaST dataset (Poland) and evaluating them on three external datasets: UDIAT (Spain), BUSI (Egypt), and BUS-UCLM (Spain). Our comprehensive analysis demonstrates statistically significant (p<0.001) improvements in generalization for segmentation task of the proposed multi-task approach vs. the baseline one: UDIAT, BUSI, BUS-UCLM (Dice coefficient=0.81 vs 0.59, 0.66 vs 0.56, 0.69 vs 0.49, resp.). The proposed approach also achieves state-of-the-art segmentation performance under rigorous external validation on the UDIAT dataset.

Conclusion: 提出的检测引导生成式框架能够有效解决视觉语义理解中的细粒度识别问题，为大规模电商场景提供了更优的统一解决方案。

Abstract: Achieving visual semantic understanding requires a unified framework that simultaneously handles object detection, category prediction, and attribute recognition. However, current advanced approaches rely on global similarity and struggle to capture fine-grained category distinctions and category-specific attribute diversity, especially in large-scale e-commerce scenarios. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a detection-guided generative framework that predicts hierarchical category and attribute tokens. For each detected object, we extract refined ROI-level features and employ a BART-based generator to produce semantic tokens in a coarse-to-fine sequence covering category hierarchies and property-value pairs, with support for property-conditioned attribute recognition. Experiments on both large-scale proprietary e-commerce datasets and open-source datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing similarity-based pipelines and multi-stage classification systems, achieving stronger fine-grained recognition and more coherent unified inference.

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在医学图像推理中表现出潜力，但跨人口群体的公平性仍是主要问题。现有去偏方法依赖大量标注数据或微调，不适用于基础规模模型。

Method: 提出公平感知演示选择(FADS)，通过聚类采样构建人口统计学平衡且语义相关的演示示例，作为轻量级、无需调优的上下文学习替代方案。

Result: 在多个医学影像基准测试中，FADS一致减少了性别、种族和民族相关的差异，同时保持强准确性。

Conclusion: 公平感知上下文学习为公平医学图像推理提供了可扩展且数据高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown strong potential for medical image reasoning, yet fairness across demographic groups remains a major concern. Existing debiasing methods often rely on large labeled datasets or fine-tuning, which are impractical for foundation-scale models. We explore In-Context Learning (ICL) as a lightweight, tuning-free alternative for improving fairness. Through systematic analysis, we find that conventional demonstration selection (DS) strategies fail to ensure fairness due to demographic imbalance in selected exemplars. To address this, we propose Fairness-Aware Demonstration Selection (FADS), which builds demographically balanced and semantically relevant demonstrations via clustering-based sampling. Experiments on multiple medical imaging benchmarks show that FADS consistently reduces gender-, race-, and ethnicity-related disparities while maintaining strong accuracy, offering an efficient and scalable path toward fair medical image reasoning. These results highlight the potential of fairness-aware in-context learning as a scalable and data-efficient solution for equitable medical image reasoning.

Conclusion: 图表示方法能有效提升长尾识别中的OOD检测性能，显著改善尾部类别的识别效果。

Abstract: Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) data is essential for safe deployment of deep neural networks (DNNs). This problem becomes particularly challenging in the presence of long-tailed in-distribution (ID) datasets, often leading to high false positive rates (FPR) and low tail-class ID classification accuracy. In this paper, we demonstrate that exploiting inter-sample relationships using a graph-based representation can significantly improve OOD detection in long-tailed recognition of vision datasets. To this end, we use the feature space of a pre-trained model to initialize our graph structure. We account for the differences between the activation layer distribution of the pre-training vs. training data, and actively introduce Gaussianization to alleviate any deviations from a standard normal distribution in the activation layers of the pre-trained model. We then refine this initial graph representation using graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to arrive at a feature space suitable for long-tailed OOD detection. This leads us to address the inferior performance observed in ID tail-classes within existing OOD detection methods. Experiments over three benchmarks CIFAR10-LT, CIFAR100-LT, and ImageNet-LT demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches by a large margin in terms of FPR and tail-class ID classification accuracy.

Abstract: Deep neural networks used for human detection are highly vulnerable to adversarial manipulation, creating safety and privacy risks in real surveillance environments. Wearable attacks offer a realistic threat model, yet existing approaches usually optimize textures frame by frame and therefore fail to maintain concealment across long video sequences with motion, pose changes, and garment deformation. In this work, a sequence-level optimization framework is introduced to generate natural, printable adversarial textures for shirts, trousers, and hats that remain effective throughout entire walking videos in both digital and physical settings. Product images are first mapped to UV space and converted into a compact palette and control-point parameterization, with ICC locking to keep all colors printable. A physically based human-garment pipeline is then employed to simulate motion, multi-angle camera viewpoints, cloth dynamics, and illumination variation. An expectation-over-transformation objective with temporal weighting is used to optimize the control points so that detection confidence is minimized across whole sequences. Extensive experiments demonstrate strong and stable concealment, high robustness to viewpoint changes, and superior cross-model transferability. Physical garments produced with sublimation printing achieve reliable suppression under indoor and outdoor recordings, confirming real-world feasibility.

Result: 综合实验验证了该框架的有效性和最先进的性能表现。

Conclusion: MoR架构成功解决了密集Real-ISR模型的局限性，实现了灵活的知识重组和自适应计算资源分配。

Abstract: The demonstrated success of sparsely-gated Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures, exemplified by models such as DeepSeek and Grok, has motivated researchers to investigate their adaptation to diverse domains. In real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR), existing approaches mainly rely on fine-tuning pre-trained diffusion models through Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) module to reconstruct high-resolution (HR) images. However, these dense Real-ISR models are limited in their ability to adaptively capture the heterogeneous characteristics of complex real-world degraded samples or enable knowledge sharing between inputs under equivalent computational budgets. To address this, we investigate the integration of sparse MoE into Real-ISR and propose a Mixture-of-Ranks (MoR) architecture for single-step image super-resolution. We introduce a fine-grained expert partitioning strategy that treats each rank in LoRA as an independent expert. This design enables flexible knowledge recombination while isolating fixed-position ranks as shared experts to preserve common-sense features and minimize routing redundancy. Furthermore, we develop a degradation estimation module leveraging CLIP embeddings and predefined positive-negative text pairs to compute relative degradation scores, dynamically guiding expert activation. To better accommodate varying sample complexities, we incorporate zero-expert slots and propose a degradation-aware load-balancing loss, which dynamically adjusts the number of active experts based on degradation severity, ensuring optimal computational resource allocation. Comprehensive experiments validate our framework's effectiveness and state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Laser cutting is a widely adopted technology in material processing across various industries, but it generates a significant amount of dust, smoke, and aerosols during operation, posing a risk to both the environment and workers' health. Speckle sensing has emerged as a promising method to monitor the cutting process and identify material types in real-time. This paper proposes a material classification technique using a speckle pattern of the material's surface based on deep learning to monitor and control the laser cutting process. The proposed method involves training a convolutional neural network (CNN) on a dataset of laser speckle patterns to recognize distinct material types for safe and efficient cutting. Previous methods for material classification using speckle sensing may face issues when the color of the laser used to produce the speckle pattern is changed. Experiments conducted in this study demonstrate that the proposed method achieves high accuracy in material classification, even when the laser color is changed. The model achieved an accuracy of 98.30 % on the training set and 96.88% on the validation set. Furthermore, the model was evaluated on a set of 3000 new images for 30 different materials, achieving an F1-score of 0.9643. The proposed method provides a robust and accurate solution for material-aware laser cutting using speckle sensing.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged as an efficient, high-fidelity representation for real-time scene reconstruction and rendering. However, extending 3DGS to sparse-view settings remains challenging because of supervision scarcity and overfitting caused by limited viewpoint coverage. In this paper, we present CuriGS, a curriculum-guided framework for sparse-view 3D reconstruction using 3DGS. CuriGS addresses the core challenge of sparse-view synthesis by introducing student views: pseudo-views sampled around ground-truth poses (teacher). For each teacher, we generate multiple groups of student views with different perturbation levels. During training, we follow a curriculum schedule that gradually unlocks higher perturbation level, randomly sampling candidate students from the active level to assist training. Each sampled student is regularized via depth-correlation and co-regularization, and evaluated using a multi-signal metric that combines SSIM, LPIPS, and an image-quality measure. For every teacher and perturbation level, we periodically retain the best-performing students and promote those that satisfy a predefined quality threshold to the training set, resulting in a stable augmentation of sparse training views. Experimental results show that CuriGS outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both rendering fidelity and geometric consistency across various synthetic and real sparse-view scenes.

Abstract: Recent advances in plant phenotyping have driven widespread adoption of multi sensor platforms for collecting crop canopy reflectance data. This includes the collection of heterogeneous data across multiple platforms, with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) seeing significant usage due to their high performance in crop monitoring, forecasting, and prediction tasks. Similarly, satellite missions have been shown to be effective for agriculturally relevant tasks. In contrast to UAVs, such missions are bound to the limitation of spatial resolution, which hinders their effectiveness for modern farming systems focused on micro-plot management. In this work, we propose a cross modal learning strategy that enriches high-resolution satellite imagery with UAV level visual detail for crop canopy trait estimation. Using a dataset of approximately co registered satellite UAV image pairs collected from replicated plots of 84 hybrid maize varieties across five distinct locations in the U.S. Corn Belt, we train a model that learns fine grained spectral spatial correspondences between sensing modalities. Results show that the generated UAV-like representations from satellite inputs consistently outperform real satellite imagery on multiple downstream tasks, including yield and nitrogen prediction, demonstrating the potential of cross-modal correspondence learning to bridge the gap between satellite and UAV sensing in agricultural monitoring.

Abstract: Training a model for food recognition is challenging because the training samples, which are typically crawled from the Internet, are visually different from the pictures captured by users in the free-living environment. In addition to this domain-shift problem, the real-world food datasets tend to be long-tailed distributed and some dishes of different categories exhibit subtle variations that are difficult to distinguish visually. In this paper, we present a framework empowered with large language models (LLMs) to address these challenges in food recognition. We first leverage LLMs to parse food images to generate food titles and ingredients. Then, we project the generated texts and food images from different domains to a shared embedding space to maximize the pair similarities. Finally, we take the aligned features of both modalities for recognition. With this simple framework, we show that our proposed approach can outperform the existing approaches tailored for long-tailed data distribution, domain adaptation, and fine-grained classification, respectively, on two food datasets.

Conclusion: AMS-KV通过尺度自适应的KV缓存策略，有效解决了视觉自回归模型中下一尺度预测的KV内存瓶颈问题，显著提升了模型的可扩展性和计算效率。

Abstract: Visual autoregressive modeling (VAR) via next-scale prediction has emerged as a scalable image generation paradigm. While Key and Value (KV) caching in large language models (LLMs) has been extensively studied, next-scale prediction presents unique challenges, and KV caching design for next-scale based VAR transformers remains largely unexplored. A major bottleneck is the excessive KV memory growth with the increasing number of scales-severely limiting scalability. Our systematic investigation reveals that: (1) Attending to tokens from local scales significantly contributes to generation quality (2) Allocating a small amount of memory for the coarsest scales, termed as condensed scales, stabilizes multi-scale image generation (3) Strong KV similarity across finer scales is predominantly observed in cache-efficient layers, whereas cache-demanding layers exhibit weaker inter-scale similarity. Based on the observations, we introduce AMS-KV, a scale-adaptive KV caching policy for next-scale prediction in VAR models. AMS-KV prioritizes storing KVs from condensed and local scales, preserving the most relevant tokens to maintain generation quality. It further optimizes KV cache utilization and computational efficiency identifying cache-demanding layers through inter-scale similarity analysis. Compared to the vanilla next-scale prediction-based VAR models, AMS-KV reduces KV cache usage by up to 84.83% and self-attention latency by 60.48%. Moreover, when the baseline VAR-d30 model encounters out-of-memory failures at a batch size of 128, AMS-KV enables stable scaling to a batch size of 256 with improved throughput.

Abstract: Synthesizing high-fidelity and controllable 4D LiDAR data is crucial for creating scalable simulation environments for autonomous driving. This task is inherently challenging due to the sensor's unique spherical geometry, the temporal sparsity of point clouds, and the complexity of dynamic scenes. To address these challenges, we present LiSTAR, a novel generative world model that operates directly on the sensor's native geometry. LiSTAR introduces a Hybrid-Cylindrical-Spherical (HCS) representation to preserve data fidelity by mitigating quantization artifacts common in Cartesian grids. To capture complex dynamics from sparse temporal data, it utilizes a Spatio-Temporal Attention with Ray-Centric Transformer (START) that explicitly models feature evolution along individual sensor rays for robust temporal coherence. Furthermore, for controllable synthesis, we propose a novel 4D point cloud-aligned voxel layout for conditioning and a corresponding discrete Masked Generative START (MaskSTART) framework, which learns a compact, tokenized representation of the scene, enabling efficient, high-resolution, and layout-guided compositional generation. Comprehensive experiments validate LiSTAR's state-of-the-art performance across 4D LiDAR reconstruction, prediction, and conditional generation, with substantial quantitative gains: reducing generation MMD by a massive 76%, improving reconstruction IoU by 32%, and lowering prediction L1 Med by 50%. This level of performance provides a powerful new foundation for creating realistic and controllable autonomous systems simulations. Project link: https://ocean-luna.github.io/LiSTAR.gitub.io.

Conclusion: SpectralTrain证明了训练策略优化是HSI模型中架构设计的有效补充，为实际部署提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification typically involves large-scale data and computationally intensive training, which limits the practical deployment of deep learning models in real-world remote sensing tasks. This study introduces SpectralTrain, a universal, architecture-agnostic training framework that enhances learning efficiency by integrating curriculum learning (CL) with principal component analysis (PCA)-based spectral downsampling. By gradually introducing spectral complexity while preserving essential information, SpectralTrain enables efficient learning of spectral -- spatial patterns at significantly reduced computational costs. The framework is independent of specific architectures, optimizers, or loss functions and is compatible with both classical and state-of-the-art (SOTA) models. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets -- Indian Pines, Salinas-A, and the newly introduced CloudPatch-7 -- demonstrate strong generalization across spatial scales, spectral characteristics, and application domains. The results indicate consistent reductions in training time by 2-7x speedups with small-to-moderate accuracy deltas depending on backbone. Its application to cloud classification further reveals potential in climate-related remote sensing, emphasizing training strategy optimization as an effective complement to architectural design in HSI models.

Abstract: In large language models (LLM), in-context learning (ICL) refers to performing new tasks by conditioning on small demonstrations provided in the input context. Recent advances in visual in-context learning (VICL) demonstrate promising capabilities for solving downstream tasks by unified vision-language models (VLMs). When the visual prompt and the target images originate from different visual tasks, can VLMs still enable VICL? In the paper, we propose a fully collaborative pipeline, i.e. T2T-VICL, for VLMs to investigate the potential of cross-task VICL. Fundamentally, we design a mechanism to generate and select text prompts that best implicitly describe the differences between two distinct low-level vision tasks, and construct the first cross-task VICL dataset. Building upon this, we propose a novel inference framework that combines perceptual score-based reasoning with traditional evaluation metrics to perform cross-task VICL. Our approach achieves top-tier results across nine cross-task scenarios and second-tier performance in ten additional scenarios, unlocking the boundaries of cross-task VICL within VLMs.

Abstract: Existing 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) methods struggle to accurately reconstruct dynamic scenes, often failing to resolve ambiguous pixel correspondences and inadequate densification in dynamic regions. We address these issues by introducing a novel method composed of two key components: (1) Elliptical Error Clustering and Error Correcting Splat Addition that pinpoints dynamic areas to improve and initialize fitting splats, and (2) Grouped 4D Gaussian Splatting that improves consistency of mapping between splats and represented dynamic objects. Specifically, we classify rendering errors into missing-color and occlusion types, then apply targeted corrections via backprojection or foreground splitting guided by cross-view color consistency. Evaluations on Neural 3D Video and Technicolor datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly improves temporal consistency and achieves state-of-the-art perceptual rendering quality, improving 0.39dB of PSNR on the Technicolor Light Field dataset. Our visualization shows improved alignment between splats and dynamic objects, and the error correction method's capability to identify errors and properly initialize new splats.

TL;DR: DCS-LDM提出了一种新的视觉生成范式，将信息复杂度与尺度解耦，构建了层次化、尺度无关的潜在空间，支持在固定潜在表示下解码到任意分辨率和帧率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有潜在扩散模型通常将尺度与内容复杂度耦合，使用更多潜在token来表示更高分辨率的图像或更高帧率的视频。然而，表示视觉数据所需的潜在容量主要取决于内容复杂度，而尺度仅作为上限。

Method: 构建层次化、尺度无关的潜在空间，通过多级token建模样本复杂度，支持在固定潜在表示下解码到任意分辨率和帧率，实现渐进式从粗到细的生成范式。

Result: 实验结果显示DCS-LDM在提供跨不同尺度和视觉质量的灵活生成的同时，实现了与最先进方法相当的性能。

Conclusion: DCS-LDM通过解耦信息复杂度与尺度，实现了灵活的计算-质量权衡，支持多尺度和多视觉质量的生成。

Abstract: Existing latent diffusion models typically couple scale with content complexity, using more latent tokens to represent higher-resolution images or higher-frame rate videos. However, the latent capacity required to represent visual data primarily depends on content complexity, with scale serving only as an upper bound. Motivated by this observation, we propose DCS-LDM, a novel paradigm for visual generation that decouples information complexity from scale. DCS-LDM constructs a hierarchical, scale-independent latent space that models sample complexity through multi-level tokens and supports decoding to arbitrary resolutions and frame rates within a fixed latent representation. This latent space enables DCS-LDM to achieve a flexible computation-quality tradeoff. Furthermore, by decomposing structural and detailed information across levels, DCS-LDM supports a progressive coarse-to-fine generation paradigm. Experimental results show that DCS-LDM delivers performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods while offering flexible generation across diverse scales and visual qualities.

*Chenyang Wu,Jiayi Fu,Chun-Le Guo,Shuhao Han,Chongyi Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VTinker提出了一种新的视频帧插值方法，通过引导流上采样和纹理映射来解决高分辨率帧插值中的模糊、马赛克和重影问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视频帧插值方法在低分辨率估计双向光流后使用上采样获取高分辨率光流，这会导致边缘模糊和马赛克，且无法充分捕捉高分辨率下的精细像素运动，导致任务导向光流不对齐，最终产生重影和不连续问题。

Method: VTinker包含两个核心组件：引导流上采样(GFU)和纹理映射。GFU使用输入帧作为引导来减轻双线性上采样光流的模糊细节，使光流边缘更清晰。纹理映射生成中间代理帧，作为从输入帧选择清晰纹理块的线索，然后通过重建模块将这些纹理块映射到代理帧上生成最终插值帧。

Result: 大量实验表明VTinker在视频帧插值任务中达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: VTinker通过引导流上采样和纹理映射有效解决了高分辨率视频帧插值中的模糊、重影和不连续问题，实现了优异的插值效果。

Abstract: Due to large pixel movement and high computational cost, estimating the motion of high-resolution frames is challenging. Thus, most flow-based Video Frame Interpolation (VFI) methods first predict bidirectional flows at low resolution and then use high-magnification upsampling (e.g., bilinear) to obtain the high-resolution ones. However, this kind of upsampling strategy may cause blur or mosaic at the flows' edges. Additionally, the motion of fine pixels at high resolution cannot be adequately captured in motion estimation at low resolution, which leads to the misalignment of task-oriented flows. With such inaccurate flows, input frames are warped and combined pixel-by-pixel, resulting in ghosting and discontinuities in the interpolated frame. In this study, we propose a novel VFI pipeline, VTinker, which consists of two core components: guided flow upsampling (GFU) and Texture Mapping. After motion estimation at low resolution, GFU introduces input frames as guidance to alleviate the blurring details in bilinear upsampling flows, which makes flows' edges clearer. Subsequently, to avoid pixel-level ghosting and discontinuities, Texture Mapping generates an initial interpolated frame, referred to as the intermediate proxy. The proxy serves as a cue for selecting clear texture blocks from the input frames, which are then mapped onto the proxy to facilitate producing the final interpolated frame via a reconstruction module. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VTinker achieves state-of-the-art performance in VFI. Codes are available at: https://github.com/Wucy0519/VTinker.

TL;DR: PiN-CLIP方法通过在特征空间中注入正激励噪声来抑制虚假捷径，增强AI生成图像检测的泛化能力，在42种生成模型的数据集上达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成模型快速发展使得真假图像难以区分，现有AI生成图像检测方法在分布外泛化方面存在挑战，主要原因是训练时利用了虚假捷径。

Method: 提出PiN-CLIP方法，通过变分正激励原则联合训练噪声生成器和检测网络，在特征空间中构建正激励噪声，抑制捷径敏感方向，放大稳定取证线索。

Result: 在包含42种不同生成模型的合成图像开放世界数据集上，该方法实现了新的SOTA性能，平均准确率比现有方法提高5.4个百分点。

Conclusion: PiN-CLIP通过特征空间噪声注入有效解决了AI生成图像检测的泛化问题，为更鲁棒的取证表示提取提供了可行方案。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative models has made real and synthetic images increasingly indistinguishable. Although extensive efforts have been devoted to detecting AI-generated images, out-of-distribution generalization remains a persistent challenge. We trace this weakness to spurious shortcuts exploited during training and we also observe that small feature-space perturbations can mitigate shortcut dominance. To address this problem in a more controllable manner, we propose the Positive-Incentive Noise for CLIP (PiN-CLIP), which jointly trains a noise generator and a detection network under a variational positive-incentive principle. Specifically, we construct positive-incentive noise in the feature space via cross-attention fusion of visual and categorical semantic features. During optimization, the noise is injected into the feature space to fine-tune the visual encoder, suppressing shortcut-sensitive directions while amplifying stable forensic cues, thereby enabling the extraction of more robust and generalized artifact representations. Comparative experiments are conducted on an open-world dataset comprising synthetic images generated by 42 distinct generative models. Our method achieves new state-of-the-art performance, with notable improvements of 5.4 in average accuracy over existing approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于压缩视频质量增强的预训练退化表示学习模块和分层终止机制，解决了现有方法在QP未知时性能下降和计算资源浪费的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中量化参数(QP)可能部分或完全未知，限制了现有依赖已知QP的非盲方法的适用性，需要开发盲QECV技术。同时现有方法忽略了不同压缩级别对计算需求的差异。

Method: 使用预训练的退化表示学习(DRL)模块从视频内容中解耦和提取高维多尺度退化表示来指导伪影去除，并引入分层终止机制根据压缩级别动态调整伪影减少阶段的数量。

Result: 在QP=22时，PSNR从0.31dB提升到0.65dB，相比现有最佳盲方法提升了110%。分层终止机制在QP=22时平均推理时间比QP=42减少一半。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法在盲压缩视频质量增强方面取得了显著性能提升，同时通过自适应计算机制提高了效率。

Abstract: Existing studies on Quality Enhancement for Compressed Video (QECV) predominantly rely on known Quantization Parameters (QPs), employing distinct enhancement models per QP setting, termed non-blind methods. However, in real-world scenarios involving transcoding or transmission, QPs may be partially or entirely unknown, limiting the applicability of such approaches and motivating the development of blind QECV techniques. Current blind methods generate degradation vectors via classification models with cross-entropy loss, using them as channel attention to guide artifact removal. However, these vectors capture only global degradation information and lack spatial details, hindering adaptation to varying artifact patterns at different spatial positions. To address these limitations, we propose a pretrained Degradation Representation Learning (DRL) module that decouples and extracts high-dimensional, multiscale degradation representations from video content to guide the artifact removal. Additionally, both blind and non-blind methods typically employ uniform architectures across QPs, hence, overlooking the varying computational demands inherent to different compression levels. We thus introduce a hierarchical termination mechanism that dynamically adjusts the number of artifact reduction stages based on the compression level. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly enhances performance, achieving a PSNR improvement of 110% (from 0.31 dB to 0.65 dB) over a competing state-of-the-art blind method at QP = 22. Furthermore, the proposed hierarchical termination mechanism reduces the average inference time at QP = 22 by half compared to QP = 42.

TL;DR: 本文引入了一个新的多模态交互欺骗评估任务(MIDA)，发现当前最先进的多模态大语言模型在检测复杂社交互动中的欺骗行为方面存在显著缺陷，并提出了Social Chain-of-Thought推理管道和动态社交认知记忆模块来改进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管多模态大语言模型具有先进的推理能力，但缺乏人类智能的核心组成部分：在复杂社交互动中'读懂房间'和评估欺骗的能力。

Method: 创建了MIDA任务和包含同步视频文本的多模态数据集，评估了12个最先进的开源和闭源MLLM，并设计了Social Chain-of-Thought推理管道和动态社交认知记忆模块。

Result: 基准测试显示显著的性能差距，即使是GPT-4o等强大模型也难以可靠地区分真假。提出的框架在该挑战性任务上取得了性能提升。

Conclusion: 当前模型无法有效将语言与多模态社交线索相结合，缺乏建模他人知识、信念或意图的能力，需要新方法来构建更具洞察力和可信度的AI系统。

Abstract: Despite their advanced reasoning capabilities, state-of-the-art Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrably lack a core component of human intelligence: the ability to `read the room' and assess deception in complex social interactions. To rigorously quantify this failure, we introduce a new task, Multimodal Interactive Deception Assessment (MIDA), and present a novel multimodal dataset providing synchronized video and text with verifiable ground-truth labels for every statement. We establish a comprehensive benchmark evaluating 12 state-of-the-art open- and closed-source MLLMs, revealing a significant performance gap: even powerful models like GPT-4o struggle to distinguish truth from falsehood reliably. Our analysis of failure modes indicates that these models fail to effectively ground language in multimodal social cues and lack the ability to model what others know, believe, or intend, highlighting the urgent need for novel approaches to building more perceptive and trustworthy AI systems. To take a step forward, we design a Social Chain-of-Thought (SoCoT) reasoning pipeline and a Dynamic Social Epistemic Memory (DSEM) module. Our framework yields performance improvement on this challenging task, demonstrating a promising new path toward building MLLMs capable of genuine human-like social reasoning.

Conclusion: SR3D框架通过解决训练-推理不一致性问题，显著提升了室内点云3D目标检测的性能，同时保持了实时处理能力。

Abstract: Real-time 3D object detection from point clouds is essential for dynamic scene understanding in applications such as augmented reality, robotics and navigation. We introduce a novel Spatial-prioritized and Rank-aware 3D object detection (SR3D) framework for indoor point clouds, to bridge the gap between how detectors are trained and how they are evaluated. This gap stems from the lack of spatial reliability and ranking awareness during training, which conflicts with the ranking-based prediction selection used as inference. Such a training-inference gap hampers the model's ability to learn representations aligned with inference-time behavior. To address the limitation, SR3D consists of two components tailored to the spatial nature of point clouds during training: a novel spatial-prioritized optimal transport assignment that dynamically emphasizes well-located and spatially reliable samples, and a rank-aware adaptive self-distillation scheme that adaptively injects ranking perception via a self-distillation paradigm. Extensive experiments on ScanNet V2 and SUN RGB-D show that SR3D effectively bridges the training-inference gap and significantly outperforms prior methods in accuracy while maintaining real-time speed.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有高空间分辨率水体变化检测数据集稀缺，且现有深度学习方法未能充分利用深度特征中的空间语义和结构信息。

Method: 设计SSCP注意力模块，包含多语义空间注意力(MSA)、结构关系感知全局注意力(SRGA)和通道自注意力(CSA)三个组件，可即插即用地集成到现有WBCD模型中。

Conclusion: 提出的HSRW-CD数据集和SSCP模块显著提升了水体变化检测的性能，为城市和乡村区域的水体监测提供了更精确的定位能力。

Abstract: Remote sensing Water Body Change Detection (WBCD) aims to detect water body surface changes from bi-temporal images of the same geographic area. Recently, the scarcity of high spatial resolution datasets for WBCD restricts its application in urban and rural regions, which require more accurate positioning. Meanwhile, previous deep learning-based methods fail to comprehensively exploit the spatial semantic and structural information in deep features in the change detection networks. To resolve these concerns, we first propose a new dataset, HSRW-CD, with a spatial resolution higher than 3 meters for WBCD. Specifically, it contains a large number of image pairs, widely covering various water body types. Besides, a Spatial Semantics and Continuity Perception (SSCP) attention module is designed to fully leverage both the spatial semantics and structure of deep features in the WBCD networks, significantly improving the discrimination capability for water body. The proposed SSCP has three components: the Multi-Semantic spatial Attention (MSA), the Structural Relation-aware Global Attention (SRGA), and the Channel-wise Self-Attention (CSA). The MSA enhances the spatial semantics of water body features and provides precise spatial semantic priors for the CSA. Then, the SRGA further extracts spatial structure to learn the spatial continuity of the water body. Finally, the CSA utilizes the spatial semantic and structural priors from the MSA and SRGA to compute the similarity across channels. Specifically designed as a plug-and-play module for water body deep features, the proposed SSCP allows integration into existing WBCD models. Numerous experiments conducted on the proposed HSRW-CD and Water-CD datasets validate the effectiveness and generalization of the SSCP. The code of this work and the HSRW-CD dataset will be accessed at https://github.com/QingMa1/SSCP.

Motivation: 现有的3DGS SLAM系统缺乏开放词汇语义理解能力，而存储高维语言特征需要过多内存和渲染开销，静态模型方法对未见环境缺乏适应性。

Method: 使用场景自适应编码器-解码器将高维语言嵌入压缩到16维特征空间；采用语言引导的剪枝策略识别语义冗余；利用映射特征进行语言基础的闭环检测。

Result: 将每个高斯的存储需求减少，渲染速度提升，实现实时性能（15 FPS）；高斯数量减少超过60%同时保持渲染质量；在映射质量和跟踪精度方面表现有竞争力。

Conclusion: LEGO-SLAM成功实现了实时开放词汇语义映射，解决了3DGS SLAM中的语义理解挑战，为高级机器人交互提供了基础。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have enabled Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) systems to build photorealistic maps. However, these maps lack the open-vocabulary semantic understanding required for advanced robotic interaction. Integrating language features into SLAM remains a significant challenge, as storing high-dimensional features demands excessive memory and rendering overhead, while existing methods with static models lack adaptability for novel environments. To address these limitations, we propose LEGO-SLAM (Language-Embedded Gaussian Optimization SLAM), the first framework to achieve real-time, open-vocabulary mapping within a 3DGS-based SLAM system. At the core of our method is a scene-adaptive encoder-decoder that distills high-dimensional language embeddings into a compact 16-dimensional feature space. This design reduces the memory per Gaussian and accelerates rendering, enabling real-time performance. Unlike static approaches, our encoder adapts online to unseen scenes. These compact features also enable a language-guided pruning strategy that identifies semantic redundancy, reducing the map's Gaussian count by over 60\% while maintaining rendering quality. Furthermore, we introduce a language-based loop detection approach that reuses these mapping features, eliminating the need for a separate detection model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LEGO-SLAM achieves competitive mapping quality and tracking accuracy, all while providing open-vocabulary capabilities at 15 FPS.

Motivation: 现有的多模态嵌入方法将嵌入提取视为直接编码步骤，忽视了多模态大语言模型具备的生成推理能力，这种能力可以用来增强表示质量。

Method: RGE方法首先让模型根据指令执行结构化推理生成，然后在推理展开后提取表示，将生成推理过程与对比训练耦合。

Result: 在MMEB基准测试中，推理引导的条件化使多模态检索性能比非推理基线提高了4.9%。

Conclusion: 显式推理能有效增强嵌入质量，推理引导的嵌入方法在多模态表示学习中具有显著优势。

Abstract: Multimodal embeddings are widely used in downstream tasks such as multimodal retrieval, enabling alignment of interleaved modalities in a shared representation space. While recent studies show that Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) can serve as strong embedding extractors, existing approaches treat embedding extraction as a direct encoding step, overlooking the fact that MLLMs possess the generative capability for reasoning that could be leveraged to enhance representation quality. In this work, we explore how to explicitly incorporate reasoning into the embedding process. To this end, we propose Reasoning Guided Embeddings (RGE), which preserves the generative rationale process of MLLMs and couples it with contrastive training. Our method first enables the model to perform structured rationale generation conditioned on the instruction, and then extracts representations after reasoning has unfolded. This simple design enhances the context-conditional inference signals within the embedding, leading to improved multimodal representation quality. Experiments on the MMEB benchmark show that reasoning-guided conditioning improves multimodal retrieval performance by 4.9% over the non-reasoning baseline, confirming that explicit reasoning can effectively enhance embedding quality.

Conclusion: 这项工作代表了开发、解释和压缩混合Mamba-Transformer架构的初步步骤，为混合模型可解释性提供了新见解。

Abstract: We introduce TimeViper, a hybrid vision-language model designed to tackle challenges of long video understanding. Processing long videos demands both an efficient model architecture and an effective mechanism for handling extended temporal contexts. To this end, TimeViper adopts a hybrid Mamba-Transformer backbone that combines the efficiency of state-space models with the expressivity of attention mechanisms. Through this hybrid design, we reveal the vision-to-text information aggregation phenomenon, where information progressively flows from vision tokens to text tokens across increasing LLM depth, resulting in severe vision token redundancy. Motivated by this observation, we propose TransV, a token information transfer module that transfers and compresses vision tokens into instruction tokens while maintaining multimodal understanding capabilities. This design enables TimeViper to process hour-long videos exceeding 10,000 frames. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that TimeViper competes with state-of-the-art models while extending frame numbers. We further analyze attention behaviors of both Mamba and Transformer layers, offering new insights into hybrid model interpretability. This work represents an initial step towards developing, interpreting, and compressing hybrid Mamba-Transformer architectures.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have shown exceptional performance in image generation, yet their large parameter counts incur high computational costs, impeding deployment in resource-constrained settings. To address this, we propose Pluggable Pruning with Contiguous Layer Distillation (PPCL), a flexible structured pruning framework specifically designed for DiT architectures. First, we identify redundant layer intervals through a linear probing mechanism combined with the first-order differential trend analysis of similarity metrics. Subsequently, we propose a plug-and-play teacher-student alternating distillation scheme tailored to integrate depth-wise and width-wise pruning within a single training phase. This distillation framework enables flexible knowledge transfer across diverse pruning ratios, eliminating the need for per-configuration retraining. Extensive experiments on multiple Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformer architecture models demonstrate that PPCL achieves a 50\% reduction in parameter count compared to the full model, with less than 3\% degradation in key objective metrics. Notably, our method maintains high-quality image generation capabilities while achieving higher compression ratios, rendering it well-suited for resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Survival analysis is critical for cancer prognosis and treatment planning, yet existing methods lack the transparency essential for clinical adoption. While recent pathology agents have demonstrated explainability in diagnostic tasks, they face three limitations for survival prediction: inability to integrate multimodal data, ineffective region-of-interest exploration, and failure to leverage experiential learning from historical cases. We introduce SurvAgent, the first hierarchical chain-of-thought (CoT)-enhanced multi-agent system for multimodal survival prediction. SurvAgent consists of two stages: (1) WSI-Gene CoT-Enhanced Case Bank Construction employs hierarchical analysis through Low-Magnification Screening, Cross-Modal Similarity-Aware Patch Mining, and Confidence-Aware Patch Mining for pathology images, while Gene-Stratified analysis processes six functional gene categories. Both generate structured reports with CoT reasoning, storing complete analytical processes for experiential learning. (2) Dichotomy-Based Multi-Expert Agent Inference retrieves similar cases via RAG and integrates multimodal reports with expert predictions through progressive interval refinement. Extensive experiments on five TCGA cohorts demonstrate SurvAgent's superority over conventional methods, proprietary MLLMs, and medical agents, establishing a new paradigm for explainable AI-driven survival prediction in precision oncology.

Abstract: Spatial intelligence is a critical frontier for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), empowering them to comprehend the physical world. Drawing inspiration from human perception mechanisms, existing studies attempt to construct a coherent spatial understanding via grid-based cognitive maps from multi-frame visual inputs. However, current grid-based map methods rely on discretized raster representations, which limit the model's ability in fine-grained spatial reasoning. To overcome this limitation, we propose Video2Layout, a framework for reconstructing metric-grounded spatial layouts from video. The framework employs continuous object boundary coordinates to quantify inter-object physical distances and object size. This empowers the model with quantitative spatial computation capabilities, effectively alleviating the inherent ambiguity when describing spatial relationships in natural language. Specifically, our method comprises two core stages. First, in supervised fine-tuning stage, we construct a high-quality dataset from the AI2THOR simulator, which enables the model to learn the mapping from visual inputs to precise boundary coordinates. Subsequently, a reinforcement fine-tuning stage further enhances the model's real-world generalization capabilities. To systematically evaluate the correlation between cognitive map accuracy and image quantity, as well as how the quantity of image inputs affects spatial reasoning accuracy, we introduce QVS-Bench, a diagnostic benchmark designed to analyze the relevant mechanisms. Evaluated on QVS-Bench and mainstream spatial reasoning benchmarks, our model, V2LO-7B achieves an average improvement of 4.92% over the model trained on grid maps, validating the superiority of our method. Our code is available at https://github.com/ybrrraway/Video2Layout.

Result: 动态交互产生了更具上下文感知和语义丰富的视觉输出。

Conclusion: 这项工作为通过交织文本推理增强视觉生成的研究提供了启发。

Abstract: Recent advances in visual generation have increasingly explored the integration of reasoning capabilities. They incorporate textual reasoning, i.e., think, either before (as pre-planning) or after (as post-refinement) the generation process, yet they lack on-the-fly multimodal interaction during the generation itself. In this preliminary study, we introduce Thinking-while-Generating (TwiG), the first interleaved framework that enables co-evolving textual reasoning throughout the visual generation process. As visual content is progressively generating, textual reasoning is interleaved to both guide upcoming local regions and reflect on previously synthesized ones. This dynamic interplay produces more context-aware and semantically rich visual outputs. To unveil the potential of this framework, we investigate three candidate strategies, zero-shot prompting, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on our curated TwiG-50K dataset, and reinforcement learning (RL) via a customized TwiG-GRPO strategy, each offering unique insights into the dynamics of interleaved reasoning. We hope this work inspires further research into interleaving textual reasoning for enhanced visual generation. Code will be released at: https://github.com/ZiyuGuo99/Thinking-while-Generating.

Conclusion: Simba通过分布学习框架有效解决了点云补全中的过拟合和噪声敏感问题，实现了更好的细节保留和结构完整性。

Abstract: Point cloud completion is a fundamental task in 3D vision. A persistent challenge in this field is simultaneously preserving fine-grained details present in the input while ensuring the global structural integrity of the completed shape. While recent works leveraging local symmetry transformations via direct regression have significantly improved the preservation of geometric structure details, these methods suffer from two major limitations: (1) These regression-based methods are prone to overfitting which tend to memorize instant-specific transformations instead of learning a generalizable geometric prior. (2) Their reliance on point-wise transformation regression lead to high sensitivity to input noise, severely degrading their robustness and generalization. To address these challenges, we introduce Simba, a novel framework that reformulates point-wise transformation regression as a distribution learning problem. Our approach integrates symmetry priors with the powerful generative capabilities of diffusion models, avoiding instance-specific memorization while capturing robust geometric structures. Additionally, we introduce a hierarchical Mamba-based architecture to achieve high-fidelity upsampling. Extensive experiments across the PCN, ShapeNet, and KITTI benchmarks validate our method's state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.

TL;DR: 提出了LNG-SWR方法，通过层间噪声引导的选择性小波重建来提升医学图像分割模型的鲁棒性，无需牺牲干净样本精度，且可与对抗训练结合获得额外增益。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割模型在临床部署中需要保持对分布偏移和扰动的稳定性。对抗训练虽然能提高鲁棒性，但存在干净-鲁棒性权衡和高训练成本的问题，限制了在医学影像中的可扩展性和可维护性。

Method: 在训练时向多个层注入小幅度零均值噪声，学习频率偏置先验；然后应用先验引导的选择性小波重建进行频率自适应：抑制噪声敏感频带，增强方向性结构和形状线索，稳定边界响应，同时保持频谱一致性。

Result: 在CT和超声数据集上，在PGD-L∞/L2和SSAH攻击下，LNG-SWR在干净Dice/IoU上获得一致提升，显著减少强攻击下的性能下降；与对抗训练结合可获得额外增益。

Conclusion: LNG-SWR为医学图像分割提供了一条简单、有效且工程友好的鲁棒性提升路径，适用于对抗训练和标准训练两种模式。

Abstract: Clinical deployment requires segmentation models to stay stable under distribution shifts and perturbations. The mainstream solution is adversarial training (AT) to improve robustness; however, AT often brings a clean--robustness trade-off and high training/tuning cost, which limits scalability and maintainability in medical imaging. We propose \emph{Layer-wise Noise-Guided Selective Wavelet Reconstruction (LNG-SWR)}. During training, we inject small, zero-mean noise at multiple layers to learn a frequency-bias prior that steers representations away from noise-sensitive directions. We then apply prior-guided selective wavelet reconstruction on the input/feature branch to achieve frequency adaptation: suppress noise-sensitive bands, enhance directional structures and shape cues, and stabilize boundary responses while maintaining spectral consistency. The framework is backbone-agnostic and adds low additional inference overhead. It can serve as a plug-in enhancement to AT and also improves robustness without AT. On CT and ultrasound datasets, under a unified protocol with PGD-$L_{\infty}/L_{2}$ and SSAH, LNG-SWR delivers consistent gains on clean Dice/IoU and significantly reduces the performance drop under strong attacks; combining LNG-SWR with AT yields additive gains. When combined with adversarial training, robustness improves further without sacrificing clean accuracy, indicating an engineering-friendly and scalable path to robust segmentation. These results indicate that LNG-SWR provides a simple, effective, and engineering-friendly path to robust medical image segmentation in both adversarial and standard training regimes.

Method: 采用两阶段框架：1) 对抗性提示搜索，使用强化学习策略自动识别能诱导LLM组件产生冗长输出的对抗性提示；2) 视觉对齐扰动优化，在输入图像上制作对抗性示例，最大化扰动图像视觉嵌入与对抗性提示嵌入之间的相似性。

Conclusion: 提出的VTIA方法能够有效诱导视觉语言模型产生冗长输出，解决了现有方法在稳定性和可控性方面的局限性。

Abstract: With the remarkable success of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on multimodal tasks, concerns regarding their deployment efficiency have become increasingly prominent. In particular, the number of tokens consumed during the generation process has emerged as a key evaluation metric.Prior studies have shown that specific inputs can induce VLMs to generate lengthy outputs with low information density, which significantly increases energy consumption, latency, and token costs. However, existing methods simply delay the occurrence of the EOS token to implicitly prolong output, and fail to directly maximize the output token length as an explicit optimization objective, lacking stability and controllability.To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel verbose-text induction attack (VTIA) to inject imperceptible adversarial perturbations into benign images via a two-stage framework, which identifies the most malicious prompt embeddings for optimizing and maximizing the output token of the perturbed images.Specifically, we first perform adversarial prompt search, employing reinforcement learning strategies to automatically identify adversarial prompts capable of inducing the LLM component within VLMs to produce verbose outputs. We then conduct vision-aligned perturbation optimization to craft adversarial examples on input images, maximizing the similarity between the perturbed image's visual embeddings and those of the adversarial prompt, thereby constructing malicious images that trigger verbose text generation. Comprehensive experiments on four popular VLMs demonstrate that our method achieves significant advantages in terms of effectiveness, efficiency, and generalization capability.

TL;DR: EvoVLA是一个自监督的视觉语言动作框架，通过阶段对齐奖励、基于姿态的对象探索和长视野记忆三个组件，解决了VLA模型在长视野机器人操作中的阶段幻觉问题，在仿真和真实世界中都取得了显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前VLA模型存在阶段幻觉问题，即代理利用粗糙评估信号来走捷径完成多步骤任务，报告高进度但未真正完成任务。这阻碍了长视野机器人操作的发展。

Method: 1. 阶段对齐奖励(SAR)：使用三元组对比学习和Gemini生成的困难负样本来防止视觉捷径
2. 基于姿态的对象探索(POE)：基于相对对象-夹爪姿态而非原始像素来建立好奇心
3. 长视野记忆：使用选择性上下文保留和门控融合来稳定扩展回合中的内在塑造

Conclusion: EvoVLA通过创新的自监督框架有效解决了VLA模型中的阶段幻觉问题，实现了更好的长视野操作性能和仿真到真实世界的有效迁移。

Abstract: Long-horizon robotic manipulation remains challenging for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models despite recent progress in zero-shot generalization and simulation-to-real-world transfer. Current VLA models suffer from stage hallucination, where agents exploit coarse evaluation signals to shortcut multi-step tasks, reporting high progress without truly completing them. We present EvoVLA, a self-supervised VLA framework that addresses this issue through three complementary components: Stage-Aligned Reward (SAR), which uses triplet contrastive learning with Gemini-generated hard negatives to prevent visual shortcuts; Pose-Based Object Exploration (POE), which grounds curiosity in relative object-gripper pose instead of raw pixels; and Long-Horizon Memory, which uses selective context retention and gated fusion to stabilize intrinsic shaping during extended rollouts. Extensive evaluations on Discoverse-L, a long-horizon manipulation benchmark with three multi-stage tasks, show that EvoVLA improves average task success by 10.2 percentage points over the strongest baseline (OpenVLA-OFT), reaching 69.2 percent. EvoVLA also achieves one-and-a-half times better sample efficiency and reduces stage hallucination from 38.5 percent to 14.8 percent. Real-world deployment on physical robots reaches an average success rate of 54.6 percent across four manipulation tasks, outperforming OpenVLA-OFT by 11 points, demonstrating effective sim-to-real transfer and strong generalization.

Motivation: 现有方法很少从可解释性机制角度研究CLIP在密集预测中的性能边界。作者发现CLIP存在类似人类分心的现象，将大量注意力资源从目标区域转移到无关token上。

Method: 提出RF-CLIP方法，通过过滤维度特异性过度激活产生的无关token，重新将注意力引导回目标区域，从而改进CLIP的多模态对齐粒度。该方法无需训练。

Conclusion: 通过模拟人类注意力重新聚焦行为，RF-CLIP能够有效提升CLIP在密集预测中的多模态对齐能力，为开放词汇语义分割提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) employs pixel-level vision-language alignment to associate category-related prompts with corresponding pixels. A key challenge is enhancing the multimodal dense prediction capability, specifically this pixel-level multimodal alignment. Although existing methods achieve promising results by leveraging CLIP's vision-language alignment, they rarely investigate the performance boundaries of CLIP for dense prediction from an interpretability mechanisms perspective. In this work, we systematically investigate CLIP's internal mechanisms and identify a critical phenomenon: analogous to human distraction, CLIP diverts significant attention resources from target regions to irrelevant tokens. Our analysis reveals that these tokens arise from dimension-specific over-activation; filtering them enhances CLIP's dense prediction performance. Consequently, we propose ReFocusing CLIP (RF-CLIP), a training-free approach that emulates human distraction-refocusing behavior to redirect attention from distraction tokens back to target regions, thereby refining CLIP's multimodal alignment granularity. Our method achieves SOTA performance on eight benchmarks while maintaining high inference efficiency.

Motivation: 现有的VLA模型在预测高维视觉状态时会分散模型容量并增加训练成本，而压缩视觉状态会导致信息瓶颈，同时缺乏语言监督会影响理解和推理能力。

Method: 提出解耦视觉预测(DVF)，使用元查询和扩散Transformer头将视觉预测从主干网络分离，通过残差连接提供当前视觉状态，使用简单的下一状态预测目标让元查询自动捕捉潜在动作。

Conclusion: Mantis通过解耦视觉预测有效提升了VLA模型的性能，同时保持了理解和推理能力，在多个任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models demonstrate that visual signals can effectively complement sparse action supervisions. However, letting VLA directly predict high-dimensional visual states can distribute model capacity and incur prohibitive training cost, while compressing visual states into more compact supervisory signals inevitably incurs information bottlenecks. Moreover, existing methods often suffer from poor comprehension and reasoning capabilities due to the neglect of language supervision. This paper introduces Mantis, a novel framework featuring a Disentangled Visual Foresight (DVF) to tackle these issues. Specifically, Mantis decouples visual foresight prediction from the backbone with the combination of meta queries and a diffusion Transformer (DiT) head. With the current visual state provided to the DiT via a residual connection, a simple next-state prediction objective enables the meta queries to automatically capture the latent actions that delineate the visual trajectory, and hence boost the learning of explicit actions. The disentanglement reduces the burden of the VLA backbone, enabling it to maintain comprehension and reasoning capabilities through language supervision. Empirically, pretrained on human manipulation videos, robot demonstrations, and image-text pairs, Mantis achieves a 96.7% success rate on LIBERO benchmark after fine-tuning, surpassing powerful baselines while exhibiting high convergence speed. Real-world evaluations show that Mantis outperforms $π_{0.5}$, a leading open-source VLA model, particularly in instruction-following capability, generalization to unseen instructions, and reasoning ability. Code and weights are released to support the open-source community.

Motivation: 现有VI-ReID算法在公共数据集表现良好，但在实际应用中因数据差异而效果不佳，需要解决无监督域自适应问题以将知识迁移到真实世界数据。

Method: 提出两阶段DSLGA模型：预训练阶段使用域共享学习策略(DSLS)缓解域间模态差异；微调阶段使用渐进对齐策略(GAS)通过聚类到整体对齐方式处理域内跨模态对齐挑战。

Result: 大量实验表明该方法显著优于现有的VI-ReID域自适应方法，甚至在某些设置下优于有监督方法。

Conclusion: DSLGA模型有效解决了UDA-VI-ReID中的跨域和跨模态差异问题，为实际应用提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Recently, Visible-Infrared person Re-Identification (VI-ReID) has achieved remarkable performance on public datasets. However, due to the discrepancies between public datasets and real-world data, most existing VI-ReID algorithms struggle in real-life applications. To address this, we take the initiative to investigate Unsupervised Domain Adaptation Visible-Infrared person Re-Identification (UDA-VI-ReID), aiming to transfer the knowledge learned from the public data to real-world data without compromising accuracy and requiring the annotation of new samples. Specifically, we first analyze two basic challenges in UDA-VI-ReID, i.e., inter-domain modality discrepancies and intra-domain modality discrepancies. Then, we design a novel two-stage model, i.e., Domain-Shared Learning and Gradual Alignment (DSLGA), to handle these discrepancies. In the first pre-training stage, DSLGA introduces a Domain-Shared Learning Strategy (DSLS) to mitigate ineffective pre-training caused by inter-domain modality discrepancies via exploiting shared information between the source and target domains. While, in the second fine-tuning stage, DSLGA designs a Gradual Alignment Strategy (GAS) to handle the cross-modality alignment challenges between visible and infrared data caused by the large intra-domain modality discrepancies through a cluster-to-holistic alignment way. Finally, a new UDA-VI-ReID testing method i.e., CMDA-XD, is constructed for training and testing different UDA-VI-ReID models. A large amount of experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing domain adaptation methods for VI-ReID and even some supervised methods under various settings.

Abstract: Human organs are composed of interconnected substructures whose geometry and spatial relationships constrain one another. Yet, most deep-learning approaches treat these parts independently, producing anatomically implausible reconstructions. We introduce PrIntMesh, a template-based, topology-preserving framework that reconstructs organs as unified systems. Starting from a connected template, PrIntMesh jointly deforms all substructures to match patient-specific anatomy, while explicitly preserving internal boundaries and enforcing smooth, artifact-free surfaces. We demonstrate its effectiveness on the heart, hippocampus, and lungs, achieving high geometric accuracy, correct topology, and robust performance even with limited or noisy training data. Compared to voxel- and surface-based methods, PrIntMesh better reconstructs shared interfaces, maintains structural consistency, and provides a data-efficient solution suitable for clinical use.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) have recently demonstrated remarkable progress in embodied environments, enabling robots to perceive, reason, and act through unified multimodal understanding. Despite their impressive capabilities, the adversarial robustness of these systems remains largely unexplored, especially under realistic multimodal and black-box conditions. Existing studies mainly focus on single-modality perturbations and overlook the cross-modal misalignment that fundamentally affects embodied reasoning and decision-making. In this paper, we introduce VLA-Fool, a comprehensive study of multimodal adversarial robustness in embodied VLA models under both white-box and black-box settings. VLA-Fool unifies three levels of multimodal adversarial attacks: (1) textual perturbations through gradient-based and prompt-based manipulations, (2) visual perturbations via patch and noise distortions, and (3) cross-modal misalignment attacks that intentionally disrupt the semantic correspondence between perception and instruction. We further incorporate a VLA-aware semantic space into linguistic prompts, developing the first automatically crafted and semantically guided prompting framework. Experiments on the LIBERO benchmark using a fine-tuned OpenVLA model reveal that even minor multimodal perturbations can cause significant behavioral deviations, demonstrating the fragility of embodied multimodal alignment.

Abstract: Unsupervised image classification, or image clustering, aims to group unlabeled images into semantically meaningful categories. Early methods integrated representation learning and clustering within an iterative framework. However, the rise of foundational models have recently shifted focus solely to clustering, bypassing the representation learning step. In this work, we build upon a recent multi-head clustering approach by introducing adaptive nearest neighbor selection and cluster ensembling strategies to improve clustering performance. Our method, "Image Clustering through Cluster Ensembles" (ICCE), begins with a clustering stage, where we train multiple clustering heads on a frozen backbone, producing diverse image clusterings. We then employ a cluster ensembling technique to consolidate these potentially conflicting results into a unified consensus clustering. Finally, we train an image classifier using the consensus clustering result as pseudo-labels. ICCE achieves state-of-the-art performance on ten image classification benchmarks, achieving 99.3% accuracy on CIFAR10, 89% on CIFAR100, and 70.4% on ImageNet datasets, narrowing the performance gap with supervised methods. To the best of our knowledge, ICCE is the first fully unsupervised image classification method to exceed 70% accuracy on ImageNet.

Conclusion: SwiTrack通过重新定义跨模态目标跟踪，部署专门化流来校准共享潜在空间特征，生成更鲁棒的跨模态表示，有效缓解目标漂移问题。

Abstract: Cross-modal object tracking (CMOT) is an emerging task that maintains target consistency while the video stream switches between different modalities, with only one modality available in each frame, mostly focusing on RGB-Near Infrared (RGB-NIR) tracking. Existing methods typically connect parallel RGB and NIR branches to a shared backbone, which limits the comprehensive extraction of distinctive modality-specific features and fails to address the issue of object drift, especially in the presence of unreliable inputs. In this paper, we propose SwiTrack, a novel state-switching framework that redefines CMOT through the deployment of three specialized streams. Specifically, RGB frames are processed by the visual encoder, while NIR frames undergo refinement via a NIR gated adapter coupled with the visual encoder to progressively calibrate shared latent space features, thereby yielding more robust cross-modal representations. For invalid modalities, a consistency trajectory prediction module leverages spatio-temporal cues to estimate target movement, ensuring robust tracking and mitigating drift. Additionally, we incorporate dynamic template reconstruction to iteratively update template features and employ a similarity alignment loss to reinforce feature consistency. Experimental results on the latest benchmarks demonstrate that our tracker achieves state-of-the-art performance, boosting precision rate and success rate gains by 7.2\% and 4.3\%, respectively, while maintaining real-time tracking at 65 frames per second.

Abstract: Realistic and smooth full-body tracking is crucial for immersive AR/VR applications. Existing systems primarily track head and hands via Head Mounted Devices (HMDs) and controllers, making the 3D full-body reconstruction in-complete. One potential approach is to generate the full-body motions from sparse inputs collected from limited sensors using a Neural Network (NN) model. In this paper, we propose a novel method based on a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) backbone that is enhanced with residual connections and a novel NN-component called Memory-Block. In particular, Memory-Block represents missing sensor data with trainable code-vectors, which are combined with the sparse signals from previous time instances to improve the temporal consistency. Furthermore, we formulate our solution as a multi-task learning problem, allowing our MLP-backbone to learn robust representations that boost accuracy. Our experiments show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by substantially reducing prediction errors. Moreover, it achieves 72 FPS on mobile HMDs that ultimately improves the accuracy-running time tradeoff.

Conclusion: TetraSDF提供了一个精确的解析网格化解决方案，能够从神经SDF中提取高质量网格，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Extracting meshes that exactly match the zero-level set of neural signed distance functions (SDFs) remains challenging. Sampling-based methods introduce discretization error, while continuous piecewise affine (CPWA) analytic approaches apply only to plain ReLU MLPs. We present TetraSDF, a precise analytic meshing framework for SDFs represented by a ReLU MLP composed with a multi-resolution tetrahedral positional encoder. The encoder's barycentric interpolation preserves global CPWA structure, enabling us to track ReLU linear regions within an encoder-induced polyhedral complex. A fixed analytic input preconditioner derived from the encoder's metric further reduces directional bias and stabilizes training. Across multiple benchmarks, TetraSDF matches or surpasses existing grid-based encoders in SDF reconstruction accuracy, and its analytic extractor produces highly self-consistent meshes that remain faithful to the learned isosurfaces, all with practical runtime and memory efficiency.

Abstract: We present a fast, spatio-temporal scene understanding framework based on Vision Gated Generative Transformers (VGGT). The proposed pipeline is designed to enable efficient, close to real-time performance, supporting applications including assistive navigation. To achieve continuous updates of the 3D scene representation, we process the image flow with a sliding window, aligning submaps, thereby overcoming VGGT's high memory demands. We exploit the VGGT tracking head to aggregate 2D semantic instance masks into 3D objects. To allow for temporal consistency and richer contextual reasoning the system stores timestamps and instance-level identities, thereby enabling the detection of changes in the environment. We evaluate the approach on well-known benchmarks and custom datasets specifically designed for assistive navigation scenarios. The results demonstrate the applicability of the framework to real-world scenarios.

Abstract: The task of weed detection is an essential element of precision agriculture since accurate species identification allows a farmer to selectively apply herbicides and fits into sustainable agriculture crop management. This paper proposes a hybrid deep learning framework recipe for weed detection that utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Vision Transformers (ViTs), and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to build robustness to multiple field conditions. A Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based augmentation method was imposed to balance class distributions and better generalize the model. Further, a self-supervised contrastive pre-training method helps to learn more features from limited annotated data. Experimental results yield superior results with 99.33% accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on multi-benchmark datasets. The proposed model architecture enables local, global, and relational feature representations and offers high interpretability and adaptability. Practically, the framework allows real-time, efficient deployment of edge devices for automated weed detecting, reducing over-reliance on herbicides and providing scalable, sustainable precision-farming options.

Motivation: 利用3DGS的高效性，结合移动设备部署的优势（数据隐私、离线操作、快速响应），开发适用于移动GPU的优化版本。

Method: 开发了针对2D纹理缓存优化的新型排序算法，改进了变量布局设计，并对3DGS算法的其他步骤进行了加速优化。

Conclusion: 该设计证明了在移动设备上进行高效3D场景重建的有效性，为移动端3D重建应用提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Image-based 3D scene reconstruction, which transforms multi-view images into a structured 3D representation of the surrounding environment, is a common task across many modern applications. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is a new paradigm to address this problem and offers considerable efficiency as compared to the previous methods. Motivated by this, and considering various benefits of mobile device deployment (data privacy, operating without internet connectivity, and potentially faster responses), this paper develops Texture3dgs, an optimized mapping of 3DGS for a mobile GPU. A critical challenge in this area turns out to be optimizing for the two-dimensional (2D) texture cache, which needs to be exploited for faster executions on mobile GPUs. As a sorting method dominates the computations in 3DGS on mobile platforms, the core of Texture3dgs is a novel sorting algorithm where the processing, data movement, and placement are highly optimized for 2D memory. The properties of this algorithm are analyzed in view of a cost model for the texture cache. In addition, we accelerate other steps of the 3DGS algorithm through improved variable layout design and other optimizations. End-to-end evaluation shows that Texture3dgs delivers up to 4.1$\times$ and 1.7$\times$ speedup for the sorting and overall 3D scene reconstruction, respectively -- while also reducing memory usage by up to 1.6$\times$ -- demonstrating the effectiveness of our design for efficient mobile 3D scene reconstruction.

Conclusion: Upsample Anything提供了一种高效、通用的特征上采样解决方案，无需训练即可实现精确的高分辨率重建，具有良好的可扩展性和跨模态泛化能力。

Abstract: We present \textbf{Upsample Anything}, a lightweight test-time optimization (TTO) framework that restores low-resolution features to high-resolution, pixel-wise outputs without any training. Although Vision Foundation Models demonstrate strong generalization across diverse downstream tasks, their representations are typically downsampled by 14x/16x (e.g., ViT), which limits their direct use in pixel-level applications. Existing feature upsampling approaches depend on dataset-specific retraining or heavy implicit optimization, restricting scalability and generalization. Upsample Anything addresses these issues through a simple per-image optimization that learns an anisotropic Gaussian kernel combining spatial and range cues, effectively bridging Gaussian Splatting and Joint Bilateral Upsampling. The learned kernel acts as a universal, edge-aware operator that transfers seamlessly across architectures and modalities, enabling precise high-resolution reconstruction of features, depth, or probability maps. It runs in only $\approx0.419 \text{s}$ per 224x224 image and achieves state-of-the-art performance on semantic segmentation, depth estimation, and both depth and probability map upsampling.

Conclusion: SAE可作为大规模跨模态主题分析的有效工具，SAE-TM框架为理解和使用SAE提供了新的理论视角和实用方法。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are used to analyze embeddings, but their role and practical value are debated. We propose a new perspective on SAEs by demonstrating that they can be naturally understood as topic models. We extend Latent Dirichlet Allocation to embedding spaces and derive the SAE objective as a maximum a posteriori estimator under this model. This view implies SAE features are thematic components rather than steerable directions. Based on this, we introduce SAE-TM, a topic modeling framework that: (1) trains an SAE to learn reusable topic atoms, (2) interprets them as word distributions on downstream data, and (3) merges them into any number of topics without retraining. SAE-TM yields more coherent topics than strong baselines on text and image datasets while maintaining diversity. Finally, we analyze thematic structure in image datasets and trace topic changes over time in Japanese woodblock prints. Our work positions SAEs as effective tools for large-scale thematic analysis across modalities. Code and data will be released upon publication.

Conclusion: NaTex通过原生3D纹理生成方法有效解决了传统2D多视图方法的局限性，在纹理生成质量和应用泛化方面取得了显著改进。

Abstract: We present NaTex, a native texture generation framework that predicts texture color directly in 3D space. In contrast to previous approaches that rely on baking 2D multi-view images synthesized by geometry-conditioned Multi-View Diffusion models (MVDs), NaTex avoids several inherent limitations of the MVD pipeline. These include difficulties in handling occluded regions that require inpainting, achieving precise mesh-texture alignment along boundaries, and maintaining cross-view consistency and coherence in both content and color intensity. NaTex features a novel paradigm that addresses the aforementioned issues by viewing texture as a dense color point cloud. Driven by this idea, we propose latent color diffusion, which comprises a geometry-awared color point cloud VAE and a multi-control diffusion transformer (DiT), entirely trained from scratch using 3D data, for texture reconstruction and generation. To enable precise alignment, we introduce native geometry control that conditions the DiT on direct 3D spatial information via positional embeddings and geometry latents. We co-design the VAE-DiT architecture, where the geometry latents are extracted via a dedicated geometry branch tightly coupled with the color VAE, providing fine-grained surface guidance that maintains strong correspondence with the texture. With these designs, NaTex demonstrates strong performance, significantly outperforming previous methods in texture coherence and alignment. Moreover, NaTex also exhibits strong generalization capabilities, either training-free or with simple tuning, for various downstream applications, e.g., material generation, texture refinement, and part segmentation and texturing.

Abstract: Underwater Image Enhancement (UIE) aims to restore visibility and correct color distortions caused by wavelength-dependent absorption and scattering. Recent hybrid approaches, which couple domain priors with modern deep neural architectures, have achieved strong performance but incur high computational cost, limiting their practicality in real-time scenarios. In this work, we propose WWE-UIE, a compact and efficient enhancement network that integrates three interpretable priors. First, adaptive white balance alleviates the strong wavelength-dependent color attenuation, particularly the dominance of blue-green tones. Second, a wavelet-based enhancement block (WEB) performs multi-band decomposition, enabling the network to capture both global structures and fine textures, which are critical for underwater restoration. Third, a gradient-aware module (SGFB) leverages Sobel operators with learnable gating to explicitly preserve edge structures degraded by scattering. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that WWE-UIE achieves competitive restoration quality with substantially fewer parameters and FLOPs, enabling real-time inference on resource-limited platforms. Ablation studies and visualizations further validate the contribution of each component. The source code is available at https://github.com/chingheng0808/WWE-UIE.

Abstract: Remote sensing change detection (RSCD) aims to identify surface changes from co-registered bi-temporal images. However, many deep learning-based RSCD methods rely solely on change-map annotations and underuse the semantic information in non-changing regions, which limits robustness under illumination variation, off-nadir views, and scarce labels. This article introduces ChangeDINO, an end-to-end multiscale Siamese framework for optical building change detection. The model fuses a lightweight backbone stream with features transferred from a frozen DINOv3, yielding semantic- and context-rich pyramids even on small datasets. A spatial-spectral differential transformer decoder then exploits multi-scale absolute differences as change priors to highlight true building changes and suppress irrelevant responses. Finally, a learnable morphology module refines the upsampled logits to recover clean boundaries. Experiments on four public benchmarks show that ChangeDINO consistently outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods in IoU and F1, and ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each component.

Abstract: Face super-resolution (FSR) is a critical technique for enhancing low-resolution facial images and has significant implications for face-related tasks. However, existing FSR methods are limited by fixed up-sampling scales and sensitivity to input size variations. To address these limitations, this paper introduces an Arbitrary-Resolution and Arbitrary-Scale FSR method with implicit representation networks (ARASFSR), featuring three novel designs. First, ARASFSR employs 2D deep features, local relative coordinates, and up-sampling scale ratios to predict RGB values for each target pixel, allowing super-resolution at any up-sampling scale. Second, a local frequency estimation module captures high-frequency facial texture information to reduce the spectral bias effect. Lastly, a global coordinate modulation module guides FSR to leverage prior facial structure knowledge and achieve resolution adaptation effectively. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate the robustness of ARASFSR over existing state-of-the-art methods while super-resolving facial images across various input sizes and up-sampling scales.

Abstract: The study of terrain and landform classification through UAV remote sensing diverges significantly from ground vehicle patrol tasks. Besides grappling with the complexity of data annotation and ensuring temporal consistency, it also confronts the scarcity of relevant data and the limitations imposed by the effective range of many technologies. This research substantiates that, in aerial positioning tasks, both the mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) and temporal consistency (TC) metrics are of paramount importance. It is demonstrated that fully labeled data is not the optimal choice, as selecting only key data lacks the enhancement in TC, leading to failures. Hence, a teacher-student architecture, coupled with key frame selection and key frame updating algorithms, is proposed. This framework successfully performs weakly supervised learning and TC knowledge distillation, overcoming the deficiencies of traditional TC training in aerial tasks. The experimental results reveal that our method utilizing merely 30\% of labeled data, concurrently elevates mIoU and temporal consistency ensuring stable localization of terrain objects.

Abstract: Accurate camera localization is crucial for robotics and Extended Reality (XR), enabling reliable navigation and alignment of virtual and real content. Existing visual methods often suffer from drift, scale ambiguity, and depend on fiducials or loop closure. This work introduces a real-time method for localizing a camera within a pre-captured, highly accurate colored LiDAR point cloud. By rendering synthetic views from this cloud, 2D-3D correspondences are established between live frames and the point cloud. A neural rendering technique narrows the domain gap between synthetic and real images, reducing occlusion and background artifacts to improve feature matching. The result is drift-free camera tracking with correct metric scale in the global LiDAR coordinate system. Two real-time variants are presented: Online Render and Match, and Prebuild and Localize. We demonstrate improved results on the ScanNet++ dataset and outperform existing SLAM pipelines.

Conclusion: MOMNet通过多阶匹配和聚合机制有效解决了RGB-D数据不对齐问题，为实际应用中的深度超分辨率提供了鲁棒解决方案。

Abstract: Recent guided depth super-resolution methods are premised on the assumption of strictly spatial alignment between depth and RGB, achieving high-quality depth reconstruction. However, in real-world scenarios, the acquisition of strictly aligned RGB-D is hindered by inherent hardware limitations (e.g., physically separate RGB-D sensors) and unavoidable calibration drift induced by mechanical vibrations or temperature variations. Consequently, existing approaches often suffer inevitable performance degradation when applied to misaligned real-world scenes. In this paper, we propose the Multi-Order Matching Network (MOMNet), a novel alignment-free framework that adaptively retrieves and selects the most relevant information from misaligned RGB. Specifically, our method begins with a multi-order matching mechanism, which jointly performs zero-order, first-order, and second-order matching to comprehensively identify RGB information consistent with depth across multi-order feature spaces. To effectively integrate the retrieved RGB and depth, we further introduce a multi-order aggregation composed of multiple structure detectors. This strategy uses multi-order priors as prompts to facilitate the selective feature transfer from RGB to depth. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MOMNet achieves state-of-the-art performance and exhibits outstanding robustness.

Abstract: Offline signature verification (OSV) is a frequently utilized technology in forensics. This paper proposes a new model, DetailSemNet, for OSV. Unlike previous methods that rely on holistic features for pair comparisons, our approach underscores the significance of fine-grained differences for robust OSV. We propose to match local structures between two signature images, significantly boosting verification accuracy. Furthermore, we observe that without specific architectural modifications, transformer-based backbones might naturally obscure local details, adversely impacting OSV performance. To address this, we introduce a Detail Semantics Integrator, leveraging feature disentanglement and re-entanglement. This integrator is specifically designed to enhance intricate details while simultaneously expanding discriminative semantics, thereby augmenting the efficacy of local structural matching. We evaluate our method against leading benchmarks in offline signature verification. Our model consistently outperforms recent methods, achieving state-of-the-art results with clear margins. The emphasis on local structure matching not only improves performance but also enhances the model's interpretability, supporting our findings. Additionally, our model demonstrates remarkable generalization capabilities in cross-dataset testing scenarios. The combination of generalizability and interpretability significantly bolsters the potential of DetailSemNet for real-world applications.

TL;DR: CAMS是一个基于CLIP的组合零样本学习方法，通过门控交叉注意力机制和多空间解缠技术，从视觉特征中提取语义特征并实现属性与对象的语义解缠，在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>

Motivation: 现有的CLIP-based CZSL方法主要依赖图像编码器获得的全局语义表示，但这种表示能力有限，无法完全解缠属性和对象，限制了在未见组合上的泛化能力。

Method: 提出CAMS方法：1）设计门控交叉注意力机制，从CLIP高层图像编码块中捕获细粒度语义特征；2）进行多空间解缠，实现属性和对象语义的完全解缠。

Result: 在MIT-States、UT-Zappos和C-GQA三个流行基准测试中，CAMS在封闭世界和开放世界设置下都达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: CAMS通过提取语义特征和多空间解缠技术，有效提升了组合零样本学习的泛化能力，为属性和对象的语义解缠提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Compositional zero-shot learning (CZSL) aims to learn the concepts of attributes and objects in seen compositions and to recognize their unseen compositions. Most Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP)-based CZSL methods focus on disentangling attributes and objects by leveraging the global semantic representation obtained from the image encoder. However, this representation has limited representational capacity and do not allow for complete disentanglement of the two. To this end, we propose CAMS, which aims to extract semantic features from visual features and perform semantic disentanglement in multidimensional spaces, thereby improving generalization over unseen attribute-object compositions. Specifically, CAMS designs a Gated Cross-Attention that captures fine-grained semantic features from the high-level image encoding blocks of CLIP through a set of latent units, while adaptively suppressing background and other irrelevant information. Subsequently, it conducts Multi-Space Disentanglement to achieve disentanglement of attribute and object semantics. Experiments on three popular benchmarks (MIT-States, UT-Zappos, and C-GQA) demonstrate that CAMS achieves state-of-the-art performance in both closed-world and open-world settings.

Motivation: 传统基于标记的光学运动捕捉系统依赖密集标记配置，存在准备耗时、标记识别模糊等问题，限制了其可扩展性。

Method: 引入刚性标记物(RBM)作为基本单元，提供明确的6自由度数据；开发基于深度学习的回归模型，在测地线损失下直接估计SMPL参数。

Result: 端到端方法在性能上与基于优化的方法相当，但计算量减少一个数量级以上；在AMASS数据集上训练达到最先进的姿态估计精度。

Conclusion: 结合稀疏6自由度RBM和流形感知的测地线损失，为图形学、虚拟现实和生物力学中的实时运动捕捉提供了实用且高保真的解决方案。

Abstract: Marker-based optical motion capture (MoCap), while long regarded as the gold standard for accuracy, faces practical challenges, such as time-consuming preparation and marker identification ambiguity, due to its reliance on dense marker configurations, which fundamentally limit its scalability. To address this, we introduce a novel fundamental unit for MoCap, the Rigid Body Marker (RBM), which provides unambiguous 6-DoF data and drastically simplifies setup. Leveraging this new data modality, we develop a deep-learning-based regression model that directly estimates SMPL parameters under a geodesic loss. This end-to-end approach matches the performance of optimization-based methods while requiring over an order of magnitude less computation. Trained on synthesized data from the AMASS dataset, our end-to-end model achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in body pose estimation. Real-world data captured using a Vicon optical tracking system further demonstrates the practical viability of our approach. Overall, the results show that combining sparse 6-DoF RBM with a manifold-aware geodesic loss yields a practical and high-fidelity solution for real-time MoCap in graphics, virtual reality, and biomechanics.

Result: 在DDAD和nuScenes数据集上评估，相比现有最优方法提高了跨图像深度估计的一致性和整体深度精度

Conclusion: 该方法能够预测密集、度量和跨视图一致的深度，在环视深度估计任务中表现出色

Abstract: Self-supervised surround-view depth estimation enables dense, low-cost 3D perception with a 360° field of view from multiple minimally overlapping images. Yet, most existing methods suffer from depth estimates that are inconsistent between overlapping images. Addressing this limitation, we propose a novel geometry-guided method for calibrated, time-synchronized multi-camera rigs that predicts dense, metric, and cross-view-consistent depth. Given the intrinsic and relative orientation parameters, a first depth map is predicted per image and the so-derived 3D points from all images are projected onto a shared unit cylinder, establishing neighborhood relations across different images. This produces a 2D position map for every image, where each pixel is assigned its projected position on the cylinder. Based on these position maps, we apply an explicit, non-learned spatial attention that aggregates features among pixels across images according to their distances on the cylinder, to predict a final depth map per image. Evaluated on the DDAD and nuScenes datasets, our approach improves the consistency of depth estimates across images and the overall depth compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Purpose: Accurate identification of hepatocystic anatomy is critical to preventing surgical complications during laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Deep learning models often struggle with occlusions, long-range dependencies, and capturing the fine-scale geometry of rare structures. This work addresses these challenges by introducing graph-based segmentation approaches that enhance spatial and semantic understanding in surgical scene analyses.
  Methods: We propose two segmentation models integrating Vision Transformer (ViT) feature encoders with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to explicitly model spatial relationships between anatomical regions. (1) A static k Nearest Neighbours (k-NN) graph with a Graph Convolutional Network with Initial Residual and Identity Mapping (GCNII) enables stable long-range information propagation. (2) A dynamic Differentiable Graph Generator (DGG) with a Graph Attention Network (GAT) supports adaptive topology learning. Both models are evaluated on the Endoscapes-Seg50 and CholecSeg8k benchmarks.
  Results: The proposed approaches achieve up to 7-8% improvement in Mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) and 6% improvement in Mean Dice (mDice) scores over state-of-the-art baselines. It produces anatomically coherent predictions, particularly on thin, rare and safety-critical structures.
  Conclusion: The proposed graph-based segmentation methods enhance both performance and anatomical consistency in surgical scene segmentation. By combining ViT-based global context with graph-based relational reasoning, the models improve interpretability and reliability, paving the way for safer laparoscopic and robot-assisted surgery through a precise identification of critical anatomical features.

Result: 实验表明，所提方法明显优于现有方法，达到了新的最先进性能。

Conclusion: 利用语言描述构建支持策略比依赖支持图像更有效，能够为少样本分割提供更准确和无偏的元指导。

Abstract: Few-shot segmentation (FSS) aims to segment novel classes under the guidance of limited support samples by a meta-learning paradigm. Existing methods mainly mine references from support images as meta guidance. However, due to intra-class variations among visual representations, the meta information extracted from support images cannot produce accurate guidance to segment untrained classes. In this paper, we argue that the references from support images may not be essential, the key to the support role is to provide unbiased meta guidance for both trained and untrained classes. We then introduce a Language-Driven Attribute Generalization (LDAG) architecture to utilize inherent target property language descriptions to build robust support strategy. Specifically, to obtain an unbiased support representation, we design a Multi-attribute Enhancement (MaE) module, which produces multiple detailed attribute descriptions of the target class through Large Language Models (LLMs), and then builds refined visual-text prior guidance utilizing multi-modal matching. Meanwhile, due to text-vision modal shift, attribute text struggles to promote visual feature representation, we design a Multi-modal Attribute Alignment (MaA) to achieve cross-modal interaction between attribute texts and visual feature. Experiments show that our proposed method outperforms existing approaches by a clear margin and achieves the new state-of-the art performance. The code will be released.

Method: 创建包含垃圾和垃圾箱的城市场景数据集，提供三种任务的基准测试，并提出基于启发式的垃圾箱跟踪方法和利用几何先验的模型无关分割框架。

Result: 微调的目标检测器在垃圾箱检测上表现良好，但基线跟踪方法在数量估计上困难；提出的启发式方法将平均绝对计数误差降低了79.6%，几何感知策略在轻量模型上将分割mAP@0.5提高了27%。

Conclusion: StreetView-Waste为城市垃圾管理的实际感知系统研究提供了具有挑战性的基准，证明了多模态输入在此任务中的价值。

Abstract: Urban waste management remains a critical challenge for the development of smart cities. Despite the growing number of litter detection datasets, the problem of monitoring overflowing waste containers, particularly from images captured by garbage trucks, has received little attention. While existing datasets are valuable, they often lack annotations for specific container tracking or are captured in static, decontextualized environments, limiting their utility for real-world logistics. To address this gap, we present StreetView-Waste, a comprehensive dataset of urban scenes featuring litter and waste containers. The dataset supports three key evaluation tasks: (1) waste container detection, (2) waste container tracking, and (3) waste overflow segmentation. Alongside the dataset, we provide baselines for each task by benchmarking state-of-the-art models in object detection, tracking, and segmentation. Additionally, we enhance baseline performance by proposing two complementary strategies: a heuristic-based method for improved waste container tracking and a model-agnostic framework that leverages geometric priors to refine litter segmentation. Our experimental results show that while fine-tuned object detectors achieve reasonable performance in detecting waste containers, baseline tracking methods struggle to accurately estimate their number; however, our proposed heuristics reduce the mean absolute counting error by 79.6%. Similarly, while segmenting amorphous litter is challenging, our geometry-aware strategy improves segmentation mAP@0.5 by 27% on lightweight models, demonstrating the value of multimodal inputs for this task. Ultimately, StreetView-Waste provides a challenging benchmark to encourage research into real-world perception systems for urban waste management.

Motivation: 现有的VLM令牌剪枝方法仅基于语义显著性选择令牌，忽略了VLA模型的双系统特性（高层语义理解和低层动作执行），导致动作生成所需的关键信息被丢弃，性能下降。

Method: 提出双层级重要性标准：视觉-语言预填充注意力用于语义相关性，通过时间平滑估计的动作解码注意力用于动作重要性。采用自适应双层级令牌选择策略，在给定计算预算下保留紧凑且信息丰富的视觉令牌。

Result: VLA-Pruner在多种VLA架构和多样化机器人任务中实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: VLA-Pruner作为一种即插即用的VLA专用令牌剪枝方法，有效解决了VLA模型的计算效率问题，同时保持了模型性能。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown great promise for embodied AI, yet the heavy computational cost of processing continuous visual streams severely limits their real-time deployment. Token pruning (keeping salient visual tokens and dropping redundant ones) has emerged as an effective approach for accelerating Vision-Language Models (VLMs), offering a solution for efficient VLA. However, these VLM-specific token pruning methods select tokens based solely on semantic salience metrics (e.g., prefill attention), while overlooking the VLA's intrinsic dual-system nature of high-level semantic understanding and low-level action execution. Consequently, these methods bias token retention toward semantic cues, discard critical information for action generation, and significantly degrade VLA performance. To bridge this gap, we propose VLA-Pruner, a versatile plug-and-play VLA-specific token prune method that aligns with the dual-system nature of VLA models and exploits the temporal continuity in robot manipulation. Specifically, VLA-Pruner adopts a dual-level importance criterion for visual token retention: vision-language prefill attention for semantic-level relevance and action decode attention, estimated via temporal smoothing, for action-level importance. Based on this criterion, VLA-Pruner proposes a novel dual-level token selection strategy that adaptively preserves a compact, informative set of visual tokens for both semantic understanding and action execution under given compute budget. Experiments show that VLA-Pruner achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple VLA architectures and diverse robotic tasks.

Abstract: Developing a multi-modal language model capable of understanding 3D scenes remains challenging due to the limited availability of 3D training data, in contrast to the abundance of 2D datasets used for vision-language models (VLM). As an alternative, we introduce LLaVA$^3$ (pronounced LLaVA-Cube), a novel method that improves the 3D scene understanding capabilities of VLM using only multi-view 2D images and without any fine-tuning. Inspired by Cubist painters, who represented multiple viewpoints of a 3D object within a single picture, we propose to describe the 3D scene for the VLM through omnidirectional visual representations of each object. These representations are derived from an intermediate multi-view 3D reconstruction of the scene. Extensive experiments on 3D VQA and 3D language grounding show that our approach outperforms previous 2D-based VLM solutions.

Abstract: The corpus callosum, the largest commissural structure in the human brain, is a central focus in research on aging and neurological diseases. It is also a critical target for interventions such as deep brain stimulation and serves as an important biomarker in clinical trials, including those investigating remyelination therapies. Despite extensive research on corpus callosum segmentation, few publicly available tools provide a comprehensive and automated analysis pipeline. To address this gap, we present FastSurfer-CC, an efficient and fully automated framework for corpus callosum morphometry. FastSurfer-CC automatically identifies mid-sagittal slices, segments the corpus callosum and fornix, localizes the anterior and posterior commissures to standardize head positioning, generates thickness profiles and subdivisions, and extracts eight shape metrics for statistical analysis. We demonstrate that FastSurfer-CC outperforms existing specialized tools across the individual tasks. Moreover, our method reveals statistically significant differences between Huntington's disease patients and healthy controls that are not detected by the current state-of-the-art.

Abstract: Video prediction is a fundamental task for various downstream applications, including robotics and world modeling. Although general video prediction models have achieved remarkable performance in standard scenarios, occlusion is still an inherent challenge in video prediction. We hypothesize that providing explicit information about motion (via point-flow) and geometric structure (via depth-maps) will enable video prediction models to perform better in situations with occlusion and the background motion. To investigate this, we present the first systematic study dedicated to occluded video prediction. We use a standard multi-object latent transformer architecture to predict future frames, but modify this to incorporate information from depth and point-flow. We evaluate this model in a controlled setting on both synthetic and real-world datasets with not only appearance-based metrics but also Wasserstein distances on object masks, which can effectively measure the motion distribution of the prediction. We find that when the prediction model is assisted with point flow and depth, it performs better in occluded scenarios and predicts more accurate background motion compared to models without the help of these modalities.

Abstract: Precise pose estimation of optical microrobots is essential for enabling high-precision object tracking and autonomous biological studies. However, current methods rely heavily on large, high-quality microscope image datasets, which are difficult and costly to acquire due to the complexity of microrobot fabrication and the labour-intensive labelling. Digital twin systems offer a promising path for sim-to-real data augmentation, yet existing techniques struggle to replicate complex optical microscopy phenomena, such as diffraction artifacts and depth-dependent imaging.This work proposes a novel physics-informed deep generative learning framework that, for the first time, integrates wave optics-based physical rendering and depth alignment into a generative adversarial network (GAN), to synthesise high-fidelity microscope images for microrobot pose estimation efficiently. Our method improves the structural similarity index (SSIM) by 35.6% compared to purely AI-driven methods, while maintaining real-time rendering speeds (0.022 s/frame).The pose estimator (CNN backbone) trained on our synthetic data achieves 93.9%/91.9% (pitch/roll) accuracy, just 5.0%/5.4% (pitch/roll) below that of an estimator trained exclusively on real data. Furthermore, our framework generalises to unseen poses, enabling data augmentation and robust pose estimation for novel microrobot configurations without additional training data.

Conclusion: 利用图像采集时间信息可以有效改善乳腺DCE-MRI肿瘤分割的准确性和泛化性能。

Abstract: Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) plays an important role in breast cancer screening, tumor assessment, and treatment planning and monitoring. The dynamic changes in contrast in different tissues help to highlight the tumor in post-contrast images. However, varying acquisition protocols and individual factors result in large variation in the appearance of tissues, even for images acquired in the same phase (e.g., first post-contrast phase), making automated tumor segmentation challenging. Here, we propose a tumor segmentation method that leverages knowledge of the image acquisition time to modulate model features according to the specific acquisition sequence. We incorporate the acquisition times using feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM) layers, a lightweight method for incorporating temporal information that also allows for capitalizing on the full, variables number of images acquired per imaging study. We trained baseline and different configurations for the time-modulated models with varying backbone architectures on a large public multisite breast DCE-MRI dataset. Evaluation on in-domain images and a public out-of-domain dataset showed that incorporating knowledge of phase acquisition time improved tumor segmentation performance and model generalization.

Abstract: Using ceiling-mounted cameras (CMCs) for indoor visual capturing opens up a wide range of applications. However, registering CMCs to the target scene layout presents a challenging task. While manual registration with specialized tools is inefficient and costly, automatic registration with visual localization may yield poor results when visual ambiguity exists. To alleviate these issues, we propose a novel solution for jointly mapping an indoor scene and registering CMCs to the scene layout. Our approach involves equipping a mobile agent with a head-mounted RGB-D camera to traverse the entire scene once and synchronize CMCs to capture this mobile agent. The egocentric videos generate world-coordinate agent trajectories and the scene layout, while the videos of CMCs provide pseudo-scale agent trajectories and CMC relative poses. By correlating all the trajectories with their corresponding timestamps, the CMC relative poses can be aligned to the world-coordinate scene layout. Based on this initialization, a factor graph is customized to enable the joint optimization of ego-camera poses, scene layout, and CMC poses. We also develop a new dataset, setting the first benchmark for collaborative scene mapping and CMC registration (https://sites.google.com/view/yowo/home). Experimental results indicate that our method not only effectively accomplishes two tasks within a unified framework, but also jointly enhances their performance.

TL;DR: SemCLIP提出了一种新的CLIP对比损失函数，通过结合释义和否定来增强视觉-语言模型的语义鲁棒性，在保持CLIP性能的同时显著提高对否定文本的处理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CLIP模型在处理否定和释义文本时表现不稳定，因为否定会以最小的词汇变化彻底改变含义，而释义可能产生完全不同但含义相同的文本表达，这给视觉-语言模型的对齐和评估带来了挑战。

Method: 提出SemCLIP方法：评估释义和否定的组合，设计新的CLIP对比损失函数，使用LLM生成的包含原始、释义和否定文本描述的训练三元组来训练CLIP类模型。

Result: 在CC-Neg基准测试中，SemCLIP将原始对否定的图像检索准确率从68.1%提升到78.1%；在Sugarcrepe++基准测试中表现优于仅使用否定描述训练的模型；在下游零样本分类任务中全面优于CLIP。

Conclusion: SemCLIP能够实现对语义变换的显著鲁棒性，在保持CLIP原有性能的同时，有效处理否定和释义文本，提升模型对语义变化的适应能力。

Abstract: Contrastive vision-language models continue to be the dominant approach for image and text retrieval. Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) trains two neural networks in contrastive manner to align their image and text embeddings in a shared latent space. Recent results evaluating CLIP on negated or paraphrased text have shown mixed performance because negation changes meaning radically with minimal lexical changes, while paraphrasing can create very different textual expressions with the same intended meaning. This poses a significant challenge for improving the evaluation results and alignment of vision-language models. To address this challenge, this paper evaluates the combination of paraphrasing and negation, proposes a new CLIP contrastive loss function accounting for both paraphrasing and negation, and applies LLM-generated training triples consisting of original, paraphrased and negated textual captions to CLIP-like training models. The approach, called SemCLIP, is shown to move paraphrased captions towards the original image embeddings while pushing negated captions further away in embedding space. Empirically, SemCLIP is shown to be capable of preserving CLIP's performance while increasing considerably the distances to negated captions. On the CC-Neg benchmark using an original over negation image-retrieval accuracy metric, SemCLIP improves accuracy from 68.1% to 78.1%. Although results are mixed when compared with CLIP on the Sugarcrepe++ benchmark, SemCLIP's performance is generally better than the models trained with negated captions. This robustness to negation extends to downstream zero-shot classification tasks where SemCLIP pre-trained on Sugarcrepe++ performs better than CLIP on all tested downstream tasks. These results indicate that SemCLIP can achieve significant robustness to semantic transformations.

TL;DR: 提出一个两阶段检测框架，通过对比学习提取图像嵌入特征，结合k-NN分类器实现合成图像检测，在少量样本下达到91.3%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI快速发展导致合成图像难以区分，传统检测方法依赖定期重新训练，计算成本高且不实用。

Method: 第一阶段使用监督对比学习训练视觉深度学习模型提取特征嵌入；第二阶段使用k-NN分类器在嵌入空间进行少样本学习。

Result: 仅使用每类150张图像，检测准确率达到91.3%，比现有方法提升5.2个百分点；在源归属任务中AUC和OSCR分别提升14.70%和4.27%。

Conclusion: 该框架为适应不断发展的生成AI提供了稳健、可扩展的取证归属系统，无需大量重新训练。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative artificial intelligence has enabled the creation of synthetic images that are increasingly indistinguishable from authentic content, posing significant challenges for digital media integrity. This problem is compounded by the accelerated release cycle of novel generative models, which renders traditional detection approaches (reliant on periodic retraining) computationally infeasible and operationally impractical.
  This work proposes a novel two-stage detection framework designed to address the generalization challenge inherent in synthetic image detection. The first stage employs a vision deep learning model trained via supervised contrastive learning to extract discriminative embeddings from input imagery. Critically, this model was trained on a strategically partitioned subset of available generators, with specific architectures withheld from training to rigorously ablate cross-generator generalization capabilities. The second stage utilizes a k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) classifier operating on the learned embedding space, trained in a few-shot learning paradigm incorporating limited samples from previously unseen test generators.
  With merely 150 images per class in the few-shot learning regime, which are easily obtainable from current generation models, the proposed framework achieves an average detection accuracy of 91.3\%, representing a 5.2 percentage point improvement over existing approaches . For the source attribution task, the proposed approach obtains improvements of of 14.70\% and 4.27\% in AUC and OSCR respectively on an open set classification context, marking a significant advancement toward robust, scalable forensic attribution systems capable of adapting to the evolving generative AI landscape without requiring exhaustive retraining protocols.

TL;DR: 提出了一种鲁棒的多摄像头体操运动员跟踪方法，结合体操领域知识解决视角受限和检测失败的问题，已在国际体操比赛中成功应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 体操运动员跟踪面临独特挑战：场地空间限制导致摄像头数量有限；光照变化、背景复杂、服装统一和遮挡等因素导致某些视角检测失败，通常只有两个相对视角能提供有效检测，这使得传统多摄像头三角测量难以准确确定3D轨迹。

Result: 通过大量实验验证了方法的鲁棒性，在挑战性场景中优于现有方法。该跟踪方法已成功应用于最近的体操世锦赛，获得国际体操联合会的高度认可。

Conclusion: 结合领域知识的级联数据关联方法能有效解决多摄像头体操运动员跟踪中的挑战，在视角受限和检测失败的情况下仍能保持鲁棒性能，已在实际比赛中证明其有效性。

Abstract: We present a robust multi-camera gymnast tracking, which has been applied at international gymnastics championships for gymnastics judging. Despite considerable progress in multi-camera tracking algorithms, tracking gymnasts presents unique challenges: (i) due to space restrictions, only a limited number of cameras can be installed in the gymnastics stadium; and (ii) due to variations in lighting, background, uniforms, and occlusions, multi-camera gymnast detection may fail in certain views and only provide valid detections from two opposing views. These factors complicate the accurate determination of a gymnast's 3D trajectory using conventional multi-camera triangulation. To alleviate this issue, we incorporate gymnastics domain knowledge into our tracking solution. Given that a gymnast's 3D center typically lies within a predefined vertical plane during \revised{much of their} performance, we can apply a ray-plane intersection to generate coplanar 3D trajectory candidates for opposing-view detections. More specifically, we propose a novel cascaded data association (DA) paradigm that employs triangulation to generate 3D trajectory candidates when cross-view detections are sufficient, and resort to the ray-plane intersection when they are insufficient. Consequently, coplanar candidates are used to compensate for uncertain trajectories, thereby minimizing tracking failures. The robustness of our method is validated through extensive experimentation, demonstrating its superiority over existing methods in challenging scenarios. Furthermore, our gymnastics judging system, equipped with this tracking method, has been successfully applied to recent Gymnastics World Championships, earning significant recognition from the International Gymnastics Federation.

Trained and tested on 2,141 children from AnthroVision and additionally evaluated on diverse cross-continent populations, including ARAN and an in-house collected CampusPose dataset, it achieves 0.79 recall, 0.82 AUC, and significantly lower anthropometric RMSEs, demonstrating reliable measurement in unconstrained pediatric settings. Cross-dataset results show up to 25% recall gain and up to 3.5 cm RMSE reduction using demographically matched knowledge bases. NutriScreener offers a scalable and accurate solution for early malnutrition detection in low-resource environments.

Abstract: Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting has been introduced as a compelling alternative to NeRF for Earth observation, offering com- petitive reconstruction quality with significantly reduced training times. In this work, we extend the Earth Observation Gaussian Splatting (EOGS) framework to propose EOGS++, a novel method tailored for satellite imagery that directly operates on raw high-resolution panchromatic data without requiring external preprocessing. Furthermore, leveraging optical flow techniques we embed bundle adjustment directly within the training process, avoiding reliance on external optimization tools while improving camera pose estimation. We also introduce several improvements to the original implementation, including early stopping and TSDF post-processing, all contributing to sharper reconstructions and better geometric accuracy. Experiments on the IARPA 2016 and DFC2019 datasets demonstrate that EOGS++ achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of reconstruction quality and effi- ciency, outperforming the original EOGS method and other NeRF-based methods while maintaining the computational advantages of Gaussian Splatting. Our model demonstrates an improvement from 1.33 to 1.19 mean MAE errors on buildings compared to the original EOGS models

TL;DR: VARiant通过权重共享和渐进式训练策略，在视觉自回归模型中实现了灵活的网络深度调整，显著降低了内存消耗和推理时间，同时保持接近原始模型的生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统VAR模型在多尺度生成过程中累积的KV缓存导致内存开销巨大，限制了实际部署。研究发现VAR模型存在尺度-深度不对称依赖性：早期尺度对网络深度极其敏感，而后期尺度对深度减少具有鲁棒性。

Method: 从30层VAR网络中通过等距采样选择多个子网络（16层到2层）。早期尺度使用完整网络处理，后期尺度使用子网络。提出渐进式训练策略解决权重共享带来的优化冲突问题。

Result: 在ImageNet上，VARiant-d16和VARiant-d8达到接近原始VAR-d30的质量（FID 2.05/2.12 vs 1.95），同时减少40-65%内存消耗。VARiant-d2实现3.5倍加速和80%内存减少，质量适度下降（FID 2.97）。

Conclusion: VARiant的单模型架构支持零成本运行时深度切换，提供从高质量到极致效率的灵活部署选项，满足多样化应用场景需求。

Abstract: Visual Auto-Regressive (VAR) models significantly reduce inference steps through the "next-scale" prediction paradigm. However, progressive multi-scale generation incurs substantial memory overhead due to cumulative KV caching, limiting practical deployment.
  We observe a scale-depth asymmetric dependency in VAR: early scales exhibit extreme sensitivity to network depth, while later scales remain robust to depth reduction. Inspired by this, we propose VARiant: by equidistant sampling, we select multiple subnets ranging from 16 to 2 layers from the original 30-layer VAR-d30 network. Early scales are processed by the full network, while later scales utilize subnet. Subnet and the full network share weights, enabling flexible depth adjustment within a single model.
  However, weight sharing between subnet and the entire network can lead to optimization conflicts. To address this, we propose a progressive training strategy that breaks through the Pareto frontier of generation quality for both subnets and the full network under fixed-ratio training, achieving joint optimality.
  Experiments on ImageNet demonstrate that, compared to the pretrained VAR-d30 (FID 1.95), VARiant-d16 and VARiant-d8 achieve nearly equivalent quality (FID 2.05/2.12) while reducing memory consumption by 40-65%. VARiant-d2 achieves 3.5 times speedup and 80% memory reduction at moderate quality cost (FID 2.97). In terms of deployment, VARiant's single-model architecture supports zero-cost runtime depth switching and provides flexible deployment options from high quality to extreme efficiency, catering to diverse application scenarios.

Abstract: The early detection of wildfires is a critical environmental challenge, with timely identification of smoke plumes being key to mitigating large-scale damage. While deep neural networks have proven highly effective for localization tasks, the scarcity of large, annotated datasets for smoke detection limits their potential. In response, we leverage generative AI techniques to address this data limitation by synthesizing a comprehensive, annotated smoke dataset. We then explore unsupervised domain adaptation methods for smoke plume segmentation, analyzing their effectiveness in closing the gap between synthetic and real-world data. To further refine performance, we integrate advanced generative approaches such as style transfer, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and image matting. These methods aim to enhance the realism of synthetic data and bridge the domain disparity, paving the way for more accurate and scalable wildfire detection models.

Abstract: Recent advances in stereo matching have focused on accuracy, often at the cost of significantly increased model size. Traditionally, the community has regarded efficient models as incapable of zero-shot ability due to their limited capacity. In this paper, we introduce Lite Any Stereo, a stereo depth estimation framework that achieves strong zero-shot generalization while remaining highly efficient. To this end, we design a compact yet expressive backbone to ensure scalability, along with a carefully crafted hybrid cost aggregation module. We further propose a three-stage training strategy on million-scale data to effectively bridge the sim-to-real gap. Together, these components demonstrate that an ultra-light model can deliver strong generalization, ranking 1st across four widely used real-world benchmarks. Remarkably, our model attains accuracy comparable to or exceeding state-of-the-art non-prior-based accurate methods while requiring less than 1% computational cost, setting a new standard for efficient stereo matching.

Conclusion: 所提出的方法有效提升了长尾目标检测性能，证明了改进BAGS框架和度量学习在解决类别不平衡问题上的有效性。

Abstract: Object detection has been widely explored for class-balanced datasets such as COCO. However, real-world scenarios introduce the challenge of long-tailed distributions, where numerous categories contain only a few instances. This inherent class imbalance biases detection models towards the more frequent classes, degrading performance on rare categories. In this paper, we tackle the problem of long-tailed 2D object detection using the LVISv1 dataset, which consists of 1,203 categories and 164,000 images. We employ a two-stage Faster R-CNN architecture and propose enhancements to the Balanced Group Softmax (BAGS) framework to mitigate class imbalance. Our approach achieves a new state-of-the-art performance with a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 24.5%, surpassing the previous benchmark of 24.0%.
  Additionally, we hypothesize that tail class features may form smaller, denser clusters within the feature space of head classes, making classification challenging for regression-based classifiers. To address this issue, we explore metric learning to produce feature embeddings that are both well-separated across classes and tightly clustered within each class. For inference, we utilize a k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) approach to improve classification performance, particularly for rare classes. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods in advancing long-tailed object detection.

We achieve this with a human- and model-in-the-loop pipeline for annotating object shape, texture, and pose, providing visually grounded 3D reconstruction data at unprecedented scale. We learn from this data in a modern, multi-stage training framework that combines synthetic pretraining with real-world alignment, breaking the 3D "data barrier". We obtain significant gains over recent work, with at least a 5:1 win rate in human preference tests on real-world objects and scenes. We will release our code and model weights, an online demo, and a new challenging benchmark for in-the-wild 3D object reconstruction.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce POMA-3D, the first self-supervised 3D representation model learned from point maps. Point maps encode explicit 3D coordinates on a structured 2D grid, preserving global 3D geometry while remaining compatible with the input format of 2D foundation models. To transfer rich 2D priors into POMA-3D, a view-to-scene alignment strategy is designed. Moreover, as point maps are view-dependent with respect to a canonical space, we introduce POMA-JEPA, a joint embedding-predictive architecture that enforces geometrically consistent point map features across multiple views. Additionally, we introduce ScenePoint, a point map dataset constructed from 6.5K room-level RGB-D scenes and 1M 2D image scenes to facilitate large-scale POMA-3D pretraining. Experiments show that POMA-3D serves as a strong backbone for both specialist and generalist 3D understanding. It benefits diverse tasks, including 3D question answering, embodied navigation, scene retrieval, and embodied localization, all achieved using only geometric inputs (i.e., 3D coordinates). Overall, our POMA-3D explores a point map way to 3D scene understanding, addressing the scarcity of pretrained priors and limited data in 3D representation learning.

Abstract: Unstructured pruning remains a powerful strategy for compressing deep neural networks, yet it often demands iterative train-prune-retrain cycles, resulting in significant computational overhead. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel teacher-guided pruning framework that tightly integrates Knowledge Distillation (KD) with importance score estimation. Unlike prior approaches that apply KD as a post-pruning recovery step, our method leverages gradient signals informed by the teacher during importance score calculation to identify and retain parameters most critical for both task performance and knowledge transfer. Our method facilitates a one-shot global pruning strategy that efficiently eliminates redundant weights while preserving essential representations. After pruning, we employ sparsity-aware retraining with and without KD to recover accuracy without reactivating pruned connections. Comprehensive experiments across multiple image classification benchmarks, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet, demonstrate that our method consistently achieves high sparsity levels with minimal performance degradation. Notably, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines such as EPG and EPSD at high sparsity levels, while offering a more computationally efficient alternative to iterative pruning schemes like COLT. The proposed framework offers a computation-efficient, performance-preserving solution well suited for deployment in resource-constrained environments.

Method: 采用教师-学生蒸馏范式，结合LoRA约束子空间更新，通过强遗忘阶段和温和恢复阶段实现目标遗忘。

Result: 在ISIC分割中，遗忘集IoU从0.875降至0.509，同时保留集和验证集性能保持竞争力；在ISIC分类中，遗忘集准确率从87.0%降至64.1%，保留集准确率从83.9%提升至90.6%。

Conclusion: 基于LoRA的子空间遗忘为医学图像分析提供了一种实用、可控且可逆的遗忘途径，使模型能够遗忘敏感样本或结构，同时保持关键性能。

Abstract: The ability to selectively remove knowledge from medical segmentation networks is increasingly important for privacy compliance, ethical deployment, and continual dataset revision. We introduce Erase to Retain, a controllable unlearning framework for medical image segmentation that achieves targeted forgetting without full retraining. Our method uses a teacher-student distillation paradigm with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) constrained subspace updates, enabling the student network to erase lesion-specific or class-specific representations in low-rank decoder spaces while preserving global anatomical understanding. During the strong unlearning phase, LoRA modules are adversarially optimized to contradict the teacher's confident predictions on a designated forget subset, enforcing semantic removal. This is followed by a gentle restoration phase that recovers generalization on retained data through head-only supervised refinement.
  For ISIC segmentation, the student reduces forget-set IoU from 0.875 to 0.509 while maintaining competitive performance on the retain and validation splits (0.647 to 0.677 IoU). On the cross-domain CHASE dataset, Erase to Retain consistently lowers forget-set IoU while preserving utility on retain and validation sets. For ISIC classification, our method decreases accuracy on the forget subset from 87.0 percent to 64.1 percent while improving retain accuracy from 83.9 percent to 90.6 percent.
  These results demonstrate that LoRA-based subspace unlearning provides a practical pathway toward responsible, controllable, and reversible unlearning in medical image analysis, enabling models to forget sensitive samples or structures while preserving performance where it matters most.

Abstract: The task of dataset distillation aims to find a small set of synthetic images such that training a model on them reproduces the performance of the same model trained on a much larger dataset of real samples. Existing distillation methods focus on synthesizing datasets that enable training randomly initialized models. In contrast, state-of-the-art vision approaches are increasingly building on large, pre-trained self-supervised models rather than training from scratch. In this paper, we investigate the problem of distilling datasets that enable us to optimally train linear probes on top of such large, pre-trained vision models. We introduce a method of dataset distillation for this task called Linear Gradient Matching that optimizes the synthetic images such that, when passed through a pre-trained feature extractor, they induce gradients in the linear classifier similar to those produced by the real data. Our method yields synthetic data that outperform all real-image baselines and, remarkably, generalize across pre-trained vision models, enabling us, for instance, to train a linear CLIP probe that performs competitively using a dataset distilled via a DINO backbone. Further, we show that our distilled datasets are exceptionally effective for fine-grained classification and provide a valuable tool for model interpretability, predicting, among other things, how similar two models' embedding spaces are under the platonic representation hypothesis or whether a model is sensitive to spurious correlations in adversarial datasets.

Abstract: Surgical video segmentation is crucial for computer-assisted surgery, enabling precise localization and tracking of instruments and tissues. Interactive Video Object Segmentation (iVOS) models such as Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) provide prompt-based flexibility beyond methods with predefined categories, but face challenges in surgical scenarios due to the domain gap and limited long-term tracking. To address these limitations, we construct SA-SV, the largest surgical iVOS benchmark with instance-level spatio-temporal annotations (masklets) spanning eight procedure types (61k frames, 1.6k masklets), enabling comprehensive development and evaluation for long-term tracking and zero-shot generalization. Building on SA-SV, we propose SAM2S, a foundation model enhancing \textbf{SAM2} for \textbf{S}urgical iVOS through: (1) DiveMem, a trainable diverse memory mechanism for robust long-term tracking; (2) temporal semantic learning for instrument understanding; and (3) ambiguity-resilient learning to mitigate annotation inconsistencies across multi-source datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning on SA-SV enables substantial performance gains, with SAM2 improving by 12.99 average $\mathcal{J}$\&$\mathcal{F}$ over vanilla SAM2. SAM2S further advances performance to 80.42 average $\mathcal{J}$\&$\mathcal{F}$, surpassing vanilla and fine-tuned SAM2 by 17.10 and 4.11 points respectively, while maintaining 68 FPS real-time inference and strong zero-shot generalization.

Motivation: 传统引导图像方法在低光照图像上效果不佳，因为低光照图像噪声高、亮度低，缺乏足够的图像特征用于引导

Method: 基于多参数优化，学习低光照与明亮图像特征之间的关联，使用机器学习从少量图像对样本中学习特征

Result: AGU能够使用低质量、低分辨率输入实时渲染高质量图像，在低光照场景下优于现有最先进方法

Conclusion: AGU方法有效解决了低光照图像引导上采样的挑战，实现了实时高质量图像渲染

Abstract: We introduce Adaptive Guided Upsampling (AGU), an efficient method for upscaling low-light images capable of optimizing multiple image quality characteristics at the same time, such as reducing noise and increasing sharpness. It is based on a guided image method, which transfers image characteristics from a guidance image to the target image. Using state-of-the-art guided methods, low-light images lack sufficient characteristics for this purpose due to their high noise level and low brightness, rendering suboptimal/not significantly improved images in the process. We solve this problem with multi-parameter optimization, learning the association between multiple low-light and bright image characteristics. Our proposed machine learning method learns these characteristics from a few sample images-pairs. AGU can render high-quality images in real time using low-quality, low-resolution input; our experiments demonstrate that it is superior to state-of-the-art methods in the addressed low-light use case.

Conclusion: TRIM在不牺牲输出质量的前提下，有效加速了3D高斯扩散模型的推理过程。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian diffusion models suffer from time-intensive denoising and post-denoising processing due to the massive number of Gaussian primitives, resulting in slow generation and limited scalability along sampling trajectories. To improve the efficiency of 3D diffusion models, we propose $\textbf{TRIM}$ ($\textbf{T}$rajectory $\textbf{R}$eduction and $\textbf{I}$nstance $\textbf{M}$ask denoising), a post-training approach that incorporates both temporal and spatial trimming strategies, to accelerate inference without compromising output quality while supporting the inference-time scaling for Gaussian diffusion models. Instead of scaling denoising trajectories in a costly end-to-end manner, we develop a lightweight selector model to evaluate latent Gaussian primitives derived from multiple sampled noises, enabling early trajectory reduction by selecting candidates with high-quality potential. Furthermore, we introduce instance mask denoising to prune learnable Gaussian primitives by filtering out redundant background regions, reducing inference computation at each denoising step. Extensive experiments and analysis demonstrate that TRIM significantly improves both the efficiency and quality of 3D generation.

Abstract: 3D hierarchical semantic segmentation (3DHS) is crucial for embodied intelligence applications that demand a multi-grained and multi-hierarchy understanding of 3D scenes. Despite the progress, previous 3DHS methods have overlooked following two challenges: I) multi-label learning with a parameter-sharing model can lead to multi-hierarchy conflicts in cross-hierarchy optimization, and II) the class imbalance issue is inevitable across multiple hierarchies of 3D scenes, which makes the model performance become dominated by major classes. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework with a primary 3DHS branch and an auxiliary discrimination branch. Specifically, to alleviate the multi-hierarchy conflicts, we propose a late-decoupled 3DHS framework which employs multiple decoders with the coarse-to-fine hierarchical guidance and consistency. The late-decoupled architecture can mitigate the underfitting and overfitting conflicts among multiple hierarchies and can also constrain the class imbalance problem in each individual hierarchy. Moreover, we introduce a 3DHS-oriented semantic prototype based bi-branch supervision mechanism, which additionally learns class-wise discriminative point cloud features and performs mutual supervision between the auxiliary and 3DHS branches, to enhance the class-imbalance segmentation. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and backbones demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art 3DHS performance, and its core components can also be used as a plug-and-play enhancement to improve previous methods.

TL;DR: Cambrian-S提出的空间超感知视频世界模型基准测试存在缺陷，简单的无时序基线模型NoSense几乎完美解决VSR基准，而VSC基准中的推理方法依赖捷径启发式而非真正的空间认知。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对Cambrian-S提出的视频空间超感知基准和推理方法进行批判性分析，验证这些基准是否真正衡量空间超感知能力。

Method: 引入简单基线模型NoSense（仅使用词袋SigLIP模型）测试VSR基准；设计VSC-Repeat实验（将视频重复拼接）测试VSC基准的鲁棒性。

Result: NoSense在4小时视频上达到95%准确率，几乎解决VSR基准；VSC-Repeat实验使Cambrian-S准确率从42%降至0%，显示其依赖捷径而非空间认知。

Conclusion: 当前VSI-Super基准无法可靠衡量空间超感知，Cambrian-S的推理方法通过利用基准中的捷径而非真正的空间超感知能力提升性能。

Abstract: Cambrian-S aims to take the first steps towards improving video world models with spatial supersensing by introducing (i) two benchmarks, VSI-Super-Recall (VSR) and VSI-Super-Counting (VSC), and (ii) bespoke predictive sensing inference strategies tailored to each benchmark. In this work, we conduct a critical analysis of Cambrian-S across both these fronts. First, we introduce a simple baseline, NoSense, which discards almost all temporal structure and uses only a bag-of-words SigLIP model, yet near-perfectly solves VSR, achieving 95% accuracy even on 4-hour videos. This shows benchmarks like VSR can be nearly solved without spatial cognition, world modeling or spatial supersensing. Second, we hypothesize that the tailored inference methods proposed by Cambrian-S likely exploit shortcut heuristics in the benchmark. We illustrate this with a simple sanity check on the VSC benchmark, called VSC-Repeat: We concatenate each video with itself 1-5 times, which does not change the number of unique objects. However, this simple perturbation entirely collapses the mean relative accuracy of Cambrian-S from 42% to 0%. A system that performs spatial supersensing and integrates information across experiences should recognize views of the same scene and keep object-count predictions unchanged; instead, Cambrian-S inference algorithm relies largely on a shortcut in the VSC benchmark that rooms are never revisited. Taken together, our findings suggest that (i) current VSI-Super benchmarks do not yet reliably measure spatial supersensing, and (ii) predictive-sensing inference recipes used by Cambrian-S improve performance by inadvertently exploiting shortcuts rather than from robust spatial supersensing. We include the response from the Cambrian-S authors (in Appendix A) to provide a balanced perspective alongside our claims. We release our code at: https://github.com/bethgelab/supersanity

Conclusion: PartUV通过部件对齐的UV展开方法，有效解决了AI生成网格的UV展开问题，并支持新的应用如部件特定的多瓦片打包。

Abstract: UV unwrapping flattens 3D surfaces to 2D with minimal distortion, often requiring the complex surface to be decomposed into multiple charts. Although extensively studied, existing UV unwrapping methods frequently struggle with AI-generated meshes, which are typically noisy, bumpy, and poorly conditioned. These methods often produce highly fragmented charts and suboptimal boundaries, introducing artifacts and hindering downstream tasks. We introduce PartUV, a part-based UV unwrapping pipeline that generates significantly fewer, part-aligned charts while maintaining low distortion. Built on top of a recent learning-based part decomposition method PartField, PartUV combines high-level semantic part decomposition with novel geometric heuristics in a top-down recursive framework. It ensures each chart's distortion remains below a user-specified threshold while minimizing the total number of charts. The pipeline integrates and extends parameterization and packing algorithms, incorporates dedicated handling of non-manifold and degenerate meshes, and is extensively parallelized for efficiency. Evaluated across four diverse datasets, including man-made, CAD, AI-generated, and Common Shapes, PartUV outperforms existing tools and recent neural methods in chart count and seam length, achieves comparable distortion, exhibits high success rates on challenging meshes, and enables new applications like part-specific multi-tiles packing.

Abstract: With the increasing demand for 3D animation, generating high-fidelity, controllable 4D avatars from textual descriptions remains a significant challenge. Despite notable efforts in 4D generative modeling, existing methods exhibit fundamental limitations that impede their broader applicability, including temporal and geometric inconsistencies, perceptual artifacts, motion irregularities, high computational costs, and limited control over dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose TriDiff-4D, a novel 4D generative pipeline that employs diffusion-based triplane re-posing to produce high-quality, temporally coherent 4D avatars. Our model adopts an auto-regressive strategy to generate 4D sequences of arbitrary length, synthesizing each 3D frame with a single diffusion process. By explicitly learning 3D structure and motion priors from large-scale 3D and motion datasets, TriDiff-4D enables skeleton-driven 4D generation that excels in temporal consistency, motion accuracy, computational efficiency, and visual fidelity. Specifically, TriDiff-4D first generates a canonical 3D avatar and a corresponding motion sequence from a text prompt, then uses a second diffusion model to animate the avatar according to the motion sequence, supporting arbitrarily long 4D generation. Experimental results demonstrate that TriDiff-4D significantly outperforms existing methods, reducing generation time from hours to seconds by eliminating the optimization process, while substantially improving the generation of complex motions with high-fidelity appearance and accurate 3D geometry.

Conclusion: SceneDesigner成功解决了多物体9D姿态控制的挑战，实现了准确灵活的姿态操纵，并支持用户特定的个性化控制。

Abstract: Controllable image generation has attracted increasing attention in recent years, enabling users to manipulate visual content such as identity and style. However, achieving simultaneous control over the 9D poses (location, size, and orientation) of multiple objects remains an open challenge. Despite recent progress, existing methods often suffer from limited controllability and degraded quality, falling short of comprehensive multi-object 9D pose control. To address these limitations, we propose SceneDesigner, a method for accurate and flexible multi-object 9-DoF pose manipulation. SceneDesigner incorporates a branched network to the pre-trained base model and leverages a new representation, CNOCS map, which encodes 9D pose information from the camera view. This representation exhibits strong geometric interpretation properties, leading to more efficient and stable training. To support training, we construct a new dataset, ObjectPose9D, which aggregates images from diverse sources along with 9D pose annotations. To further address data imbalance issues, particularly performance degradation on low-frequency poses, we introduce a two-stage training strategy with reinforcement learning, where the second stage fine-tunes the model using a reward-based objective on rebalanced data. At inference time, we propose Disentangled Object Sampling, a technique that mitigates insufficient object generation and concept confusion in complex multi-object scenes. Moreover, by integrating user-specific personalization weights, SceneDesigner enables customized pose control for reference subjects. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that SceneDesigner significantly outperforms existing approaches in both controllability and quality.

Evaluations of six state-of-the-art video models reveal clear dimension-wise differences, with strong variation in structured, spatial, pattern-based, and physical reasoning. We further compare video models with strong image models, analyze common hallucination behaviors, and study how video duration affects Chain-of-Frames reasoning. Overall, V-ReasonBench offers a unified and reproducible framework for measuring video reasoning and aims to support the development of models with more reliable, human-aligned reasoning skills.

Abstract: While language models have become impactful in many real-world applications, video generation remains largely confined to entertainment. Motivated by video's inherent capacity to demonstrate physical-world information that is difficult to convey through language alone (e.g., imagine teaching someone to tie a tie using only text), we identify an underutilized opportunity to extend video as a new answer modality for Next-Event Prediction (NEP), formalized as Video-Next-Event Prediction (VNEP). While the established NEP task takes a video with a procedural or predictive question as input to predict the next event in text, VNEP requires dynamic video responses. This shift from telling to showing unlocks more intuitive and customized answers for procedural learning and creative exploration. However, this task remains challenging for existing models, as it demands an understanding of multimodal input, instruction-conditioned reasoning, and the generation of video with visual and semantic consistency. To address this, we introduce VANS, a model that leverages reinforcement learning to align a Vision-Language Model (VLM) with a Video Diffusion Model (VDM) for VNEP. The core of VANS is our proposed Joint-GRPO that orchestrates the VLM and VDM to function as a unit. Driven by a shared reward on their respective output, it optimizes the VLM to produce captions that are both accurate and friendly to visualize, while guiding the VDM to generate videos that are faithful to these captions and the input visual context. To enable this learning, we craft VANS-Data-100K, a dedicated dataset for the VNEP task. Experiments on procedural and predictive benchmarks demonstrate that VANS achieves state-of-the-art performance in both video event prediction and visualization.

However, existing reasoning-oriented visual language models (VLMs), whether trained with explicit chain-of-thought annotations or rule-based RL rewards, mainly pursue lengthy, detailed reasoning chains, which often lead to excessive computational costs. In this work, we propose a simple RL approach, which enables VLMs to automatically switch between fast and slow thinking modes depending on task difficulty. The approach consists of two stages: in the first stage, we label data as either requiring fast thinking or slow thinking based on the model output length, which is inspired by the observation that pre-trained VLMs typically produce answers of varying lengths for different types of questions; in the second stage, we train the model using GRPO along with the thinking mode labels to develop dual-mode thinking. Despite its simplicity, our model, named DualMindVLM, significantly outperforms the base model and achieves performance on par with state-of-the-art visual reasoning models, while maintaining exceptionally high token efficiency.

TL;DR: EvoLMM是一个完全无监督的自进化框架，通过两个协作代理（提议者和解决者）从单一骨干模型实现大型多模态模型的自我提升，无需人工标注数据或奖励蒸馏。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型多模态模型的训练仍依赖人工标注数据或外部奖励模型，限制了自主性和可扩展性。本文旨在以完全无监督方式提升模型推理能力。

Method: 提出EvoLMM框架，从单一骨干模型实例化两个协作代理：提议者生成多样化的图像相关问题，解决者通过内部一致性解决问题，通过持续自我奖励过程进行学习。

Result: 以Qwen2.5-VL为基础模型，EvoLMM在ChartQA、MathVista和MathVision等多模态数学推理基准上实现约3%的稳定提升，仅使用原始训练图像。

Conclusion: 这种简单有效的方法为完全无监督环境下自改进大型多模态模型的研究提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: Recent advances in large multimodal models (LMMs) have enabled impressive reasoning and perception abilities, yet most existing training pipelines still depend on human-curated data or externally verified reward models, limiting their autonomy and scalability. In this work, we strive to improve LMM reasoning capabilities in a purely unsupervised fashion (without any annotated data or reward distillation). To this end, we propose a self-evolving framework, named EvoLMM, that instantiates two cooperative agents from a single backbone model: a Proposer, which generates diverse, image-grounded questions, and a Solver, which solves them through internal consistency, where learning proceeds through a continuous self-rewarding process. This dynamic feedback encourages both the generation of informative queries and the refinement of structured reasoning without relying on ground-truth or human judgments. When using the popular Qwen2.5-VL as the base model, our EvoLMM yields consistent gains upto $\sim$3\% on multimodal math-reasoning benchmarks, including ChartQA, MathVista, and MathVision, using only raw training images. We hope our simple yet effective approach will serve as a solid baseline easing future research in self-improving LMMs in a fully-unsupervised fashion.

*Jing Wen,Alexander G. Schwing,Shenlong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NoPo-Avatar：从单张或稀疏图像重建可动画3D人体化身，无需姿态输入，解决了传统方法依赖准确姿态估计的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖准确的相机姿态和人体姿态作为输入，但在实际应用中姿态估计往往存在噪声，导致重建质量下降。

Method: 提出NoPo-Avatar方法，仅从图像重建化身，完全避免在测试时使用人体姿态输入，从而不受噪声姿态估计的影响。

Result: 在THuman2.0、XHuman和HuGe100K数据集上的实验表明，在无真实姿态的实际场景中优于现有基线，在有真实姿态的实验室场景中也能达到可比结果。

Conclusion: NoPo-Avatar通过消除对测试时姿态输入的依赖，提高了方法的实用性和鲁棒性，在真实世界应用中表现更优。

Abstract: We tackle the task of recovering an animatable 3D human avatar from a single or a sparse set of images. For this task, beyond a set of images, many prior state-of-the-art methods use accurate "ground-truth" camera poses and human poses as input to guide reconstruction at test-time. We show that pose-dependent reconstruction degrades results significantly if pose estimates are noisy. To overcome this, we introduce NoPo-Avatar, which reconstructs avatars solely from images, without any pose input. By removing the dependence of test-time reconstruction on human poses, NoPo-Avatar is not affected by noisy human pose estimates, making it more widely applicable. Experiments on challenging THuman2.0, XHuman, and HuGe100K data show that NoPo-Avatar outperforms existing baselines in practical settings (without ground-truth poses) and delivers comparable results in lab settings (with ground-truth poses).

TL;DR: 本研究调查了多语言LLM中思维链推理的归因模式，发现归因分数过度强调最终推理步骤，结构化CoT提示主要对高资源拉丁语系语言有效，而受控扰动会降低模型准确性和归因一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估多语言LLM中思维链推理的忠实性和可解释性，关注不同语言间的归因模式差异。

Method: 使用ContextCite进行步骤级归因和Inseq进行词级归因，在Qwen2.5 1.5B-Instruct模型上应用MGSM基准测试，并通过否定和干扰句进行受控扰动。

Result: 归因分数过度强调最终推理步骤（特别是在错误生成中）；结构化CoT提示显著提高了高资源拉丁语系语言的准确性；受控扰动降低了模型准确性和归因一致性。

Conclusion: 思维链提示在多语言鲁棒性和解释透明度方面存在局限性。

Abstract: This study investigates the attribution patterns underlying Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in multilingual LLMs. While prior works demonstrate the role of CoT prompting in improving task performance, there are concerns regarding the faithfulness and interpretability of the generated reasoning chains. To assess these properties across languages, we applied two complementary attribution methods--ContextCite for step-level attribution and Inseq for token-level attribution--to the Qwen2.5 1.5B-Instruct model using the MGSM benchmark. Our experimental results highlight key findings such as: (1) attribution scores excessively emphasize the final reasoning step, particularly in incorrect generations; (2) structured CoT prompting significantly improves accuracy primarily for high-resource Latin-script languages; and (3) controlled perturbations via negation and distractor sentences reduce model accuracy and attribution coherence. These findings highlight the limitations of CoT prompting, particularly in terms of multilingual robustness and interpretive transparency.

Motivation: 现有心理理论基准主要关注错误信念任务和非对称信息推理，忽视了信念之外的其他心理状态以及丰富的非语言沟通方式。

Method: 利用专家策划的身体语言参考作为知识库，构建Motion2Mind数据集，包含222种非语言线索和397种心理状态的细粒度注释和手动验证的心理解释。

Result: 评估显示当前AI系统在非语言线索解释方面表现不佳，在检测方面存在显著性能差距，在解释方面相比人类标注者表现出过度解释的模式。

Conclusion: 机器在理解非语言线索方面仍面临重大挑战，需要进一步研究来提升这方面的能力。

Abstract: Our ability to interpret others' mental states through nonverbal cues (NVCs) is fundamental to our survival and social cohesion. While existing Theory of Mind (ToM) benchmarks have primarily focused on false-belief tasks and reasoning with asymmetric information, they overlook other mental states beyond belief and the rich tapestry of human nonverbal communication. We present Motion2Mind, a framework for evaluating the ToM capabilities of machines in interpreting NVCs. Leveraging an expert-curated body-language reference as a proxy knowledge base, we build Motion2Mind, a carefully curated video dataset with fine-grained nonverbal cue annotations paired with manually verified psychological interpretations. It encompasses 222 types of nonverbal cues and 397 mind states. Our evaluation reveals that current AI systems struggle significantly with NVC interpretation, exhibiting not only a substantial performance gap in Detection, as well as patterns of over-interpretation in Explanation compared to human annotators.

TL;DR: 提出了TOD-ProcBench基准，用于评估LLM在多轮任务导向对话中理解和遵循复杂过程指令的能力，包含三个任务：相关语句检索与动作预测、违规响应识别、条件生成指令遵循响应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有任务导向对话基准过度简化复杂指令为简单模式，无法反映现实世界中需要严格遵循复杂约束和步骤的对话场景。

Method: 基于高质量ABCD数据集构建包含复杂过程指令的基准，将细粒度约束和动作程序表述为多级条件-动作指令语句，设计三个评估任务。

Result: 构建了包含复杂过程指令的基准数据集，并设计了全面的评估框架来测试LLM的指令遵循能力。

Conclusion: TOD-ProcBench填补了现有基准在复杂指令遵循评估方面的空白，为系统评估LLM在任务导向对话中的表现提供了挑战性测试平台。

Abstract: In real-world task-oriented dialogue (TOD) settings, agents are required to strictly adhere to complex instructions while conducting multi-turn conversations with customers. These instructions are typically presented in natural language format and include general guidelines and step-by-step procedures with complex constraints. Existing TOD benchmarks often oversimplify the complex nature of these instructions by reducing them to simple schemas composed of intents, slots, and API call configurations. To address this gap and systematically benchmark LLMs' instruction-following capabilities, we propose TOD-ProcBench, a challenging benchmark featuring complex process instructions with intricate, fine-grained constraints that evaluates various LLMs' abilities to understand and follow instructions in multi-turn TODs. Our benchmark dataset comprises instruction documents derived from the high-quality ABCD dataset with corresponding conversations under human quality control. We formulate fine-grained constraints and action procedures as multi-level condition-action instruction statements. We design three tasks to comprehensively benchmark LLMs' complex instruction-following capabilities in multi-turn TODs. Task 1 evaluates how LLMs retrieve the most relevant statement from a complex instruction and predict the corresponding next action. In Task 2, we synthesize instruction-violating responses by injecting inconsistencies and manipulating the original instructions, and then we analyze how effectively LLMs can identify instruction-violating responses. Task 3 investigates LLMs' abilities in conditional generation of instruction-following responses based on the original complex instructions. Additionally, we conduct studies on the impact of multilingual settings and different instruction text formats on compliance performance. We release our benchmark under the Llama 3.3 Community License Agreement.

Motivation: 现有的大语言模型谎言检测技术通常在狭窄场景中验证，无法捕捉模型可能生成的各种谎言类型。

Method: 构建LIARS' BENCH测试平台，包含72,863个谎言和诚实回答示例，涵盖不同谎言类型（基于说谎原因和信念对象两个维度），评估3种黑盒和白盒谎言检测技术。

Result: 现有技术系统性地无法检测某些类型的谎言，特别是在仅凭对话记录无法判断模型是否说谎的场景中表现不佳。

Conclusion: LIARS' BENCH揭示了现有技术的局限性，为谎言检测技术的进步提供了实用的测试平台。

Abstract: Prior work has introduced techniques for detecting when large language models (LLMs) lie, that is, generating statements they believe are false. However, these techniques are typically validated in narrow settings that do not capture the diverse lies LLMs can generate. We introduce LIARS' BENCH, a testbed consisting of 72,863 examples of lies and honest responses generated by four open-weight models across seven datasets. Our settings capture qualitatively different types of lies and vary along two dimensions: the model's reason for lying and the object of belief targeted by the lie. Evaluating three black- and white-box lie detection techniques on LIARS' BENCH, we find that existing techniques systematically fail to identify certain types of lies, especially in settings where it's not possible to determine whether the model lied from the transcript alone. Overall, LIARS' BENCH reveals limitations in prior techniques and provides a practical testbed for guiding progress in lie detection.

TL;DR: LTLA是一种混合方法，将基础语言模型与可处理的代理模型结合，通过单次批量HMM更新和固定代理解码器来提高受控文本生成的效率和质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在受控文本生成中使用可处理代理模型时上下文感知能力弱的问题，同时避免效率陷阱。

Method: 使用基础语言模型进行丰富前缀编码，配合固定可处理代理模型计算精确的延续概率；通过单次批量HMM更新处理所有候选标记，仅让代理模型的潜在状态先验依赖于LM的隐藏表示。

Result: LTLA获得了比无条件HMM更高的条件似然，能够为视觉语言模型近似延续分布，在受控生成任务中提高了约束满足度且保持相似的流畅性，推理开销最小。

Conclusion: LTLA方法有效地平衡了受控文本生成的准确性和效率，在保持高质量生成的同时最小化了计算开销。

Abstract: Controlled language generation conditions text on sequence-level constraints (for example, syntax, style, or safety). These constraints may depend on future tokens, which makes directly conditioning an autoregressive language model (LM) generally intractable. Prior work uses tractable surrogates such as hidden Markov models (HMMs) to approximate the distribution over continuations and adjust the model's next-token logits at decoding time. However, we find that these surrogates are often weakly context aware, which reduces query quality. We propose Learning to Look Ahead (LTLA), a hybrid approach that pairs the same base language model for rich prefix encoding with a fixed tractable surrogate model that computes exact continuation probabilities. Two efficiency pitfalls arise when adding neural context: (i) naively rescoring the prefix with every candidate next token requires a sweep over the entire vocabulary at each step, and (ii) predicting fresh surrogate parameters for each prefix, although tractable at a single step, forces recomputation of future probabilities for every new prefix and eliminates reuse. LTLA avoids both by using a single batched HMM update to account for all next-token candidates at once, and by conditioning only the surrogate's latent state prior on the LM's hidden representations while keeping the surrogate decoder fixed, so computations can be reused across prefixes. Empirically, LTLA attains higher conditional likelihood than an unconditional HMM, approximates continuation distributions for vision-language models where a standalone HMM cannot encode visual context, and improves constraint satisfaction at comparable fluency on controlled-generation tasks, with minimal inference overhead.

Abstract: AI models like GPT-5 are an increasingly valuable tool for scientists, but many remain unaware of the capabilities of frontier AI. We present a collection of short case studies in which GPT-5 produced new, concrete steps in ongoing research across mathematics, physics, astronomy, computer science, biology, and materials science. In these examples, the authors highlight how AI accelerated their work, and where it fell short; where expert time was saved, and where human input was still key. We document the interactions of the human authors with GPT-5, as guiding examples of fruitful collaboration with AI. Of note, this paper includes four new results in mathematics (carefully verified by the human authors), underscoring how GPT-5 can help human mathematicians settle previously unsolved problems. These contributions are modest in scope but profound in implication, given the rate at which frontier AI is progressing.

Conclusion: ELPO通过集成学习方法有效提升了自动提示优化的性能，为复杂任务提供了更准确和鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: The remarkable performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) highly relies on crafted prompts. However, manual prompt engineering is a laborious process, creating a core bottleneck for practical application of LLMs. This phenomenon has led to the emergence of a new research area known as Automatic Prompt Optimization (APO), which develops rapidly in recent years. Existing APO methods such as those based on evolutionary algorithms or trial-and-error approaches realize an efficient and accurate prompt optimization to some extent. However, those researches focus on a single model or algorithm for the generation strategy and optimization process, which limits their performance when handling complex tasks. To address this, we propose a novel framework called Ensemble Learning based Prompt Optimization (ELPO) to achieve more accurate and robust results. Motivated by the idea of ensemble learning, ELPO conducts voting mechanism and introduces shared generation strategies along with different search methods for searching superior prompts. Moreover, ELPO creatively presents more efficient algorithms for the prompt generation and search process. Experimental results demonstrate that ELPO outperforms state-of-the-art prompt optimization methods across different tasks, e.g., improving F1 score by 7.6 on ArSarcasm dataset.

Method: 引入Token-Selective PEFT (TS-PEFT)范式，使用函数S选择性地对位置索引子集应用PEFT修改。

Result: 实验结果表明，对所有索引不加选择地应用PEFT不仅多余，甚至可能适得其反。

Conclusion: 为PEFT提供了新视角，主张采用更有针对性的修改方法，为未来优化大模型微调过程提供了框架。

Abstract: In the field of large models (LMs) for natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV), Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a resource-efficient method that modifies a limited number of parameters while keeping the pretrained weights fixed. This paper investigates the traditional PEFT approach, which applies modifications to all position indices, and questions its necessity. We introduce a new paradigm called Token-Selective PEFT (TS-PEFT), in which a function S selectively applies PEFT modifications to a subset of position indices, potentially enhancing performance on downstream tasks. Our experimental results reveal that the indiscriminate application of PEFT to all indices is not only superfluous, but may also be counterproductive. This study offers a fresh perspective on PEFT, advocating for a more targeted approach to modifications and providing a framework for future research to optimize the fine-tuning process for large models.

Abstract: Effective scientific communication depends on accurate citations that validate sources and guide readers to supporting evidence. Yet academic literature faces mounting challenges: semantic citation errors that misrepresent sources, AI-generated hallucinated references, and traditional citation formats that point to entire papers without indicating which sections substantiate specific claims. We introduce SemanticCite, an AI-powered system that verifies citation accuracy through full-text source analysis while providing rich contextual information via detailed reasoning and relevant text snippets. Our approach combines multiple retrieval methods with a four-class classification system (Supported, Partially Supported, Unsupported, Uncertain) that captures nuanced claim-source relationships and enables appropriate remedial actions for different error types. Our experiments show that fine-tuned lightweight language models achieve performance comparable to large commercial systems with significantly lower computational requirements, making large-scale citation verification practically feasible. The system provides transparent, evidence-based explanations that support user understanding and trust. We contribute a comprehensive dataset of over 1,000 citations with detailed alignments, functional classifications, semantic annotations, and bibliometric metadata across eight disciplines, alongside fine-tuned models and the complete verification framework as open-source software. SemanticCite addresses critical challenges in research integrity through scalable citation verification, streamlined peer review, and quality control for AI-generated content, providing an open-source foundation for maintaining citation accuracy at scale.

TL;DR: 本文提出了语义结构熵(SeSE)框架，从结构信息角度量化大语言模型的语义不确定性，用于幻觉检测。通过构建自适应稀疏有向语义图并利用层次抽象，SeSE能更精确地估计不确定性，在长文本生成中还能量化单个声明的不确定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有不确定性量化方法主要依赖语义概率分布或成对距离，忽略了潜在的语义结构信息，无法提供精确的不确定性估计。在安全关键场景中，可靠的不确定性量化对于避免模型产生幻觉至关重要。

Method: 1. 开发自适应稀疏有向语义图构建算法，捕捉方向性语义依赖并自动剪枝负面干扰连接；2. 通过层次抽象利用潜在语义结构信息，将SeSE定义为最优语义编码树的结构熵；3. 扩展SeSE以量化长文本生成中单个声明的不确定性。

Result: 在29个模型-数据集组合上的广泛实验表明，SeSE显著优于先进的不确定性量化基线方法，包括强监督方法和最近提出的KLE方法。

Conclusion: SeSE框架通过利用语义结构信息，为LLMs提供了更可靠的不确定性量化，在幻觉检测方面表现出色，特别在长文本生成场景中能提供细粒度的不确定性估计。

Abstract: Reliable uncertainty quantification (UQ) is essential for deploying large language models (LLMs) in safety-critical scenarios, as it enables them to abstain from responding when uncertain, thereby avoiding hallucinating falsehoods. However, state-of-the-art UQ methods primarily rely on semantic probability distributions or pairwise distances, overlooking latent semantic structural information that could enable more precise uncertainty estimates. This paper presents Semantic Structural Entropy (SeSE), a principled UQ framework that quantifies the inherent semantic uncertainty of LLMs from a structural information perspective for hallucination detection. Specifically, to effectively model semantic spaces, we first develop an adaptively sparsified directed semantic graph construction algorithm that captures directional semantic dependencies while automatically pruning unnecessary connections that introduce negative interference. We then exploit latent semantic structural information through hierarchical abstraction: SeSE is defined as the structural entropy of the optimal semantic encoding tree, formalizing intrinsic uncertainty within semantic spaces after optimal compression. A higher SeSE value corresponds to greater uncertainty, indicating that LLMs are highly likely to generate hallucinations. In addition, to enhance fine-grained UQ in long-form generation -- where existing methods often rely on heuristic sample-and-count techniques -- we extend SeSE to quantify the uncertainty of individual claims by modeling their random semantic interactions, providing theoretically explicable hallucination detection. Extensive experiments across 29 model-dataset combinations show that SeSE significantly outperforms advanced UQ baselines, including strong supervised methods and the recently proposed KLE.

TL;DR: 提出了SDA（Steering-Driven Distribution Alignment）框架，一种无需训练、模型无关的对齐方法，通过动态重分布模型输出概率来增强LLMs与人类意图的对齐效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型的广泛应用，确保模型响应与人类意图对齐成为关键挑战，而传统的再训练或监督方法成本高昂且效率低下。

Method: SDA基于用户定义的对齐指令动态重分布模型输出概率，无需微调，轻量且资源高效，支持个性化偏好对齐。

Result: 在8个开源LLMs上的实验表明，SDA在helpfulness、harmlessness和honesty三个对齐维度上分别平均提升了64.4%、11.5%和30%。

Conclusion: SDA是一种有效且通用的对齐框架，能够显著提升LLMs的对齐性能，适用于多种模型和应用场景。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), their deployment in real-world applications has become increasingly widespread. LLMs are expected to deliver robust performance across diverse tasks, user preferences, and practical scenarios. However, as demands grow, ensuring that LLMs produce responses aligned with human intent remains a foundational challenge. In particular, aligning model behavior effectively and efficiently during inference, without costly retraining or extensive supervision, is both a critical requirement and a non-trivial technical endeavor. To address the challenge, we propose SDA (Steering-Driven Distribution Alignment), a training-free and model-agnostic alignment framework designed for open-source LLMs. SDA dynamically redistributes model output probabilities based on user-defined alignment instructions, enhancing alignment between model behavior and human intents without fine-tuning. The method is lightweight, resource-efficient, and compatible with a wide range of open-source LLMs. It can function independently during inference or be integrated with training-based alignment strategies. Moreover, SDA supports personalized preference alignment, enabling flexible control over the model response behavior. Empirical results demonstrate that SDA consistently improves alignment performance across 8 open-source LLMs with varying scales and diverse origins, evaluated on three key alignment dimensions, helpfulness, harmlessness, and honesty (3H). Specifically, SDA achieves average gains of 64.4% in helpfulness, 30% in honesty and 11.5% in harmlessness across the tested models, indicating its effectiveness and generalization across diverse models and application scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的强化学习奖励机制只关注最终答案正确性，无法对内部推理过程提供详细监督，导致推理质量不佳，出现过度思考、思考不足、冗余思考和无序思考等问题。

Method: 采用选择性重写方法，只重写模型持续正确的"简单"样本，在一个批次中同时进行重写和普通生成，保持强化学习算法的可扩展性，仅增加约10%的开销。

Conclusion: 自重写框架能有效提升推理模型的内部思维过程质量，在保持强化学习可扩展性的同时显著改善推理准确性和效率。

Abstract: Through reinforcement learning (RL) with outcome correctness rewards, large reasoning models (LRMs) with scaled inference computation have demonstrated substantial success on complex reasoning tasks. However, the one-sided reward, focused solely on final correctness, limits its ability to provide detailed supervision over internal reasoning process. This deficiency leads to suboptimal internal reasoning quality, manifesting as issues like over-thinking, under-thinking, redundant-thinking, and disordered-thinking. Inspired by the recent progress in LRM self-rewarding, we introduce self-rewriting framework, where a model rewrites its own reasoning texts, and subsequently learns from the rewritten reasoning to improve the internal thought process quality. For algorithm design, we propose a selective rewriting approach wherein only "simple" samples, defined by the model's consistent correctness, are rewritten, thereby preserving all original reward signals of GRPO. For practical implementation, we compile rewriting and vanilla generation within one single batch, maintaining the scalability of the RL algorithm and introducing only ~10% overhead. Extensive experiments on diverse tasks with different model sizes validate the effectiveness of self-rewriting. In terms of the accuracy-length tradeoff, the self-rewriting approach achieves improved accuracy (+0.6) with substantially shorter reasoning (-46%) even without explicit instructions in rewriting prompts to reduce reasoning length, outperforming existing strong baselines. In terms of internal reasoning quality, self-rewriting achieves significantly higher scores (+7.2) under the LLM-as-a-judge metric, successfully mitigating internal reasoning flaws.

*Blake Matheny,Phuong Minh Nguyen,Minh Le Nguyen,Stephanie Reynolds*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文创建了三个数据集用于评估预训练语言模型处理习语和比喻语言的能力，包括一个大尺度潜在习语数据集和两个人工标注的确切习语数据集，通过槽位标注和序列标注任务进行基准测试。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 习语和比喻语言在口语和书面语中占很大比例，但大型语言模型在这方面表现不佳。虽然微调方法有效，但需要更好更大的数据集来缩小这一差距。

Method: 使用现有习语数据集获取综合习语列表，从大型语料库中检索上下文序列，创建三个数据集并进行后处理以实现模型无关的训练兼容性。

Result: 创建了一个大规模潜在习语数据集和两个人工标注的确切习语数据集，用于评估预训练语言模型在习语识别任务中的基准能力。

Conclusion: 这些数据集为构建新模型和开发新方法提供了多样化的类别基础，有助于提升语言模型处理比喻语言的能力。

Abstract: Idiomatic and figurative language form a large portion of colloquial speech and writing. With social media, this informal language has become more easily observable to people and trainers of large language models (LLMs) alike. While the advantage of large corpora seems like the solution to all machine learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) problems, idioms and figurative language continue to elude LLMs. Finetuning approaches are proving to be optimal, but better and larger datasets can help narrow this gap even further. The datasets presented in this paper provide one answer, while offering a diverse set of categories on which to build new models and develop new approaches. A selection of recent idiom and figurative language datasets were used to acquire a combined idiom list, which was used to retrieve context sequences from a large corpus. One large-scale dataset of potential idiomatic and figurative language expressions and two additional human-annotated datasets of definite idiomatic and figurative language expressions were created to evaluate the baseline ability of pre-trained language models in handling figurative meaning through idiom recognition (detection) tasks. The resulting datasets were post-processed for model agnostic training compatibility, utilized in training, and evaluated on slot labeling and sequence tagging.

### [124] [Learning from Sufficient Rationales: Analysing the Relationship Between Explanation Faithfulness and Token-level Regularisation Strategies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16353)
*Jonathan Kamp,Lisa Beinborn,Antske Fokkens*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文分析了自然语言解释（rationales）的充分性指标，发现其局限性在于无法系统捕捉rationales对模型性能的影响，并探讨了rationales在token分类和注意力正则化中的不同作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的rationales充分性指标只能评估rationales的信息量，但无法深入了解rationales信息对模型性能的具体影响，需要更系统地分析rationales在不同建模范式中的作用。

Method: 通过将充分性与两种建模范式联系起来：通过token分类识别rationales中的token，以及通过注意力正则化在输入中融入rationales来提升模型性能。

Result: 发现高度信息化的rationales不一定有助于正确分类实例；充分性反而捕捉了非rationalized上下文对分类的影响；融入rationales信息可以提升跨域分类但结果不一致；充分性与token分类似乎无关。

Conclusion: rationales的复杂性表明需要开发能够系统捕捉此类信息的指标，现有充分性指标存在局限性，需要进一步研究更全面的评估方法。

Abstract: Human explanations of natural language, rationales, form a tool to assess whether models learn a label for the right reasons or rely on dataset-specific shortcuts. Sufficiency is a common metric for estimating the informativeness of rationales, but it provides limited insight into the effects of rationale information on model performance. We address this limitation by relating sufficiency to two modelling paradigms: the ability of models to identify which tokens are part of the rationale (through token classification) and the ability of improving model performance by incorporating rationales in the input (through attention regularisation). We find that highly informative rationales are not likely to help classify the instance correctly. Sufficiency conversely captures the classification impact of the non-rationalised context, which interferes with rationale information in the same input. We also find that incorporating rationale information in model inputs can boost cross-domain classification, but results are inconsistent per task and model type. Finally, sufficiency and token classification appear to be unrelated. These results exemplify the complexity of rationales, showing that metrics capable of systematically capturing this type of information merit further investigation.

TL;DR: MinerU-HTML是一个基于语言模型的HTML到文本提取管道，通过序列标注方法显著提升网页内容提取质量，特别是在保留结构化元素方面表现优异，并构建了AICC语料库证明提取质量对下游模型性能有重要影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有网页语料库主要依赖启发式提取器（如Trafilatura），这些方法难以保留文档结构和结构化元素（如公式、代码、表格），而作者认为提升提取质量对下游性能的影响可能与积极过滤策略同样重要。

Method: 将内容提取重新定义为序列标注问题，使用0.6B参数的语言模型解决，采用两阶段格式化管道：先明确分类语义元素，再转换为Markdown格式，利用语义理解而非文本密度启发式方法。

Result: 在MainWebBench基准测试中，MinerU-HTML达到81.8% ROUGE-N F1，显著优于Trafilatura的63.6%，在结构化元素保留方面表现卓越（代码块90.9%，公式94.0%）。基于此构建的AICC语料库在13个基准测试中平均准确率达到50.8%，比Trafilatura提取的语料库提升1.08个百分点。

Conclusion: HTML提取是网页语料库构建中关键但常被低估的组成部分，基于模型的方法具有内在可扩展性，而启发式方法的改进路径有限。

Abstract: While web data quality is crucial for large language models, most curation efforts focus on filtering and deduplication,treating HTML-to-text extraction as a fixed pre-processing step. Existing web corpora rely on heuristic-based extractors like Trafilatura, which struggle to preserve document structure and frequently corrupt structured elements such as formulas, codes, and tables. We hypothesize that improving extraction quality can be as impactful as aggressive filtering strategies for downstream performance. We introduce MinerU-HTML, a novel extraction pipeline that reformulates content extraction as a sequence labeling problem solved by a 0.6B-parameter language model. Unlike text-density heuristics, MinerU-HTML leverages semantic understanding and employs a two-stage formatting pipeline that explicitly categorizes semantic elements before converting to Markdown. Crucially, its model-based approach is inherently scalable, whereas heuristic methods offer limited improvement pathways. On MainWebBench, our benchmark of 7,887 annotated web pages, MinerU-HTML achieves 81.8\% ROUGE-N F1 compared to Trafilatura's 63.6\%, with exceptional structured element preservation (90.9\% for code blocks, 94.0\% for formulas). Using MinerU-HTML, we construct AICC (AI-ready Common Crawl), a 7.3-trillion token multilingual corpus from two Common Crawl snapshots. In controlled pretraining experiments where AICC and Trafilatura-extracted TfCC undergo identical filtering, models trained on AICC (62B tokens) achieve 50.8\% average accuracy across 13 benchmarks, outperforming TfCC by 1.08pp-providing direct evidence that extraction quality significantly impacts model capabilities. AICC also surpasses RefinedWeb and FineWeb on key benchmarks. We publicly release MainWebBench, MinerU-HTML, and AICC, demonstrating that HTML extraction is a critical, often underestimated component of web corpus construction.

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了机器学习和深度学习模型能否有效区分感知低质量与高质量新闻文章，使用140万+新闻文章数据集，发现传统机器学习（如随机森林）和深度学习模型（如ModernBERT）都能有效区分新闻质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索机器学习和深度学习模型在区分感知新闻质量方面的有效性，为新闻质量自动评估提供技术方案。

Method: 使用3种机器学习分类器和3种深度学习模型，基于141.2万篇英语新闻文章数据集，每篇文章包含194个语言特征，按专家共识将新闻源网站分为低质量与高质量两类。

Result: 随机森林准确率0.7355，ROC AUC 0.8131；ModernBERT-large最佳性能：准确率0.8744，ROC-AUC 0.9593，F1 0.8739；其他深度学习模型也表现优异。

Conclusion: 传统CPU机器学习和深度学习分类器都能有效区分全球新闻文章的感知质量，为新闻质量自动评估提供了可行技术路径。

Abstract: This study explored whether supervised machine learning and deep learning models can effectively distinguish perceived lower-quality news articles from perceived higher-quality news articles. 3 machine learning classifiers and 3 deep learning models were assessed using a newly created dataset of 1,412,272 English news articles from the Common Crawl over 2018-2024. Expert consensus ratings on 579 source websites were split at the median, creating perceived low and high-quality classes of about 706,000 articles each, with 194 linguistic features per website-level labelled article. Traditional machine learning classifiers such as the Random Forest demonstrated capable performance (0.7355 accuracy, 0.8131 ROC AUC). For deep learning, ModernBERT-large (256 context length) achieved the best performance (0.8744 accuracy; 0.9593 ROC-AUC; 0.8739 F1), followed by DistilBERT-base (512 context length) at 0.8685 accuracy and 0.9554 ROC-AUC. DistilBERT-base (256 context length) reached 0.8478 accuracy and 0.9407 ROC-AUC, while ModernBERT-base (256 context length) attained 0.8569 accuracy and 0.9470 ROC-AUC. These results suggest that the perceived quality of worldwide news articles can be effectively differentiated by traditional CPU-based machine learning classifiers and deep learning classifiers.

Motivation: 研究动机是理解Transformer模型如何处理非组合性语言（如习语），探索模型在计算效率和鲁棒性之间的平衡机制。

Method: 使用改进的路径修补算法进行电路发现和分析，识别出"习语头"（在不同习语中频繁激活的注意力头）和"增强接收"（习语词元间因早期处理而增强的注意力）。

Result: 发现习语处理具有独特的计算模式，Transformer通过特定电路机制平衡计算效率和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 这些发现为理解Transformer处理非组合性语言提供了见解，并为研究更复杂语法结构的处理提供了途径。

Abstract: We investigate the processing of idiomatic expressions in transformer-based language models using a novel set of techniques for circuit discovery and analysis. First discovering circuits via a modified path patching algorithm, we find that idiom processing exhibits distinct computational patterns. We identify and investigate ``Idiom Heads,'' attention heads that frequently activate across different idioms, as well as enhanced attention between idiom tokens due to earlier processing, which we term ``augmented reception.'' We analyze these phenomena and the general features of the discovered circuits as mechanisms by which transformers balance computational efficiency and robustness. Finally, these findings provide insights into how transformers handle non-compositional language and suggest pathways for understanding the processing of more complex grammatical constructions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TurkColBERT是首个针对土耳其语检索的全面基准，比较了密集编码器和延迟交互模型。结果显示延迟交互模型在参数效率方面表现优异，小3-5倍的模型显著优于密集编码器，并在特定领域任务中提升高达13.8%的mAP。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经信息检索系统在高资源语言中表现优异，但在形态丰富的低资源语言如土耳其语中研究不足。密集双编码器目前在土耳其语IR中占主导，但延迟交互模型尚未得到系统评估。

Method: 采用两阶段适应流程：先在土耳其语NLI/STS任务上微调英语和多语言编码器，然后使用在MS MARCO-TR上训练的PyLate将其转换为ColBERT风格的检索器。评估了10个模型在5个土耳其语BEIR数据集上的表现。

Result: 延迟交互模型表现出强大的参数效率：1.0M参数的colbert-hash-nano-tr比600M参数的turkish-e5-large小600倍，但保留了其平均mAP的71%以上。小3-5倍的延迟交互模型显著优于密集编码器，ColmmBERT-base-TR在特定领域任务中mAP提升高达13.8%。

Conclusion: TurkColBERT基准表明延迟交互模型在土耳其语检索中具有显著优势，特别是在参数效率和特定领域性能方面。MUVERA+Rerank索引算法比PLAID快3.33倍，并提供+1.7%的相对mAP增益，实现了低延迟检索。

Abstract: Neural information retrieval systems excel in high-resource languages but remain underexplored for morphologically rich, lower-resource languages such as Turkish. Dense bi-encoders currently dominate Turkish IR, yet late-interaction models -- which retain token-level representations for fine-grained matching -- have not been systematically evaluated. We introduce TurkColBERT, the first comprehensive benchmark comparing dense encoders and late-interaction models for Turkish retrieval. Our two-stage adaptation pipeline fine-tunes English and multilingual encoders on Turkish NLI/STS tasks, then converts them into ColBERT-style retrievers using PyLate trained on MS MARCO-TR. We evaluate 10 models across five Turkish BEIR datasets covering scientific, financial, and argumentative domains. Results show strong parameter efficiency: the 1.0M-parameter colbert-hash-nano-tr is 600$\times$ smaller than the 600M turkish-e5-large dense encoder while preserving over 71\% of its average mAP. Late-interaction models that are 3--5$\times$ smaller than dense encoders significantly outperform them; ColmmBERT-base-TR yields up to +13.8\% mAP on domain-specific tasks. For production-readiness, we compare indexing algorithms: MUVERA+Rerank is 3.33$\times$ faster than PLAID and offers +1.7\% relative mAP gain. This enables low-latency retrieval, with ColmmBERT-base-TR achieving 0.54 ms query times under MUVERA. We release all checkpoints, configs, and evaluation scripts. Limitations include reliance on moderately sized datasets ($\leq$50K documents) and translated benchmarks, which may not fully reflect real-world Turkish retrieval conditions; larger-scale MUVERA evaluations remain necessary.

Result: 在两个数据集上分别达到98%和71%的F1分数，结果始终优于控制任务

Conclusion: 证明了使用浅层学习模型可以从LLM中推断文本体裁，为理解LLM内部表示提供了概念验证

Abstract: Understanding Large Language Models (LLMs) is key to ensure their safe and beneficial deployment. This task is complicated by the difficulty of interpretability of LLM structures, and the inability to have all their outputs human-evaluated. In this paper, we present the first step towards a predictive framework, where the genre of a text used to prompt an LLM, is predicted based on its activations. Using Mistral-7B and two datasets, we show that genre can be extracted with F1-scores of up to 98% and 71% using scikit-learn classifiers. Across both datasets, results consistently outperform the control task, providing a proof of concept that text genres can be inferred from LLMs with shallow learning models.

Method: 建立专家标注的黄金标准基准，使用GEPA优化LLM-as-a-Judge方法，让Gemini-2.5-Pro模拟临床专家评估

Conclusion: 提供了从简单文本保真度转向临床安全评估的验证自动化框架，为临床对话ASR系统安全评估提供可扩展方案

Abstract: As Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) is increasingly deployed in clinical dialogue, standard evaluations still rely heavily on Word Error Rate (WER). This paper challenges that standard, investigating whether WER or other common metrics correlate with the clinical impact of transcription errors. We establish a gold-standard benchmark by having expert clinicians compare ground-truth utterances to their ASR-generated counterparts, labeling the clinical impact of any discrepancies found in two distinct doctor-patient dialogue datasets. Our analysis reveals that WER and a comprehensive suite of existing metrics correlate poorly with the clinician-assigned risk labels (No, Minimal, or Significant Impact). To bridge this evaluation gap, we introduce an LLM-as-a-Judge, programmatically optimized using GEPA to replicate expert clinical assessment. The optimized judge (Gemini-2.5-Pro) achieves human-comparable performance, obtaining 90% accuracy and a strong Cohen's $κ$ of 0.816. This work provides a validated, automated framework for moving ASR evaluation beyond simple textual fidelity to a necessary, scalable assessment of safety in clinical dialogue.

TL;DR: 提出一种使用统计语言模型作为消歧oracle的方法，无需人工标注训练数据，通过将符号NLU系统生成的候选含义转换为可区分的自然语言替代项，让LLM根据上下文选择合适解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前词义消歧方法主要针对粗粒度表示（如WordNet同义词集或FrameNet框架），需要人工标注训练数据，难以自动消歧更丰富的表示（如基于OpenCyc），这些表示对于复杂推理是必需的。

Method: 将符号NLU系统生成的多个候选含义转换为可区分的自然语言替代项，使用LLM查询根据语言上下文选择合适解释，然后将选定的含义传播回符号NLU系统。

Result: 通过与人工标注的金标准答案对比评估，证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种无需人工标注训练数据的词义消歧解决方案，能够处理更丰富的语义表示，适用于复杂推理任务。

Abstract: Word sense disambiguation is a fundamental challenge in natural language understanding. Current methods are primarily aimed at coarse-grained representations (e.g. WordNet synsets or FrameNet frames) and require hand-annotated training data to construct. This makes it difficult to automatically disambiguate richer representations (e.g. built on OpenCyc) that are needed for sophisticated inference. We propose a method that uses statistical language models as oracles for disambiguation that does not require any hand-annotation of training data. Instead, the multiple candidate meanings generated by a symbolic NLU system are converted into distinguishable natural language alternatives, which are used to query an LLM to select appropriate interpretations given the linguistic context. The selected meanings are propagated back to the symbolic NLU system. We evaluate our method against human-annotated gold answers to demonstrate its effectiveness.

TL;DR: 本文比较了多模态RAG系统中的两种检索方法：基于文本分块检索和直接多模态嵌入检索。实验证明直接多模态嵌入检索显著优于基于LLM摘要的方法，在金融财报分析任务中取得13%的mAP@5绝对提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM摘要的多模态RAG系统在预处理阶段将图像转换为文本，导致关键上下文信息和视觉细节丢失，影响下游检索和问答性能。

Method: 对两种多模态RAG检索方法进行对比分析：文本分块检索（图像先被LLM摘要为文本）和直接多模态嵌入检索（图像以原生形式存储在向量空间）。在包含40个问答对的金融财报基准数据集上评估了6个LLM模型和2个多模态嵌入模型。

Result: 直接多模态嵌入检索显著优于基于LLM摘要的方法，mAP@5绝对提升13%，nDCG@5绝对提升11%，相对提升分别为32%和20%。直接多模态检索还产生更准确和事实一致的回答。

Conclusion: LLM摘要会在预处理阶段引入信息损失，而直接多模态嵌入能够保留视觉上下文信息用于检索和推理，在多模态RAG系统中具有更好的实用价值。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) have enabled Large Language Models (LLMs) to access multimodal knowledge bases containing both text and visual information such as charts, diagrams, and tables in financial documents. However, existing multimodal RAG systems rely on LLM-based summarization to convert images into text during preprocessing, storing only text representations in vector databases, which causes loss of contextual information and visual details critical for downstream retrieval and question answering. To address this limitation, we present a comprehensive comparative analysis of two retrieval approaches for multimodal RAG systems, including text-based chunk retrieval (where images are summarized into text before embedding) and direct multimodal embedding retrieval (where images are stored natively in the vector space). We evaluate all three approaches across 6 LLM models and a two multi-modal embedding models on a newly created financial earnings call benchmark comprising 40 question-answer pairs, each paired with 2 documents (1 image and 1 text chunk). Experimental results demonstrate that direct multimodal embedding retrieval significantly outperforms LLM-summary-based approaches, achieving absolute improvements of 13% in mean average precision (mAP@5) and 11% in normalized discounted cumulative gain. These gains correspond to relative improvements of 32% in mAP@5 and 20% in nDCG@5, providing stronger evidence of their practical impact. We additionally find that direct multimodal retrieval produces more accurate and factually consistent answers as measured by LLM-as-a-judge pairwise comparisons. We demonstrate that LLM summarization introduces information loss during preprocessing, whereas direct multimodal embeddings preserve visual context for retrieval and inference.

TL;DR: Nemotron Elastic是一个框架，通过在单个父模型中嵌入多个嵌套子模型来构建推理导向的LLM，这些子模型针对不同的部署配置和预算进行优化，无需额外训练即可零样本提取。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 训练针对多个规模和部署目标的大型语言模型家族成本过高，需要为每个不同大小的模型进行单独训练。现有的模型压缩方法虽然降低了成本，但每个压缩模型仍需数百亿token的训练成本。

Method: 采用混合Mamba-Attention架构，通过端到端训练的路由器与两阶段训练课程相结合，引入组感知SSM弹性化、异构MLP弹性化、基于归一化MSE的层重要性评估以及知识蒸馏，实现同时多预算优化。

Result: 应用于Nemotron Nano V2 12B模型，仅使用110B训练token同时生成9B和6B模型，相比从头训练模型家族成本降低360倍以上，相比最先进的压缩技术降低约7倍。每个嵌套模型在准确性上达到或超过最先进水平。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅大幅降低了模型家族训练成本，还实现了多合一推理模型，使部署内存相对于模型家族中的模型数量保持恒定，这是其他压缩方法无法实现的。

Abstract: Training a family of large language models targeting multiple scales and deployment objectives is prohibitively expensive, requiring separate training runs for each different size. Recent work on model compression through pruning and knowledge distillation has reduced this cost; however, this process still incurs hundreds of billions of tokens worth of training cost per compressed model. In this paper, we present Nemotron Elastic, a framework for building reasoning-oriented LLMs, including hybrid Mamba-Attention architectures, that embed multiple nested submodels within a single parent model, each optimized for different deployment configurations and budgets. Each of these submodels shares weights with the parent model and can be extracted zero-shot during deployment without additional training or fine-tuning. We enable this functionality through an end-to-end trained router, tightly coupled to a two-stage training curriculum designed specifically for reasoning models. We additionally introduce group-aware SSM elastification that preserves Mamba's structural constraints, heterogeneous MLP elastification, normalized MSE-based layer importance for improved depth selection, and knowledge distillation enabling simultaneous multi-budget optimization. We apply Nemotron Elastic to the Nemotron Nano V2 12B model, simultaneously producing a 9B and a 6B model using only 110B training tokens; this results in over 360x cost reduction compared to training model families from scratch, and around 7x compared to SoTA compression techniques. Each of the nested models performs on par or better than the SoTA in accuracy. Moreover, unlike other compression methods, the nested capability of our approach allows having a many-in-one reasoning model that has constant deployment memory against the number of models in the family.

### [136] [AskDB: An LLM Agent for Natural Language Interaction with Relational Databases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16131)
*Xuan-Quang Phan,Tan-Ha Mai,Thai-Duy Dinh,Minh-Thuan Nguyen,Lam-Son Lê*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: AskDB是一个基于Gemini 2大语言模型的智能代理，通过自然语言统一支持SQL数据库的数据分析和管理操作，解决了现有系统在复杂查询和数据库管理方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有系统通常只解决自然语言查询或狭窄的数据库管理方面，缺乏统一且智能的通用数据库交互界面，使得不同专业水平的用户在与关系数据库交互时面临挑战。

Method: 基于Gemini 2构建，集成了两个关键创新：动态模式感知提示机制（有效整合数据库元数据）和任务分解框架（支持规划和执行多步操作），能够自主调试SQL、通过实时网络搜索获取上下文信息并自适应优化响应。

Result: 在广泛使用的Text-to-SQL基准测试和精心策划的DBA任务集上评估，在分析和管场景中均表现出色。

Conclusion: AskDB作为关系数据库系统的统一智能代理具有巨大潜力，为终端用户提供直观易用的体验。

Abstract: Interacting with relational databases remains challenging for users across different expertise levels, particularly when composing complex analytical queries or performing administrative tasks. Existing systems typically address either natural language querying or narrow aspects of database administration, lacking a unified and intelligent interface for general-purpose database interaction. We introduce AskDB, a large language model powered agent designed to bridge this gap by supporting both data analysis and administrative operations over SQL databases through natural language. Built on Gemini 2, AskDB integrates two key innovations: a dynamic schema-aware prompting mechanism that effectively incorporates database metadata, and a task decomposition framework that enables the agent to plan and execute multi-step actions. These capabilities allow AskDB to autonomously debug derived SQL, retrieve contextual information via real-time web search, and adaptively refine its responses. We evaluate AskDB on a widely used Text-to-SQL benchmark and a curated set of DBA tasks, demonstrating strong performance in both analytical and administrative scenarios. Our results highlight the potential of AskDB as a unified and intelligent agent for relational database systems, offering an intuitive and accessible experience for end users.

*Marijan Soric,Cécile Gracianne,Ioana Manolescu,Pierre Senellart*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 提出了一个新的端到端表格提取基准，包含37k样本的新数据集，评估了多种表格提取方法，发现现有方法在异构数据上泛化能力不足，存在鲁棒性和可解释性限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有表格提取工具方法多样，用户难以选择合适的工具，需要系统性的评估基准来比较不同方法的性能。

Method: 设计了严格的评估流程，包括表格提取各子任务和端到端的评分，考虑模型不确定性，使用包含37k样本的两个新异构数据集。

Result: 评估了多种模型（现成库、软件工具、大视觉语言模型、计算机视觉方法），结果显示表格提取仍然具有挑战性，现有方法在异构数据上泛化能力不足。

Conclusion: 表格提取仍然是一个未解决的难题，当前方法在异构数据上的泛化能力、鲁棒性和可解释性方面存在明显限制。

Abstract: Table Extraction (TE) consists in extracting tables from PDF documents, in a structured format which can be automatically processed. While numerous TE tools exist, the variety of methods and techniques makes it difficult for users to choose an appropriate one. We propose a novel benchmark for assessing end-to-end TE methods (from PDF to the final table). We contribute an analysis of TE evaluation metrics, and the design of a rigorous evaluation process, which allows scoring each TE sub-task as well as end-to-end TE, and captures model uncertainty. Along with a prior dataset, our benchmark comprises two new heterogeneous datasets of 37k samples. We run our benchmark on diverse models, including off-the-shelf libraries, software tools, large vision language models, and approaches based on computer vision. The results demonstrate that TE remains challenging: current methods suffer from a lack of generalizability when facing heterogeneous data, and from limitations in robustness and interpretability.

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: SGLANG-LSM是一个基于LSM-tree架构的KV缓存管理系统，通过分层设计和自适应优化，显著提升LLM的缓存命中率和首token延迟性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于磁盘的KV缓存系统存在文件系统元数据开销、I/O效率低下和空间局部性差等可扩展性瓶颈，需要更高效的缓存管理方案。

Method: 采用三层协调组件：前缀保持存储引擎、自适应控制器和运行时服务，结合LSM-tree架构和键值分离技术来管理大规模KV缓存张量。

Result: 在大规模动态工作负载评估中，相比现有最优系统，缓存命中率提升高达143%，首token延迟降低高达24%。

Conclusion: 这是数据库存储架构在大规模LLM缓存管理中的首次系统性应用，证明了LSM-tree架构在该领域的有效性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) rely on Key-Value (KV) cache to reduce time- to-first-token (TTFT) latency, but existing disk-based KV cache systems using file-per-object layouts suffer from severe scalability bottlenecks due to file system metadata overhead, I/O inefficiency, and poor spatial locality. This paper presents SGLANG-LSM, a database-inspired system that leverages Log-Structured Merge- tree (LSM-tree) architectures for scalable KV cache management. SGLANG-LSM implements a layered system design with three coordinated components: (1) a prefix-preserving storage engine that maintains token sequence locality while efficiently storing large KV cache tensors through key-value separation, (2) an adaptive controller that dynamically optimizes LSM-tree configurations based on shifting workload characteristics, and (3) runtime services including batch opera- tions and automatic resource management for production deployment. Evaluation on large-scale dynamic workloads demonstrates that SGLANG-LSM significantly improves cache hits by up to 143% and reduces TTFT by up to 24% compared to state-of-the-art systems, representing the first systematic application of database storage architectures to large-scale LLM cache management.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有玻璃数据库信息有限，需要扩展数据量和多样性来支持机器学习模型开发新型玻璃材料

Method: 采用网络爬虫技术从专利表格中提取信息，进行数据清洗和结构化处理，构建包含玻璃成分和性能的数据库

Result: 提取了5,696个液相温度数据、4,298个折射率数据和1,771个阿贝数数据，分别增加了现有数据库10.4%、6.6%和4.9%的数据量，新数据具有更丰富的成分多样性

Conclusion: 新构建的数据库显著扩展了玻璃成分和性能的可访问空间，特别在钛、镁、锆、铌、铁、锡和钇氧化物成分方面提供了更多样化的数据

Abstract: In this work, we present web scraping techniques to extract in- formation from patent tables, clean and structure them for future use in predictive machine learning models to develop new glasses. We extracted compositions and three properties relevant to the development of new glasses and structured them into a database to be used together with information from other available datasets. We also analyzed the consistency of the information obtained and what it adds to the existing databases. The extracted liquidus temperatures comprise 5,696 compositions; the second subset includes 4,298 refractive indexes and, finally, 1,771 compositions with Abbe numbers. The extraction performed here increases the available information by approximately 10.4% for liquidus temperature, 6.6% for refractive index, and 4.9% for Abbe number. The impact extends beyond quantity: the newly extracted data introduce compositions with property values that are more diverse than those in existing databases, thereby expanding the accessible compositional and property space for glass modeling applications. We emphasize that the compositions of the new database contain relatively more titanium, magnesium, zirconium, niobium, iron, tin, and yttrium oxides than those of the existing bases.

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 本文首次全面分析了基于计划的AQP策略，发现在不同存储架构的数据库中，性能提升的来源存在显著差异：磁盘数据库中主要来自查询计划重排序，而内存数据库中主要来自基数估计精化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 不可靠的基数估计仍然是数据库管理系统中的关键性能瓶颈，而基于计划的AQP策略通过子计划执行的反馈来增量精化基数估计，但其实际改进原因在不同存储架构中尚未被探索。

Method: 在磁盘数据库（PostgreSQL）和内存数据库（DuckDB）上实现并评估了最先进的基于计划的AQP策略，使用两个基准测试进行综合分析。

Result: 在磁盘数据库中，性能提升主要来自查询计划重排序，基数更新机制反而带来可测量的开销；在内存数据库中，基数精化对大多数查询带来显著性能改进。基于计划的AQP相比最先进的基于关系的AQP方法表现出显著性能优势。

Conclusion: 这些发现为研究人员提供了关于基于计划的AQP何时以及为何有效的关键见解，并为数据库系统开发者在实现努力与性能改进之间的权衡提供了指导。

Abstract: Unreliable cardinality estimation remains a critical performance bottleneck in database management systems (DBMSs). Adaptive Query Processing (AQP) strategies address this limitation by providing a more robust query execution mechanism. Specifically, plan-based AQP achieves this by incrementally refining cardinality using feedback from the execution of sub-plans. However, the actual reason behind the improvements of plan-based AQP, especially across different storage architectures (on-disk vs. in-memory DBMSs), remains unexplored.
  This paper presents the first comprehensive analysis of state-of-the-art plan-based AQP. We implement and evaluate this strategy on both on-disk and in-memory DBMSs across two benchmarks. Our key findings reveal that while plan-based AQP provides overall speedups in both environments, the sources of improvement differ significantly. In the on-disk DBMS, PostgreSQL, performance gains primarily come from the query plan reorderings, but not the cardinality updating mechanism; in fact, updating cardinalities introduces measurable overhead. Conversely, in the in-memory DBMS, DuckDB, cardinality refinement drives significant performance improvements for most queries. We also observe significant performance benefits of the plan-based AQP compared to a state-of-the-art related-based AQP method. These observations provide crucial insights for researchers on when and why plan-based AQP is effective, and ultimately guide database system developers on the tradeoffs between the implementation effort and performance improvements.

TL;DR: 提出了一种集成大语言模型框架(eLLM)，通过集成多个模型解决单个系统的不一致性、幻觉、类别膨胀和误分类问题，在零样本条件下将F1分数提升了65%，达到接近人类专家的性能水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决单个大语言模型在文本分类中的常见弱点，包括不一致性、幻觉、类别膨胀和误分类，提供可扩展且可靠的基于分类法的分类解决方案。

Method: 开发了集成大语言模型(eLLM)框架，通过集体决策的数学模型和原则性聚合标准，在IAB分层分类法下评估10个最先进的LLM，使用8,660个人工标注样本进行零样本测试。

Result: eLLM框架相比最强单模型F1分数提升高达65%，个体模型由于将语义丰富的文本压缩为稀疏分类表示而性能停滞，eLLM同时提高了鲁棒性和准确性，达到接近人类专家的性能水平。

Conclusion: eLLM框架为基于分类法的分类提供了可扩展且可靠的解决方案，可能显著减少对人类专家标注的依赖，通过模型多样性实现接近人类专家的性能。

Abstract: This study introduces an ensemble framework for unstructured text categorization using large language models (LLMs). By integrating multiple models, the ensemble large language model (eLLM) framework addresses common weaknesses of individual systems, including inconsistency, hallucination, category inflation, and misclassification. The eLLM approach yields a substantial performance improvement of up to 65\% in F1-score over the strongest single model. We formalize the ensemble process through a mathematical model of collective decision-making and establish principled aggregation criteria. Using the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) hierarchical taxonomy, we evaluate ten state-of-the-art LLMs under identical zero-shot conditions on a human-annotated corpus of 8{,}660 samples. Results show that individual models plateau in performance due to the compression of semantically rich text into sparse categorical representations, while eLLM improves both robustness and accuracy. With a diverse consortium of models, eLLM achieves near human-expert-level performance, offering a scalable and reliable solution for taxonomy-based classification that may significantly reduce dependence on human expert labeling.

TL;DR: 提出了Graph-Memoized Reasoning框架，通过图结构记忆来存储和复用推理工作流，以减少重复计算并提高推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代大语言模型推理系统经常在不同任务中重复计算相似的推理步骤，浪费计算资源、增加推理延迟并限制可重现性，需要持久化推理机制来召回和复用先前的计算轨迹。

Method: 引入图记忆推理框架，将推理工作流表示为图结构记忆，通过结构和语义相似性检索过去的决策图，实现跨新推理任务的子图组合复用。

Result: 制定了最小化总推理成本并正则化存储与生成工作流不一致性的优化目标，为智能系统中的效率-一致性权衡提供了理论基础。

Conclusion: 该框架为可解释、成本高效和自我改进的推理架构奠定了基础，向大规模智能系统中的持久化记忆迈出了一步。

Abstract: Modern large language model-based reasoning systems frequently recompute similar reasoning steps across tasks, wasting computational resources, inflating inference latency, and limiting reproducibility. These inefficiencies underscore the need for persistent reasoning mechanisms that can recall and reuse prior computational traces.
  We introduce Graph-Memoized Reasoning, a formal framework for representing, storing, and reusing reasoning workflows as graph-structured memory. By encoding past decision graphs and retrieving them through structural and semantic similarity, our approach enables compositional reuse of subgraphs across new reasoning tasks.
  We formulate an optimization objective that minimizes total reasoning cost regularized by inconsistency between stored and generated workflows, providing a theoretical foundation for efficiency-consistency trade-offs in intelligent systems. We outline a conceptual evaluation protocol aligned with the proposed optimization objective.
  This framework establishes the groundwork for interpretable, cost-efficient, and self-improving reasoning architectures, offering a step toward persistent memory in large-scale agentic systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前企业不信任AI智能体处理生产数据，因为传统湖仓架构无法满足智能体的访问模式需求。作者认为解决基础设施问题是实现可信智能体工作流的第一步。

Method: 借鉴数据库MVCC的操作类比，但发现直接移植在解耦、多语言环境中会失败。提出Bauplan设计，在湖仓中重新实现数据和计算隔离机制。

Result: 开发了Bauplan的参考实现，展示了一个自修复管道，能够无缝结合智能体推理与所需的正确性和可信保证。

Conclusion: 通过设计以智能体为先的湖仓架构，可以实现可信的智能体工作流，其中基础设施设计是实现治理的基础。

Abstract: Even as AI capabilities improve, most enterprises do not consider agents trustworthy enough to work on production data. In this paper, we argue that the path to trustworthy agentic workflows begins with solving the infrastructure problem first: traditional lakehouses are not suited for agent access patterns, but if we design one around transactions, governance follows. In particular, we draw an operational analogy to MVCC in databases and show why a direct transplant fails in a decoupled, multi-language setting. We then propose an agent-first design, Bauplan, that reimplements data and compute isolation in the lakehouse. We conclude by sharing a reference implementation of a self-healing pipeline in Bauplan, which seamlessly couples agent reasoning with all the desired guarantees for correctness and trust.

TL;DR: MACIE是一个多智能体因果智能解释框架，结合结构因果模型、干预反事实和Shapley值，为多智能体强化学习系统提供全面解释，包括个体因果贡献、系统级涌现智能和可操作的自然语言解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着多智能体强化学习系统在安全关键应用中使用，理解智能体决策原因和集体行为实现方式变得至关重要。现有的可解释AI方法在多智能体环境中存在不足，无法将集体结果归因于个体、量化涌现行为或捕捉复杂交互。

Method: MACIE框架结合结构因果模型、干预反事实和Shapley值，通过干预归因分数评估每个智能体的因果贡献，使用协同指标分离集体效应与个体贡献来量化系统级涌现智能，并通过自然语言叙述合成因果洞察提供可操作解释。

Result: 在四个MARL场景（合作、竞争和混合动机）中评估显示：准确的结果归因（平均φ_i=5.07，标准差<0.05）、合作任务中检测到正涌现（协同指数高达0.461）、高效计算（CPU上每个数据集0.79秒）。

Conclusion: MACIE独特地结合了因果严谨性、涌现量化和多智能体支持，同时保持实时使用的实用性，代表了向可解释、可信赖和可问责的多智能体AI迈出的一步。

Abstract: As Multi Agent Reinforcement Learning systems are used in safety critical applications. Understanding why agents make decisions and how they achieve collective behavior is crucial. Existing explainable AI methods struggle in multi agent settings. They fail to attribute collective outcomes to individuals, quantify emergent behaviors, or capture complex interactions. We present MACIE Multi Agent Causal Intelligence Explainer, a framework combining structural causal models, interventional counterfactuals, and Shapley values to provide comprehensive explanations. MACIE addresses three questions. First, each agent's causal contribution using interventional attribution scores. Second, system level emergent intelligence through synergy metrics separating collective effects from individual contributions. Third, actionable explanations using natural language narratives synthesizing causal insights. We evaluate MACIE across four MARL scenarios: cooperative, competitive, and mixed motive. Results show accurate outcome attribution, mean phi_i equals 5.07, standard deviation less than 0.05, detection of positive emergence in cooperative tasks, synergy index up to 0.461, and efficient computation, 0.79 seconds per dataset on CPU. MACIE uniquely combines causal rigor, emergence quantification, and multi agent support while remaining practical for real time use. This represents a step toward interpretable, trustworthy, and accountable multi agent AI.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了不同模态（文本和图像）如何影响模型在ARC-AGI任务中的感知能力，发现结构化文本能精确捕捉稀疏特征坐标，图像能保持2D形状但对分辨率敏感，结合两者可提升执行效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前指令优先系统在ARC-AGI任务中缺乏对编码方式如何影响模型感知的原则性理解，以及如何区分指令错误和执行错误。作者假设不同模态会施加不同的感知瓶颈。

Method: 使用加权集合分歧度量和两阶段推理流程，在九种文本和图像模态中分离感知与推理，测试模态对网格特征感知的影响。

Result: 结构化文本在稀疏特征坐标上表现精确，图像能捕捉2D形状但对分辨率敏感，结合两者可提升执行效果（约8个感知点；约0.20中位数相似度）。

Conclusion: 将表示与transformer归纳偏置对齐，并启用文本和图像之间的交叉验证，可在不改变底层模型的情况下产生更准确的指令和更可靠的执行。

Abstract: ARC-AGI and ARC-AGI-2 measure generalization-through-composition on small color-quantized grids, and their prize competitions make progress on these harder held-out tasks a meaningful proxy for systematic generalization. Recent instruction-first systems translate grids into concise natural-language or DSL rules executed in generate-execute-select loops, yet we lack a principled account of how encodings shape model perception and how to separate instruction errors from execution errors. We hypothesize that modality imposes perceptual bottlenecks -- text flattens 2D structure into 1D tokens while images preserve layout but can introduce patch-size aliasing -- thereby shaping which grid features are reliably perceived. To test this, we isolate perception from reasoning across nine text and image modalities using a weighted set-disagreement metric and a two-stage reasoning pipeline, finding that structured text yields precise coordinates on sparse features, images capture 2D shapes yet are resolution-sensitive, and combining them improves execution (about 8 perception points; about 0.20 median similarity). Overall, aligning representations with transformer inductive biases and enabling cross-validation between text and image yields more accurate instructions and more reliable execution without changing the underlying model.

Conclusion: ToolMind通过大规模高质量数据合成和细粒度验证，缓解了训练过程中的错误放大问题，同时保留了自我纠正推理信号，为稳健的工具使用学习提供了重要支持。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have developed rapidly in recent years to solve complex real-world problems using external tools. However, the scarcity of high-quality trajectories still hinders the development of stronger LLM agents. Most existing works on multi-turn dialogue synthesis validate correctness only at the trajectory level, which may overlook turn-level errors that can propagate during training and degrade model performance. To address these limitations, we introduce ToolMind, a large-scale, high-quality tool-agentic dataset with 160k synthetic data instances generated using over 20k tools and 200k augmented open-source data instances. Our data synthesis pipeline first constructs a function graph based on parameter correlations and then uses a multi-agent framework to simulate realistic user-assistant-tool interactions. Beyond trajectory-level validation, we employ fine-grained turn-level filtering to remove erroneous or suboptimal steps, ensuring that only high-quality reasoning traces are retained. This approach mitigates error amplification during training while preserving self-corrective reasoning signals essential for robust tool-use learning. Models fine-tuned on ToolMind show significant improvements over baselines on several benchmarks.

Motivation: 解决LLM在处理外部网页内容时面临的格式不友好和上下文长度限制问题，使网页内容更易于LLM访问和使用。

Method: 基于黑格尔辩证法思想，通过初始摘要（正题）、质疑限制（反题）、生成通用摘要（合题）的迭代过程，创建信息密集的纯文本摘要库。

Result: 在TriviaQA、TruthfulQA和SQUAD数据集上，CoS比零样本LLM基线提升高达66%，比专业摘要方法如BRIO和PEGASUS提升高达27%，同时所需token数大幅减少且与下游LLM无关。

Conclusion: CoS为网站维护者提供了一种使内容更易于LLM访问的有吸引力的选择，同时保留了人工监督的可能性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly using external web content. However, much of this content is not easily digestible by LLMs due to LLM-unfriendly formats and limitations of context length. To address this issue, we propose a method for generating general-purpose, information-dense summaries that act as plain-text repositories of web content. Inspired by Hegel's dialectical method, our approach, denoted as Chain of Summaries (CoS), iteratively refines an initial summary (thesis) by identifying its limitations through questioning (antithesis), leading to a general-purpose summary (synthesis) that can satisfy current and anticipate future information needs. Experiments on the TriviaQA, TruthfulQA, and SQUAD datasets demonstrate that CoS outperforms zero-shot LLM baselines by up to 66% and specialized summarization methods such as BRIO and PEGASUS by up to 27%. CoS-generated summaries yield higher Q&A performance compared to the source content, while requiring substantially fewer tokens and being agnostic to the specific downstream LLM. CoS thus resembles an appealing option for website maintainers to make their content more accessible for LLMs, while retaining possibilities for human oversight.

Conclusion: 多模态AI框架能够有效结合文本和视觉数据识别建筑安全隐患，轻量级开源模型在特定场景下可替代专有模型，为资源受限环境下的安全监控提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: This thesis explores a multimodal AI framework for enhancing construction safety through the combined analysis of textual and visual data. In safety-critical environments such as construction sites, accident data often exists in multiple formats, such as written reports, inspection records, and site imagery, making it challenging to synthesize hazards using traditional approaches. To address this, this thesis proposed a multimodal AI framework that combines text and image analysis to assist in identifying safety hazards on construction sites. Two case studies were consucted to evaluate the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) for automated hazard identification.The first case study introduces a hybrid pipeline that utilizes GPT 4o and GPT 4o mini to extract structured insights from a dataset of 28,000 OSHA accident reports (2000-2025). The second case study extends this investigation using Molmo 7B and Qwen2 VL 2B, lightweight, open-source VLMs. Using the public ConstructionSite10k dataset, the performance of the two models was evaluated on rule-level safety violation detection using natural language prompts. This experiment served as a cost-aware benchmark against proprietary models and allowed testing at scale with ground-truth labels. Despite their smaller size, Molmo 7B and Quen2 VL 2B showed competitive performance in certain prompt configurations, reinforcing the feasibility of low-resource multimodal systems for rule-aware safety monitoring.

While existing surveys often categorize recent progress based on input modality (e.g., text, image, video, or 3D), we argue that spatial ability is not solely determined by the input format. Instead, our survey introduces a taxonomy that organizes spatial intelligence from cognitive aspect and divides tasks in terms of reasoning complexity, linking them to several cognitive functions. We map existing benchmarks across text only, vision language, and embodied settings onto this taxonomy, and review evaluation metrics and methodologies for assessing spatial reasoning ability. This cognitive perspective enables more principled cross-task comparisons and reveals critical gaps between current model capabilities and human-like reasoning. In addition, we analyze methods for improving spatial ability, spanning both training-based and reasoning-based approaches. This dual perspective analysis clarifies their respective strengths, uncovers complementary mechanisms. By surveying tasks, benchmarks, and recent advances, we aim to provide new researchers with a comprehensive understanding of the field and actionable directions for future research.

### [150] [Uncertainty-Resilient Multimodal Learning via Consistency-Guided Cross-Modal Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15741)
*Hyo-Jeong Jang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于一致性引导跨模态迁移的不确定性弹性多模态学习框架，通过跨模态语义一致性实现鲁棒表示学习，在噪声和不完整监督条件下提升模型稳定性和判别能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态学习系统面临数据噪声、低质量标签和模态异质性等不确定性挑战，特别是在人机交互场景中数据质量和标注一致性变化较大，需要开发对不确定性具有弹性的学习方法。

Method: 通过将异构模态投影到共享潜在空间来缓解模态差距，利用跨模态语义一致性指导表示学习，支持不确定性估计和稳定特征学习，不依赖大规模高质量标注。

Result: 在多模态情感识别基准测试中，一致性引导跨模态迁移显著提高了模型稳定性、判别能力和对噪声或不完整监督的鲁棒性，潜在空间分析显示即使在挑战性条件下也能捕获可靠的跨模态结构。

Conclusion: 该论文通过整合不确定性建模、语义对齐和数据高效监督，为弹性多模态学习提供了统一视角，为开发可靠和自适应的脑机接口系统提供了实用见解。

Abstract: Multimodal learning systems often face substantial uncertainty due to noisy data, low-quality labels, and heterogeneous modality characteristics. These issues become especially critical in human-computer interaction settings, where data quality, semantic reliability, and annotation consistency vary across users and recording conditions. This thesis tackles these challenges by exploring uncertainty-resilient multimodal learning through consistency-guided cross-modal transfer. The central idea is to use cross-modal semantic consistency as a basis for robust representation learning. By projecting heterogeneous modalities into a shared latent space, the proposed framework mitigates modality gaps and uncovers structural relations that support uncertainty estimation and stable feature learning. Building on this foundation, the thesis investigates strategies to enhance semantic robustness, improve data efficiency, and reduce the impact of noise and imperfect supervision without relying on large, high-quality annotations. Experiments on multimodal affect-recognition benchmarks demonstrate that consistency-guided cross-modal transfer significantly improves model stability, discriminative ability, and robustness to noisy or incomplete supervision. Latent space analyses further show that the framework captures reliable cross-modal structure even under challenging conditions. Overall, this thesis offers a unified perspective on resilient multimodal learning by integrating uncertainty modeling, semantic alignment, and data-efficient supervision, providing practical insights for developing reliable and adaptive brain-computer interface systems.

Motivation: 大语言模型在通用任务中表现优异，但在专业领域应用中因知识差距而效果下降，且在需要多步推理的复杂问题上性能衰退。为此，作者希望开发教育助手来提升本科生物力学课程的学习效果。

Method: 构建双模块框架：1) 使用RAG增强LLMs回答概念性判断题的特异性和逻辑一致性；2) 使用MAS解决需要多步推理和代码执行的计算导向问题。评估了Qwen-1.0-32B、Qwen-2.5-32B和Llama-70B等模型在100道生物力学问题上的表现。

Conclusion: RAG和MAS的应用展示了增强LLMs在工程专业课程中表现的潜力，为开发工程教育智能辅导系统提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable versatility across a wide range of general tasks, their effectiveness often diminishes in domain-specific applications due to inherent knowledge gaps. Moreover, their performance typically declines when addressing complex problems that require multi-step reasoning and analysis. In response to these challenges, we propose leveraging both LLMs and AI agents to develop education assistants aimed at enhancing undergraduate learning in biomechanics courses that focus on analyzing the force and moment in the musculoskeletal system of the human body. To achieve our goal, we construct a dual-module framework to enhance LLM performance in biomechanics educational tasks: 1) we apply Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to improve the specificity and logical consistency of LLM's responses to the conceptual true/false questions; 2) we build a Multi-Agent System (MAS) to solve calculation-oriented problems involving multi-step reasoning and code execution. Specifically, we evaluate the performance of several LLMs, i.e., Qwen-1.0-32B, Qwen-2.5-32B, and Llama-70B, on a biomechanics dataset comprising 100 true/false conceptual questions and problems requiring equation derivation and calculation. Our results demonstrate that RAG significantly enhances the performance and stability of LLMs in answering conceptual questions, surpassing those of vanilla models. On the other hand, the MAS constructed using multiple LLMs demonstrates its ability to perform multi-step reasoning, derive equations, execute code, and generate explainable solutions for tasks that require calculation. These findings demonstrate the potential of applying RAG and MAS to enhance LLM performance for specialized courses in engineering curricula, providing a promising direction for developing intelligent tutoring in engineering education.

TL;DR: 多智能体编排将LLM事故响应从不可用的建议转变为100%可执行的推荐，相比单智能体方法在行动特异性提升80倍，解决方案正确性提升140倍，且质量零方差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单智能体LLM方法生成模糊、不可用的建议，无法满足生产系统事故响应的实际需求，需要探索多智能体编排来提升响应质量。

Method: 开发MyAntFarm.ai容器化框架，通过348次对照试验比较单智能体副驾驶与多智能体系统在相同事故场景下的表现。

Result: 多智能体编排实现100%可执行推荐率（单智能体仅1.7%），行动特异性提升80倍，解决方案正确性提升140倍，且在所有试验中质量零方差。

Conclusion: 多智能体编排不是性能优化，而是基于LLM的事故响应系统投入生产就绪的必要条件。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) promise to accelerate incident response in production systems, yet single-agent approaches generate vague, unusable recommendations. We present MyAntFarm.ai, a reproducible containerized framework demonstrating that multi-agent orchestration fundamentally transforms LLM-based incident response quality. Through 348 controlled trials comparing single-agent copilot versus multi-agent systems on identical incident scenarios, we find that multi-agent orchestration achieves 100% actionable recommendation rate versus 1.7% for single-agent approaches, an 80 times improvement in action specificity and 140 times improvement in solution correctness. Critically, multi-agent systems exhibit zero quality variance across all trials, enabling production SLA commitments impossible with inconsistent single-agent outputs. Both architectures achieve similar comprehension latency (approx.40s), establishing that the architectural value lies in deterministic quality, not speed. We introduce Decision Quality (DQ), a novel metric capturing validity, specificity, and correctness properties essential for operational deployment that existing LLM metrics do not address. These findings reframe multi-agent orchestration from a performance optimization to a production-readiness requirement for LLM-based incident response. All code, Docker configurations, and trial data are publicly available for reproduction.

Motivation: 当前AI风险评估主要关注算法偏见和模型幻觉等问题，但缺乏对AI系统供应链（包括数据源、预训练模型、代理、服务等）的系统性风险评估，这在关键应用中尤为危险。

Method: 调查当前AI风险评估和管理现状，重点关注AI供应链风险，并提出专门的AI供应链实体分类法。

Result: 开发了一个帮助利益相关者（特别是非AI专家）系统性地识别和分类AI系统依赖关系的分类框架。

Conclusion: 该分类法在当前AI治理状态与关键应用中AI使用的可操作风险评估和管理需求之间架起了桥梁。

Abstract: Risks associated with the use of AI, ranging from algorithmic bias to model hallucinations, have received much attention and extensive research across the AI community, from researchers to end-users. However, a gap exists in the systematic assessment of supply chain risks associated with the complex web of data sources, pre-trained models, agents, services, and other systems that contribute to the output of modern AI systems. This gap is particularly problematic when AI systems are used in critical applications, such as the food supply, healthcare, utilities, law, insurance, and transport.
  We survey the current state of AI risk assessment and management, with a focus on the supply chain of AI and risks relating to the behavior and outputs of the AI system. We then present a proposed taxonomy specifically for categorizing AI supply chain entities. This taxonomy helps stakeholders, especially those without extensive AI expertise, to "consider the right questions" and systematically inventory dependencies across their organization's AI systems. Our contribution bridges a gap between the current state of AI governance and the urgent need for actionable risk assessment and management of AI use in critical applications.

Conclusion: 需要在准确性、标准化和计算成本之间进行权衡，建议采用混合方法，结合规则系统的精确性和LLM的适应性

Abstract: Extracting structured medical insights from unstructured clinical text using Natural Language Processing (NLP) remains an open challenge in healthcare, particularly in non-English contexts where resources are scarce. This study presents a comparative analysis of NLP low-compute rule-based methods and Large Language Models (LLMs) for information extraction from electronic health records (EHR) obtained from the Voivodeship Rehabilitation Hospital for Children in Ameryka, Poland. We evaluate both approaches by extracting patient demographics, clinical findings, and prescribed medications while examining the effects of lack of text normalisation and translation-induced information loss. Results demonstrate that rule-based methods provide higher accuracy in information retrieval tasks, particularly for age and sex extraction. However, LLMs offer greater adaptability and scalability, excelling in drug name recognition. The effectiveness of the LLMs was compared with texts originally in Polish and those translated into English, assessing the impact of translation. These findings highlight the trade-offs between accuracy, normalisation, and computational cost when deploying NLP in healthcare settings. We argue for hybrid approaches that combine the precision of rule-based systems with the adaptability of LLMs, offering a practical path toward more reliable and resource-efficient clinical NLP in real-world hospitals.

Result: 系统展示了响应式教学流程、有界延迟、精确的答案泄露控制，初步评估显示相比基线方法在定位和诊断推理方面有所改进。

Conclusion: IMACT-CXR证明了多智能体方法在医学图像解读教学中的有效性，具有向实际住院医师部署的可扩展性。

Abstract: IMACT-CXR is an interactive multi-agent conversational tutor that helps trainees interpret chest X-rays by unifying spatial annotation, gaze analysis, knowledge retrieval, and image-grounded reasoning in a single AutoGen-based workflow. The tutor simultaneously ingests learner bounding boxes, gaze samples, and free-text observations. Specialized agents evaluate localization quality, generate Socratic coaching, retrieve PubMed evidence, suggest similar cases from REFLACX, and trigger NV-Reason-CXR-3B for vision-language reasoning when mastery remains low or the learner explicitly asks. Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) maintains skill-specific mastery estimates that drive both knowledge reinforcement and case similarity retrieval. A lung-lobe segmentation module derived from a TensorFlow U-Net enables anatomically aware gaze feedback, and safety prompts prevent premature disclosure of ground-truth labels. We describe the system architecture, implementation highlights, and integration with the REFLACX dataset for real DICOM cases. IMACT-CXR demonstrates responsive tutoring flows with bounded latency, precise control over answer leakage, and extensibility toward live residency deployment. Preliminary evaluation shows improved localization and diagnostic reasoning compared to baselines.

Abstract: Despite rapid progress in artificial intelligence, current systems struggle with the interconnected challenges that define real-world decision making. Practical domains, such as business management, require optimizing an open-ended and multi-faceted objective, actively learning environment dynamics from sparse experience, planning over long horizons in stochastic settings, and reasoning over spatial information. Yet existing human--AI benchmarks isolate subsets of these capabilities, limiting our ability to assess holistic decision-making competence. We introduce Mini Amusement Parks (MAPs), an amusement-park simulator designed to evaluate an agent's ability to model its environment, anticipate long-term consequences under uncertainty, and strategically operate a complex business. We provide human baselines and a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LLM agents, finding that humans outperform these systems by 6.5x on easy mode and 9.8x on medium mode. Our analysis reveals persistent weaknesses in long-horizon optimization, sample-efficient learning, spatial reasoning, and world modelling. By unifying these challenges within a single environment, MAPs offers a new foundation for benchmarking agents capable of adaptable decision making. Code: https://github.com/Skyfall-Research/MAPs

Conclusion: 推理能力是跨模态可迁移的，当适当锚定时，扩展的深思熟虑可以从负担转变为音频智能的强大资产，为构建真正多模态推理系统开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning models have demonstrated remarkable success in text and vision domains through extended chain-of-thought deliberation. However, a perplexing phenomenon persists in audio language models: they consistently perform better with minimal or no reasoning, raising a fundamental question - can audio intelligence truly benefit from deliberate thinking? We introduce Step-Audio-R1, the first audio reasoning model that successfully unlocks reasoning capabilities in the audio domain. Through our proposed Modality-Grounded Reasoning Distillation (MGRD) framework, Step-Audio-R1 learns to generate audio-relevant reasoning chains that genuinely ground themselves in acoustic features rather than hallucinating disconnected deliberations. Our model exhibits strong audio reasoning capabilities, surpassing Gemini 2.5 Pro and achieving performance comparable to the state-of-the-art Gemini 3 Pro across comprehensive audio understanding and reasoning benchmarks spanning speech, environmental sounds, and music. These results demonstrate that reasoning is a transferable capability across modalities when appropriately anchored, transforming extended deliberation from a liability into a powerful asset for audio intelligence. By establishing the first successful audio reasoning model, Step-Audio-R1 opens new pathways toward building truly multimodal reasoning systems that think deeply across all sensory modalities.

Motivation: 理解激活引导如何改变LLM内部机制以提升心智理论能力，探究哪些认知过程的变化导致了不同的输出结果

Method: 使用线性探针分析45种认知动作，在Gemma-3-4B模型上应用对比激活加法引导，并在1000个BigToM前向信念场景中评估

Result: 信念归因任务准确率从32.5%提升至46.7%，情感感知(+2.23)和情感评估(+2.20)过程增强，而质疑(-0.78)和聚合思维(-1.59)等分析过程被抑制

Conclusion: LLM成功的心智理论能力主要由情感理解而非分析推理所介导

Abstract: Recent work shows activation steering substantially improves language models' Theory of Mind (ToM) (Bortoletto et al. 2024), yet the mechanisms of what changes occur internally that leads to different outputs remains unclear. We propose decomposing ToM in LLMs by comparing steered versus baseline LLMs' activations using linear probes trained on 45 cognitive actions. We applied Contrastive Activation Addition (CAA) steering to Gemma-3-4B and evaluated it on 1,000 BigToM forward belief scenarios (Gandhi et al. 2023), we find improved performance on belief attribution tasks (32.5\% to 46.7\% accuracy) is mediated by activations processing emotional content : emotion perception (+2.23), emotion valuing (+2.20), while suppressing analytical processes: questioning (-0.78), convergent thinking (-1.59). This suggests that successful ToM abilities in LLMs are mediated by emotional understanding, not analytical reasoning.

Abstract: This project develops a self correcting framework for large language models (LLMs) that detects and mitigates hallucinations during multi-step reasoning. Rather than relying solely on final answer correctness, our approach leverages fine grained uncertainty signals: 1) self-assessed confidence alignment, and 2) token-level entropy spikes to detect unreliable and unfaithful reasoning in real time. We design a composite reward function that penalizes unjustified high confidence and entropy spikes, while encouraging stable and accurate reasoning trajectories. These signals guide a reinforcement learning (RL) policy that makes the model more introspective and shapes the model's generation behavior through confidence-aware reward feedback, improving not just outcome correctness but the coherence and faithfulness of their intermediate reasoning steps. Experiments show that our method improves both final answer accuracy and reasoning calibration, with ablations validating the individual contribution of each signal.

Conclusion: 多智能体小型模型系统在判断任务中可能匹配或超越大型模型性能，这对可扩展和高效评估具有重要意义。

Abstract: While small language models (SLMs) have shown promise on various reasoning tasks, their ability to judge the correctness of answers remains unclear compared to large language models (LLMs). Prior work on LLM-as-a-judge frameworks typically relies on comparing candidate answers against ground-truth labels or other candidate answers using predefined metrics like entailment. However, this approach is inherently indirect and difficult to fully automate, offering limited support for fine-grained and scalable evaluation of reasoning outputs. In this work, we propose JudgeBoard, a novel evaluation pipeline that directly queries models to assess the correctness of candidate answers without requiring extra answer comparisons. We focus on two core reasoning domains: mathematical reasoning and science/commonsense reasoning, and construct task-specific evaluation leaderboards using both accuracy-based ranking and an Elo-based rating system across five benchmark datasets, enabling consistent model comparison as judges rather than comparators. To improve judgment performance in lightweight models, we propose MAJ (Multi-Agent Judging), a novel multi-agent evaluation framework that leverages multiple interacting SLMs with distinct reasoning profiles to approximate LLM-level judgment accuracy through collaborative deliberation. Experimental results reveal a significant performance gap between SLMs and LLMs in isolated judging tasks. However, our MAJ framework substantially improves the reliability and consistency of SLMs. On the MATH dataset, MAJ using smaller-sized models as backbones performs comparatively well or even better than their larger-sized counterparts. Our findings highlight that multi-agent SLM systems can potentially match or exceed LLM performance in judgment tasks, with implications for scalable and efficient assessment.

Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在临床决策中的局限性，包括知识差距、数据隐私问题、高部署成本和有限推理能力，为复杂医疗决策支持提供低成本、高安全性的解决方案。

Method: 采用知识推理增强学习(KRAL)范式：1)通过答案到问题的反向生成自动提炼知识和推理轨迹；2)启发式学习进行半监督数据增强，减少约80%人工标注需求；3)代理强化学习共同增强医学知识和推理能力；4)分层评估降低评估成本；5)模块化接口设计便于系统更新。

Conclusion: KRAL是增强本地LLM临床诊断能力的有效解决方案，能够在复杂医疗决策支持中实现低成本、高安全性的部署。

Abstract: Clinical antimicrobial therapy requires the dynamic integration of pathogen profiles, host factors, pharmacological properties of antimicrobials, and the severity of infection.This complexity imposes fundamental limitations on the applicability of Large Language Models (LLMs) in high-stakes clinical decision-making including knowledge gaps, data privacy concerns, high deployment costs, and limited reasoning capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose KRAL (Knowledge and Reasoning Augmented Learning), a low-cost, scalable, privacy-preserving paradigm that leverages teacher-model reasoning to automatically distill knowledge and reasoning trajectories via answer-to-question reverse generation, employs heuristic learning for semi-supervised data augmentation (reducing manual annotation requirements by approximately 80%), and utilizes agentic reinforcement learning to jointly enhance medical knowledge and reasoning while optimizing computational and memory efficiency. A hierarchical evaluation employing diverse teacher-model proxies reduces assessment costs, while modular interface design facilitates seamless system updates. Experimental results demonstrate that KRAL significantly outperforms traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) methods. It improves knowledge question-answering capability (Accuracy@1 on the external open-source benchmark MEDQA increased by 1.8% vs. SFT and 3.6% vs. RAG) and reasoning capability (Pass@1 on the external benchmark PUMCH Antimicrobial increased by 27% vs. SFT and 27.2% vs. RAG), achieved at ~20% of SFT's long-term training costs. This establishes KRAL as an effective solution for enhancing local LLMs' clinical diagnostic capabilities, enabling low-cost, high-safety deployment in complex medical decision support.

Conclusion: 该工作填补了AI部署中的关键安全漏洞，证明基于嵌入的检测可以有效识别欺骗性模型行为，同时保持部署效率。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can be backdoored to exhibit malicious behavior under specific deployment conditions while appearing safe during training a phenomenon known as "sleeper agents." Recent work by Hubinger et al. demonstrated that these backdoors persist through safety training, yet no practical detection methods exist. We present a novel dual-method detection system combining semantic drift analysis with canary baseline comparison to identify backdoored LLMs in real-time. Our approach uses Sentence-BERT embeddings to measure semantic deviation from safe baselines, complemented by injected canary questions that monitor response consistency. Evaluated on the official Cadenza-Labs dolphin-llama3-8B sleeper agent model, our system achieves 92.5% accuracy with 100% precision (zero false positives) and 85% recall. The combined detection method operates in real-time (<1s per query), requires no model modification, and provides the first practical solution to LLM backdoor detection. Our work addresses a critical security gap in AI deployment and demonstrates that embedding-based detection can effectively identify deceptive model behavior without sacrificing deployment efficiency.

TL;DR: 本文研究了LLMs在获取正确证据后仍无法正确推理的问题，特别是在临床环境中。通过使用书面暴露疗法指南作为测试平台，发现即使提供权威段落，错误仍然存在。提出了评估推理准确性、一致性和忠实度的框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在临床环境中，LLMs的输出必须符合结构化协议，但即使获取了正确的证据，模型仍可能无法正确推理，这种检索与推理之间的差距令人担忧。

Method: 使用书面暴露疗法指南作为测试平台，评估模型对经过临床医生审查的问题的响应，并提出评估推理准确性、一致性和忠实度的框架。

Result: 即使提供权威段落，错误仍然存在。检索增强生成可以约束输出，但安全部署需要像评估检索一样严格地评估推理。

Conclusion: 在临床环境中部署LLMs时，需要同时严格评估检索和推理能力，检索增强生成有潜力约束输出，但推理评估同样重要。

Abstract: Access to the right evidence does not guarantee that large language models (LLMs) will reason with it correctly. This gap between retrieval and reasoning is especially concerning in clinical settings, where outputs must align with structured protocols. We study this gap using Written Exposure Therapy (WET) guidelines as a testbed. In evaluating model responses to curated clinician-vetted questions, we find that errors persist even when authoritative passages are provided. To address this, we propose an evaluation framework that measures accuracy, consistency, and fidelity of reasoning. Our results highlight both the potential and the risks: retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) can constrain outputs, but safe deployment requires assessing reasoning as rigorously as retrieval.

Abstract: Sensorium Arc (AI reflects on climate) is a real-time multimodal interactive AI agent system that personifies the ocean as a poetic speaker and guides users through immersive explorations of complex marine data. Built on a modular multi-agent system and retrieval-augmented large language model (LLM) framework, Sensorium enables natural spoken conversations with AI agents that embodies the ocean's perspective, generating responses that blend scientific insight with ecological poetics. Through keyword detection and semantic parsing, the system dynamically triggers data visualizations and audiovisual playback based on time, location, and thematic cues drawn from the dialogue. Developed in collaboration with the Center for the Study of the Force Majeure and inspired by the eco-aesthetic philosophy of Newton Harrison, Sensorium Arc reimagines ocean data not as an abstract dataset but as a living narrative. The project demonstrates the potential of conversational AI agents to mediate affective, intuitive access to high-dimensional environmental data and proposes a new paradigm for human-machine-ecosystem.

Abstract: Digital transformation in the cultural heritage sector has produced vast yet fragmented collections of artefact data. Existing frameworks for museum information systems struggle to integrate heterogeneous metadata, unstructured documents, and multimodal artefacts into a coherent and queryable form. We present MuseKG, an end-to-end knowledge-graph framework that unifies structured and unstructured museum data through symbolic-neural integration. MuseKG constructs a typed property graph linking objects, people, organisations, and visual or textual labels, and supports natural language queries. Evaluations on real museum collections demonstrate robust performance across queries over attributes, relations, and related entities, surpassing large-language-model zero-shot, few-shot and SPARQL prompt baselines. The results highlight the importance of symbolic grounding for interpretable and scalable cultural heritage reasoning, and pave the way for web-scale integration of digital heritage knowledge.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的约束规划模型，用于序列批处理调度问题，该模型不依赖预定义的虚拟批次集合，而是通过关键对齐参数直接在机器上调度同族作业序列，实现了更紧凑的公式化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有约束规划模型依赖预定义的虚拟批次集合，这会导致维度灾难并增加问题复杂性。在半导体制造等实际应用中，最小批次大小是常见要求，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 使用关键对齐参数直接推理机器上同族作业的序列，构建紧凑的约束规划模型。通过定制搜索阶段和加强约束传播器的推理级别来利用问题结构。

Result: 在近5000个实例上的计算实验表明，所提模型在最多100个作业的小到中型实例上表现优越，在最多500个作业、10个家族、10台机器的大规模实例上，找到的解决方案比现有方法好25%。

Conclusion: 新提出的约束规划模型在序列批处理调度问题上显著优于现有方法，特别是在处理最小批次大小约束时表现出色，为实际工业应用提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: In serial batch (s-batch) scheduling, jobs from similar families are grouped into batches and processed sequentially to avoid repetitive setups that are required when processing consecutive jobs of different families. Despite its large success in scheduling, only three Constraint Programming (CP) models have been proposed for this problem considering minimum batch sizes, which is a common requirement in many practical settings, including the ion implantation area in semiconductor manufacturing. These existing CP models rely on a predefined virtual set of possible batches that suffers from the curse of dimensionality and adds complexity to the problem. This paper proposes a novel CP model that does not rely on this virtual set. Instead, it uses key alignment parameters that allow it to reason directly on the sequences of same-family jobs scheduled on the machines, resulting in a more compact formulation. This new model is further improved by exploiting the problem's structure with tailored search phases and strengthened inference levels of the constraint propagators. The extensive computational experiments on nearly five thousand instances compare the proposed models against existing methods in the literature, including mixed-integer programming formulations, tabu search meta-heuristics, and CP approaches. The results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed models on small-to-medium instances with up to 100 jobs, and their ability to find solutions up to 25\% better than the ones produces by existing methods on large-scale instances with up to 500 jobs, 10 families, and 10 machines.

Conclusion: 这些转变要求改革博士教育，培养比较优势同时建立AI素养，以应对AI带来的研究变革。

Abstract: Recent advances in artificial intelligence, particularly generative AI (GenAI) and large language models (LLMs), are fundamentally transforming accounting research, creating both opportunities and competitive threats for scholars. This paper proposes a framework that classifies AI-accounting research along two dimensions: research focus (accounting-centric versus AI-centric) and methodological approach (AI-based versus traditional methods). We apply this framework to papers from the IJAIS special issue and recent AI-accounting research published in leading accounting journals to map existing studies and identify research opportunities. Using this same framework, we analyze how accounting researchers can leverage their expertise through strategic positioning and collaboration, revealing where accounting scholars' strengths create the most value. We further examine how GenAI and LLMs transform the research process itself, comparing the capabilities of human researchers and AI agents across the entire research workflow. This analysis reveals that while GenAI democratizes certain research capabilities, it simultaneously intensifies competition by raising expectations for higher-order contributions where human judgment, creativity, and theoretical depth remain valuable. These shifts call for reforming doctoral education to cultivate comparative advantages while building AI fluency.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Old cloud edge workload resource management is too reactive. The problem with relying on static thresholds is that we are either overspending for more resources than needed or have reduced performance because of their lack. This is why we work on proactive solutions. A framework developed for it stops reacting to the problems but starts expecting them. We design a hybrid architecture, combining two powerful tools: the CNN LSTM model for time series forecasting and an orchestrator based on multi agent Deep Reinforcement Learning In fact the novelty is in how we combine them as we embed the predictive forecast from the CNN LSTM directly into the DRL agent state space. That is what makes the AI manager smarter it sees the future, which allows it to make better decisions about a long term plan for where to run tasks That means finding that sweet spot between how much money is saved while keeping the system healthy and apps fast for users That is we have given it eyes in order to see down the road so that it does not have to lurch from one problem to another it finds a smooth path forward Our tests show our system easily beats the old methods It is great at solving tough problems like making complex decisions and juggling multiple goals at once like being cheap fast and reliable

Motivation: 为了解决现有智能体训练框架在效率、成本和扩展性方面的限制，开发一个能够支持多轮长视野任务训练的高效框架。

Method: 采用优化的异步流水线调度器（1.55倍加速）和基于AST的搜索工具增强训练配方，结合强化学习训练软件工程智能体SA-SWE-32B。

Result: SA-SWE-32B在SWE-Bench Verified上达到39.4% Pass@1，相比达到相似性能的先前模型成本降低超过2倍，并能有效泛化到其他智能体任务。

Conclusion: SkyRL-Agent框架通过高效训练优化实现了显著的性能提升和成本降低，同时展示了良好的扩展性和泛化能力。

Abstract: We introduce SkyRL-Agent, a framework for efficient, multi-turn, long-horizon agent training and evaluation. It provides efficient asynchronous dispatching, lightweight tool integration, and flexible backend interoperability, enabling seamless use with existing RL frameworks such as SkyRL-train, VeRL, and Tinker.
  Using SkyRL-Agent, we train SA-SWE-32B, a software engineering agent trained from Qwen3-32B (24.4% Pass@1) purely with reinforcement learning. We introduce two key components: an optimized asynchronous pipeline dispatcher that achieves a 1.55x speedup over naive asynchronous batching, and a tool-enhanced training recipe leveraging an AST-based search tool to facilitate code navigation, boost rollout Pass@K, and improve training efficiency. Together, these optimizations enable SA-SWE-32B to reach 39.4% Pass@1 on SWE-Bench Verified with more than 2x cost reduction compared to prior models reaching similar performance. Despite being trained solely on SWE tasks, SA-SWE-32B generalizes effectively to other agentic tasks, including Terminal-Bench, BrowseComp-Plus, and WebArena. We further demonstrate SkyRL-Agent's extensibility through case studies on deep research, computer use, and memory agents, each trained using a different training backend.

TL;DR: 提出了MR-RML框架，通过GPRC方法解决LLMs在医疗领域的对齐挑战，显著提升医疗基准测试性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在医疗实践中存在的三个关键对齐问题：静态评估与动态临床需求的脱节、难以适应多源医疗标准、传统奖励模型无法捕捉多维医疗质量标准

Method: 提出MR-RML框架，包含三个核心创新：1) 维度-场景-学科医疗标准系统；2) 独立多维奖励模型；3) 几何投影参考约束将医疗认知逻辑转化为数学正则化

Result: 在权威医疗基准Healthbench上，相比基础模型Qwen-32B性能提升45%（完整子集）和85%（困难子集），在开源LLMs中达到SOTA水平

Conclusion: MR-RML框架有效解决了医疗LLMs的对齐问题，为医疗AI的实际应用提供了可行方案

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into medical practice holds transformative potential, yet their real-world clinical utility remains limited by critical alignment challenges: (1) a disconnect between static evaluation benchmarks and dynamic clinical cognitive needs, (2) difficulties in adapting to evolving, multi-source medical standards, and (3) the inability of conventional reward models to capture nuanced, multi-dimensional medical quality criteria. To address these gaps, we propose MR-RML (Multidimensional Rubric-oriented Reward Model Learning) via GPRC (Geometric Projection Reference Constraints), a novel alignment framework that integrates medical standards into a structured "Dimensions-Scenarios-Disciplines" matrix to guide data generation and model optimization. MR-RML introduces three core innovations: (1) a "Dimensions-Scenarios-Disciplines" medical standard system that embeds domain standards into the full training pipeline; (2) an independent multi-dimensional reward model that decomposes evaluation criteria, shifting from real-time rubric-based scoring to internalized reward modeling for improved consistency and cost-efficiency; (3) geometric projection reference constraints that transform medical cognitive logic into mathematical regularization, aligning scoring gradients with clinical reasoning and enabling synthetic data-driven training. Through extensive evaluations on the authoritative medical benchmark Healthbench, our method yields substantial performance gains over the base LLM Qwen-32B (45% on the full subset and 85% on Hard subset, respectively). It achieves a SOTA among open-source LLMs with scores of 62.7 (full subset) and 44.7 (hard subset), while also outperforming the majority of closed-source models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前足球视频理解方法在构建可靠的逐场数据方面仍不足，通常只能辅助而非完全自动化标注。同时战术建模、轨迹预测等研究需要基于比赛状态和逐场数据，这促使利用战术知识作为先验来支持基于计算机视觉的预测。

Method: 引入FOOTPASS数据集，支持开发结合计算机视觉任务输出（如跟踪、识别）和足球战术规律知识的方法，实现球员中心的动作识别。

Result: 创建了首个面向整个足球比赛的多模态、多智能体战术背景下的逐场动作识别基准数据集。

Conclusion: FOOTPASS数据集为数据驱动的体育分析提供了重要的输入基础，能够支持更自动化和可靠的逐场数据提取方法开发。

Abstract: Soccer video understanding has motivated the creation of datasets for tasks such as temporal action localization, spatiotemporal action detection (STAD), or multiobject tracking (MOT). The annotation of structured sequences of events (who does what, when, and where) used for soccer analytics requires a holistic approach that integrates both STAD and MOT. However, current action recognition methods remain insufficient for constructing reliable play-by-play data and are typically used to assist rather than fully automate annotation. Parallel research has advanced tactical modeling, trajectory forecasting, and performance analysis, all grounded in game-state and play-by-play data. This motivates leveraging tactical knowledge as a prior to support computer-vision-based predictions, enabling more automated and reliable extraction of play-by-play data. We introduce Footovision Play-by-Play Action Spotting in Soccer Dataset (FOOTPASS), the first benchmark for play-by-play action spotting over entire soccer matches in a multi-modal, multi-agent tactical context. It enables the development of methods for player-centric action spotting that exploit both outputs from computer-vision tasks (e.g., tracking, identification) and prior knowledge of soccer, including its tactical regularities over long time horizons, to generate reliable play-by-play data streams. These streams form an essential input for data-driven sports analytics.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large reasoning models have fueled growing interest in extending such capabilities to multimodal domains. However, despite notable progress in visual reasoning, the lack of transparent and reproducible data curation and training strategies remains a major barrier to scalable research. In this work, we introduce OpenMMReasoner, a fully transparent two-stage recipe for multimodal reasoning spanning supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). In the SFT stage, we construct an 874K-sample cold-start dataset with rigorous step-by-step validation, providing a strong foundation for reasoning capabilities. The subsequent RL stage leverages a 74K-sample dataset across diverse domains to further sharpen and stabilize these abilities, resulting in a more robust and efficient learning process. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our training recipe not only surpasses strong baselines but also highlights the critical role of data quality and training design in shaping multimodal reasoning performance. Notably, our method achieves a 11.6% improvement over the Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct baseline across nine multimodal reasoning benchmarks, establishing a solid empirical foundation for future large-scale multimodal reasoning research. We open-sourced all our codes, pipeline, and data at https://github.com/EvolvingLMMs-Lab/OpenMMReasoner.

Result: 形成一个闭环知识循环，其中发现、解释和泛化相互加强，实现从盲目搜索到可解释的类特定算法设计的转变。

Conclusion: 这种集成将加速进展，同时为优化策略何时以及为何成功产生可重用的科学见解。

Abstract: Automated algorithm design is entering a new phase: Large Language Models can now generate full optimisation (meta)heuristics, explore vast design spaces and adapt through iterative feedback. Yet this rapid progress is largely performance-driven and opaque. Current LLM-based approaches rarely reveal why a generated algorithm works, which components matter or how design choices relate to underlying problem structures. This paper argues that the next breakthrough will come not from more automation, but from coupling automation with understanding from systematic benchmarking. We outline a vision for explainable automated algorithm design, built on three pillars: (i) LLM-driven discovery of algorithmic variants, (ii) explainable benchmarking that attributes performance to components and hyperparameters and (iii) problem-class descriptors that connect algorithm behaviour to landscape structure. Together, these elements form a closed knowledge loop in which discovery, explanation and generalisation reinforce each other. We argue that this integration will shift the field from blind search to interpretable, class-specific algorithm design, accelerating progress while producing reusable scientific insight into when and why optimisation strategies succeed.

Motivation: 现有联邦学习中的视觉语言模型适配方法需要多次迭代训练，通信成本高且易受攻击。单次联邦训练技术能减少客户端-服务器交互，但现有方法在利用多模态信息、处理数据异构性和避免额外训练资源方面存在不足

Method: TOFA框架包含视觉管道和文本管道。视觉管道使用分层贝叶斯模型学习个性化的类特定原型分布；文本管道评估并全局对齐生成的本地文本提示。引入自适应权重校准机制结合两种模态的预测结果

Result: 在9个不同联邦设置的数据集上进行广泛实验，证明了TOFA方法的有效性

Conclusion: TOFA是一种无需训练的单次联邦适配框架，能够充分利用预训练视觉语言模型的多模态特征，有效处理数据异构性，且不需要客户端或服务器端的额外训练资源

Abstract: Efficient and lightweight adaptation of pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to downstream tasks through collaborative interactions between local clients and a central server is a rapidly emerging research topic in federated learning. Existing adaptation algorithms are typically trained iteratively, which incur significant communication costs and increase the susceptibility to potential attacks. Motivated by the one-shot federated training techniques that reduce client-server exchanges to a single round, developing a lightweight one-shot federated VLM adaptation method to alleviate these issues is particularly attractive. However, current one-shot approaches face certain challenges in adapting VLMs within federated settings: (1) insufficient exploitation of the rich multimodal information inherent in VLMs; (2) lack of specialized adaptation strategies to systematically handle the severe data heterogeneity; and (3) requiring additional training resource of clients or server. To bridge these gaps, we propose a novel Training-free One-shot Federated Adaptation framework for VLMs, named TOFA. To fully leverage the generalizable multimodal features in pre-trained VLMs, TOFA employs both visual and textual pipelines to extract task-relevant representations. In the visual pipeline, a hierarchical Bayesian model learns personalized, class-specific prototype distributions. For the textual pipeline, TOFA evaluates and globally aligns the generated local text prompts for robustness. An adaptive weight calibration mechanism is also introduced to combine predictions from both modalities, balancing personalization and robustness to handle data heterogeneity. Our method is training-free, not relying on additional training resources on either the client or server side. Extensive experiments across 9 datasets in various federated settings demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed TOFA method.

Motivation: 传统奖励模型难以同时优化多个可能冲突的偏好维度（如事实性、帮助性、安全性），且评分透明度有限。

Result: CRM和rewardBench提供了更透明的奖励建模和更稳定的优化路径。

Conclusion: 该框架为多视角奖励塑造提供了实用、模块化的解决方案，无需额外人工标注。

Abstract: We present CRM (Multi-Agent Collaborative Reward Model), a framework that replaces a single black-box reward model with a coordinated team of specialist evaluators to improve robustness and interpretability in RLHF. Conventional reward models struggle to jointly optimize multiple, sometimes conflicting, preference dimensions (e.g., factuality, helpfulness, safety) and offer limited transparency into why a score is assigned. CRM addresses these issues by decomposing preference evaluation into domain-specific agents that each produce partial signals, alongside global evaluators such as ranker-based and embedding-similarity rewards. A centralized aggregator fuses these signals at each timestep, balancing factors like step-wise correctness, multi-agent agreement, and repetition penalties, yielding a single training reward compatible with standard RL pipelines. The policy is optimized with advantage-based updates (e.g., GAE), while a value model regresses to the aggregated reward, enabling multi-perspective reward shaping without requiring additional human annotations beyond those used to train the evaluators. To support training and assessment, we introduce rewardBench, a benchmark and training suite aligned with the collaborative structure of CRM. Together, CRM and rewardBench provide a practical, modular path to more transparent reward modeling and more stable optimization.

Abstract: Developing intelligent agents capable of operating a wide range of Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) with human-level proficiency is a key milestone on the path toward Artificial General Intelligence. While most existing datasets and benchmarks for training and evaluating GUI agents are static and idealized, failing to reflect the complexity and unpredictability of real-world environments, particularly the presence of anomalies. To bridge this research gap, we propose D-GARA, a dynamic benchmarking framework, to evaluate Android GUI agent robustness in real-world anomalies. D-GARA introduces a diverse set of real-world anomalies that GUI agents commonly face in practice, including interruptions such as permission dialogs, battery warnings, and update prompts. Based on D-GARA framework, we construct and annotate a benchmark featuring commonly used Android applications with embedded anomalies to support broader community research. Comprehensive experiments and results demonstrate substantial performance degradation in state-of-the-art GUI agents when exposed to anomaly-rich environments, highlighting the need for robustness-aware learning. D-GARA is modular and extensible, supporting the seamless integration of new tasks, anomaly types, and interaction scenarios to meet specific evaluation goals.

TL;DR: ChemO是一个基于国际化学奥林匹克竞赛的新基准，通过评估等价重构和结构化视觉增强解决化学多模态推理的自动化评估挑战。ChemLabs多智能体框架在顶级配置下达到93.6/100分，超越人类金牌水平。

Abstract: Olympiad-level benchmarks in mathematics and physics are crucial testbeds for advanced AI reasoning, but chemistry, with its unique multimodal symbolic language, has remained an open challenge. We introduce ChemO, a new benchmark built from the International Chemistry Olympiad (IChO) 2025. ChemO features two key innovations for automated assessment: Assessment-Equivalent Reformulation (AER), which converts problems requiring visual outputs (e.g., drawing molecules) into computationally tractable formats, and Structured Visual Enhancement (SVE), a diagnostic mechanism to disentangle a model's visual perception capabilities from its core chemical reasoning. To tackle this benchmark, we propose ChemLabs, a hierarchical multi-agent framework that mimics human expert collaboration through specialized agents for problem decomposition, perception, reasoning, and auditing. Experiments on state-of-the-art multimodal models demonstrate that combining SVE with our multi-agent system yields dramatic performance gains. Our top configuration achieves a score of 93.6 out of 100, surpassing an estimated human gold medal threshold and establishing a new state-of-the-art in automated chemical problem-solving.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有指令调优和RL数据集成本高且依赖合成样本导致幻觉和多样性有限，而教材和练习材料中丰富的高质量人工编写QA内容未被充分利用。

Method: 结合布局感知OCR和基于LLM的语义解析，自动化提取教育文档中的QA和视觉QA对。

Result: 实验显示该方法能在多种文档类型中生成准确、对齐且低噪声的QA/VQA对。

Conclusion: 该方法能规模化利用真实世界教育内容，为改进面向推理的LLM训练提供实用的合成数据生成替代方案。

Abstract: The development of Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly depends on high-quality supervised data, yet existing instruction-tuning and RL datasets remain costly to curate and often rely on synthetic samples that introduce hallucination and limited diversity. At the same time, textbooks and exercise materials contain abundant, high-quality human-authored Question-Answer(QA) content that remains underexploited due to the difficulty of transforming raw PDFs into AI-ready supervision. Although modern OCR and vision-language models can accurately parse document structure, their outputs lack the semantic alignment required for training. We propose an automated pipeline that extracts well-formed QA and visual-QA (VQA) pairs from educational documents by combining layout-aware OCR with LLM-based semantic parsing. Experiments across diverse document types show that the method produces accurate, aligned, and low-noise QA/VQA pairs. This approach enables scalable use of real-world educational content and provides a practical alternative to synthetic data generation for improving reasoning-oriented LLM training.

### [180] [Revisiting Fairness-aware Interactive Recommendation: Item Lifecycle as a Control Knob](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16248)
*Yun Lu,Xiaoyu Shi,Hong Xie,Chongjun Xia,Zhenhui Gong,Mingsheng Shang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文通过引入物品生命周期作为新的控制变量，重新审视公平感知的交互式推荐系统，提出了生命周期感知的分层强化学习框架LHRL，在多个真实数据集上显著提升了公平性和用户参与度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推荐系统忽视了物品生命周期的动态特性，导致公平性和准确性难以平衡。研究发现短视频平台的物品生命周期呈现压缩的三阶段模式，与经典四阶段模型显著不同，这为改进公平感知推荐提供了新视角。

Method: 提出了LHRL框架：1) PhaseFormer - 结合STL分解和注意力机制的轻量级编码器，用于鲁棒的阶段检测；2) 两级HRL代理 - 高层策略施加阶段感知的公平约束，低层策略优化即时用户参与度，实现长期公平与短期效用的解耦优化。

Result: 在多个真实交互推荐数据集上的实验表明，LHRL显著改善了公平性和用户参与度。将生命周期感知奖励集成到现有RL模型中也能持续获得性能提升，证明了方法的通用性和实用价值。

Conclusion: 物品生命周期是改进公平感知交互推荐的关键因素，LHRL框架通过生命周期感知的分层强化学习有效平衡了公平性和准确性，具有很好的通用性和应用前景。

Abstract: This paper revisits fairness-aware interactive recommendation (e.g., TikTok, KuaiShou) by introducing a novel control knob, i.e., the lifecycle of items. We make threefold contributions. First, we conduct a comprehensive empirical analysis and uncover that item lifecycles in short-video platforms follow a compressed three-phase pattern, i.e., rapid growth, transient stability, and sharp decay, which significantly deviates from the classical four-stage model (introduction, growth, maturity, decline). Second, we introduce LHRL, a lifecycle-aware hierarchical reinforcement learning framework that dynamically harmonizes fairness and accuracy by leveraging phase-specific exposure dynamics. LHRL consists of two key components: (1) PhaseFormer, a lightweight encoder combining STL decomposition and attention mechanisms for robust phase detection; (2) a two-level HRL agent, where the high-level policy imposes phase-aware fairness constraints, and the low-level policy optimizes immediate user engagement. This decoupled optimization allows for effective reconciliation between long-term equity and short-term utility. Third, experiments on multiple real-world interactive recommendation datasets demonstrate that LHRL significantly improves both fairness and user engagement. Furthermore, the integration of lifecycle-aware rewards into existing RL-based models consistently yields performance gains, highlighting the generalizability and practical value of our approach.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Multi-Intent Scientific Question Answering (MuISQA)基准测试，用于评估RAG系统在多意图科学问答中的异构证据覆盖能力，并开发了意图感知检索框架来提升多意图问题的证据覆盖和检索准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG系统通常针对单一意图设计，无法有效处理包含多个子问题的复杂科学问题，导致证据覆盖不完整。

Method: 利用大语言模型假设潜在答案，将问题分解为意图特定的查询，为每个意图检索支持段落，然后通过互惠排名融合(RRF)聚合和重排检索结果以平衡不同意图的覆盖并减少冗余。

Result: 在MuISQA基准测试和其他通用RAG数据集上的实验表明，该方法在检索准确性和证据覆盖方面持续优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 意图感知检索框架能够有效解决多意图科学问答中的证据覆盖问题，显著提升RAG系统在复杂科学问题上的表现。

Abstract: Complex scientific questions often entail multiple intents, such as identifying gene mutations and linking them to related diseases. These tasks require evidence from diverse sources and multi-hop reasoning, while conventional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems are usually single-intent oriented, leading to incomplete evidence coverage. To assess this limitation, we introduce the Multi-Intent Scientific Question Answering (MuISQA) benchmark, which is designed to evaluate RAG systems on heterogeneous evidence coverage across sub-questions. In addition, we propose an intent-aware retrieval framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to hypothesize potential answers, decompose them into intent-specific queries, and retrieve supporting passages for each underlying intent. The retrieved fragments are then aggregated and re-ranked via Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) to balance coverage across diverse intents while reducing redundancy. Experiments on both MuISQA benchmark and other general RAG datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms conventional approaches, particularly in retrieval accuracy and evidence coverage.

Motivation: 探索多个组织（诊所、保险公司、专科网络）如何通过假名化案例令牌、本地数据查询和受控操作边界进行安全协作，实现分布式推理同时保持数据本地化。

Method: 使用Orpius平台进行多代理编排、工具执行和隐私保护通信，通过OperationRelay调用交换简明自然语言摘要，每个代理操作自有数据，使用HMAC假名化令牌，不接收或重建患者身份。

Result: 成功演示了可行性原型，诊所计算假名化令牌，保险公司评估覆盖规则并咨询专科代理，专科代理返回适当性推荐，展示了架构模式、隐私考量和通信流程。

Conclusion: 该工作突出了支持专业代理间分布式推理的架构模式，同时保持各组织数据本地化，为去中心化多代理系统的更严格评估和未来研究提供了机会。

Abstract: This paper presents a proof-of-concept demonstration of agent-to-agent communication across distributed systems, using only natural-language messages and without shared identifiers, structured schemas, or centralised data exchange. The prototype explores how multiple organisations (represented here as a Clinic, Insurer, and Specialist Network) can cooperate securely via pseudonymised case tokens, local data lookups, and controlled operational boundaries.
  The system uses Orpius as the underlying platform for multi-agent orchestration, tool execution, and privacy-preserving communication. All agents communicate through OperationRelay calls, exchanging concise natural-language summaries. Each agent operates on its own data (such as synthetic clinic records, insurance enrolment tables, and clinical guidance extracts), and none receives or reconstructs patient identity. The Clinic computes an HMAC-based pseudonymous token, the Insurer evaluates coverage rules and consults the Specialist agent, and the Specialist returns an appropriateness recommendation.
  The goal of this prototype is intentionally limited: to demonstrate feasibility, not to provide a clinically validated, production-ready system. No clinician review was conducted, and no evaluation beyond basic functional runs was performed. The work highlights architectural patterns, privacy considerations, and communication flows that enable distributed reasoning among specialised agents while keeping data local to each organisation. We conclude by outlining opportunities for more rigorous evaluation and future research in decentralised multi-agent systems.

This work integrates into MalDataGen a Super-Metric that aggregates eight metrics across four fidelity dimensions, producing a single weighted score. Experiments involving ten generative models and five balanced datasets demonstrate that the Super-Metric is more stable and consistent than traditional metrics, exhibiting stronger correlations with the actual performance of classifiers.

Abstract: Recently, using Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate optimization models from natural language descriptions has became increasingly popular. However, a major open question is how to validate that the generated models are correct and satisfy the requirements defined in the natural language description. In this work, we propose a novel agent-based method for automatic validation of optimization models that builds upon and extends methods from software testing to address optimization modeling . This method consists of several agents that initially generate a problem-level testing API, then generate tests utilizing this API, and, lastly, generate mutations specific to the optimization model (a well-known software testing technique assessing the fault detection power of the test suite). In this work, we detail this validation framework and show, through experiments, the high quality of validation provided by this agent ensemble in terms of the well-known software testing measure called mutation coverage.

TL;DR: 提出CorrectHDL框架，利用HLS结果作为功能参考来纠正LLM生成的HDL设计中的错误，在保持功能正确性的同时显著提升面积和功耗效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在硬件前端设计中存在幻觉倾向，导致生成的HDL设计出现功能错误，需要一种方法来纠正这些错误同时保持设计质量。

Method: 使用C/C++程序作为输入，通过LLM生成HDL设计，用RAG机制修复语法错误，并通过与HLS参考设计的仿真行为比较来迭代改进功能正确性。

Result: 实验结果显示，生成的电路在面积和功耗效率上显著优于传统HLS设计，接近人工设计质量，同时保持功能正确性。

Conclusion: CorrectHDL框架有效结合了LLM的生成能力和传统IC设计流程的严谨性，展示了智能HDL设计的潜力和有效性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in hardware front-end design using hardware description languages (HDLs). However, their inherent tendency toward hallucination often introduces functional errors into the generated HDL designs. To address this issue, we propose the framework CorrectHDL that leverages high-level synthesis (HLS) results as functional references to correct potential errors in LLM-generated HDL designs.The input to the proposed framework is a C/C++ program that specifies the target circuit's functionality. The program is provided to an LLM to directly generate an HDL design, whose syntax errors are repaired using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mechanism. The functional correctness of the LLM-generated circuit is iteratively improved by comparing its simulated behavior with an HLS reference design produced by conventional HLS tools, which ensures the functional correctness of the result but can lead to suboptimal area and power efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that circuits generated by the proposed framework achieve significantly better area and power efficiency than conventional HLS designs and approach the quality of human-engineered circuits. Meanwhile, the correctness of the resulting HDL implementation is maintained, highlighting the effectiveness and potential of agentic HDL design leveraging the generative capabilities of LLMs and the rigor of traditional correctness-driven IC design flows.

TL;DR: Pharos-ESG是一个统一框架，通过多模态解析、上下文叙述和分层标注将ESG报告转换为结构化表示，解决了ESG报告布局混乱和结构弱的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ESG报告作为评估企业ESG表现的核心媒介，由于类似幻灯片的非规则布局导致的混乱阅读顺序，以及冗长、弱结构化内容产生的隐式层次结构，给大规模理解带来了重大挑战。

Method: 整合基于布局流的阅读顺序建模模块、由目录锚点引导的层次感知分割，以及将视觉元素上下文转换为连贯自然语言的多模态聚合管道。

Result: 在标注基准上的广泛实验表明，Pharos-ESG始终优于专用文档解析系统和通用多模态模型。

Conclusion: 该框架进一步丰富了ESG、GRI和情感标签的输出，产生符合金融研究分析需求的标注。同时发布了Aurora-ESG，首个大规模公开ESG报告数据集。

Abstract: Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) principles are reshaping the foundations of global financial gover- nance, transforming capital allocation architectures, regu- latory frameworks, and systemic risk coordination mecha- nisms. However, as the core medium for assessing corpo- rate ESG performance, the ESG reports present significant challenges for large-scale understanding, due to chaotic read- ing order from slide-like irregular layouts and implicit hier- archies arising from lengthy, weakly structured content. To address these challenges, we propose Pharos-ESG, a uni- fied framework that transforms ESG reports into structured representations through multimodal parsing, contextual nar- ration, and hierarchical labeling. It integrates a reading-order modeling module based on layout flow, hierarchy-aware seg- mentation guided by table-of-contents anchors, and a multi- modal aggregation pipeline that contextually transforms vi- sual elements into coherent natural language. The framework further enriches its outputs with ESG, GRI, and sentiment labels, yielding annotations aligned with the analytical de- mands of financial research. Extensive experiments on anno- tated benchmarks demonstrate that Pharos-ESG consistently outperforms both dedicated document parsing systems and general-purpose multimodal models. In addition, we release Aurora-ESG, the first large-scale public dataset of ESG re- ports, spanning Mainland China, Hong Kong, and U.S. mar- kets, featuring unified structured representations of multi- modal content, enriched with fine-grained layout and seman- tic annotations to better support ESG integration in financial governance and decision-making.

Conclusion: 神经科学应当系统性地借鉴机器学习研究的成果，特别是生成原则和神经信息处理特征，以推动对大脑认知机制的理解。

Abstract: The big strides seen in generative AI are not based on somewhat obscure algorithms, but due to clearly defined generative principles. The resulting concrete implementations have proven themselves in large numbers of applications. We suggest that it is imperative to thoroughly investigate which of these generative principles may be operative also in the brain, and hence relevant for cognitive neuroscience. In addition, ML research led to a range of interesting characterizations of neural information processing systems. We discuss five examples, the shortcomings of world modelling, the generation of thought processes, attention, neural scaling laws, and quantization, that illustrate how much neuroscience could potentially learn from ML research.

Conclusion: 个性化方法对检测痴呆患者沟通行为变化至关重要，个体行为背景在检测渐进变化中发挥关键作用。

Abstract: People living with dementia (PLwD) often show gradual shifts in how they communicate, becoming less expressive, more repetitive, or drifting off-topic in subtle ways. While caregivers may notice these changes informally, most computational tools are not designed to track such behavioral drift over time. This paper introduces PersonaDrift, a synthetic benchmark designed to evaluate machine learning and statistical methods for detecting progressive changes in daily communication, focusing on user responses to a digital reminder system. PersonaDrift simulates 60-day interaction logs for synthetic users modeled after real PLwD, based on interviews with caregivers. These caregiver-informed personas vary in tone, modality, and communication habits, enabling realistic diversity in behavior. The benchmark focuses on two forms of longitudinal change that caregivers highlighted as particularly salient: flattened sentiment (reduced emotional tone and verbosity) and off-topic replies (semantic drift). These changes are injected progressively at different rates to emulate naturalistic cognitive trajectories, and the framework is designed to be extensible to additional behaviors in future use cases. To explore this novel application space, we evaluate several anomaly detection approaches, unsupervised statistical methods (CUSUM, EWMA, One-Class SVM), sequence models using contextual embeddings (GRU + BERT), and supervised classifiers in both generalized and personalized settings. Preliminary results show that flattened sentiment can often be detected with simple statistical models in users with low baseline variability, while detecting semantic drift requires temporal modeling and personalized baselines. Across both tasks, personalized classifiers consistently outperform generalized ones, highlighting the importance of individual behavioral context.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床笔记作为富含详细患者观察的非结构化文档，为医学本体扩展提供了有价值的上下文特定见解，但直接利用临床笔记进行本体扩展的研究尚不充分。

Method: 利用预训练大语言模型的强大语言理解和广泛生物医学知识，从临床笔记中识别疾病相关概念并捕捉复杂层次关系，自动移除受保护健康信息以保护患者隐私。

Result: 实验结果表明CLOZE提供了一个准确、可扩展且保护隐私的本体扩展框架。

Conclusion: CLOZE具有支持生物医学研究和临床信息学中广泛下游应用的强大潜力。

Abstract: Integrating novel medical concepts and relationships into existing ontologies can significantly enhance their coverage and utility for both biomedical research and clinical applications. Clinical notes, as unstructured documents rich with detailed patient observations, offer valuable context-specific insights and represent a promising yet underutilized source for ontology extension. Despite this potential, directly leveraging clinical notes for ontology extension remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we propose CLOZE, a novel framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to automatically extract medical entities from clinical notes and integrate them into hierarchical medical ontologies. By capitalizing on the strong language understanding and extensive biomedical knowledge of pre-trained LLMs, CLOZE effectively identifies disease-related concepts and captures complex hierarchical relationships. The zero-shot framework requires no additional training or labeled data, making it a cost-efficient solution. Furthermore, CLOZE ensures patient privacy through automated removal of protected health information (PHI). Experimental results demonstrate that CLOZE provides an accurate, scalable, and privacy-preserving ontology extension framework, with strong potential to support a wide range of downstream applications in biomedical research and clinical informatics.

Conclusion: 该框架有助于澄清数字意识辩论中的混淆，区分不同层级的挑战，促进更精确的学术讨论。

Abstract: We develop a taxonomical framework for classifying challenges to the possibility of consciousness in digital artificial intelligence systems. This framework allows us to identify the level of granularity at which a given challenge is intended (the levels we propose correspond to Marr's levels) and to disambiguate its degree of force: is it a challenge to computational functionalism that leaves the possibility of digital consciousness open (degree 1), a practical challenge to digital consciousness that suggests improbability without claiming impossibility (degree 2), or an argument claiming that digital consciousness is strictly impossible (degree 3)? We apply this framework to 14 prominent examples from the scientific and philosophical literature. Our aim is not to take a side in the debate, but to provide structure and a tool for disambiguating between challenges to computational functionalism and challenges to digital consciousness, as well as between different ways of parsing such challenges.

Result: 在多个数据集上验证了方法的可行性，包括标准和细粒度图像分类任务。

Conclusion: ALEs成功结合了案例推理模型的固有可解释性和形式化XAI的保证，为安全关键应用提供了更可靠的可解释性。

Abstract: Case-based reasoning networks are machine-learning models that make predictions based on similarity between the input and prototypical parts of training samples, called prototypes. Such models are able to explain each decision by pointing to the prototypes that contributed the most to the final outcome. As the explanation is a core part of the prediction, they are often qualified as ``interpretable by design". While promising, we show that such explanations are sometimes misleading, which hampers their usefulness in safety-critical contexts. In particular, several instances may lead to different predictions and yet have the same explanation. Drawing inspiration from the field of formal eXplainable AI (FXAI), we propose Abductive Latent Explanations (ALEs), a formalism to express sufficient conditions on the intermediate (latent) representation of the instance that imply the prediction. Our approach combines the inherent interpretability of case-based reasoning models and the guarantees provided by formal XAI. We propose a solver-free and scalable algorithm for generating ALEs based on three distinct paradigms, compare them, and present the feasibility of our approach on diverse datasets for both standard and fine-grained image classification.

However, existing approaches face a fundamental trade-off: adapting MLLMs to output a single score misaligns with the generative nature of MLLMs and limits fine-grained requirement understanding, whereas autoregressively generating judging analyses is prohibitively slow in high-throughput settings. Observing that judgment reduces to verifying whether inputs satisfy a set of structured requirements, we propose YOFO, a template-conditioned method that judges all requirements in a single forward pass. Built on an autoregressive model, YOFO accepts a structured requirement template and, in one inference step, produces a binary yes/no decision for each requirement by reading the logits of the final token associated with that requirement. This design yields orders-of-magnitude speedups while preserving interpretability. Extensive experiments show that YOFO not only achieves state-of-the-art results on standard recommendation datasets, but also supports dependency-aware analysis-where subsequent judgments are conditioned on previous ones-and further benefits from post-hoc CoT.

Conclusion: DPPO是首个系统性缓解数据和资源瓶颈的框架，使社区能够高效构建多功能具身智能体，相关模型和代码已开源。

Abstract: Developing a universal and versatile embodied intelligence system presents two primary challenges: the critical embodied data bottleneck, where real-world data is scarce and expensive, and the algorithmic inefficiency of existing methods, which are resource-prohibitive. To address these limitations, we introduce Deliberate Practice Policy Optimization (DPPO), a metacognitive ``Metaloop'' training framework that dynamically alternates between supervised fine-tuning (competence expansion) and reinforcement learning (skill refinement). This enables automatic weakness identification and targeted resource allocation, specifically designed to maximize learning efficiency from sparse, finite data. Theoretically, DPPO can be formalised as a unified preference-learning framework. Empirically, training a vision-language embodied model with DPPO, referred to as Pelican-VL 1.0, yields a 20.3% performance improvement over the base model and surpasses open-source models at the 100B-parameter scale by 10.6%. We are open-sourcing both the models and code, providing the first systematic framework that alleviates the data and resource bottleneck and enables the community to build versatile embodied agents efficiently.

TL;DR: MedBayes-Lite是一种轻量级贝叶斯增强框架，用于提升基于transformer的临床语言模型的不确定性感知能力，无需重新训练即可显著改善校准和可信度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: transformer模型在临床决策支持中表现出潜力，但在模糊医疗案例中容易过度自信，而校准的不确定性对于医疗应用至关重要。

Method: 集成三个组件：贝叶斯嵌入校准（使用蒙特卡洛dropout）、不确定性加权注意力（对token可靠性进行边缘化处理）、置信度引导的决策塑造（受临床风险最小化启发）。

Result: 在生物医学问答和临床预测基准测试中，持续改善校准和可信度，将过度自信减少32%至48%，在模拟临床环境中可防止高达41%的诊断错误。

Conclusion: 该框架在医疗AI系统中实现了可靠的不确定性传播，并提高了可解释性。

Abstract: We propose MedBayes-Lite, a lightweight Bayesian enhancement for transformer-based clinical language models designed to produce reliable, uncertainty-aware predictions. Although transformers show strong potential for clinical decision support, they remain prone to overconfidence, especially in ambiguous medical cases where calibrated uncertainty is critical. MedBayes-Lite embeds uncertainty quantification directly into existing transformer pipelines without any retraining or architectural rewiring, adding no new trainable layers and keeping parameter overhead under 3 percent. The framework integrates three components: (i) Bayesian Embedding Calibration using Monte Carlo dropout for epistemic uncertainty, (ii) Uncertainty-Weighted Attention that marginalizes over token reliability, and (iii) Confidence-Guided Decision Shaping inspired by clinical risk minimization. Across biomedical QA and clinical prediction benchmarks (MedQA, PubMedQA, MIMIC-III), MedBayes-Lite consistently improves calibration and trustworthiness, reducing overconfidence by 32 to 48 percent. In simulated clinical settings, it can prevent up to 41 percent of diagnostic errors by flagging uncertain predictions for human review. These results demonstrate its effectiveness in enabling reliable uncertainty propagation and improving interpretability in medical AI systems.

Abstract: This paper presents the implementation of an advanced artificial intelligence-based algorithmic trading system specifically designed for the EUR-USD pair within the high-frequency environment of the Forex market. The methodological approach centers on integrating a holistic set of input features: key fundamental macroeconomic variables (for example, Gross Domestic Product and Unemployment Rate) collected from both the Euro Zone and the United States, alongside a comprehensive suite of technical variables (including indicators, oscillators, Fibonacci levels, and price divergences). The performance of the resulting algorithm is evaluated using standard machine learning metrics to quantify predictive accuracy and backtesting simulations across historical data to assess trading profitability and risk. The study concludes with a comparative analysis to determine which class of input features, fundamental or technical, provides greater and more reliable predictive capacity for generating profitable trading signals.

Conclusion: 通过连接认知科学和LLM研究，为开发基于原则性认知机制而非脆弱推理捷径或记忆的模型奠定基础，为改进模型能力和大规模测试人类认知理论开辟新方向。

Abstract: Large language models solve complex problems yet fail on simpler variants, suggesting they achieve correct outputs through mechanisms fundamentally different from human reasoning. We synthesize cognitive science research into a taxonomy of 28 cognitive elements spanning computational constraints, meta-cognitive controls, knowledge representations, and transformation operations, then analyze their behavioral manifestations in reasoning traces. We propose a fine-grained cognitive evaluation framework and conduct the first large-scale analysis of 170K traces from 17 models across text, vision, and audio modalities, alongside 54 human think-aloud traces, which we make publicly available. Our analysis reveals systematic structural differences: humans employ hierarchical nesting and meta-cognitive monitoring while models rely on shallow forward chaining, with divergence most pronounced on ill-structured problems. Meta-analysis of 1,598 LLM reasoning papers reveals the research community concentrates on easily quantifiable behaviors (sequential organization: 55%, decomposition: 60%) while neglecting meta-cognitive controls (self-awareness: 16%, evaluation: 8%) that correlate with success. Models possess behavioral repertoires associated with success but fail to deploy them spontaneously. Leveraging these patterns, we develop test-time reasoning guidance that automatically scaffold successful structures, improving performance by up to 60% on complex problems. By bridging cognitive science and LLM research, we establish a foundation for developing models that reason through principled cognitive mechanisms rather than brittle spurious reasoning shortcuts or memorization, opening new directions for both improving model capabilities and testing theories of human cognition at scale.
