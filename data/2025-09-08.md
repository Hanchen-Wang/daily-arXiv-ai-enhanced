### [1] [Facial Emotion Recognition does not detect feeling unsafe in automated driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04490)
*Abel van Elburg,Konstantinos Gkentsidis,Mathieu Sarrazin,Sarah Barendswaard,Varun Kotian,Riender Happee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过驾驶模拟器实验研究自动驾驶风格和行人交互对乘客风险感知的影响，开发了基于车辆运动和皮电导的神经网络风险预测模型


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究自动驾驶车辆的公众接受度，探索乘客对自动驾驶风险的感知特征和对象性评估方法

Method: 使用32名参与者进行驾驶模拟器实验，收集主观舒适度评分、车辆运动、面部表情、皮电导、心率和眼动跟踪数据，并建立神经网络风险预测模型

Result: 动态驾驶风格导致更强的不舒适感，行人交互加剧了风险感知；面部表情识别在风险评估中不可靠；神经网络模型能够准确预测主观风险感知

Conclusion: 车辆运动和皮电导数据可以对象地评估自动驾驶风险感知，为自动驾驶安全性评估提供有效方法，减少主观偏差

Abstract: Trust and perceived safety play a crucial role in the public acceptance of
automated vehicles. To understand perceived risk, an experiment was conducted
using a driving simulator under two automated driving styles and optionally
introducing a crossing pedestrian. Data was collected from 32 participants,
consisting of continuous subjective comfort ratings, motion, webcam footage for
facial expression, skin conductance, heart rate, and eye tracking. The
continuous subjective perceived risk ratings showed significant discomfort
associated with perceived risk during cornering and braking followed by relief
or even positive comfort on continuing the ride. The dynamic driving style
induced a stronger discomfort as compared to the calm driving style. The
crossing pedestrian did not affect discomfort with the calm driving style but
doubled the comfort decrement with the dynamic driving style. This illustrates
the importance of consequences of critical interactions in risk perception.
Facial expression was successfully analyzed for 24 participants but most
(15/24) did not show any detectable facial reaction to the critical event.
Among the 9 participants who did, 8 showed a Happy expression, and only 4
showed a Surprise expression. Fear was never dominant. This indicates that
facial expression recognition is not a reliable method for assessing perceived
risk in automated vehicles. To predict perceived risk a neural network model
was implemented using vehicle motion and skin conductance. The model correlated
well with reported perceived risk, demonstrating its potential for objective
perceived risk assessment in automated vehicles, reducing subjective bias and
highlighting areas for future research.

### [2] [PromptEnhancer: A Simple Approach to Enhance Text-to-Image Models via Chain-of-Thought Prompt Rewriting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04545)
*Linqing Wang,Ximing Xing,Yiji Cheng,Zhiyuan Zhao,Jiale Tao,Qixun Wang,Ruihuang Li,Xin Li,Mingrui Wu,Xinchi Deng,Chunyu Wang,Qinglin Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PromptEnhancer是一个通用的提示词重写框架，通过强化学习训练思维链重写器，利用专门的奖励模型提供细粒度反馈，显著提升文本到图像生成模型的对齐效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到图像扩散模型在处理复杂用户提示时经常出现属性绑定、否定和组合关系方面的失败，导致用户意图与生成输出之间存在显著不匹配。

Method: 提出PromptEnhancer框架，通过强化学习训练思维链重写器，使用基于24个关键点的系统分类学的AlignEvaluator奖励模型提供明确反馈，优化提示词重写过程。

Result: 在HunyuanImage 2.1模型上的广泛实验表明，PromptEnhancer在广泛的语义和组合挑战中显著提高了图像-文本对齐效果。

Conclusion: 该框架无需修改预训练模型的权重即可提升任何T2I模型性能，并引入了新的人类偏好基准来促进未来研究。

Abstract: Recent advancements in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in generating high-fidelity images. However, these
models often struggle to faithfully render complex user prompts, particularly
in aspects like attribute binding, negation, and compositional relationships.
This leads to a significant mismatch between user intent and the generated
output. To address this challenge, we introduce PromptEnhancer, a novel and
universal prompt rewriting framework that enhances any pretrained T2I model
without requiring modifications to its weights. Unlike prior methods that rely
on model-specific fine-tuning or implicit reward signals like image-reward
scores, our framework decouples the rewriter from the generator. We achieve
this by training a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) rewriter through reinforcement
learning, guided by a dedicated reward model we term the AlignEvaluator. The
AlignEvaluator is trained to provide explicit and fine-grained feedback based
on a systematic taxonomy of 24 key points, which are derived from a
comprehensive analysis of common T2I failure modes. By optimizing the CoT
rewriter to maximize the reward from our AlignEvaluator, our framework learns
to generate prompts that are more precisely interpreted by T2I models.
Extensive experiments on the HunyuanImage 2.1 model demonstrate that
PromptEnhancer significantly improves image-text alignment across a wide range
of semantic and compositional challenges. Furthermore, we introduce a new,
high-quality human preference benchmark to facilitate future research in this
direction.

### [3] [Skywork UniPic 2.0: Building Kontext Model with Online RL for Unified Multimodal Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04548)
*Hongyang Wei,Baixin Xu,Hongbo Liu,Cyrus Wu,Jie Liu,Yi Peng,Peiyu Wang,Zexiang Liu,Jingwen He,Yidan Xietian,Chuanxin Tang,Zidong Wang,Yichen Wei,Liang Hu,Boyi Jiang,William Li,Ying He,Yang Liu,Xuchen Song,Eric Li,Yahui Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniPic2-SD3.5M-Kontext是一个2B参数的DiT模型，基于SD3.5-Medium架构改进，通过渐进式双任务强化策略实现最先进的图像生成和编辑能力，并扩展到统一多模态框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开源多模态模型过于注重参数规模扩展而忽视训练策略优化，限制了效率和性能。

Method: 对SD3.5-Medium进行架构修改和大规模高质量数据预训练，提出渐进式双任务强化策略(PDTR)，分阶段强化文本到图像生成和编辑任务。

Result: 模型在图像生成和编辑方面超越了参数更大的BAGEL(7B)和Flux-Kontext(12B)等模型，并成功构建了统一多模态模型UniPic2-Metaquery。

Conclusion: 提出的训练范式有效且具有良好泛化能力，被形式化为Skywork UniPic 2.0框架。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal models have demonstrated impressive
capabilities in unified image generation and editing. However, many prominent
open-source models prioritize scaling model parameters over optimizing training
strategies, limiting their efficiency and performance. In this work, we present
UniPic2-SD3.5M-Kontext, a 2B-parameter DiT model based on SD3.5-Medium, which
achieves state-of-the-art image generation and editing while extending
seamlessly into a unified multimodal framework. Our approach begins with
architectural modifications to SD3.5-Medium and large-scale pre-training on
high-quality data, enabling joint text-to-image generation and editing
capabilities. To enhance instruction following and editing consistency, we
propose a novel Progressive Dual-Task Reinforcement strategy (PDTR), which
effectively strengthens both tasks in a staged manner. We empirically validate
that the reinforcement phases for different tasks are mutually beneficial and
do not induce negative interference. After pre-training and reinforcement
strategies, UniPic2-SD3.5M-Kontext demonstrates stronger image generation and
editing capabilities than models with significantly larger generation
parameters-including BAGEL (7B) and Flux-Kontext (12B). Furthermore, following
the MetaQuery, we connect the UniPic2-SD3.5M-Kontext and Qwen2.5-VL-7B via a
connector and perform joint training to launch a unified multimodal model
UniPic2-Metaquery. UniPic2-Metaquery integrates understanding, generation, and
editing, achieving top-tier performance across diverse tasks with a simple and
scalable training paradigm. This consistently validates the effectiveness and
generalizability of our proposed training paradigm, which we formalize as
Skywork UniPic 2.0.

### [4] [Inpaint4Drag: Repurposing Inpainting Models for Drag-Based Image Editing via Bidirectional Warping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04582)
*Jingyi Lu,Kai Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Inpaint4Drag是一个基于拖拽的图像编辑框架，通过像素空间双向扭曲和图像修复实现实时编辑，相比现有方法大幅提升交互体验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于生成模型潜在空间操作的拖拽编辑方法存在精度有限、反馈延迟和模型特定限制等问题，需要更高效精确的解决方案。

Method: 将拖拽编辑分解为像素空间双向扭曲和图像修复两个步骤，将图像区域视为可变形材料，通过弹性物体变形原理实现自然形状保持。

Result: 在512x512分辨率下实现实时扭曲预览(0.01秒)和高效修复(0.3秒)，相比需要数分钟编辑的现有方法显著提升交互体验，并可作为通用适配器兼容任何修复模型。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持实时性能的同时实现了卓越的视觉质量和精确控制，为拖拽式图像编辑提供了高效通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Drag-based image editing has emerged as a powerful paradigm for intuitive
image manipulation. However, existing approaches predominantly rely on
manipulating the latent space of generative models, leading to limited
precision, delayed feedback, and model-specific constraints. Accordingly, we
present Inpaint4Drag, a novel framework that decomposes drag-based editing into
pixel-space bidirectional warping and image inpainting. Inspired by elastic
object deformation in the physical world, we treat image regions as deformable
materials that maintain natural shape under user manipulation. Our method
achieves real-time warping previews (0.01s) and efficient inpainting (0.3s) at
512x512 resolution, significantly improving the interaction experience compared
to existing methods that require minutes per edit. By transforming drag inputs
directly into standard inpainting formats, our approach serves as a universal
adapter for any inpainting model without architecture modification,
automatically inheriting all future improvements in inpainting technology.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior visual
quality and precise control while maintaining real-time performance. Project

### [5] [DisPatch: Disarming Adversarial Patches in Object Detection with Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04597)
*Jin Ma,Mohammed Aldeen,Christopher Salas,Feng Luo,Mashrur Chowdhury,Mert Pesé,Long Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DISPATCH是一个基于扩散模型的物体检测防御框架，采用"再生和修正"策略来对抗对抗性补丁攻击，无需先验知识即可有效防御多种攻击类型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的物体检测器容易受到对抗性补丁攻击，这些攻击可以在现实世界中隐藏实际物体或创建不存在的物体，造成严重后果。现有防御方法需要针对特定攻击设计，缺乏通用性和鲁棒性。

Method: 提出DISPATCH框架：1）利用扩散模型的生成能力重新生成整个图像，使其与良性数据对齐；2）通过修正过程识别并替换对抗性区域为重新生成的良性对应物。该方法与攻击无关，无需已知补丁信息。

Result: 在多个检测器和攻击方法上的实验表明，DISPATCH在隐藏攻击上达到89.3%的最佳mAP.5分数，在无目标创建攻击上将攻击成功率降低至24.8%，始终优于现有最先进防御方法。

Conclusion: DISPATCH是对抗性补丁攻击的有效、通用且鲁棒的防御方案，对自适应攻击保持强鲁棒性，为物体检测系统提供了实用可靠的防御机制。

Abstract: Object detection is fundamental to various real-world applications, such as
security monitoring and surveillance video analysis. Despite their
advancements, state-of-theart object detectors are still vulnerable to
adversarial patch attacks, which can be easily applied to real-world objects to
either conceal actual items or create non-existent ones, leading to severe
consequences. Given the current diversity of adversarial patch attacks and
potential unknown threats, an ideal defense method should be effective,
generalizable, and robust against adaptive attacks. In this work, we introduce
DISPATCH, the first diffusion-based defense framework for object detection.
Unlike previous works that aim to "detect and remove" adversarial patches,
DISPATCH adopts a "regenerate and rectify" strategy, leveraging generative
models to disarm attack effects while preserving the integrity of the input
image. Specifically, we utilize the in-distribution generative power of
diffusion models to regenerate the entire image, aligning it with benign data.
A rectification process is then employed to identify and replace adversarial
regions with their regenerated benign counterparts. DISPATCH is attack-agnostic
and requires no prior knowledge of the existing patches. Extensive experiments
across multiple detectors and attacks demonstrate that DISPATCH consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art defenses on both hiding attacks and creating
attacks, achieving the best overall mAP.5 score of 89.3% on hiding attacks, and
lowering the attack success rate to 24.8% on untargeted creating attacks.
Moreover, it maintains strong robustness against adaptive attacks, making it a
practical and reliable defense for object detection systems.

### [6] [WATCH: World-aware Allied Trajectory and pose reconstruction for Camera and Human](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04600)
*Qijun Ying,Zhongyuan Hu,Rui Zhang,Ronghui Li,Yu Lu,Zijiao Zeng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WATCH是一个统一的框架，用于从单目视频中重建全局人体运动，通过创新的航向角分解技术和相机轨迹整合机制，解决了深度模糊和运动模糊问题，在轨迹重建方面达到了最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于人体运动的方法在利用相机方向信息和整合相机平移线索方面存在不足，需要解决相机到世界坐标映射的深度模糊、运动模糊以及相机与人体运动纠缠等挑战。

Method: 提出了WATCH框架，包含解析航向角分解技术（高效且可扩展）和受世界模型启发的相机轨迹整合机制，能够有效利用相机平移信息。

Result: 在野外基准测试中，WATCH在端到端轨迹重建方面实现了最先进的性能，证明了联合建模相机-人体运动关系的有效性。

Conclusion: 该工作为解决相机平移整合这一长期挑战提供了新见解，展示了联合建模方法的有效性，代码将公开提供。

Abstract: Global human motion reconstruction from in-the-wild monocular videos is
increasingly demanded across VR, graphics, and robotics applications, yet
requires accurate mapping of human poses from camera to world coordinates-a
task challenged by depth ambiguity, motion ambiguity, and the entanglement
between camera and human movements. While human-motion-centric approaches excel
in preserving motion details and physical plausibility, they suffer from two
critical limitations: insufficient exploitation of camera orientation
information and ineffective integration of camera translation cues. We present
WATCH (World-aware Allied Trajectory and pose reconstruction for Camera and
Human), a unified framework addressing both challenges. Our approach introduces
an analytical heading angle decomposition technique that offers superior
efficiency and extensibility compared to existing geometric methods.
Additionally, we design a camera trajectory integration mechanism inspired by
world models, providing an effective pathway for leveraging camera translation
information beyond naive hard-decoding approaches. Through experiments on
in-the-wild benchmarks, WATCH achieves state-of-the-art performance in
end-to-end trajectory reconstruction. Our work demonstrates the effectiveness
of jointly modeling camera-human motion relationships and offers new insights
for addressing the long-standing challenge of camera translation integration in
global human motion reconstruction. The code will be available publicly.

### [7] [Sali4Vid: Saliency-Aware Video Reweighting and Adaptive Caption Retrieval for Dense Video Captioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04602)
*MinJu Jeon,Si-Woo Kim,Ye-Chan Kim,HyunGee Kim,Dong-Jin Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Sali4Vid是一个基于显著性的密集视频字幕框架，通过视频重加权和自适应字幕检索来解决现有方法的时间戳监督不足和固定大小视频块检索的问题，在YouCook2和ViTT数据集上取得了最先进的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的端到端密集视频字幕模型存在两个主要问题：(1)仅对文本应用时间戳监督，而将所有视频帧同等对待；(2)从固定大小的视频块中检索字幕，忽略了场景转换。

Method: 提出了Sali4Vid框架，包含两个核心组件：1)显著性感知视频重加权 - 将时间戳标注转换为基于sigmoid的帧重要性权重；2)基于语义的自适应字幕检索 - 通过帧相似性分割视频以捕捉场景转换并改进字幕检索。

Result: 在YouCook2和ViTT数据集上实现了最先进的性能，证明了联合改进视频加权和检索对密集视频字幕的益处。

Conclusion: Sali4Vid是一个简单而有效的显著性感知框架，通过更好地利用时间戳监督和考虑场景转换，显著提升了密集视频字幕的性能。

Abstract: Dense video captioning aims to temporally localize events in video and
generate captions for each event. While recent works propose end-to-end models,
they suffer from two limitations: (1) applying timestamp supervision only to
text while treating all video frames equally, and (2) retrieving captions from
fixed-size video chunks, overlooking scene transitions. To address these, we
propose Sali4Vid, a simple yet effective saliency-aware framework. We introduce
Saliency-aware Video Reweighting, which converts timestamp annotations into
sigmoid-based frame importance weights, and Semantic-based Adaptive Caption
Retrieval, which segments videos by frame similarity to capture scene
transitions and improve caption retrieval. Sali4Vid achieves state-of-the-art
results on YouCook2 and ViTT, demonstrating the benefit of jointly improving
video weighting and retrieval for dense video captioning

Abstract: Traffic congestion and violations pose significant challenges for urban
mobility and road safety. Traditional traffic monitoring systems, such as fixed
cameras and sensor-based methods, are often constrained by limited coverage,
low adaptability, and poor scalability. To address these challenges, this paper
introduces an advanced unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based traffic surveillance
system capable of accurate vehicle detection, classification, tracking, and
behavioral analysis in real-world, unconstrained urban environments. The system
leverages multi-scale and multi-angle template matching, Kalman filtering, and
homography-based calibration to process aerial video data collected from
altitudes of approximately 200 meters. A case study in urban area demonstrates
robust performance, achieving a detection precision of 91.8%, an F1-score of
90.5%, and tracking metrics (MOTA/MOTP) of 92.1% and 93.7%, respectively.
Beyond precise detection, the system classifies five vehicle types and
automatically detects critical traffic violations, including unsafe lane
changes, illegal double parking, and crosswalk obstructions, through the fusion
of geofencing, motion filtering, and trajectory deviation analysis. The
integrated analytics module supports origin-destination tracking, vehicle count
visualization, inter-class correlation analysis, and heatmap-based congestion
modeling. Additionally, the system enables entry-exit trajectory profiling,
vehicle density estimation across road segments, and movement direction
logging, supporting comprehensive multi-scale urban mobility analytics.
Experimental results confirms the system's scalability, accuracy, and practical
relevance, highlighting its potential as an enforcement-aware,
infrastructure-independent traffic monitoring solution for next-generation
smart cities.

### [9] [VCMamba: Bridging Convolutions with Multi-Directional Mamba for Efficient Visual Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04669)
*Mustafa Munir,Alex Zhang,Radu Marculescu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VCMamba是一个新颖的视觉骨干网络，结合了CNN的局部特征提取能力和Mamba SSM的全局建模能力，在ImageNet和ADE20K上取得了优异的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ViT和SSM在全局上下文建模方面表现出色，但缺乏CNN对细粒度局部特征的有效捕捉能力；而CNN虽然擅长局部特征提取，但缺乏全局推理能力。需要一种能结合两者优势的混合架构。

Method: 采用卷积stem和分层结构，早期阶段使用卷积块提取局部特征，后期阶段使用多方向Mamba块建模长距离依赖和全局上下文，保持线性复杂度。

Result: VCMamba-B在ImageNet-1K上达到82.6% top-1准确率，比PlainMamba-L3高0.3%且参数减少37%；在ADE20K上获得47.1 mIoU，比EfficientFormer-L7高2.0 mIoU且参数减少62%。

Conclusion: VCMamba成功整合了CNN和Mamba SSM的优势，在保持线性复杂度的同时实现了优异的特征表示能力，为视觉任务提供了高效的骨干网络解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision Transformers (ViTs) and State Space Models (SSMs)
have challenged the dominance of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in
computer vision. ViTs excel at capturing global context, and SSMs like Mamba
offer linear complexity for long sequences, yet they do not capture
fine-grained local features as effectively as CNNs. Conversely, CNNs possess
strong inductive biases for local features but lack the global reasoning
capabilities of transformers and Mamba. To bridge this gap, we introduce
\textit{VCMamba}, a novel vision backbone that integrates the strengths of CNNs
and multi-directional Mamba SSMs. VCMamba employs a convolutional stem and a
hierarchical structure with convolutional blocks in its early stages to extract
rich local features. These convolutional blocks are then processed by later
stages incorporating multi-directional Mamba blocks designed to efficiently
model long-range dependencies and global context. This hybrid design allows for
superior feature representation while maintaining linear complexity with
respect to image resolution. We demonstrate VCMamba's effectiveness through
extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K classification and ADE20K semantic
segmentation. Our VCMamba-B achieves 82.6% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K,
surpassing PlainMamba-L3 by 0.3% with 37% fewer parameters, and outperforming
Vision GNN-B by 0.3% with 64% fewer parameters. Furthermore, VCMamba-B obtains
47.1 mIoU on ADE20K, exceeding EfficientFormer-L7 by 2.0 mIoU while utilizing
62% fewer parameters. Code is available at
https://github.com/Wertyuui345/VCMamba.

*Vanshika Vats,Ashwani Rathee,James Davis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种多智能体训练免费框架，通过Worker-Supervisor迭代架构协调通用视觉语言模型，确保语义分割结果严格遵循复杂的文本标注指南。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中的语义分割不仅需要准确的分割掩码，还必须严格遵循复杂的文本标注指南。传统方法需要昂贵的任务特定重新训练，且无法适应指南的演变。现有开放词汇分割方法在处理段落级复杂指南时表现不佳。

Method: 采用多智能体训练免费框架，包含Worker执行分割、Supervisor根据检索到的指南进行批判、以及轻量级强化学习停止策略决定循环终止时机，确保指南一致性同时平衡资源使用。

Result: 在Waymo和ReasonSeg数据集上的评估显示，该方法显著优于最先进的基线方法，表现出强大的泛化能力和指令遵循能力。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了复杂标注指南下的语义分割问题，无需重新训练即可适应指南变化，在保持高质量分割的同时实现了资源效率。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation in real-world applications often requires not only
accurate masks but also strict adherence to textual labeling guidelines. These
guidelines are typically complex and long, and both human and automated
labeling often fail to follow them faithfully. Traditional approaches depend on
expensive task-specific retraining that must be repeated as the guidelines
evolve. Although recent open-vocabulary segmentation methods excel with simple
prompts, they often fail when confronted with sets of paragraph-length
guidelines that specify intricate segmentation rules. To address this, we
introduce a multi-agent, training-free framework that coordinates
general-purpose vision-language models within an iterative Worker-Supervisor
refinement architecture. The Worker performs the segmentation, the Supervisor
critiques it against the retrieved guidelines, and a lightweight reinforcement
learning stop policy decides when to terminate the loop, ensuring
guideline-consistent masks while balancing resource use. Evaluated on the Waymo
and ReasonSeg datasets, our method notably outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines, demonstrating strong generalization and instruction adherence.

### [11] [Domain Adaptation for Different Sensor Configurations in 3D Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04711)
*Satoshi Tanaka,Kok Seang Tan,Isamu Yamashita*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出两种技术解决不同传感器配置间的3D物体检测领域适应问题：下游微调和部分层微调，在多配置联合训练中表现优于朴素方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 不同车辆平台使用不同的传感器配置导致点云分布差异，现有研究主要关注环境领域差距和单一LiDAR内的密度变化，而不同传感器配置间的领域差距尚未充分探索

Method: 提出下游微调（在多数据集训练后进行数据集特定微调）和部分层微调（仅更新部分层以提高跨配置泛化能力），使用同一地理区域采集的多传感器配置配对数据集

Result: 联合训练结合下游微调和部分层微调始终优于每种配置的朴素联合训练

Conclusion: 为适应不同车辆平台的3D物体检测模型提供了实用且可扩展的解决方案

Abstract: Recent advances in autonomous driving have underscored the importance of
accurate 3D object detection, with LiDAR playing a central role due to its
robustness under diverse visibility conditions. However, different vehicle
platforms often deploy distinct sensor configurations, causing performance
degradation when models trained on one configuration are applied to another
because of shifts in the point cloud distribution. Prior work on multi-dataset
training and domain adaptation for 3D object detection has largely addressed
environmental domain gaps and density variation within a single LiDAR; in
contrast, the domain gap for different sensor configurations remains largely
unexplored. In this work, we address domain adaptation across different sensor
configurations in 3D object detection. We propose two techniques: Downstream
Fine-tuning (dataset-specific fine-tuning after multi-dataset training) and
Partial Layer Fine-tuning (updating only a subset of layers to improve
cross-configuration generalization). Using paired datasets collected in the
same geographic region with multiple sensor configurations, we show that joint
training with Downstream Fine-tuning and Partial Layer Fine-tuning consistently
outperforms naive joint training for each configuration. Our findings provide a
practical and scalable solution for adapting 3D object detection models to the
diverse vehicle platforms.

TL;DR: 提出CD-Mamba混合模型，结合卷积神经网络和Mamba状态空间建模，用于遥感图像云检测，能同时处理局部空间关系和长程依赖关系


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 遥感图像常被云层遮挡，影响数据完整性和可靠性。云检测需要同时处理短程空间冗余和长程大气相似性

Method: 提出CD-Mamba混合模型，整合卷积神经网络（捕捉局部空间依赖）和Mamba状态空间建模（处理长程依赖），形成统一的云检测网络

Result: 大量实验验证了CD-Mamba的有效性，证明其在检测精度上优于现有方法

Conclusion: CD-Mamba能够同时管理像素级交互和大范围斑块级依赖关系，在不同空间尺度上提高检测精度

Abstract: Remote sensing images are frequently obscured by cloud cover, posing
significant challenges to data integrity and reliability. Effective cloud
detection requires addressing both short-range spatial redundancies and
long-range atmospheric similarities among cloud patches. Convolutional neural
networks are effective at capturing local spatial dependencies, while Mamba has
strong capabilities in modeling long-range dependencies. To fully leverage both
local spatial relations and long-range dependencies, we propose CD-Mamba, a
hybrid model that integrates convolution and Mamba's state-space modeling into
a unified cloud detection network. CD-Mamba is designed to comprehensively
capture pixelwise textural details and long term patchwise dependencies for
cloud detection. This design enables CD-Mamba to manage both pixel-wise
interactions and extensive patch-wise dependencies simultaneously, improving
detection accuracy across diverse spatial scales. Extensive experiments
validate the effectiveness of CD-Mamba and demonstrate its superior performance
over existing methods.

TL;DR: 提出Task Consistency Training (TCT)框架解决医学图像分割中的类别不平衡问题，无需额外模型，通过一致性约束和过滤策略有效利用未标注数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割中获取所有类别的完整标注成本高昂，部分标注数据集存在严重的类别不平衡问题，现有方法需要额外模型且容易受到标签噪声影响。

Method: TCT框架包含主分割头和多辅助任务头，通过一致性约束利用未标注解剖结构，采用过滤策略排除低一致性数据，使用统一辅助不确定性加权损失防止特定任务主导。

Result: 在8个不同临床站点的腹部数据集上进行广泛实验，证明了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: TCT框架能够有效解决类别不平衡问题，无需额外模型，在医学图像分割任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Versatile medical image segmentation (VMIS) targets the segmentation of
multiple classes, while obtaining full annotations for all classes is often
impractical due to the time and labor required. Leveraging partially labeled
datasets (PLDs) presents a promising alternative; however, current VMIS
approaches face significant class imbalance due to the unequal category
distribution in PLDs. Existing methods attempt to address this by generating
pseudo-full labels. Nevertheless, these typically require additional models and
often result in potential performance degradation from label noise. In this
work, we introduce a Task Consistency Training (TCT) framework to address class
imbalance without requiring extra models. TCT includes a backbone network with
a main segmentation head (MSH) for multi-channel predictions and multiple
auxiliary task heads (ATHs) for task-specific predictions. By enforcing a
consistency constraint between the MSH and ATH predictions, TCT effectively
utilizes unlabeled anatomical structures. To avoid error propagation from
low-consistency, potentially noisy data, we propose a filtering strategy to
exclude such data. Additionally, we introduce a unified auxiliary
uncertainty-weighted loss (UAUWL) to mitigate segmentation quality declines
caused by the dominance of specific tasks. Extensive experiments on eight
abdominal datasets from diverse clinical sites demonstrate our approach's
effectiveness.

*Dharsan Ravindran,Kevin Wang,Zhuoyuan Cao,Saleh Abdelrahman,Jeffery Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文针对SAM和SAM2在恶劣天气条件下分割性能不佳的问题，提出了两种不确定性感知方法：多步微调SAM2和适配UAT到驾驶场景，在多个驾驶数据集上验证了改进效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉基础模型(SAM/SAM2)在视觉模糊性高的恶劣天气条件下表现不佳，缺乏不确定性量化能力，而自动驾驶在安全关键场景中需要更可靠的分割性能。

Method: 1. 为SAM2设计多步微调程序，将不确定性指标直接融入损失函数；2. 将医学影像中的不确定性感知适配器(UAT)适配到驾驶场景。

Result: 在CamVid、BDD100K和GTA驾驶数据集上的实验表明：UAT-SAM在极端天气下优于标准SAM，带有不确定性感知损失的SAM2在多样化驾驶场景中性能提升。

Conclusion: 显式不确定性建模对于挑战性环境中的安全关键自动驾驶具有重要价值，不确定性感知方法能显著提升分割模型的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision foundation models, such as the Segment Anything
Model (SAM) and its successor SAM2, have achieved state-of-the-art performance
on general image segmentation benchmarks. However, these models struggle in
adverse weather conditions where visual ambiguity is high, largely due to their
lack of uncertainty quantification. Inspired by progress in medical imaging,
where uncertainty-aware training has improved reliability in ambiguous cases,
we investigate two approaches to enhance segmentation robustness for autonomous
driving. First, we introduce a multi-step finetuning procedure for SAM2 that
incorporates uncertainty metrics directly into the loss function, improving
overall scene recognition. Second, we adapt the Uncertainty-Aware Adapter
(UAT), originally designed for medical image segmentation, to driving contexts.
We evaluate both methods on CamVid, BDD100K, and GTA driving datasets.
Experiments show that UAT-SAM outperforms standard SAM in extreme weather,
while SAM2 with uncertainty-aware loss achieves improved performance across
diverse driving scenes. These findings underscore the value of explicit
uncertainty modeling for safety-critical autonomous driving in challenging
environments.

Abstract: Despite advances in practical and multimodal fine-grained Human Activity

environments remains elusive. We present WatchHAR, an audio and inertial-based
HAR system that operates fully on smartwatches, addressing privacy and latency
issues associated with external data processing. By optimizing each component

a novel architecture that unifies sensor data preprocessing and inference into
an end-to-end trainable module, achieving 5x faster processing while

outperforms state-of-the-art models for event detection and activity
classification while running directly on the smartwatch, achieving 9.3 ms
processing time for activity event detection and 11.8 ms for multimodal
activity classification. This research advances on-device activity recognition,
realizing smartwatches' potential as standalone, privacy-aware, and
minimally-invasive continuous activity tracking devices.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MCANet是一个用于飓风后损害评估的多标签分类框架，通过多尺度特征学习和类别特定注意力机制，在RescueNet数据集上达到91.75%的mAP，优于多个基准模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的CNN方法难以捕捉多尺度空间特征，且难以区分视觉相似或共现的损害类型，这限制了飓风后损害评估的准确性和效率。

Method: 提出MCANet框架：1) 使用Res2Net分层骨干网络丰富多尺度空间上下文；2) 采用多头类别特定残差注意力模块，每个注意力分支关注不同空间粒度；3) 平衡局部细节与全局上下文。

Result: 在RescueNet数据集(4,494张UAV图像)上：MCANet达到91.75% mAP，优于ResNet、Res2Net、VGG等模型；使用8个注意力头时性能提升至92.35%，对Road Blocked等困难类别的AP提升超过6%。

Conclusion: MCANet能够准确定位损害相关区域，支持可解释性，输出可用于灾后风险制图、应急路由等应用。未来可集成灾害知识图谱和多模态大语言模型来提升适应性。

Abstract: Rapid and accurate post-hurricane damage assessment is vital for disaster
response and recovery. Yet existing CNN-based methods struggle to capture
multi-scale spatial features and to distinguish visually similar or
co-occurring damage types. To address these issues, we propose MCANet, a
multi-label classification framework that learns multi-scale representations
and adaptively attends to spatially relevant regions for each damage category.
MCANet employs a Res2Net-based hierarchical backbone to enrich spatial context
across scales and a multi-head class-specific residual attention module to
enhance discrimination. Each attention branch focuses on different spatial
granularities, balancing local detail with global context. We evaluate MCANet
on the RescueNet dataset of 4,494 UAV images collected after Hurricane Michael.
MCANet achieves a mean average precision (mAP) of 91.75%, outperforming ResNet,
Res2Net, VGG, MobileNet, EfficientNet, and ViT. With eight attention heads,
performance further improves to 92.35%, boosting average precision for
challenging classes such as Road Blocked by over 6%. Class activation mapping
confirms MCANet's ability to localize damage-relevant regions, supporting
interpretability. Outputs from MCANet can inform post-disaster risk mapping,
emergency routing, and digital twin-based disaster response. Future work could
integrate disaster-specific knowledge graphs and multimodal large language
models to improve adaptability to unseen disasters and enrich semantic
understanding for real-world decision-making.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于VLM的动态人群检测方法，通过全局优化图解决了视频中人群动态变化的检测问题，在公开数据集上超越了现有最佳方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统人群检测方法假设视频中人群不变，无法处理动态变化的群体结构。识别复杂人群需要同时考虑局部外观特征和全局场景上下文。

Method: 使用组检测增强的视觉-语言模型(VLM)提取每帧的局部和全局特征，通过全局优化图对所有帧的组织概率进行动态检测。

Result: 在公开数据集上超越了现有的state-of-the-art人群检测方法。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效检测视频中动态变化的人群，通过VLM特征提取和全局优化实现了更准确的组织检测。

Abstract: This paper proposes dynamic human group detection in videos. For detecting
complex groups, not only the local appearance features of in-group members but
also the global context of the scene are important. Such local and global
appearance features in each frame are extracted using a Vision-Language Model
(VLM) augmented for group detection in our method. For further improvement, the
group structure should be consistent over time. While previous methods are
stabilized on the assumption that groups are not changed in a video, our method
detects dynamically changing groups by global optimization using a graph with
all frames' groupness probabilities estimated by our groupness-augmented CLIP
features. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art group detection methods on public datasets. Code:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有计算机视觉方法在洪水检测中存在精度限制和泛化能力差的问题，需要开发能够跨不同洪水场景准确估计水深的通用解决方案

Method: 结合GPT-4o基础模型的语义推理能力和结构化领域知识图谱，动态识别RGB图像中的参考物体，检索验证高度，估计淹没比例，并应用统计异常值过滤

Result: 在110张MyCoast New York众包图像上评估，平均绝对误差为8.17厘米，比GPT-4o基线降低20.5%，优于先前的CNN方法

Conclusion: FloodVision系统在不同场景下泛化良好，近实时运行，适合集成到数字孪生平台和公民报告应用中，增强智慧城市洪水韧性

Abstract: Timely and accurate floodwater depth estimation is critical for road
accessibility and emergency response. While recent computer vision methods have
enabled flood detection, they suffer from both accuracy limitations and poor
generalization due to dependence on fixed object detectors and task-specific
training. To enable accurate depth estimation that can generalize across
diverse flood scenarios, this paper presents FloodVision, a zero-shot framework
that combines the semantic reasoning abilities of the foundation
vision-language model GPT-4o with a structured domain knowledge graph. The
knowledge graph encodes canonical real-world dimensions for common urban
objects including vehicles, people, and infrastructure elements to ground the
model's reasoning in physical reality. FloodVision dynamically identifies
visible reference objects in RGB images, retrieves verified heights from the
knowledge graph to mitigate hallucination, estimates submergence ratios, and
applies statistical outlier filtering to compute final depth values. Evaluated
on 110 crowdsourced images from MyCoast New York, FloodVision achieves a mean
absolute error of 8.17 cm, reducing the GPT-4o baseline 10.28 cm by 20.5% and
surpassing prior CNN-based methods. The system generalizes well across varying
scenes and operates in near real-time, making it suitable for future
integration into digital twin platforms and citizen-reporting apps for smart
city flood resilience.

Method: 提出PIG方法，包含伪查询生成器为每个视频生成伪查询，使视频特征和文本特征能够进行细粒度交互，在推理阶段不增加额外计算开销

Result: 在5个常用文本-视频检索基准测试中，R@1指标提升1.6%~3.9%，效率与双塔模型相当，性能接近最先进水平

Conclusion: 混合塔框架成功结合了双塔和单塔框架的优势，在文本-视频检索任务中实现了效果和效率的双重提升

Abstract: The Text-to-Video Retrieval (T2VR) task aims to retrieve unlabeled videos by
textual queries with the same semantic meanings. Recent CLIP-based approaches
have explored two frameworks: Two-Tower versus Single-Tower framework, yet the
former suffers from low effectiveness, while the latter suffers from low
efficiency. In this study, we explore a new Hybrid-Tower framework that can
hybridize the advantages of the Two-Tower and Single-Tower framework, achieving
high effectiveness and efficiency simultaneously. We propose a novel hybrid
method, Fine-grained Pseudo-query Interaction and Generation for T2VR, ie, PIG,
which includes a new pseudo-query generator designed to generate a pseudo-query
for each video. This enables the video feature and the textual features of
pseudo-query to interact in a fine-grained manner, similar to the Single-Tower
approaches to hold high effectiveness, even before the real textual query is
received. Simultaneously, our method introduces no additional storage or
computational overhead compared to the Two-Tower framework during the inference
stage, thus maintaining high efficiency. Extensive experiments on five commonly
used text-video retrieval benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves a
significant improvement over the baseline, with an increase of $1.6\% \sim
3.9\%$ in R@1. Furthermore, our method matches the efficiency of Two-Tower
models while achieving near state-of-the-art performance, highlighting the
advantages of the Hybrid-Tower framework.

Motivation: 针对MRI图像在切片维度空间分辨率低的问题，需要开发一种高效的超分辨率方法，能够在没有真实高分辨率图像的情况下提升图像质量，同时保持边缘清晰度和减少模糊。

Method: 结合MLP-Mixer和多层感知机与卷积层，构建生成对抗网络进行单维度上采样，使用MSSEG2数据集训练，并在多个临床数据集上进行验证。

Result: MLP-SRGAN相比现有方法能够产生更清晰的边缘、更少的模糊，保留更多纹理和细节，同时具有更少的参数、更快的训练/评估速度和更小的模型尺寸。

Conclusion: 该方法在MRI图像超分辨率任务中表现出色，特别是在没有真实参考图像的情况下，提出的无参考图像质量指标有效量化了图像质量改进。

Abstract: We propose a novel architecture called MLP-SRGAN, which is a single-dimension
Super Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (SRGAN) that utilizes
Multi-Layer Perceptron Mixers (MLP-Mixers) along with convolutional layers to
upsample in the slice direction. MLP-SRGAN is trained and validated using high
resolution (HR) FLAIR MRI from the MSSEG2 challenge dataset. The method was
applied to three multicentre FLAIR datasets (CAIN, ADNI, CCNA) of images with
low spatial resolution in the slice dimension to examine performance on
held-out (unseen) clinical data. Upsampled results are compared to several
state-of-the-art SR networks. For images with high resolution (HR) ground
truths, peak-signal-to-noise-ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity index
(SSIM) are used to measure upsampling performance. Several new structural,
no-reference image quality metrics were proposed to quantify sharpness (edge
strength), noise (entropy), and blurriness (low frequency information) in the
absence of ground truths. Results show MLP-SRGAN results in sharper edges, less
blurring, preserves more texture and fine-anatomical detail, with fewer
parameters, faster training/evaluation time, and smaller model size than
existing methods. Code for MLP-SRGAN training and inference, data generators,
models and no-reference image quality metrics will be available at

Conclusion: 预处理和学习型方法对于在不同条件下实现鲁棒的月球图像配准至关重要，深度学习算法在跨模态月球图像配准中展现出显著优势。

Abstract: Accurate image registration is critical for lunar exploration, enabling
surface mapping, resource localization, and mission planning. Aligning data
from diverse lunar sensors -- optical (e.g., Orbital High Resolution Camera,
Narrow and Wide Angle Cameras), hyperspectral (Imaging Infrared Spectrometer),
and radar (e.g., Dual-Frequency Synthetic Aperture Radar, Selene/Kaguya
mission) -- is challenging due to differences in resolution, illumination, and
sensor distortion. We evaluate five feature matching algorithms: SIFT, ASIFT,
AKAZE, RIFT2, and SuperGlue (a deep learning-based matcher), using
cross-modality image pairs from equatorial and polar regions. A preprocessing
pipeline is proposed, including georeferencing, resolution alignment, intensity
normalization, and enhancements like adaptive histogram equalization, principal
component analysis, and shadow correction. SuperGlue consistently yields the
lowest root mean square error and fastest runtimes. Classical methods such as
SIFT and AKAZE perform well near the equator but degrade under polar lighting.
The results highlight the importance of preprocessing and learning-based
approaches for robust lunar image registration across diverse conditions.

Conclusion: Transformer方法在移动皮肤病变分类中具有巨大潜力，为资源有限环境下的AI辅助皮肤病筛查和早期诊断提供了可行路径

Abstract: Skin diseases are among the most prevalent health concerns worldwide, yet
conventional diagnostic methods are often costly, complex, and unavailable in
low-resource settings. Automated classification using deep learning has emerged
as a promising alternative, but existing studies are mostly limited to
dermoscopic datasets and a narrow range of disease classes. In this work, we
curate a large dataset of over 50 skin disease categories captured with mobile
devices, making it more representative of real-world conditions. We evaluate
multiple convolutional neural networks and Transformer-based architectures,
demonstrating that Transformer models, particularly the Swin Transformer,
achieve superior performance by effectively capturing global contextual
features. To enhance interpretability, we incorporate Gradient-weighted Class
Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM), which highlights clinically relevant regions and
provides transparency in model predictions. Our results underscore the
potential of Transformer-based approaches for mobile-acquired skin lesion
classification, paving the way toward accessible AI-assisted dermatological

Motivation: 在安全关键应用（如交通场景感知）中，提高计算机视觉模型的可靠性需要准确且校准良好的预测不确定性估计。集成方法虽然常用但效率较低，而混合专家模型提供了更高效的替代方案。

Method: 使用混合专家模型，通过门控网络动态加权专家预测。研究了三种不确定性提取方法：预测熵、互信息和专家方差。在A2D2数据集上训练了两个专家的MoE，并评估了路由不确定性（通过门熵计算）。

Conclusion: 混合专家模型能够有效提取校准良好的预测不确定性，无需架构修改，在不确定性估计方面优于传统集成方法，为安全关键应用提供了可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Estimating accurate and well-calibrated predictive uncertainty is important
for enhancing the reliability of computer vision models, especially in
safety-critical applications like traffic scene perception. While ensemble
methods are commonly used to quantify uncertainty by combining multiple models,
a mixture of experts (MoE) offers an efficient alternative by leveraging a
gating network to dynamically weight expert predictions based on the input.
Building on the promising use of MoEs for semantic segmentation in our previous
works, we show that well-calibrated predictive uncertainty estimates can be
extracted from MoEs without architectural modifications. We investigate three
methods to extract predictive uncertainty estimates: predictive entropy, mutual
information, and expert variance. We evaluate these methods for an MoE with two
experts trained on a semantical split of the A2D2 dataset. Our results show
that MoEs yield more reliable uncertainty estimates than ensembles in terms of
conditional correctness metrics under out-of-distribution (OOD) data.
Additionally, we evaluate routing uncertainty computed via gate entropy and
find that simple gating mechanisms lead to better calibration of routing
uncertainty estimates than more complex classwise gates. Finally, our
experiments on the Cityscapes dataset suggest that increasing the number of
experts can further enhance uncertainty calibration. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Mamba方法在光场超分辨率中存在多方向扫描策略效率低下和特征冗余问题，且状态空间模型在保持空间-角度和视差信息方面存在局限

Method: 提出子空间简单扫描策略(Sub-SS)和子空间简单Mamba块(SSMB)；采用双阶段建模：第一阶段使用空间-角度残差子空间Mamba块(SA-RSMB)进行浅层特征提取，第二阶段使用双分支并行结构结合极平面Mamba块(EPMB)和极平面Transformer块(EPTB)进行深度特征精炼

Result: LFMT在真实和合成光场数据集上显著优于当前最先进方法，在保持低计算复杂度的同时实现了性能的实质性提升

Conclusion: LFMT成功整合了Mamba和Transformer的优势，实现了跨空间、角度和极平面域的全面信息探索，为光场超分辨率提供了高效且高性能的解决方案

Abstract: Recently, Mamba-based methods, with its advantage in long-range information
modeling and linear complexity, have shown great potential in optimizing both
computational cost and performance of light field image super-resolution
(LFSR). However, current multi-directional scanning strategies lead to
inefficient and redundant feature extraction when applied to complex LF data.
To overcome this challenge, we propose a Subspace Simple Scanning (Sub-SS)
strategy, based on which we design the Subspace Simple Mamba Block (SSMB) to
achieve more efficient and precise feature extraction. Furthermore, we propose
a dual-stage modeling strategy to address the limitation of state space in
preserving spatial-angular and disparity information, thereby enabling a more
comprehensive exploration of non-local spatial-angular correlations.
Specifically, in stage I, we introduce the Spatial-Angular Residual Subspace
Mamba Block (SA-RSMB) for shallow spatial-angular feature extraction; in stage
II, we use a dual-branch parallel structure combining the Epipolar Plane Mamba
Block (EPMB) and Epipolar Plane Transformer Block (EPTB) for deep epipolar
feature refinement. Building upon meticulously designed modules and strategies,
we introduce a hybrid Mamba-Transformer framework, termed LFMT. LFMT integrates
the strengths of Mamba and Transformer models for LFSR, enabling comprehensive
information exploration across spatial, angular, and epipolar-plane domains.
Experimental results demonstrate that LFMT significantly outperforms current
state-of-the-art methods in LFSR, achieving substantial improvements in
performance while maintaining low computational complexity on both real-word
and synthetic LF datasets.

Motivation: 现有端到端视觉定位方法仅依赖参考目标进行监督，忽略了潜在前景目标的益处，且缺乏多粒度判别能力，难以在复杂场景中实现鲁棒的目标识别。

Method: 提出PropVG框架，包含Contrastive-based Refer Scoring (CRS)模块（在句子和词汇层面进行对比学习）和Multi-granularity Target Discrimination (MTD)模块（融合对象和语义级信息）。

Conclusion: PropVG成功解决了现有方法的局限性，通过整合proposal生成和目标理解，结合对比学习和多粒度判别，显著提升了视觉定位性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in visual grounding have largely shifted away from
traditional proposal-based two-stage frameworks due to their inefficiency and
high computational complexity, favoring end-to-end direct reference paradigms.
However, these methods rely exclusively on the referred target for supervision,
overlooking the potential benefits of prominent prospective targets. Moreover,
existing approaches often fail to incorporate multi-granularity discrimination,
which is crucial for robust object identification in complex scenarios. To
address these limitations, we propose PropVG, an end-to-end proposal-based
framework that, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to seamlessly
integrate foreground object proposal generation with referential object
comprehension without requiring additional detectors. Furthermore, we introduce
a Contrastive-based Refer Scoring (CRS) module, which employs contrastive
learning at both sentence and word levels to enhance the capability in
understanding and distinguishing referred objects. Additionally, we design a
Multi-granularity Target Discrimination (MTD) module that fuses object- and
semantic-level information to improve the recognition of absent targets.
Extensive experiments on gRefCOCO (GREC/GRES), Ref-ZOM, R-RefCOCO, and RefCOCO
(REC/RES) benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of PropVG. The codes and

of temporal flow fields from scramjet combustion simulations. Our approach
leverages hundreds of simulated combustion cases with varying initial
conditions, each producing time-sequenced flow field images. We use pretrained
Vision Transformers to extract high-dimensional embeddings from these frames,
apply dimensionality reduction and density-based clustering to uncover latent
combustion modes, and construct temporal trajectories in the embedding space to
track the evolution of each simulation over time. To bridge the gap between
latent representations and expert reasoning, domain specialists annotate
representative cluster centroids with descriptive labels. These annotations are
used as contextual prompts for a vision-language model, which generates
natural-language summaries for individual frames and full simulation cases. The
system also supports parameter-based filtering, similarity-based case
retrieval, and coordinated multi-view exploration to facilitate in-depth
analysis. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TemporalFlowViz through two
expert-informed case studies and expert feedback, showing TemporalFlowViz
enhances hypothesis generation, supports interpretable pattern discovery, and
enhances knowledge discovery in large-scale scramjet combustion analysis.

TL;DR: OmniFHT是一个无姿态约束的3D折射率重建框架，通过傅里叶衍射定理和隐式神经表示，实现了对任意形状细胞在流动中的高精度断层成像，突破了传统方法对细胞形状和旋转模式的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前流式细胞术中的3D定量相位成像方法假设细胞进行均匀单轴旋转且姿态已知，这限制了方法只能应用于近球形细胞，无法准确成像具有复杂旋转的不规则形状细胞，导致只能分析细胞群体的子集。

Method: 采用傅里叶衍射定理和隐式神经表示(INRs)，通过联合优化每个细胞的未知旋转轨迹和体积结构，在弱散射假设下支持任意细胞几何形状和多轴旋转。连续表示允许从稀疏采样投影和有限角度覆盖进行准确重建。

Result: OmniFHT能够从仅10个视图或120度角度范围产生高保真结果，首次实现了对整个流动细胞群体的原位高通量断层成像。

Conclusion: 该方法为流式细胞术平台提供了可扩展且无偏见的无标记形态计量分析解决方案，突破了传统成像方法的局限性。

Abstract: High-throughput 3D quantitative phase imaging (QPI) in flow cytometry enables
label-free, volumetric characterization of individual cells by reconstructing
their refractive index (RI) distributions from multiple viewing angles during
flow through microfluidic channels. However, current imaging methods assume
that cells undergo uniform, single-axis rotation, which require their poses to
be known at each frame. This assumption restricts applicability to
near-spherical cells and prevents accurate imaging of irregularly shaped cells
with complex rotations. As a result, only a subset of the cellular population
can be analyzed, limiting the ability of flow-based assays to perform robust
statistical analysis. We introduce OmniFHT, a pose-free 3D RI reconstruction
framework that leverages the Fourier diffraction theorem and implicit neural
representations (INRs) for high-throughput flow cytometry tomographic imaging.
By jointly optimizing each cell's unknown rotational trajectory and volumetric
structure under weak scattering assumptions, OmniFHT supports arbitrary cell
geometries and multi-axis rotations. Its continuous representation also allows
accurate reconstruction from sparsely sampled projections and restricted
angular coverage, producing high-fidelity results with as few as 10 views or
only 120 degrees of angular range. OmniFHT enables, for the first time, in
situ, high-throughput tomographic imaging of entire flowing cell populations,
providing a scalable and unbiased solution for label-free morphometric analysis
in flow cytometry platforms.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoRe-GS是一种用于移动自主空中机器人的语义3D高斯重建方法，通过粗粒度语义分割和颜色过滤快速隔离兴趣点，将训练时间减少约25%，同时提高新视角合成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 移动机器人应用如远程指导和灾难响应需要快速准确的3D重建，传统方法重建整个场景效率低下，而兴趣点通常早期就能被检测到，因此需要专注于特定对象的高效重建方法。

Method: 首先使用语义高斯溅射生成粗粒度可分割场景，然后通过新颖的基于颜色的有效过滤方法对语义对象进行精炼，实现有效的对象隔离。

Result: 在两个数据集（SCRREAM真实户外和NeRDS 360合成室内）上评估，显示运行时间减少，新视角合成质量提高，训练时间比完整语义高斯训练周期减少约四分之一。

Conclusion: CoRe-GS方法在保持高质量重建的同时显著减少了训练时间，为移动机器人应用提供了高效的语义3D重建解决方案。

Abstract: Mobile reconstruction for autonomous aerial robotics holds strong potential
for critical applications such as tele-guidance and disaster response. These
tasks demand both accurate 3D reconstruction and fast scene processing. Instead
of reconstructing the entire scene in detail, it is often more efficient to
focus on specific objects, i.e., points of interest (PoIs). Mobile robots
equipped with advanced sensing can usually detect these early during data
acquisition or preliminary analysis, reducing the need for full-scene
optimization. Gaussian Splatting (GS) has recently shown promise in delivering
high-quality novel view synthesis and 3D representation by an incremental
learning process. Extending GS with scene editing, semantics adds useful
per-splat features to isolate objects effectively.
  Semantic 3D Gaussian editing can already be achieved before the full training
cycle is completed, reducing the overall training time. Moreover, the
semantically relevant area, the PoI, is usually already known during capturing.
To balance high-quality reconstruction with reduced training time, we propose
CoRe-GS. We first generate a coarse segmentation-ready scene with semantic GS
and then refine it for the semantic object using our novel color-based
effective filtering for effective object isolation. This is speeding up the
training process to be about a quarter less than a full training cycle for
semantic GS. We evaluate our approach on two datasets, SCRREAM (real-world,
outdoor) and NeRDS 360 (synthetic, indoor), showing reduced runtime and higher
novel-view-synthesis quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前冷冻消融针放置规划依赖人工经验，耗时且质量不一，需要自动化方法来提高治疗质量和可扩展性。

Method: 将冷冻消融规划建模为马尔可夫决策过程，在模拟环境中通过强化学习代理顺序选择冷冻消融针位置和冰球直径，基于肿瘤覆盖率的奖励函数指导学习。

Result: 在583例回顾性病例中，Cryo-RL相比最佳几何优化基线方法Dice系数提升超过8个百分点，达到人类专家水平，规划时间显著减少。

Conclusion: 强化学习能够提供临床可行、可重复且高效的冷冻消融规划方案，具有重要的临床应用潜力。

Abstract: Cryoablation is a minimally invasive localised treatment for prostate cancer
that destroys malignant tissue during de-freezing, while sparing surrounding
healthy structures. Its success depends on accurate preoperative planning of
cryoprobe placements to fully cover the tumour and avoid critical anatomy. This
planning is currently manual, expertise-dependent, and time-consuming, leading
to variability in treatment quality and limited scalability. In this work, we
introduce Cryo-RL, a reinforcement learning framework that models cryoablation
planning as a Markov decision process and learns an optimal policy for
cryoprobe placement. Within a simulated environment that models clinical
constraints and stochastic intraoperative variability, an agent sequentially
selects cryoprobe positions and ice sphere diameters. Guided by a reward
function based on tumour coverage, this agent learns a cryoablation strategy
that leads to optimal cryoprobe placements without the need for any
manually-designed plans. Evaluated on 583 retrospective prostate cancer cases,
Cryo-RL achieved over 8 percentage-point Dice improvements compared with the
best automated baselines, based on geometric optimisation, and matched human
expert performance while requiring substantially less planning time. These
results highlight the potential of reinforcement learning to deliver clinically
viable, reproducible, and efficient cryoablation plans.

Motivation: 为开发自适应计算机化暴露疗法系统，需要能够根据视觉刺激动态调整治疗参数，因此研究计算机视觉模型能否准确预测图像引发的恐惧水平

Method: 采用三种不同的预训练计算机视觉模型进行迁移学习，使用包含313张蜘蛛图像的标准数据集预测人类恐惧评分（0-100分），通过交叉验证评估性能，并进行学习曲线分析和可解释性评估

Result: 模型平均绝对误差在10.1到11.0之间，学习曲线分析显示减少数据集大小会显著损害性能，可解释性评估证实模型基于蜘蛛相关特征进行预测，错误分析识别出特定视觉条件（如远距离视图和人造蜘蛛）与较高误差相关

Conclusion: 研究证明了可解释计算机视觉模型在预测恐惧评分方面的潜力，强调了模型可解释性和足够数据集大小对于开发有效情感感知治疗技术的重要性

Abstract: Advances in computer vision have opened new avenues for clinical
applications, particularly in computerized exposure therapy where visual
stimuli can be dynamically adjusted based on patient responses. As a critical
step toward such adaptive systems, we investigated whether pretrained computer
vision models can accurately predict fear levels from spider-related images. We
adapted three diverse models using transfer learning to predict human fear
ratings (on a 0-100 scale) from a standardized dataset of 313 images. The
models were evaluated using cross-validation, achieving an average mean
absolute error (MAE) between 10.1 and 11.0. Our learning curve analysis
revealed that reducing the dataset size significantly harmed performance,
though further increases yielded no substantial gains. Explainability
assessments showed the models' predictions were based on spider-related
features. A category-wise error analysis further identified visual conditions
associated with higher errors (e.g., distant views and artificial/painted
spiders). These findings demonstrate the potential of explainable computer
vision models in predicting fear ratings, highlighting the importance of both
model explainability and a sufficient dataset size for developing effective
emotion-aware therapeutic technologies.

Motivation: 工业磨损检测对预测性维护至关重要，但真实数据收集成本高、时间长，缺乏各种磨损场景的数据集

Method: 结合视觉语言模型和3D模拟渲染引擎，生成不同锈近条件下的合成数据

Result: 使用合成数据训练的碳识别模型在真实图像上达到mAP50评分0.87，性能超过其他方法

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了工业磨损检测数据缺乏问题，可自定义并扩展到其他工业磨损检测场景

Abstract: We propose an approach to generate synthetic data to train computer vision
(CV) models for industrial wear and tear detection. Wear and tear detection is
an important CV problem for predictive maintenance tasks in any industry.
However, data curation for training such models is expensive and time-consuming
due to the unavailability of datasets for different wear and tear scenarios.
Our approach employs a vision language model along with a 3D simulation and
rendering engine to generate synthetic data for varying rust conditions. We
evaluate our approach by training a CV model for rust detection using the
generated dataset and tested the trained model on real images of rusted
industrial objects. The model trained with the synthetic data generated by our
approach, outperforms the other approaches with a mAP50 score of 0.87. The
approach is customizable and can be easily extended to other industrial wear
and tear detection scenarios

TL;DR: 一种简单的注意力基础多实例学习框架用于皮脊细胞图像分析，基线MLP模型表现更稳定，注意力MIL需要优化才能发挥潜力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 皮脊细胞中脂豆计数是关键指标，手动计数劳动强度大且主观，需要自动化解决方案

Method: 使用Nile Red染色皮脊细胞图像，分为14个类别，通过数据增帽扩展到约50,000个细胞。比较两种模型：基线MLP模型和注意力基础MIL模型（使用ResNet-50特征）

Result: 五折交叉验证显示，基线MLP模型表现更稳定（平均MAE=5.6），注意力MIL模型不太稳定（平均MAE=10.7）但在某些折叠中表现更好

Conclusion: 简单的集合级聚合方法可以作为坐标计数的稳健基准，注意力MIL需要任务对齐的池化和正则化才能充分发挥其在皮脊细胞图像分析中的潜力

Abstract: Sebocytes are lipid-secreting cells whose differentiation is marked by the
accumulation of intracellular lipid droplets, making their quantification a key
readout in sebocyte biology. Manual counting is labor-intensive and subjective,
motivating automated solutions. Here, we introduce a simple attention-based
multiple instance learning (MIL) framework for sebocyte image analysis. Nile
Red-stained sebocyte images were annotated into 14 classes according to droplet
counts, expanded via data augmentation to about 50,000 cells. Two models were
benchmarked: a baseline multi-layer perceptron (MLP) trained on aggregated
patch-level counts, and an attention-based MIL model leveraging ResNet-50
features with instance weighting. Experiments using five-fold cross-validation
showed that the baseline MLP achieved more stable performance (mean MAE = 5.6)
compared with the attention-based MIL, which was less consistent (mean MAE =
10.7) but occasionally superior in specific folds. These findings indicate that
simple bag-level aggregation provides a robust baseline for slide-level droplet
counting, while attention-based MIL requires task-aligned pooling and
regularization to fully realize its potential in sebocyte image analysis.

Motivation: 单图像新视角合成任务由于未观察区域存在多种解释而高度不适定，现有方法往往基于模糊先验和输入视图附近的插值生成不可见区域，导致严重失真。

Method: 构建检索和增强系统，利用多模态大语言模型选择符合要求的参考图像；引入具有多级隔离层的即插即用适配器模块动态生成目标视图的参考特征；设计解耦三重注意力机制有效对齐和整合多分支特征以保留原始输入图像细节。

Result: 大量实验表明，UniView显著提升了新视角合成性能，在具有挑战性的数据集上优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: 通过利用相似物体的参考图像提供强先验信息，UniView有效解决了单图像新视角合成中的失真问题，取得了优异的性能表现。

Abstract: The task of synthesizing novel views from a single image is highly ill-posed
due to multiple explanations for unobserved areas. Most current methods tend to
generate unseen regions from ambiguity priors and interpolation near input
views, which often lead to severe distortions. To address this limitation, we
propose a novel model dubbed as UniView, which can leverage reference images
from a similar object to provide strong prior information during view
synthesis. More specifically, we construct a retrieval and augmentation system
and employ a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to assist in selecting
reference images that meet our requirements. Additionally, a plug-and-play
adapter module with multi-level isolation layers is introduced to dynamically
generate reference features for the target views. Moreover, in order to
preserve the details of an original input image, we design a decoupled triple
attention mechanism, which can effectively align and integrate multi-branch
features into the synthesis process. Extensive experiments have demonstrated
that our UniView significantly improves novel view synthesis performance and
outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the challenging datasets.

TL;DR: MFM-Mapper通过融合双视觉编码器特征和使用GPT-2作为映射器，显著提升了视频到音频生成的训练效率和性能，仅需之前方法16%的训练量就能达到竞争性结果。


<details>

Motivation: 现有视频到音频生成方法训练成本高，需要利用基础模型的跨模态知识迁移能力。之前的工作通过轻量级映射器连接预训练视觉编码器和文本到音频模型，但仍有改进空间。

Method: 提出MFM-Mapper方法：1）使用双视觉编码器融合更丰富的语义和时序特征；2）用GPT-2替代线性映射器，将跨模态特征映射视为自回归翻译任务；3）保持训练高效性。

Result: 仅需之前映射器方法16%的训练规模，在语义和时序一致性方面表现更好，与更大规模训练的模型性能相当。

Conclusion: MFM-Mapper通过多基础模型融合和GPT-2映射器的创新设计，实现了高效且高性能的视频到音频生成，为跨模态生成任务提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent Video-to-Audio (V2A) generation relies on extracting semantic and
temporal features from video to condition generative models. Training these
models from scratch is resource intensive. Consequently, leveraging foundation
models (FMs) has gained traction due to their cross-modal knowledge transfer
and generalization capabilities. One prior work has explored fine-tuning a
lightweight mapper network to connect a pre-trained visual encoder with a
text-to-audio generation model for V2A. Inspired by this, we introduce the
Multiple Foundation Model Mapper (MFM-Mapper). Compared to the previous mapper
approach, MFM-Mapper benefits from richer semantic and temporal information by
fusing features from dual visual encoders. Furthermore, by replacing a linear
mapper with GPT-2, MFM-Mapper improves feature alignment, drawing parallels
between cross-modal features mapping and autoregressive translation tasks. Our
MFM-Mapper exhibits remarkable training efficiency. It achieves better
performance in semantic and temporal consistency with fewer training consuming,
requiring only 16\% of the training scale compared to previous mapper-based
work, yet achieves competitive performance with models trained on a much larger
scale.

Method: 设计引导频率模态特定提取(GFMSE)模块进行频域退化感知和抑制，以及引导空间模态聚合融合(GSMAF)模块进行跨模态退化过滤和自适应多源特征聚合

Result: 大量定性和定量实验表明，GD^2Fusion在双源退化场景下相比现有算法和策略实现了更优的融合性能

Conclusion: 该方法通过协同整合视觉语言模型和双域联合优化，有效解决了双源退化场景下的图像融合问题，代码将在论文接受后公开

Abstract: Most existing infrared-visible image fusion (IVIF) methods assume
high-quality inputs, and therefore struggle to handle dual-source degraded
scenarios, typically requiring manual selection and sequential application of
multiple pre-enhancement steps. This decoupled pre-enhancement-to-fusion
pipeline inevitably leads to error accumulation and performance degradation. To
overcome these limitations, we propose Guided Dual-Domain Fusion (GD^2Fusion),
a novel framework that synergistically integrates vision-language models (VLMs)
for degradation perception with dual-domain (frequency/spatial) joint
optimization. Concretely, the designed Guided Frequency Modality-Specific
Extraction (GFMSE) module performs frequency-domain degradation perception and
suppression and discriminatively extracts fusion-relevant sub-band features.
Meanwhile, the Guided Spatial Modality-Aggregated Fusion (GSMAF) module carries
out cross-modal degradation filtering and adaptive multi-source feature
aggregation in the spatial domain to enhance modality complementarity and
structural consistency. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments
demonstrate that GD^2Fusion achieves superior fusion performance compared with
existing algorithms and strategies in dual-source degraded scenarios. The code
will be publicly released after acceptance of this paper.

Abstract: Breast cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality among women
worldwide. Ultrasound imaging, widely used due to its safety and
cost-effectiveness, plays a key role in early detection, especially in patients

Conclusion: SLVM模型在低光照交通场景感知中表现出色，计算开销低，Dark-traffic数据集填补了该领域大规模基准的空白

Abstract: Fast and accurate object perception in low-light traffic scenes has attracted
increasing attention. However, due to severe illumination degradation and the
lack of reliable visual cues, existing perception models and methods struggle
to quickly adapt to and accurately predict in low-light environments. Moreover,
there is the absence of available large-scale benchmark specifically focused on
low-light traffic scenes. To bridge this gap, we introduce a physically
grounded illumination degradation method tailored to real-world low-light
settings and construct Dark-traffic, the largest densely annotated dataset to
date for low-light traffic scenes, supporting object detection, instance
segmentation, and optical flow estimation. We further propose the Separable
Learning Vision Model (SLVM), a biologically inspired framework designed to
enhance perception under adverse lighting. SLVM integrates four key components:
a light-adaptive pupillary mechanism for illumination-sensitive feature
extraction, a feature-level separable learning strategy for efficient
representation, task-specific decoupled branches for multi-task separable
learning, and a spatial misalignment-aware fusion module for precise
multi-feature alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SLVM achieves
state-of-the-art performance with reduced computational overhead. Notably, it
outperforms RT-DETR by 11.2 percentage points in detection, YOLOv12 by 6.1
percentage points in instance segmentation, and reduces endpoint error (EPE) of
baseline by 12.37% on Dark-traffic. On the LIS benchmark, the end-to-end
trained SLVM surpasses Swin Transformer+EnlightenGAN and
ConvNeXt-T+EnlightenGAN by an average of 11 percentage points across key
metrics, and exceeds Mask RCNN (with light enhancement) by 3.1 percentage
points. The Dark-traffic dataset and complete code is released at

ShuffleNet. Experiments were conducted on three benchmark datasets: AHCD,
HIJJA, and IFHCDB. MobileNet emerged as the top-performing model, consistently
achieving superior accuracy, robustness, and efficiency, with ShuffleNet
excelling in generalization, particularly under full fine-tuning. The IFHCDB
dataset yielded the highest results, with 99% accuracy using MnasNet under full
fine-tuning, highlighting its suitability for robust character recognition. The
AHCD dataset achieved competitive accuracy (97%) with ShuffleNet, while HIJJA
posed significant challenges due to its variability, achieving a peak accuracy
of 92% with ShuffleNet. Notably, full fine-tuning demonstrated the best overall
performance, balancing accuracy and convergence speed, while partial
fine-tuning underperformed across metrics. These findings underscore the
potential of combining TL and MbNets for resource-efficient AHCR, paving the
way for further optimizations and broader applications. Future work will

partial-to-complete shape correspondence prediction, we introduce a diffusion
model-based approach for body-to-SMPL correspondence using multi-view
consistent appearance features and a pre-trained 2D foundation model. Our
method can handle complex geometries, non-manifold meshes, and generalizes
effectively to a wide range of humanoid characters -- including humans, robots,
cartoon subjects, creatures, and aliens, while maintaining computational
efficiency for practical adoption. In addition to offering a fully automatic
fitting solution, LUIVITON supports fast customization of clothing size,
allowing users to adjust clothing sizes and material properties after they have
been draped. We show that our system can produce high-quality 3D clothing
fittings without any human labor, even when 2D clothing sewing patterns are not
available.

TL;DR: ADClick是一个用于工业异常检测的交互式图像分割算法，通过少量用户点击和文本描述生成像素级异常标注，显著提升异常检测模型性能。ADClick-Seg进一步通过跨模态框架结合视觉特征和文本提示，在多项指标上达到最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业产品检测通常只使用正常样本训练异常检测模型，虽然有缺陷样本但需要像素级标注，限制了可扩展性。需要一种能够利用少量用户交互和文本描述来生成精确标注的方法。

Method: 提出ADClick交互式图像分割算法，通过用户点击和文本描述生成像素级异常标注。进一步开发ADClick-Seg跨模态框架，使用基于原型的方法对齐视觉特征和文本提示，结合像素级先验和语言引导线索。

Result: ADClick在MVTec AD上达到AP=96.1%的优异性能。ADClick-Seg在多类异常检测任务上取得AP=80.0%、PRO=97.5%、Pixel-AUROC=99.1%的state-of-the-art结果。

Conclusion: ADClick和ADClick-Seg通过结合用户交互和跨模态信息，有效解决了工业异常检测中标注成本高的问题，显著提升了模型性能，为实际工业应用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Industrial product inspection is often performed using Anomaly Detection (AD)
frameworks trained solely on non-defective samples. Although defective samples
can be collected during production, leveraging them usually requires
pixel-level annotations, limiting scalability. To address this, we propose
ADClick, an Interactive Image Segmentation (IIS) algorithm for industrial
anomaly detection. ADClick generates pixel-wise anomaly annotations from only a
few user clicks and a brief textual description, enabling precise and efficient
labeling that significantly improves AD model performance (e.g., AP = 96.1\% on
MVTec AD). We further introduce ADClick-Seg, a cross-modal framework that
aligns visual features and textual prompts via a prototype-based approach for
anomaly detection and localization. By combining pixel-level priors with
language-guided cues, ADClick-Seg achieves state-of-the-art results on the
challenging ``Multi-class'' AD task (AP = 80.0\%, PRO = 97.5\%, Pixel-AUROC =
99.1\% on MVTec AD).

Abstract: Background: To systematically review and perform a meta-analysis of
artificial intelligence (AI)-driven methods for detecting and correcting
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) motion artifacts, assessing current
developments, effectiveness, challenges, and future research directions.
Methods: A comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted,
focusing on deep learning (DL) approaches, particularly generative models, for
the detection and correction of MRI motion artifacts. Quantitative data were
extracted regarding utilized datasets, DL architectures, and performance
metrics. Results: DL, particularly generative models, show promise for reducing
motion artifacts and improving image quality; however, limited
generalizability, reliance on paired training data, and risk of visual
distortions remain key challenges that motivate standardized datasets and
reporting. Conclusions: AI-driven methods, particularly DL generative models,
show significant potential for improving MRI image quality by effectively
addressing motion artifacts. However, critical challenges must be addressed,
including the need for comprehensive public datasets, standardized reporting
protocols for artifact levels, and more advanced, adaptable DL techniques to
reduce reliance on extensive paired datasets. Addressing these aspects could
substantially enhance MRI diagnostic accuracy, reduce healthcare costs, and
improve patient care outcomes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeoSplat是一个几何约束优化框架，利用一阶和二阶几何量改进高斯溅射的整个训练流程，包括初始化、梯度更新和致密化，通过曲率初始化高斯尺度和噪声鲁棒的几何估计方法，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要使用低阶几何先验（如法向量），且这些先验通过噪声敏感的方法（如局部主成分分析）不可靠估计，需要更鲁棒的几何约束来改进高斯溅射优化。

Method: 提出GeoSplat框架：1）基于主曲率初始化3D高斯基元尺度；2）引入高效噪声鲁棒的几何估计方法提供动态几何先验；3）在整个训练流程（初始化、梯度更新、致密化）中利用一阶和二阶几何量。

Result: 在多个数据集上的新颖视图合成实验中，GeoSplat显著提升了高斯溅射的性能，并优于之前的基线方法。

Conclusion: GeoSplat通过引入更全面的几何约束和鲁棒的估计方法，有效解决了现有几何先验方法的局限性，为高斯溅射优化提供了更可靠的几何指导。

Abstract: A few recent works explored incorporating geometric priors to regularize the
optimization of Gaussian splatting, further improving its performance. However,
those early studies mainly focused on the use of low-order geometric priors
(e.g., normal vector), and they are also unreliably estimated by
noise-sensitive methods, like local principal component analysis. To address
their limitations, we first present GeoSplat, a general geometry-constrained
optimization framework that exploits both first-order and second-order
geometric quantities to improve the entire training pipeline of Gaussian
splatting, including Gaussian initialization, gradient update, and
densification. As an example, we initialize the scales of 3D Gaussian
primitives in terms of principal curvatures, leading to a better coverage of
the object surface than random initialization. Secondly, based on certain
geometric structures (e.g., local manifold), we introduce efficient and
noise-robust estimation methods that provide dynamic geometric priors for our
framework. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple datasets for novel view
synthesis, showing that our framework: GeoSplat, significantly improves the
performance of Gaussian splatting and outperforms previous baselines.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合CNN和Transformer的混合架构SIT，用于面部美观度预测，通过多尺度特征提取和自注意力机制建模特征间关系，在SCUT-FBP5500数据集上达到0.9187的皮尔逊相关系数，创下新纪录。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CNN在处理面部美观度预测时存在固定尺度处理的局限性，无法有效捕捉不同粒度特征间的相互依赖关系，需要一种能够建模多尺度特征交互的新方法。

Method: 提出Scale-Interaction Transformer (SIT)混合架构：首先使用多尺度并行卷积模块提取不同感受野的面部特征，然后将多尺度表示作为序列输入Transformer编码器，通过自注意力机制显式建模特征间的交互和上下文关系。

Result: 在SCUT-FBP5500基准数据集上实现了0.9187的皮尔逊相关系数，超越了之前的所有方法，建立了新的state-of-the-art性能。

Conclusion: 显式建模多尺度视觉线索之间的相互作用对于高性能面部美观度预测至关重要，SIT架构的成功证明了CNN-Transformer混合模型在需要整体、上下文感知理解的复杂图像回归任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Automated Facial Beauty Prediction (FBP) is a challenging computer vision
task due to the complex interplay of local and global facial features that
influence human perception. While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) excel at
feature extraction, they often process information at a fixed scale,
potentially overlooking the critical inter-dependencies between features at
different levels of granularity. To address this limitation, we introduce the
Scale-Interaction Transformer (SIT), a novel hybrid deep learning architecture
that synergizes the feature extraction power of CNNs with the relational
modeling capabilities of Transformers. The SIT first employs a multi-scale
module with parallel convolutions to capture facial characteristics at varying
receptive fields. These multi-scale representations are then framed as a
sequence and processed by a Transformer encoder, which explicitly models their
interactions and contextual relationships via a self-attention mechanism. We
conduct extensive experiments on the widely-used SCUT-FBP5500 benchmark
dataset, where the proposed SIT model establishes a new state-of-the-art. It
achieves a Pearson Correlation of 0.9187, outperforming previous methods. Our
findings demonstrate that explicitly modeling the interplay between multi-scale
visual cues is crucial for high-performance FBP. The success of the SIT
architecture highlights the potential of hybrid CNN-Transformer models for
complex image regression tasks that demand a holistic, context-aware
understanding.

TL;DR: 通过在ResNet网络深层插入稀疏混合专家(MoE)层，在不增加推理成本的情况下提升了模型对对抗攻击的鲁棒性，并发现专家路由集中现象反而促进了精细化的强化学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对抗性攻击对卷积神经网络构成了严重威胁，而传统的防御方法通常需要消耗大量资源。本文探索如何通过稀疏混合专家技术在不增加推理成本的前提下提升模型的鲁棒性。

Method: 在ResNet网络深层阶段替换选择的殊差块或卷积层为MoE层，使用CIFAR-100数据集进行对抗性训练，并分析PGD和AutoPGD攻击下的鲁棒性表现。

Result: 在深层插入单个MoE层结合对抗性训练后，模型在各种攻击下都显示出一致的鲁棒性提升。路由集中现象导致部分专家专门化学习，个别专家甚至超过了门控MoE模型的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 稀疏MoE结构能够有效提升CNN的对抗性鲁棒性，路由集中现象反而促进了专家的强化学习，证明了通过精细化子路径来提升模型鲁棒性的可行性。

Abstract: Robustifying convolutional neural networks (CNNs) against adversarial attacks
remains challenging and often requires resource-intensive countermeasures. We
explore the use of sparse mixture-of-experts (MoE) layers to improve robustness
by replacing selected residual blocks or convolutional layers, thereby
increasing model capacity without additional inference cost. On ResNet
architectures trained on CIFAR-100, we find that inserting a single MoE layer
in the deeper stages leads to consistent improvements in robustness under PGD
and AutoPGD attacks when combined with adversarial training. Furthermore, we
discover that when switch loss is used for balancing, it causes routing to
collapse onto a small set of overused experts, thereby concentrating
adversarial training on these paths and inadvertently making them more robust.
As a result, some individual experts outperform the gated MoE model in
robustness, suggesting that robust subpaths emerge through specialization. Our
code is available at https://github.com/KASTEL-MobilityLab/robust-sparse-moes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现实应用中源数据无法共享（隐私或计算成本限制）且目标标签稀缺的问题，特别是在医学和生物学中的连续值预测任务

Method: 基于Contradistinguisher框架，开发了CRAFT方法，用于源数据不可用的半监督回归任务迁移，不依赖中间表示对齐

Result: 在两个神经科学数据集上，CRAFT相比微调模型RMSE提升达9%，比现有源无关域适应方法性能提升超过3%

Conclusion: CRAFT是生物学和医学中源数据不可用、半监督深度迁移回归任务的高效解决方案

Abstract: Deep learning models deployed in real-world applications (e.g., medicine)
face challenges because source models do not generalize well to domain-shifted
target data. Many successful domain adaptation (DA) approaches require full
access to source data. Yet, such requirements are unrealistic in scenarios
where source data cannot be shared either because of privacy concerns or
because it is too large and incurs prohibitive storage or computational costs.
Moreover, resource constraints may limit the availability of labeled targets.
We illustrate this challenge in a neuroscience setting where source data are
unavailable, labeled target data are meager, and predictions involve
continuous-valued outputs. We build upon Contradistinguisher (CUDA), an
efficient framework that learns a shared model across the labeled source and
unlabeled target samples, without intermediate representation alignment. Yet,
CUDA was designed for unsupervised DA, with full access to source data, and for
classification tasks. We develop CRAFT -- a Contradistinguisher-based
Regularization Approach for Flexible Training -- for source-free (SF),
semi-supervised transfer of pretrained models in regression tasks. We showcase
the efficacy of CRAFT in two neuroscience settings: gaze prediction with
electroencephalography (EEG) data and ``brain age'' prediction with structural
MRI data. For both datasets, CRAFT yielded up to 9% improvement in
root-mean-squared error (RMSE) over fine-tuned models when labeled training
examples were scarce. Moreover, CRAFT leveraged unlabeled target data and
outperformed four competing state-of-the-art source-free domain adaptation
models by more than 3%. Lastly, we demonstrate the efficacy of CRAFT on two
other real-world regression benchmarks. We propose CRAFT as an efficient
approach for source-free, semi-supervised deep transfer for regression that is
ubiquitous in biology and medicine.

Method: 使用Transformer框架统一三平面表示和深度基础的逆投影损失，直接从单张图像和网格预测3D素材场

Result: 方法在单张图像素材重建任务上超过现有最优方法，在保真度和感知质量方面都更好，每个形状只需0.2秒

Conclusion: 该方法具有实用性，能支持可扩展、高质量和可控的3D内容创建

Abstract: High-quality textures are critical for realistic 3D content creation, yet
existing generative methods are slow, rely on UV maps, and often fail to remain
faithful to a reference image. To address these challenges, we propose a
transformer-based framework that predicts a 3D texture field directly from a
single image and a mesh, eliminating the need for UV mapping and differentiable
rendering, and enabling faster texture generation. Our method integrates a
triplane representation with depth-based backprojection losses, enabling
efficient training and faster inference. Once trained, it generates
high-fidelity textures in a single forward pass, requiring only 0.2s per shape.
Extensive qualitative, quantitative, and user preference evaluations
demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on
single-image texture reconstruction in terms of both fidelity to the input
image and perceptual quality, highlighting its practicality for scalable,
high-quality, and controllable 3D content creation.

TL;DR: SGS-3D是一个训练免费的3D实例分割精炼框架，通过"分割-生长"策略融合语义和几何信息，显著提升分割精度和鲁棒性。


<details>

Motivation: 现有的基于2D到3D提升的3D实例分割方法由于提升过程中的累积误差、模糊语义指导和深度约束不足，难以产生精确的实例级分割。

Method: 提出"分割-生长"框架：首先使用几何基元净化和分割模糊的提升掩码，然后在场景中将其生长为完整实例。包括基于3D几何基元共现的掩码过滤策略和利用空间连续性及高层特征的几何精炼。

Result: 在ScanNet200、ScanNet++和KITTI-360数据集上的实验表明，SGS-3D显著提高了分割精度和鲁棒性，能够处理预训练模型产生的不准确掩码，在室内外环境中保持强泛化能力。

Conclusion: SGS-3D通过联合融合语义和几何信息，实现了高保真度的3D实例分割，为3D视觉领域的高质量场景理解提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate 3D instance segmentation is crucial for high-quality scene
understanding in the 3D vision domain. However, 3D instance segmentation based
on 2D-to-3D lifting approaches struggle to produce precise instance-level
segmentation, due to accumulated errors introduced during the lifting process
from ambiguous semantic guidance and insufficient depth constraints. To tackle
these challenges, we propose splitting and growing reliable semantic mask for
high-fidelity 3D instance segmentation (SGS-3D), a novel "split-then-grow"
framework that first purifies and splits ambiguous lifted masks using geometric
primitives, and then grows them into complete instances within the scene.
Unlike existing approaches that directly rely on raw lifted masks and sacrifice
segmentation accuracy, SGS-3D serves as a training-free refinement method that
jointly fuses semantic and geometric information, enabling effective
cooperation between the two levels of representation. Specifically, for
semantic guidance, we introduce a mask filtering strategy that leverages the
co-occurrence of 3D geometry primitives to identify and remove ambiguous masks,
thereby ensuring more reliable semantic consistency with the 3D object
instances. For the geometric refinement, we construct fine-grained object
instances by exploiting both spatial continuity and high-level features,
particularly in the case of semantic ambiguity between distinct objects.
Experimental results on ScanNet200, ScanNet++, and KITTI-360 demonstrate that
SGS-3D substantially improves segmentation accuracy and robustness against
inaccurate masks from pre-trained models, yielding high-fidelity object
instances while maintaining strong generalization across diverse indoor and
outdoor environments. Code is available in the supplementary materials.

Conclusion: 所提出的自监督框架有效解决了手语识别中对比学习的关键问题，能够学习到更有意义的特征表示，在手语识别任务中取得了优异的性能表现。

Abstract: Sign language recognition (SLR) is a machine learning task aiming to identify
signs in videos. Due to the scarcity of annotated data, unsupervised methods
like contrastive learning have become promising in this field. They learn
meaningful representations by pulling positive pairs (two augmented versions of
the same instance) closer and pushing negative pairs (different from the
positive pairs) apart. In SLR, in a sign video, only certain parts provide
information that is truly useful for its recognition. Applying contrastive
methods to SLR raises two issues: (i) contrastive learning methods treat all
parts of a video in the same way, without taking into account the relevance of
certain parts over others; (ii) shared movements between different signs make
negative pairs highly similar, complicating sign discrimination. These issues
lead to learning non-discriminative features for sign recognition and poor
results in downstream tasks. In response, this paper proposes a self-supervised
learning framework designed to learn meaningful representations for SLR. This
framework consists of two key components designed to work together: (i) a new
self-supervised approach with free-negative pairs; (ii) a new data augmentation
technique. This approach shows a considerable gain in accuracy compared to
several contrastive and self-supervised methods, across linear evaluation,
semi-supervised learning, and transferability between sign languages.

Abstract: The classification of 3D point clouds is crucial for applications such as
autonomous driving, robotics, and augmented reality. However, the commonly used
ModelNet40 dataset suffers from limitations such as inconsistent labeling, 2D

reduced computational overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that models
trained in ModelNet-R exhibit significant performance improvements. Notably,
Point-SkipNet achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on ModelNet-R with a

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在生成符号图形程序方面的能力，特别是SVG生成，以此作为理解模型如何通过编程来表达视觉世界的窗口。

Method: 引入SGP-GenBench基准测试评估模型性能；提出强化学习方法，使用格式有效性验证和跨模态奖励（SigLIP和DINO编码器）来提升SVG生成质量。

Result: 前沿专有模型显著优于开源模型，性能与通用编码能力相关；提出的RL方法使Qwen-2.5-7B模型达到与前沿系统相当的性能，改善了对象分解和场景连贯性。

Conclusion: 符号图形编程为跨模态 grounding 提供了精确且可解释的研究视角，RL方法能有效提升LLMs的SVG生成能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at program synthesis, yet their ability to
produce symbolic graphics programs (SGPs) that render into precise visual
content remains underexplored. We study symbolic graphics programming, where
the goal is to generate an SGP from a natural-language description. This task
also serves as a lens into how LLMs understand the visual world by prompting
them to generate images rendered from SGPs. Among various SGPs, our paper
sticks to scalable vector graphics (SVGs). We begin by examining the extent to
which LLMs can generate SGPs. To this end, we introduce SGP-GenBench, a
comprehensive benchmark covering object fidelity, scene fidelity, and
compositionality (attribute binding, spatial relations, numeracy). On
SGP-GenBench, we discover that frontier proprietary models substantially
outperform open-source models, and performance correlates well with general
coding capabilities. Motivated by this gap, we aim to improve LLMs' ability to
generate SGPs. We propose a reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rewards
approach, where a format-validity gate ensures renderable SVG, and a
cross-modal reward aligns text and the rendered image via strong vision
encoders (e.g., SigLIP for text-image and DINO for image-image). Applied to
Qwen-2.5-7B, our method substantially improves SVG generation quality and
semantics, achieving performance on par with frontier systems. We further
analyze training dynamics, showing that RL induces (i) finer decomposition of
objects into controllable primitives and (ii) contextual details that improve
scene coherence. Our results demonstrate that symbolic graphics programming
offers a precise and interpretable lens on cross-modal grounding.

rule-based tasks which apply a set of transformations to objects in grid-like
environments. It supports composition, at adjustable depth, over a set of 28
interoperable transformations, along with extensive control over grid

virtually unlimited sample generation per rule. We provide baseline experiments

maintain a global camera token pool, which enhances the reliability of camera
pose estimation without sacrificing efficiency. These designs enable WinT3R to
achieve state-of-the-art performance in terms of online reconstruction quality,
camera pose estimation, and reconstruction speed, as validated by extensive
experiments on diverse datasets. Code and model are publicly available at

### [54] [Evaluating NL2SQL via SQL2NL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04657)
*Mohammadtaher Safarzadeh,Afshin Oroojlooyjadid,Dan Roth*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于SQL2NL的模式对齐复述框架，用于系统评估NL2SQL模型对语言变异的鲁棒性，发现现有SOTA模型比标准基准测试显示的要脆弱得多。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试很少系统或受控地处理语言变异因素，无法真正理解NL2SQL模型的泛化能力。

Method: 使用SQL-to-NL生成语义等价但词汇多样的查询，同时保持与原始模式和意图的对齐，实现针对语言变异的隔离评估。

Result: LLaMa3.3-70B在复述查询上执行准确率下降10.23%，LLaMa3.1-8B下降近20%，小模型受影响更严重，鲁棒性退化程度因查询复杂度、数据集和领域而异。

Conclusion: 需要明确测量语言泛化能力的评估框架，以确保模型在真实场景中的可靠性能。

Abstract: Robust evaluation in the presence of linguistic variation is key to
understanding the generalization capabilities of Natural Language to SQL
(NL2SQL) models, yet existing benchmarks rarely address this factor in a
systematic or controlled manner. We propose a novel schema-aligned paraphrasing
framework that leverages SQL-to-NL (SQL2NL) to automatically generate
semantically equivalent, lexically diverse queries while maintaining alignment
with the original schema and intent. This enables the first targeted evaluation
of NL2SQL robustness to linguistic variation in isolation-distinct from prior
work that primarily investigates ambiguity or schema perturbations. Our
analysis reveals that state-of-the-art models are far more brittle than
standard benchmarks suggest. For example, LLaMa3.3-70B exhibits a 10.23% drop
in execution accuracy (from 77.11% to 66.9%) on paraphrased Spider queries,
while LLaMa3.1-8B suffers an even larger drop of nearly 20% (from 62.9% to
42.5%). Smaller models (e.g., GPT-4o mini) are disproportionately affected. We
also find that robustness degradation varies significantly with query
complexity, dataset, and domain -- highlighting the need for evaluation
frameworks that explicitly measure linguistic generalization to ensure reliable
performance in real-world settings.

Abstract: Insurance, as a critical component of the global financial system, demands
high standards of accuracy and reliability in AI applications. While existing
benchmarks evaluate AI capabilities across various domains, they often fail to
capture the unique characteristics and requirements of the insurance domain. To
address this gap, we present INSEva, a comprehensive Chinese benchmark
specifically designed for evaluating AI systems' knowledge and capabilities in
insurance. INSEva features a multi-dimensional evaluation taxonomy covering
business areas, task formats, difficulty levels, and cognitive-knowledge
dimension, comprising 38,704 high-quality evaluation examples sourced from
authoritative materials. Our benchmark implements tailored evaluation methods
for assessing both faithfulness and completeness in open-ended responses.
Through extensive evaluation of 8 state-of-the-art Large Language Models
(LLMs), we identify significant performance variations across different
dimensions. While general LLMs demonstrate basic insurance domain competency
with average scores above 80, substantial gaps remain in handling complex,
real-world insurance scenarios. The benchmark will be public soon.

mental health support chatbot designed to augment professional healthcare, with
a strong emphasis on safe and meaningful application. Our approach involved
rigorous evaluation, covering accuracy, empathy, trustworthiness, privacy, and

TL;DR: 该论文提出了ChartReasoner方法，通过模拟人类视觉推理来解决MLLMs在无标注图表理解中的幻觉问题，并在新基准CRBench上取得了优于GPT-4o和Gemini-2.5-Flash的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在图表理解中存在严重的幻觉问题，特别是在处理无标注图表时性能显著下降，需要探索MLLMs是否真正理解图表。

Method: 提出ChartReasoner方法，通过模拟人类行为，将图表理解建立在视觉推理基础上，而不是仅仅依赖识别能力。

Result: ChartReasoner-3B/7B在CRBench基准上取得了优越性能，超越了GPT-4o和Gemini-2.5-Flash，同时在公开基准测试中也展现出显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: ChartReasoner能够使MLLMs理性地理解图表，解决了现有模型主要依赖识别而非推理的问题，为图表理解提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
increasingly impressive performance in chart understanding, most of them
exhibit alarming hallucinations and significant performance degradation when
handling non-annotated charts. Therefore, a question arises: Do MLLMs really
understand the charts? Since a human is capable of understanding charts and
estimating the values by visual reasoning, we first carefully establish a
comprehensive Chart Reasoning Benchmark CRBench to rigorously evaluate the
visual reasoning abilities of MLLMs on non-annotated charts. We argue that
MLLMs are primarily relying on recognition rather than reasoning to interpret
the charts. To steer MLLMs to reasonable chart understanding, we propose
ChartReasoner that mimics human behavior by grounding their estimation in chart
understanding. Extensive results on the proposed CRBench show that
ChartReasnoner-3B/7B achieves superior performance in chart reasoning, even
compared to GPT-4o and Gemini-2.5-Flash. More importantly, ChartReasnoner also
demonstrates the visual reasoning abilities in general chart comprehension on
public benchmarks, leading to significant performance gains and enabling MLLMs
to rationally understand the charts. The code and dataset will be publicly
available upon publication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型在生物医学本体术语链接任务中失败的原因，特别是在Human Phenotype Ontology和Gene Ontology两个主要本体上的表现。

Method: 使用GPT-4o和LLaMa 3.1 405B两个高性能模型，评估九个与术语熟悉度、标识符使用、形态学和本体结构相关的候选特征，进行单变量和多变量分析。

Result: 分析显示，本体标识符的暴露程度是链接成功的最强预测因子，其他特征如术语熟悉度、形态学特征等预测能力较弱。

Conclusion: 模型对本体标识符的熟悉程度直接影响其链接性能，这为改进生物医学NLP中的本体术语链接提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Large language models often perform well on biomedical NLP tasks but may fail
to link ontology terms to their correct identifiers. We investigate why these
failures occur by analyzing predictions across two major ontologies, Human
Phenotype Ontology and Gene Ontology, and two high-performing models, GPT-4o
and LLaMa 3.1 405B. We evaluate nine candidate features related to term
familiarity, identifier usage, morphology, and ontology structure. Univariate
and multivariate analyses show that exposure to ontology identifiers is the
strongest predictor of linking success.

Method: 提出不确定性驱动的协同系统（U-ACS），让轻量模型先过滤输入，将高不确定性的困难样本转给MLLM处理，并使用加权平均和提示验证等策略处理模糊预测。

Result: 在标准数据集上达到最先进性能，计算资源需求仅为独立MLLM的一小部分，同时保持了高准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法高效解决了多模态情感分析中的性能效率矛盾，为实际部署提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: The advent of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has significantly
advanced the state-of-the-art in multimodal machine learning, yet their
substantial computational demands present a critical barrier to real-world
deployment. Conversely, smaller, specialized models offer high efficiency but
often at the cost of performance. To reconcile this performance-efficiency
trade-off, we propose a novel Uncertainty-Aware Collaborative System (U-ACS)
that synergistically orchestrates a powerful MLLM (e.g., HumanOmni) and a
lightweight baseline model for multimodal sentiment analysis. The core of our
system is an uncertainty-driven cascade mechanism, where the efficient small
model first acts as a rapid filter for all input samples. Only those samples
yielding high predictive uncertainty, thereby indicating greater difficulty,
are selectively escalated to the MLLM for more sophisticated analysis.
Furthermore, our system introduces advanced strategies to handle ambiguous or
conflicting predictions, including weighted averaging for predictions of
similar polarity and a prompt-based cross-verification to resolve conflicting
predictions when both models exhibit high uncertainty. This
sample-difficulty-aware approach allows for a dynamic allocation of
computational resources, drastically reducing inference costs while retaining
the high accuracy of MLLM. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets
demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance,
while requiring only a fraction of the computational resources compared to
using a standalone MLLM.

Result: 开发了更准确和稳健的AI审查检测方法，为评估同行审查中LLM的使用提供了实践基础。

Conclusion: 该研究为实际学术应用提供了更精确、公平和可靠的检测方法，有助于维护学术评估的整体质量。

Abstract: The growing integration of large language models (LLMs) into the peer review
process presents potential risks to the fairness and reliability of scholarly
evaluation. While LLMs offer valuable assistance for reviewers with language
refinement, there is growing concern over their use to generate substantive
review content. Existing general AI-generated text detectors are vulnerable to
paraphrasing attacks and struggle to distinguish between surface language
refinement and substantial content generation, suggesting that they primarily
rely on stylistic cues. When applied to peer review, this limitation can result
in unfairly suspecting reviews with permissible AI-assisted language
enhancement, while failing to catch deceptively humanized AI-generated reviews.
To address this, we propose a paradigm shift from style-based to content-based
detection. Specifically, we introduce CoCoNUTS, a content-oriented benchmark
built upon a fine-grained dataset of AI-generated peer reviews, covering six
distinct modes of human-AI collaboration. Furthermore, we develop CoCoDet, an
AI review detector via a multi-task learning framework, designed to achieve
more accurate and robust detection of AI involvement in review content. Our
work offers a practical foundation for evaluating the use of LLMs in peer
review, and contributes to the development of more precise, equitable, and
reliable detection methods for real-world scholarly applications. Our code and
data will be publicly available at https://github.com/Y1hanChen/COCONUTS.

Motivation: 传统机器学习和深度学习方法在MBTI人格预测中存在局限性，而直接使用大语言模型面临幻觉问题和MBTI类型自然分布不平衡的挑战。

Method: 提出PtoP框架，利用检索增强生成和上下文学习缓解LLM幻觉，通过微调预训练LLM和使用合成少数类过采样技术平衡类别不平衡。

Result: 在真实社交媒体数据集上的实验表明，PtoP相比10个ML和DL基线方法取得了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: PtoP框架有效解决了LLM在MBTI预测中的幻觉和类别不平衡问题，为社交媒体人格预测提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Personality prediction from social media posts is a critical task that
implies diverse applications in psychology and sociology. The Myers Briggs Type
Indicator (MBTI), a popular personality inventory, has been traditionally
predicted by machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques. Recently,
the success of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revealed their huge potential
in understanding and inferring personality traits from social media content.
However, directly exploiting LLMs for MBTI prediction faces two key challenges:
the hallucination problem inherent in LLMs and the naturally imbalanced
distribution of MBTI types in the population. In this paper, we propose
PostToPersonality (PtoP), a novel LLM based framework for MBTI prediction from
social media posts of individuals. Specifically, PtoP leverages Retrieval
Augmented Generation with in context learning to mitigate hallucination in
LLMs. Furthermore, we fine tune a pretrained LLM to improve model specification
in MBTI understanding with synthetic minority oversampling, which balances the
class imbalance by generating synthetic samples. Experiments conducted on a
real world social media dataset demonstrate that PtoP achieves state of the art
performance compared with 10 ML and DL baselines.

### [62] [Benchmarking GPT-5 for biomedical natural language processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04462)
*Yu Hou,Zaifu Zhan,Rui Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GPT-5在生物医学NLP基准测试中表现最佳，在医学问答任务上达到94.1%准确率，超越之前最优监督模型50多个百分点，但在信息抽取和摘要任务上仍落后于领域专用模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生物医学文献的快速增长，需要可扩展的自然语言处理解决方案。虽然GPT-4在问答任务上缩小了与专用系统的差距，但在其他领域的表现仍不均衡，因此需要评估新一代模型GPT-5和GPT-4o的性能。

Method: 使用标准化的BioNLP基准测试，在12个数据集上评估GPT-5和GPT-4o，涵盖6个任务家族：命名实体识别、关系抽取、多标签文档分类、问答、文本摘要和文本简化。采用零样本、单样本和五样本提示策略，使用固定提示模板、相同解码参数和批量推理。

Result: GPT-5在五样本提示下获得0.557的宏观平均分数，优于GPT-4的0.506和GPT-4o的0.508。在MedQA上达到94.1%准确率，超过之前监督最优模型50多个百分点。在PubMedQA上与监督系统持平（0.734）。在化学NER和ChemProt关系抽取任务上有显著提升，但摘要和疾病NER仍落后于领域基线。

Conclusion: GPT-5已成为通用模型，在推理导向的生物医学问答任务上达到部署就绪性能，但精度要求高的信息抽取和证据密集的摘要任务仍需要微调或混合方法。基准测试为BioNLP系统设计提供了实用指导。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of biomedical literature has heightened the need for
scalable natural language processing (NLP) solutions. While GPT-4 substantially
narrowed the gap with task-specific systems, especially in question answering,
its performance across other domains remained uneven. We updated a standardized
BioNLP benchmark to evaluate GPT-5 and GPT-4o under zero-, one-, and five-shot
prompting across 12 datasets spanning six task families: named entity
recognition, relation extraction, multi-label document classification, question
answering, text summarization, and text simplification. Using fixed prompt
templates, identical decoding parameters, and batch inference, we report
primary metrics per dataset and include prior results for GPT-4, GPT-3.5, and
LLaMA-2-13B for comparison. GPT-5 achieved the strongest overall benchmark
performance, with macro-average scores rising to 0.557 under five-shot
prompting versus 0.506 for GPT-4 and 0.508 for GPT-4o. On MedQA, GPT-5 reached
94.1% accuracy, exceeding the previous supervised state of the art by over
fifty points, and attained parity with supervised systems on PubMedQA (0.734).
In extraction tasks, GPT-5 delivered major gains in chemical NER (0.886 F1) and
ChemProt relation extraction (0.616 F1), outperforming GPT-4 and GPT-4o, though
summarization and disease NER still lagged behind domain-specific baselines.
These results establish GPT-5 as a general-purpose model now offering
deployment-ready performance for reasoning-oriented biomedical QA, while
precision-critical extraction and evidence-dense summarization continue to
favor fine-tuned or hybrid approaches. The benchmark delineates where simple
prompting suffices and where retrieval-augmented or planning-based scaffolds
are likely required, providing actionable guidance for BioNLP system design as
frontier models advance.

Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然取得重大突破，但仍会产生不可靠或误导性输出，现有研究主要关注量化模型不确定性，而很少诊断不确定性的具体来源。

Method: 收集目标LLM的多个响应，使用辅助LLM分析这些响应之间的分歧模式，推理不确定性的可能来源（输入歧义、知识缺失等），并识别具体的缺失事实或概念。

Result: 在AmbigQA、OpenBookQA和MMLU-Pro数据集上验证了该框架的有效性，证实了其在诊断不同不确定性来源方面的通用性。

Conclusion: 这种不确定性诊断方法展示了通过相关人工干预来提高LLM性能和可靠性的潜力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have delivered significant breakthroughs across
diverse domains but can still produce unreliable or misleading outputs, posing
critical challenges for real-world applications. While many recent studies
focus on quantifying model uncertainty, relatively little work has been devoted
to \textit{diagnosing the source of uncertainty}. In this study, we show that,
when an LLM is uncertain, the patterns of disagreement among its multiple
generated responses contain rich clues about the underlying cause of
uncertainty. To illustrate this point, we collect multiple responses from a
target LLM and employ an auxiliary LLM to analyze their patterns of
disagreement. The auxiliary model is tasked to reason about the likely source
of uncertainty, such as whether it stems from ambiguity in the input question,
a lack of relevant knowledge, or both. In cases involving knowledge gaps, the
auxiliary model also identifies the specific missing facts or concepts
contributing to the uncertainty. In our experiment, we validate our framework
on AmbigQA, OpenBookQA, and MMLU-Pro, confirming its generality in diagnosing
distinct uncertainty sources. Such diagnosis shows the potential for relevant
manual interventions that improve LLM performance and reliability.

Motivation: 探索自动文本情感识别是否能洞察争议解决中情感表达对对方的影响，特别是在争议这种情感更强烈、社会过程不同的情境中。

Method: 使用大型买家-卖家争议对话语料库，分析情感表达如何影响主观和客观结果，并比较大语言模型与传统方法的情感标注效果。

Result: 大语言模型在情感强度标注方面比先前方法具有更大的解释力，更符合人类标注者的决策。情感表达确实影响冲突的升级和解决过程。

Conclusion: 研究结果支持情感表达影响冲突升级和解决的理论模型，表明基于代理的系统可以通过识别和缓解情感升级来有效管理争议。

Abstract: In conflict, people use emotional expressions to shape their counterparts'
thoughts, feelings, and actions. This paper explores whether automatic text
emotion recognition offers insight into this influence in the context of
dispute resolution. Prior work has shown the promise of such methods in
negotiations; however, disputes evoke stronger emotions and different social
processes. We use a large corpus of buyer-seller dispute dialogues to
investigate how emotional expressions shape subjective and objective outcomes.
We further demonstrate that large-language models yield considerably greater
explanatory power than previous methods for emotion intensity annotation and
better match the decisions of human annotators. Findings support existing
theoretical models for how emotional expressions contribute to conflict
escalation and resolution and suggest that agent-based systems could be useful
in managing disputes by recognizing and potentially mitigating emotional
escalation.

Method: 通过分析可迁移任务表示（能在另一个模型实例中恢复任务上下文的向量表示）的演化过程，研究其在序列维度上的局部性特征和语义范围。

Result: 发现任务表示以非单调、稀疏方式演化，具有强烈的时间局部性（仅在特定token处激活）和语义局部性（捕获最小"任务范围"），模型依赖更分布式表示支持复杂任务。

Conclusion: 语言模型通过即时计算过程适应新证据和学习新任务，其可迁移任务表示展现出时间和语义双重局部性特征，揭示了上下文学习的底层机制。

Abstract: Many of language models' impressive capabilities originate from their
in-context learning: based on instructions or examples, they can infer and
perform new tasks without weight updates. In this work, we investigate
\emph{when} representations for new tasks are formed in language models, and
\emph{how} these representations change over the course of context. We focus on
''transferrable'' task representations -- vector representations that can
restore task context in another instance of the model, even without the full
prompt. We show that these representations evolve in non-monotonic and sporadic
ways, and are distinct from a more inert representation of high-level task
categories that persists throughout the context. Specifically, models often
condense multiple evidence into these transferrable task representations, which
align well with the performance improvement based on more examples in the
context. However, this accrual process exhibits strong locality along the
sequence dimension, coming online only at certain tokens -- despite task
identity being reliably decodable throughout the context. Moreover, these local
but transferrable task representations tend to capture minimal ''task scopes'',
such as a semantically-independent subtask, and models rely on more
temporally-distributed representations to support longer and composite tasks.
This two-fold locality (temporal and semantic) underscores a kind of
just-in-time computational process underlying language models' ability to adapt
to new evidence and learn new tasks on the fly.

Conclusion: 该方法通过考虑预填充-解码分离特性，实现了更精确和高效的模型剪枝，为大语言模型的高效部署提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional capabilities across
various tasks, but their deployment is constrained by high computational and
memory costs. Model pruning provides an effective means to alleviate these
demands. However, existing methods often ignore the characteristics of
prefill-decode (PD) disaggregation in practice. In this paper, we propose a
novel pruning method for PD disaggregation inference, enabling more precise and
efficient block and KV Cache pruning. Our approach constructs pruning and
distillation sets to perform iterative block removal independently for the
prefill and decode stages, obtaining better pruning solutions. Moreover, we
introduce a token-aware cache pruning mechanism that retains all KV Cache in
the prefill stage but selectively reuses entries for the first and last token
sequences in selected layers during decode, reducing communication costs with
minimal overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
consistently achieves strong performance in both PD disaggregation and PD
unified settings without disaggregation. Under the default settings, our method
achieves a 20.56% inference speedup and a 4.95 times reduction in data
transmission bandwidth consumption.

*Xuan Yao,Qianteng Wang,Xinbo Liu,Ke-Wei Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究首次全面评估了先进LLM在CFA专业金融认证考试中的表现，通过1560道选择题测试发现推理导向模型在零样本设置中表现最佳，而RAG管道在复杂场景中显著提升准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在金融应用中有巨大潜力，但缺乏在专业金融背景下的系统性评估。CFA作为全球最严格的金融专业认证，能够反映真实金融分析的复杂性，是理想的评估基准。

Method: 使用CFA I-III级官方模拟考试的1560道选择题，比较三类LLM：多模态计算强大型、推理专业化高精度型和轻量级效率优化型。评估采用零样本提示和新颖的RAG管道，后者通过分层知识组织和结构化查询生成实现精确领域知识检索。

Result: 推理导向模型在零样本设置中表现最优，RAG管道显著提升复杂场景的推理准确性。错误分析显示知识差距是主要失败原因，文本可读性影响极小。

Conclusion: 研究为金融领域LLM部署提供了实用见解，为从业者提供了基于证据的模型选择和成本性能优化指导，强调了专业领域知识检索对提升金融分析准确性的重要性。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models presents significant
opportunities for financial applications, yet systematic evaluation in
specialized financial contexts remains limited. This study presents the first
comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs using 1,560 multiple-choice
questions from official mock exams across Levels I-III of CFA, most rigorous
professional certifications globally that mirror real-world financial analysis
complexity. We compare models distinguished by core design priorities:
multi-modal and computationally powerful, reasoning-specialized and highly
accurate, and lightweight efficiency-optimized.
  We assess models under zero-shot prompting and through a novel
Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline that integrates official CFA curriculum
content. The RAG system achieves precise domain-specific knowledge retrieval
through hierarchical knowledge organization and structured query generation,
significantly enhancing reasoning accuracy in professional financial
certification evaluation.
  Results reveal that reasoning-oriented models consistently outperform others
in zero-shot settings, while the RAG pipeline provides substantial improvements
particularly for complex scenarios. Comprehensive error analysis identifies
knowledge gaps as the primary failure mode, with minimal impact from text
readability. These findings provide actionable insights for LLM deployment in
finance, offering practitioners evidence-based guidance for model selection and
cost-performance optimization.

Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在复杂指令执行、减少幻觉和空间推理任务中的局限性，提高模型在协作构建等任务中的表现。

Method: 集成中等规模LLM代理，采用新颖抽象机制和话语模块来解析指令，通过上下文学习动态生成环境的高层表示。

Result: 在自然协作构建任务中表现优于使用更大LLM的单LLM CoT和代理LLM系统，能够大幅避免幻觉、识别缺失信息、请求澄清并更新学习对象。在ToolBench API完成任务中也展示了超越环境的抽象能力。

Conclusion: COCORELI框架通过混合代理方法和抽象机制，有效提升了LLM在复杂任务中的性能，特别是在减少幻觉和空间推理方面表现出色。

Abstract: We present COCORELI, a hybrid agent framework designed to tackle the
limitations of large language models (LLMs) in tasks requiring: following
complex instructions, minimizing hallucination, and spatial reasoning. COCORELI
integrates medium-sized LLM agents with novel abstraction mechanisms and a
discourse module to parse instructions to in-context learn dynamic, high-level
representations of the environment. Experiments on natural collaborative
construction tasks show that COCORELI outperforms single-LLM CoT and agentic
LLM systems, all using larger LLMs. It manages to largely avoid hallucinations,
identify missing information, ask for clarifications, and update its learned
objects. COCORELI's abstraction abilities extend beyond ENVIRONMENT, as shown
in the ToolBench API completion task.

### [70] [MOSAIC: A Multilingual, Taxonomy-Agnostic, and Computationally Efficient Approach for Radiological Report Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04471)
*Alice Schiavone,Marco Fraccaro,Lea Marie Pehrson,Silvia Ingala,Rasmus Bonnevie,Michael Bachmann Nielsen,Vincent Beliveau,Melanie Ganz,Desmond Elliott*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MOSAIC是一个基于开源语言模型MedGemma-4B的多语言放射学报告分类系统，支持零样本/少样本提示和轻量级微调，在多种语言和影像模态上达到接近专家水平的性能，且计算资源需求低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有放射学报告分类方法存在局限性：基于规则的方法难以处理语言变异性，监督模型需要大量标注数据，基于LLM的系统依赖闭源或资源密集型模型，且大多仅限于英语和单一模态/分类法。

Method: 使用紧凑的开源语言模型MedGemma-4B，支持零样本/少样本提示和轻量级微调，可在消费级GPU上部署。在英语、西班牙语、法语和丹麦语的7个数据集上进行评估，涵盖多种影像模态和标签分类法。

Result: 在5个胸部X光数据集上平均宏观F1得分为88，接近或超过专家水平，仅需24GB GPU内存。通过数据增强，仅80个标注样本即可在丹麦语报告上达到82的加权F1得分（完整1600样本训练集为86）。

Conclusion: MOSAIC为临床环境提供了大型或专有LLM的实用替代方案，代码和模型开源，邀请社区在新语言、分类法和模态上评估和扩展MOSAIC。

Abstract: Radiology reports contain rich clinical information that can be used to train
imaging models without relying on costly manual annotation. However, existing
approaches face critical limitations: rule-based methods struggle with
linguistic variability, supervised models require large annotated datasets, and
recent LLM-based systems depend on closed-source or resource-intensive models
that are unsuitable for clinical use. Moreover, current solutions are largely
restricted to English and single-modality, single-taxonomy datasets. We
introduce MOSAIC, a multilingual, taxonomy-agnostic, and computationally
efficient approach for radiological report classification. Built on a compact
open-access language model (MedGemma-4B), MOSAIC supports both zero-/few-shot
prompting and lightweight fine-tuning, enabling deployment on consumer-grade
GPUs. We evaluate MOSAIC across seven datasets in English, Spanish, French, and
Danish, spanning multiple imaging modalities and label taxonomies. The model
achieves a mean macro F1 score of 88 across five chest X-ray datasets,
approaching or exceeding expert-level performance, while requiring only 24 GB
of GPU memory. With data augmentation, as few as 80 annotated samples are
sufficient to reach a weighted F1 score of 82 on Danish reports, compared to 86
with the full 1600-sample training set. MOSAIC offers a practical alternative
to large or proprietary LLMs in clinical settings. Code and models are
open-source. We invite the community to evaluate and extend MOSAIC on new
languages, taxonomies, and modalities.

TL;DR: RECAP是一个新的基准测试，用于评估和改进意图重写技术，通过将模糊的用户对话重写为清晰的目标表示来提升多智能体对话系统的规划能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界对话往往存在模糊性、不完整性和动态变化，传统分类方法在开放领域对话中泛化能力差，导致意图识别困难，影响下游规划效果。

Method: 提出RECAP基准数据集，包含歧义、意图漂移、模糊性和多目标对话等挑战；开发基于LLM的评估器评估规划效用；采用基于提示的重写方法和两个DPO微调的重写器。

Result: 基于提示的重写方法优于基线，DPO微调的重写器带来额外的效用提升，证明意图重写是改善开放领域对话系统规划的关键可行组件。

Conclusion: 意图重写是提升多智能体对话系统规划能力的关键技术，RECAP基准为这一领域提供了有效的评估框架，LLM-based方法在此任务上表现出色。

Abstract: Understanding user intent is essential for effective planning in
conversational assistants, particularly those powered by large language models
(LLMs) coordinating multiple agents. However, real-world dialogues are often
ambiguous, underspecified, or dynamic, making intent detection a persistent
challenge. Traditional classification-based approaches struggle to generalize
in open-ended settings, leading to brittle interpretations and poor downstream
planning. We propose RECAP (REwriting Conversations for Agent Planning), a new
benchmark designed to evaluate and advance intent rewriting, reframing
user-agent dialogues into concise representations of user goals. RECAP captures
diverse challenges such as ambiguity, intent drift, vagueness, and mixed-goal
conversations. Alongside the dataset, we introduce an LLM-based evaluator that
assesses planning utility given the rewritten intent. Using RECAP, we develop a
prompt-based rewriting approach that outperforms baselines. We further
demonstrate that fine-tuning two DPO-based rewriters yields additional utility
gains. Our results highlight intent rewriting as a critical and tractable
component for improving agent planning in open-domain dialogue systems.

Motivation: 语音编码器与LLM集成需要大量数据和资源，但实际应用场景中数据可用性不足

Method: 使用参数高效适配器转换语音嵌入，采用LLM合成数据集标注技术减少标注成本，添加分类器正则化器并使用LoRA优化LLM

Result: 在LibriSpeech ASR任务上相对WER提升26%，NER任务F1分数提升6.3%，SA任务F1分数提升32%，SLUE评分提升6.6%和9.5%

Conclusion: 提出的适配器方法在减少参数量的同时显著提升了语音处理任务的性能，为解决数据不足问题提供了有效方案

Abstract: While integrating speech encoder with LLM requires substantial data and
resources, use cases face limitations due to insufficient availability. To
address this, we propose a solution with a parameter-efficient adapter that
converts speech embeddings into LLM-compatible tokens, focusing on end-to-end
automatic speech recognition (ASR), named entity recognition (NER), and
sentiment analysis (SA). To reduce labeling costs, we employ an LLM-based
synthetic dataset annotation technique. The proposed adapter, using 7x fewer
trainable parameters, achieves significant performance gains: a 26% relative
Word Error Rates (WER) improvement on the LibriSpeech ASR task, a 6.3% relative
F1 score increase on the NER task, and a 32% relative F1 score boost on the SA
task. Moreover, using advanced techniques such as adding a classifier
regularizer and optimizing the LLM with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) yields
notable performance gains, with Spoken Language Understanding Evaluation (SLUE)
score improvement of 6.6% and 9.5%

TL;DR: 提出了首个用于评估推测解码方法加速LLM测试时扩展的综合基准，发现简单的n-gram方法能有效捕获重复模式，建议将其与模型或训练方法结合以平衡加速效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试时扩展虽然能增强大语言模型的推理能力，但由于生成冗余和重复的推理轨迹导致计算效率低下，而推测解码在这一结构化、重复丰富的上下文中的有效性尚未充分探索

Method: 建立综合基准，在代表性测试时扩展范式（如Best-of-N采样和多轮思考）上使用一致的实验协议，评估三类推测解码方法：基于模型、基于训练和基于n-gram的方法

Result: 实验表明简单的n-gram方法能有效捕获重复模式，在加速测试时扩展方面展现出独特潜力，证明了将n-gram方法与模型或训练方法结合的价值

Conclusion: 该基准有望推动测试时扩展中推测解码的进一步研究，通过更好处理重复和多样化推理路径，实现更快速实用的LLM推理

Abstract: Test-time scaling has emerged as a powerful paradigm for enhancing the
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by allocating additional
computational resources during inference. However, this paradigm is inherently
inefficient due to the generation of redundant and repetitive reasoning traces,
leading to significant computational overhead. Speculative decoding offers a
promising avenue for mitigating this inefficiency, yet its efficacy in the
structured, repetition-rich context of test-time scaling remains largely
unexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce the first comprehensive benchmark
designed to evaluate speculative decoding methods for accelerating LLM
test-time scaling. Our benchmark provides consistent experimental protocols
across representative test-time scaling paradigms (e.g., Best-of-N sampling and
multi-round thinking), enabling a fair comparison of three major categories of
speculative decoding: model-based, training-based, and n-gram-based methods.
Extensive experiments reveal that simple n-gram-based methods effectively
capture repetitive patterns, demonstrating unique potential in accelerating
test-time scaling. This phenomenon demonstrates the value of integrating
n-gram-based methods with model-based or training-based approaches to balance
acceleration for both repetitive and diverse reasoning in test-time scaling. We
hope this benchmark spurs further research on speculative decoding for
test-time scaling, enabling faster and more practical reasoning in LLMs through
better handling of repetitive and diverse reasoning paths.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ParaThinker通过并行生成多种推理路径来克服大语言模型的"隧道视野"问题，相比顺序计算扩展，并行计算扩展能更有效地提升推理能力，让小模型达到甚至超越大模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型通过增加测试时计算（生成长序列思考过程）来提升推理能力，但这种方法存在边际效益递减的问题。研究发现这不是模型能力限制，而是"隧道视野"问题——不完美的初始步骤会将模型锁定在次优推理路径中。

Method: 提出ParaThinker框架，训练LLM并行生成多个多样化的推理路径，然后综合这些路径得出更优的最终答案。通过同时探索不同思路来避免隧道视野问题。

Result: 在挑战性推理基准测试中，ParaThinker相比顺序LLM实现了显著准确率提升（1.5B模型平均提升12.3%，7B模型平均提升7.5%，使用8条并行路径），同时仅增加可忽略的延迟开销（7.1%）。

Conclusion: 并行计算扩展（宽度）比顺序计算扩展（深度）是更有效和高效的推理扩展方式，使小模型能够超越更大模型，确立了并行思维作为未来LLM扩展的关键高效维度。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have been driven by test-time
compute scaling - a strategy that improves reasoning by generating longer,
sequential thought processes. While effective, this approach encounters a
significant bottleneck as computation increases, where further computation
offers only marginal performance gains. We argue this ceiling is not an
inherent limit of the model's capability but a flaw in the scaling strategy
itself, a phenomenon we term "Tunnel Vision", where a model's imperfect initial
steps lock it into a suboptimal reasoning path. To overcome this, we introduce
a new scaling paradigm: native thought parallelism. We present ParaThinker, an
end-to-end framework that trains an LLM to generate multiple, diverse reasoning
paths in parallel and synthesize them into a superior final answer. By
exploring different lines of thoughts simultaneously, ParaThinker effectively
sidesteps the Tunnel Vision issue and unlocks the model's latent reasoning
potential. Our approach demonstrates that scaling compute in parallel (width)
is a more effective and efficient way to superior reasoning than simply scaling
sequentially (depth). On challenging reasoning benchmarks, ParaThinker achieves
substantial accuracy improvements over sequential LLMs (12.3% for 1.5B and 7.5%
for 7B models on average with 8 parallel paths), while adding only negligible
latency overhead (7.1%). This enables smaller models to surpass much larger
counterparts and establishes parallel thinking as a critical, efficient
dimension for scaling future LLMs.

Motivation: 现有的文本到分子模型使用原子级标记化，主要关注局部连接性，限制了模型捕捉分子全局结构上下文的能力。为了解决这个问题，需要开发能够更好理解分子语义的模型。

Method: 提出了子结构级标记化方案，并开发了基于重要性的训练策略，优先考虑关键子结构。还提出了简单的集成策略来聚合多个模型的输出。

Result: CAMT5在各种文本到分子生成任务中表现出优越性，仅使用2%的训练标记就能超越最先进的方法。集成策略进一步提升了生成性能。

Conclusion: 子结构级标记化和基于重要性的训练策略能够有效提升文本到分子模型的性能，使其更好地捕捉分子语义和全局结构上下文。

Abstract: Recently, text-to-molecule models have shown great potential across various
chemical applications, e.g., drug-discovery. These models adapt language models
to molecular data by representing molecules as sequences of atoms. However,
they rely on atom-level tokenizations, which primarily focus on modeling local
connectivity, thereby limiting the ability of models to capture the global
structural context within molecules. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel
text-to-molecule model, coined Context-Aware Molecular T5 (CAMT5). Inspired by
the significance of the substructure-level contexts in understanding molecule
structures, e.g., ring systems, we introduce substructure-level tokenization
for text-to-molecule models. Building on our tokenization scheme, we develop an
importance-based training strategy that prioritizes key substructures, enabling
CAMT5 to better capture the molecular semantics. Extensive experiments verify
the superiority of CAMT5 in various text-to-molecule generation tasks.
Intriguingly, we find that CAMT5 outperforms the state-of-the-art methods using
only 2% of training tokens. In addition, we propose a simple yet effective
ensemble strategy that aggregates the outputs of text-to-molecule models to
further boost the generation performance. Code is available at

Abstract: This paper presents an end-to-end mobile system that delivers
culturally-attuned safe driving feedback to drivers in Nigeria, a low-resource
environment with significant infrastructural challenges. The core of the system
is a novel dual-component Natural Language Generation (NLG) engine that
provides both legally-grounded safety tips and persuasive, theory-driven
behavioural reports. We describe the complete system architecture, including an
automatic trip detection service, on-device behaviour analysis, and a
sophisticated NLG pipeline that leverages a two-step reflection process to
ensure high-quality feedback. The system also integrates a specialized machine
learning model for detecting alcohol-influenced driving, a key local safety
issue. The architecture is engineered for robustness against intermittent
connectivity and noisy sensor data. A pilot deployment with 90 drivers
demonstrates the viability of our approach, and initial results on detected
unsafe behaviours are presented. This work provides a framework for applying
data-to-text and AI systems to achieve social good.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在稀有词预测方面存在困难，先前研究发现有专门的"平台神经元"处理稀有词，但其功能组织和机制尚不清楚。

Method: 通过在GPT-2 XL和Pythia模型中进行神经元影响分析、基于图的聚类和注意力头消融实验来研究稀有词处理的机制。

Result: 发现稀有词处理需要额外的平台神经元，这些神经元空间分布而非模块化聚集，注意力机制没有专门路由到专家神经元。

Conclusion: 稀有词专门化是通过分布式、训练驱动的分化而非架构模块化实现的，既保持了上下文敏感灵活性，又实现了自适应容量分配。

Abstract: Large language models struggle with rare token prediction, yet the mechanisms
driving their specialization remain unclear. Prior work identified specialized
``plateau'' neurons for rare tokens following distinctive three-regime
influence patterns \cite{liu2025emergent}, but their functional organization is
unknown. We investigate this through neuron influence analyses, graph-based
clustering, and attention head ablations in GPT-2 XL and Pythia models. Our
findings show that: (1) rare token processing requires additional plateau
neurons beyond the power-law regime sufficient for common tokens, forming dual
computational regimes; (2) plateau neurons are spatially distributed rather
than forming modular clusters; and (3) attention mechanisms exhibit no
preferential routing to specialists. These results demonstrate that rare token
specialization arises through distributed, training-driven differentiation
rather than architectural modularity, preserving context-sensitive flexibility
while achieving adaptive capacity allocation.

Abstract: Visual Emotion Recognition (VER) is an important research topic due to its
wide range of applications, including opinion mining and advertisement design.
Extending this capability to recognize emotions at the individual level further
broadens its potential applications. Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) have attracted increasing attention and demonstrated performance
comparable to that of conventional VER methods. However, MLLMs are trained on
large and diverse datasets containing general opinions, which causes them to
favor majority viewpoints and familiar patterns. This tendency limits their
performance in a personalized VER, which is crucial for practical and
real-world applications, and indicates a key area for improvement. To address
this limitation, the proposed method employs discrete prompt tuning inspired by
the process of humans' prompt engineering to adapt the VER task to each
individual. Our method selects the best natural language representation from
the generated prompts and uses it to update the prompt for the realization of
accurate personalized VER.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在安全关键领域如女性健康中，检索增强生成(RAG)系统的错误回答可能导致严重后果，因此需要可靠的拒绝机制来避免生成不准确信息。

Method: 使用基于能量模型(EBM)在260万指南衍生问题语料库上学习平滑能量景观，与校准softmax基线和k近邻密度启发式方法进行对比，测试简单和困难拒绝分割。

Result: EBM在语义困难案例中达到AUROC 0.961，优于softmax的0.950，FPR@95从0.331降低到0.235。在简单负例上各方法表现相当，但在安全关键困难分布中EBM优势最明显。

Conclusion: 基于能量的拒绝评分比基于概率的softmax置信度提供更可靠的置信信号，为安全RAG系统提供了可扩展和可解释的基础。

Abstract: Reliable abstention is critical for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
systems, particularly in safety-critical domains such as women's health, where
incorrect answers can lead to harm. We present an energy-based model (EBM) that
learns a smooth energy landscape over a dense semantic corpus of 2.6M
guideline-derived questions, enabling the system to decide when to generate or
abstain. We benchmark the EBM against a calibrated softmax baseline and a
k-nearest neighbour (kNN) density heuristic across both easy and hard
abstention splits, where hard cases are semantically challenging
near-distribution queries. The EBM achieves superior abstention performance
abstention on semantically hard cases, reaching AUROC 0.961 versus 0.950 for
softmax, while also reducing FPR@95 (0.235 vs 0.331). On easy negatives,
performance is comparable across methods, but the EBM's advantage becomes most
pronounced in safety-critical hard distributions. A comprehensive ablation with
controlled negative sampling and fair data exposure shows that robustness stems
primarily from the energy scoring head, while the inclusion or exclusion of
specific negative types (hard, easy, mixed) sharpens decision boundaries but is
not essential for generalisation to hard cases. These results demonstrate that
energy-based abstention scoring offers a more reliable confidence signal than
probability-based softmax confidence, providing a scalable and interpretable
foundation for safe RAG systems.

Abstract: Claim decomposition plays a crucial role in the fact-checking process by
breaking down complex claims into simpler atomic components and identifying
their unfactual elements. Despite its importance, current research primarily
focuses on generative methods for decomposition, with insufficient emphasis on

we introduce \textbf{DecMetrics}, which comprises three new metrics:
\texttt{COMPLETENESS}, \texttt{CORRECTNESS}, and \texttt{SEMANTIC ENTROPY},
designed to automatically assess the quality of claims produced by
decomposition models. Utilizing these metrics, we develop a lightweight claim
decomposition model, optimizing its performance through the integration of
these metrics as a reward function. Through automatic evaluation, our approach
aims to set a benchmark for claim decomposition, enhancing both the reliability
and effectiveness of fact-checking systems.

TL;DR: 本文提出了RevUtil数据集和模型，用于自动评估同行评审评论的效用性，包括四个关键方面：可操作性、具体性、可验证性和帮助性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着评审人员时间减少，需要自动化系统来确保评审质量，使反馈对作者更有用。

Method: 构建包含1,430条人工标注和10k条合成标注的RevUtil数据集，使用微调模型评估评论的四个关键方面并生成解释。

Result: 微调模型在人类一致性方面达到甚至超过GPT-4o等强大闭源模型的水平，但机器生成的评论通常在这四个方面表现不如人工评论。

Conclusion: 该研究为自动评估评审评论质量提供了有效工具，有助于提高同行评审的效用性。

Abstract: Providing constructive feedback to paper authors is a core component of peer
review. With reviewers increasingly having less time to perform reviews,
automated support systems are required to ensure high reviewing quality, thus
making the feedback in reviews useful for authors. To this end, we identify
four key aspects of review comments (individual points in weakness sections of
reviews) that drive the utility for authors: Actionability, Grounding &
Specificity, Verifiability, and Helpfulness. To enable evaluation and
development of models assessing review comments, we introduce the RevUtil
dataset. We collect 1,430 human-labeled review comments and scale our data with
10k synthetically labeled comments for training purposes. The synthetic data
additionally contains rationales, i.e., explanations for the aspect score of a
review comment. Employing the RevUtil dataset, we benchmark fine-tuned models
for assessing review comments on these aspects and generating rationales. Our
experiments demonstrate that these fine-tuned models achieve agreement levels
with humans comparable to, and in some cases exceeding, those of powerful
closed models like GPT-4o. Our analysis further reveals that machine-generated
reviews generally underperform human reviews on our four aspects.

Abstract: We present ASCENDgpt, a transformer-based model specifically designed for
cardiovascular risk prediction from longitudinal electronic health records
(EHRs). Our approach introduces a novel phenotype-aware tokenization scheme
that maps 47,155 raw ICD codes to 176 clinically meaningful phenotype tokens,
achieving 99.6\% consolidation of diagnosis codes while preserving semantic
information. This phenotype mapping contributes to a total vocabulary of 10,442
tokens - a 77.9\% reduction when compared with using raw ICD codes directly. We
pretrain ASCENDgpt on sequences derived from 19402 unique individuals using a
masked language modeling objective, then fine-tune for time-to-event prediction
of five cardiovascular outcomes: myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, major
adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), cardiovascular death, and all-cause
mortality. Our model achieves excellent discrimination on the held-out test set
with an average C-index of 0.816, demonstrating strong performance across all
outcomes (MI: 0.792, stroke: 0.824, MACE: 0.800, cardiovascular death: 0.842,
all-cause mortality: 0.824). The phenotype-based approach enables clinically
interpretable predictions while maintaining computational efficiency. Our work
demonstrates the effectiveness of domain-specific tokenization and pretraining
for EHR-based risk prediction tasks.

*Hao Shi,Yusuke Fujita,Tomoya Mizumoto,Lianbo Liu,Atsushi Kojima,Yui Sudo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种序列化输出提示(SOP)方法，通过结构化提示显式指导LLM，显著提升多说话人语音识别系统性能，特别是在复杂的三说话人场景下。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多说话人ASR系统要么忽略提示，要么使用简单的任务定义提示，缺乏通过精心设计提示来提升LLM性能的研究。

Method: 在语音编码器后插入分离器和序列化CTC层，以先到先出的方式分离多说话人内容；通过贪心搜索解码序列化CTC输出获得SOP提示；采用三阶段训练策略：序列化输出训练微调、序列化语音信息提取和SOP自适应。

Result: 在LibriMix数据集上的实验表明，SOP方法在双说话人和三说话人条件下均显著提升了性能，特别是在三说话人复杂场景下效果明显。

Conclusion: SOP方法有效解决了LLM在多说话人ASR中未能充分利用的问题，通过结构化提示显著提升了系统性能，为复杂场景下的语音识别提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Prompts are crucial for task definition and for improving the performance of
large language models (LLM)-based systems. However, existing LLM-based
multi-talker (MT) automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems either omit
prompts or rely on simple task-definition prompts, with no prior work exploring
the design of prompts to enhance performance. In this paper, we propose
extracting serialized output prompts (SOP) and explicitly guiding the LLM using
structured prompts to improve system performance (SOP-MT-ASR). A Separator and
serialized Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) layers are inserted
after the speech encoder to separate and extract MT content from the mixed
speech encoding in a first-speaking-first-out manner. Subsequently, the SOP,
which serves as a prompt for LLMs, is obtained by decoding the serialized CTC
outputs using greedy search. To train the model effectively, we design a
three-stage training strategy, consisting of serialized output training (SOT)
fine-tuning, serialized speech information extraction, and SOP-based
adaptation. Experimental results on the LibriMix dataset show that, although
the LLM-based SOT model performs well in the two-talker scenario, it fails to
fully leverage LLMs under more complex conditions, such as the three-talker
scenario. The proposed SOP approach significantly improved performance under
both two- and three-talker conditions.

TL;DR: 通过将TV字幕重构为上下文提示，辅以加权注意力机制，在弱监督ASR框架中生成更准确的伪标签语料集


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TV字幕容易获得但与音频对齐不准，不适合直接作为盱字识别目标，需要新方法利用其上下文信息

Method: 将TV字幕作为上下文提示，通过迭代精炼生成伪词展，并使用加权注意力机制强调相关字幕词汇

Result: 实验显示识别准确性显著提升，能够生成高质量的伪标签语料集

Conclusion: 该方法有效利用TV字幕的上下文信息，为训练健壮的ASR系统提供了高质量的基础资源

Abstract: This study proposes a novel approach to using TV subtitles within a weakly
supervised (WS) Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) framework. Although TV
subtitles are readily available, their imprecise alignment with corresponding
audio limits their applicability as supervised targets for verbatim
transcription. Rather than using subtitles as direct supervision signals, our
method reimagines them as context-rich prompts. This design enables the model
to handle discrepancies between spoken audio and subtitle text. Instead,
generated pseudo transcripts become the primary targets, with subtitles acting
as guiding cues for iterative refinement. To further enhance the process, we
introduce a weighted attention mechanism that emphasizes relevant subtitle
tokens during inference. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements
in transcription accuracy, highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed
method in refining transcripts. These enhanced pseudo-labeled datasets provide
high-quality foundational resources for training robust ASR systems.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种通过分析LLM生成过程中的前几个代理对数概率来检测幻觉的方法，适用于黑盒API环境且仅需单次生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在QA任务中输出幻觉的问题，特别是在数据访问受限的黑盒API环境下。

Method: 从非贪婪解码中获取的前几个代理对数概率提取不确定性指标，首先提出熵产率(EPR)指标，然后通过监督学习进行增强。

Result: 在多个QA数据集和LLM上评估，该方法显著提高了幻觉检测性能，仅需前10个代理对数概率即可获得高性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为QA和RAG系统提供了一种可部署的幻觉检测技术，能够在单次生成中提高LLM输出的可靠性。

Abstract: Hallucinations in Large Language Model (LLM) outputs for Question Answering
(QA) tasks critically undermine their real-world reliability. This paper
introduces an applied methodology for robust, one-shot hallucination detection,
specifically designed for scenarios with limited data access, such as
interacting with black-box LLM APIs that typically expose only a few top
candidate log-probabilities per token. Our approach derives uncertainty
indicators directly from these readily available log-probabilities generated
during non-greedy decoding. We first derive an Entropy Production Rate (EPR)
metric that offers baseline performance, later augmented with supervised
learning. Our learned model uses features representing the entropic
contributions of the accessible top-ranked tokens within a single generated
sequence, requiring no multiple query re-runs. Evaluated across diverse QA
datasets and multiple LLMs, this estimator significantly improves hallucination
detection over using EPR alone. Crucially, high performance is demonstrated
using only the typically small set of available log-probabilities (e.g., top
<10 per token), confirming its practical efficiency and suitability for these
API-constrained deployments. This work provides a readily deployable technique
to enhance the trustworthiness of LLM responses from a single generation pass
in QA and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, with its utility
further demonstrated in a finance framework analyzing responses to queries on
annual reports from an industrial dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床医生熬熬对病人安全构成重大威胁，现有研究主要依赖回顾性问卷或广泛的EHR元数据，忽视了临床笔记中的叙事信息。

Method: 分析MIMIC-IV数据库中10,000份ICU出院摘要，采用混合流水线：细调BioBERT情感嵌入、临床熬熬监测词汇压力词典、5主题LDA分析和工作负荷代理指标，最终使用提供者级别的逻辑回归分类器。

Result: 模型在分层预留集上达到精度0.80、召回率0.89、F1分0.84的性能，超过仅使用元数据的基准方法至少0.17的F1分数。根据专业分析，放射科、精神病学和神经科的医务人员熬熬风险较高。

Conclusion: ICU临床笔记中含有可执行的信号，可用于主动的健康状况监测，为预防医务人员熬熬提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Clinician burnout poses a substantial threat to patient safety, particularly
in high-acuity intensive care units (ICUs). Existing research predominantly
relies on retrospective survey tools or broad electronic health record (EHR)
metadata, often overlooking the valuable narrative information embedded in
clinical notes. In this study, we analyze 10,000 ICU discharge summaries from
MIMIC-IV, a publicly available database derived from the electronic health
records of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. The dataset encompasses
diverse patient data, including vital signs, medical orders, diagnoses,
procedures, treatments, and deidentified free-text clinical notes. We introduce
a hybrid pipeline that combines BioBERT sentiment embeddings fine-tuned for
clinical narratives, a lexical stress lexicon tailored for clinician burnout
surveillance, and five-topic latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) with workload
proxies. A provider-level logistic regression classifier achieves a precision
of 0.80, a recall of 0.89, and an F1 score of 0.84 on a stratified hold-out
set, surpassing metadata-only baselines by greater than or equal to 0.17 F1
score. Specialty-specific analysis indicates elevated burnout risk among
providers in Radiology, Psychiatry, and Neurology. Our findings demonstrate
that ICU clinical narratives contain actionable signals for proactive
well-being monitoring.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型越来越多地用于教育规划等日常推荐任务，其推荐结果可能延续社会偏见，需要实证研究这些偏见的具体表现和影响。

Method: 使用360个模拟用户档案（按性别、国籍和经济状况变化），分析三个开源LLM（LLaMA-3.1-8B、Gemma-7B、Mistral-7B）的25,000多条大学和专业推荐，提出多维度评估框架。

Result: 结果显示强烈偏见：全球北方机构被过度偏爱，推荐经常强化性别刻板印象，机构重复现象普遍。LLaMA-3.1多样性最高，推荐了58个国家的481所独特大学，但系统性差异仍然存在。

Conclusion: 研究强调在教育大语言模型中考虑偏见的紧迫性，以确保全球高等教育机会的公平获取，提出了超越准确度的多维度评估方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as daily recommendation
systems for tasks like education planning, yet their recommendations risk
perpetuating societal biases. This paper empirically examines geographic,
demographic, and economic biases in university and program suggestions from
three open-source LLMs: LLaMA-3.1-8B, Gemma-7B, and Mistral-7B. Using 360
simulated user profiles varying by gender, nationality, and economic status, we
analyze over 25,000 recommendations. Results show strong biases: institutions
in the Global North are disproportionately favored, recommendations often
reinforce gender stereotypes, and institutional repetition is prevalent. While
LLaMA-3.1 achieves the highest diversity, recommending 481 unique universities
across 58 countries, systemic disparities persist. To quantify these issues, we
propose a novel, multi-dimensional evaluation framework that goes beyond
accuracy by measuring demographic and geographic representation. Our findings
highlight the urgent need for bias consideration in educational LMs to ensure
equitable global access to higher education.

Motivation: 当前生成式搜索引擎和深度研究LLM代理存在过度自信、来源支持薄弱和引用混乱等问题，需要系统化的评估框架来检测这些缺陷。

Method: 开发了DeepTRACE框架，包含8个可测量维度，使用语句级分析（分解、置信度评分）和构建引用与事实支持矩阵来端到端审计系统如何推理和归因证据。

Result: 研究发现生成式搜索引擎和深度研究代理在辩论查询中经常产生片面且高度自信的回应，大量陈述缺乏来源支持。深度研究配置能减少过度自信但仍有40-80%的引用准确率问题。

Conclusion: 当前系统在证据推理和归因方面存在显著缺陷，需要改进引用准确性和支持性，DeepTRACE为系统化评估提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Generative search engines and deep research LLM agents promise trustworthy,
source-grounded synthesis, yet users regularly encounter overconfidence, weak
sourcing, and confusing citation practices. We introduce DeepTRACE, a novel
sociotechnically grounded audit framework that turns prior community-identified
failure cases into eight measurable dimensions spanning answer text, sources,
and citations. DeepTRACE uses statement-level analysis (decomposition,
confidence scoring) and builds citation and factual-support matrices to audit
how systems reason with and attribute evidence end-to-end. Using automated
extraction pipelines for popular public models (e.g., GPT-4.5/5, You.com,
Perplexity, Copilot/Bing, Gemini) and an LLM-judge with validated agreement to
human raters, we evaluate both web-search engines and deep-research
configurations. Our findings show that generative search engines and deep
research agents frequently produce one-sided, highly confident responses on
debate queries and include large fractions of statements unsupported by their
own listed sources. Deep-research configurations reduce overconfidence and can
attain high citation thoroughness, but they remain highly one-sided on debate
queries and still exhibit large fractions of unsupported statements, with
citation accuracy ranging from 40--80% across systems.

TL;DR: LLMs在处理混合上下文时倾向于采纳较少出现的信息，这种特性容易被恶意内容利用。研究提出Poisoned Context测试平台和基于Rescorla-Wagner模型的RW-Steering方法，通过两阶段微调使模型能够识别并忽略不适当内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的上下文往往混合相关信息和不当内容，LLMs在处理这种混合上下文时存在可靠性风险，需要研究其处理机制并提升安全性。

Method: 引入Poisoned Context测试平台，将Rescorla-Wagner模型从神经科学适配到LLM行为量化，提出RW-Steering两阶段微调方法使模型内部识别忽略不当信号。

Result: 实验显示最佳微调模型将响应质量提升39.8%，逆转了不良行为曲线，RW-Steering在不同比例不当内容下都具有鲁棒泛化能力。

Conclusion: RW-Steering为提升LLM在现实世界使用中的安全性提供了一个鲁棒、可泛化的上下文工程解决方案。

Abstract: Incorporating external context can significantly enhance the response quality
of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, real-world contexts often mix
relevant information with disproportionate inappropriate content, posing
reliability risks. How do LLMs process and prioritize mixed context? To study
this, we introduce the Poisoned Context Testbed, pairing queries with
real-world contexts containing relevant and inappropriate content. Inspired by
associative learning in animals, we adapt the Rescorla-Wagner (RW) model from
neuroscience to quantify how competing contextual signals influence LLM
outputs. Our adapted model reveals a consistent behavioral pattern: LLMs
exhibit a strong tendency to incorporate information that is less prevalent in
the context. This susceptibility is harmful in real-world settings, where small
amounts of inappropriate content can substantially degrade response quality.
Empirical evaluations on our testbed further confirm this vulnerability. To
tackle this, we introduce RW-Steering, a two-stage finetuning-based approach
that enables the model to internally identify and ignore inappropriate signals.
Unlike prior methods that rely on extensive supervision across diverse context
mixtures, RW-Steering generalizes robustly across varying proportions of
inappropriate content. Experiments show that our best fine-tuned model improves
response quality by 39.8% and reverses the undesirable behavior curve,
establishing RW-Steering as a robust, generalizable context engineering
solution for improving LLM safety in real-world use.

Abstract: This paper provides a self-contained, from-scratch, exposition of key
algorithms for instruction tuning of models: SFT, Rejection Sampling,
REINFORCE, Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO), Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO), Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), and Direct

simplified and explicit notation focused on LLMs, aiming to eliminate ambiguity
and provide a clear and intuitive understanding of the concepts. By minimizing
detours into the broader RL literature and connecting concepts to LLMs, we
eliminate superfluous abstractions and reduce cognitive overhead. Following
this exposition, we provide a literature review of new techniques and

Conclusion: VaccineRAG能够系统暴露当前LLM的固有弱点，并通过CoT分析和Partial-GRPO方法显著提升模型的样本判别能力和复杂序列学习能力。

Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation enhances the response accuracy of Large
Language Models (LLMs) by integrating retrieval and generation modules with
external knowledge, demonstrating particular strength in real-time queries and
Visual Question Answering tasks. However, the effectiveness of RAG is
frequently hindered by the precision of the retriever: many retrieved samples
fed into the generation phase are irrelevant or misleading, posing a critical
bottleneck to LLMs' performance. To address this challenge, we introduce
VaccineRAG, a novel Chain-of-Thought-based retrieval-augmented generation
dataset. On one hand, VaccineRAG employs a benchmark to evaluate models using
data with varying positive/negative sample ratios, systematically exposing
inherent weaknesses in current LLMs. On the other hand, it enhances models'
sample-discrimination capabilities by prompting LLMs to generate explicit
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) analysis for each sample before producing final answers.
Furthermore, to enhance the model's ability to learn long-sequence complex CoT
content, we propose Partial-GRPO. By modeling the outputs of LLMs as multiple
components rather than a single whole, our model can make more informed
preference selections for complex sequences, thereby enhancing its capacity to
learn complex CoT. Comprehensive evaluations and ablation studies on VaccineRAG
validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. The code and dataset will be
publicly released soon.

Motivation: 当前LLM基准测试主要关注性能指标，无法捕捉模型之间的细微行为差异，需要一种能够识别模型内在认知和交互风格的新评估方法。

Method: 使用精心设计的诊断提示套件和自动化评估流程，其中强大的LLM作为公正评判者，分析18个不同能力层级的模型。

Result: 发现核心能力（如抽象和因果推理）在顶级模型中趋于一致，但对齐相关行为（如奉承和语义鲁棒性）差异显著，并观察到跨模型的默认人格聚类（ISTJ/ESTJ）。

Conclusion: 模型的交互特性并非其规模或推理能力的涌现属性，而是特定且高度可变的开发者对齐策略的直接结果，该框架为揭示这些深层行为差异提供了可重复和可扩展的方法论。

Abstract: Current benchmarks for Large Language Models (LLMs) primarily focus on
performance metrics, often failing to capture the nuanced behavioral
characteristics that differentiate them. This paper introduces a novel
``Behavioral Fingerprinting'' framework designed to move beyond traditional
evaluation by creating a multi-faceted profile of a model's intrinsic cognitive
and interactive styles. Using a curated \textit{Diagnostic Prompt Suite} and an
innovative, automated evaluation pipeline where a powerful LLM acts as an
impartial judge, we analyze eighteen models across capability tiers. Our
results reveal a critical divergence in the LLM landscape: while core
capabilities like abstract and causal reasoning are converging among top
models, alignment-related behaviors such as sycophancy and semantic robustness
vary dramatically. We further document a cross-model default persona clustering
(ISTJ/ESTJ) that likely reflects common alignment incentives. Taken together,
this suggests that a model's interactive nature is not an emergent property of
its scale or reasoning power, but a direct consequence of specific, and highly
variable, developer alignment strategies. Our framework provides a reproducible
and scalable methodology for uncovering these deep behavioral differences.

Abstract: Silent Speech Interfaces (SSIs) have gained attention for their ability to
generate intelligible speech from non-acoustic signals. While significant
progress has been made in advancing speech generation pipelines, limited work
has addressed the recognition and downstream processing of synthesized speech,
which often suffers from phonetic ambiguity and noise. To overcome these
challenges, we propose an enhanced automatic speech recognition framework that
combines a transformer-based acoustic model with a large language model (LLM)
for post-processing. The transformer captures full utterance context, while the
LLM ensures linguistic consistency. Experimental results show a 16% relative
and 6% absolute reduction in word error rate (WER) over a 36% baseline,
demonstrating substantial improvements in intelligibility for silent speech
interfaces.

AppWorld environment using different sized language models.
  We find that difficulties with long-trajectory learning in smaller language
models (SLMs) limit their performance. Even when trained for specialized roles,
SLMs fail to learn all subtasks effectively. To address this issue, we
introduce a simple progressive sub-task training strategy, which introduces new
sub-tasks progressively in each training epoch. We find that this novel
strategy, analogous to instance level curriculum learning, consistently
improves the effectiveness of multi-agents at all configurations. Our Pareto
analysis shows that fine-tuned multi-agent systems yield better
effectiveness-efficiency trade-offs. Additional ablations and analyses shows
the importance of our progressive training strategy and its ability to reduce
subtask error rates.

TL;DR: 使用VR和AI来预测意大利和西班牙大学生的读写困难症，通过水平阈读测试和自責评估收集数据，机器学习模型分别达到87.5%和66.6%的准确率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索VR和AI技术在读写困难症识别中的应用潜力，通过对比读写困难和正常学生的行为数据，开发更有效的辅助评估工具

Method: 让参与者完成VR基于的阈读测试和自責评估，先进行t检验和Mann-Whitney检验统计分析，然后训练监督式机器学习模型进行分类

Result: 统计分析显示读写困难症学生在阈读完成时间上有显著差异，但准确性和自責水平无差异。ML模型在意大利组达到87.5%准确率，西班牙组66.6%，合并组75.0%

Conclusion: VR和ML可作为读写困难症评估的有效辅助工具，特别是通过捕捉任务完成速度差异，但语言特征因素可能影响分类准确性

Abstract: This study explores the use of virtual reality (VR) and artificial
intelligence (AI) to predict the presence of dyslexia in Italian and Spanish
university students. In particular, the research investigates whether
VR-derived data from Silent Reading (SR) tests and self-esteem assessments can
differentiate between students that are affected by dyslexia and students that
are not, employing machine learning (ML) algorithms. Participants completed
VR-based tasks measuring reading performance and self-esteem. A preliminary
statistical analysis (t tests and Mann Whitney tests) on these data was
performed, to compare the obtained scores between individuals with and without
dyslexia, revealing significant differences in completion time for the SR test,
but not in accuracy, nor in self esteem. Then, supervised ML models were
trained and tested, demonstrating an ability to classify the presence/absence
of dyslexia with an accuracy of 87.5 per cent for Italian, 66.6 per cent for
Spanish, and 75.0 per cent for the pooled group. These findings suggest that VR
and ML can effectively be used as supporting tools for assessing dyslexia,
particularly by capturing differences in task completion speed, but
language-specific factors may influence classification accuracy.

TL;DR: 论文研究了不同规模LLM在情感安全分类任务上的表现，发现大模型在零样本和复杂分类中表现更好，但小模型经过轻量微调后也能达到相近性能，适合隐私敏感的应用场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解LLM如何处理情感敏感内容对于构建安全可靠的系统至关重要，特别是在心理健康领域需要确保对话安全性。

Method: 构建了一个包含15K+样本的心理健康数据集，使用情感重解释提示进行增强，评估了4个不同规模的LLaMA模型在零样本、少样本和微调设置下的表现。

Result: 大模型在平均性能上更强，特别是在复杂的多标签分类和零样本设置中。但1B小模型经过轻量微调后，在多个高数据类别中达到了与大模型和BERT相当的性能，且推理时仅需<2GB显存。

Conclusion: 小型设备端模型可以作为隐私保护的可行替代方案，具备解释情感语境和维护安全对话边界的能力，对治疗性LLM应用和安全关键系统的可扩展对齐具有重要意义。

Abstract: Understanding how large language models (LLMs) process emotionally sensitive
content is critical for building safe and reliable systems, particularly in
mental health contexts. We investigate the scaling behavior of LLMs on two key
tasks: trinary classification of emotional safety (safe vs. unsafe vs.
borderline) and multi-label classification using a six-category safety risk
taxonomy. To support this, we construct a novel dataset by merging several
human-authored mental health datasets (> 15K samples) and augmenting them with
emotion re-interpretation prompts generated via ChatGPT. We evaluate four LLaMA
models (1B, 3B, 8B, 70B) across zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning settings.
Our results show that larger LLMs achieve stronger average performance,
particularly in nuanced multi-label classification and in zero-shot settings.
However, lightweight fine-tuning allowed the 1B model to achieve performance
comparable to larger models and BERT in several high-data categories, while
requiring <2GB VRAM at inference. These findings suggest that smaller,
on-device models can serve as viable, privacy-preserving alternatives for
sensitive applications, offering the ability to interpret emotional context and
maintain safe conversational boundaries. This work highlights key implications
for therapeutic LLM applications and the scalable alignment of safety-critical
systems.

Motivation: 语言模型在输出中传播社会偏见，特别是在性别和种族表征方面。本文旨在调查AI生成职业故事中的性别和种族偏见，并提出有效的缓解策略。

Method: 提出BAME（Bias Analysis and Mitigation through Explanation）方法，利用模型生成的解释来指导针对性提示工程，分析25个职业群体、3个大语言模型（Claude 3.5 Sonnet、Llama 3.1 70B Instruct和GPT-4 Turbo）以及多个人口统计维度生成的故事。

Result: 应用BAME后，人口统计代表性改善了2%-20%，识别出与训练数据刻板印象相关的过度代表和不足代表的持续模式。

Conclusion: 通过引导模型使用其内部推理机制可以显著增强人口统计平等性，有助于开发更透明的生成式AI系统。

Abstract: Language models have been shown to propagate social bias through their
output, particularly in the representation of gender and ethnicity. This paper
investigates gender and ethnicity biases in AI-generated occupational stories.
Representation biases are measured before and after applying our proposed
mitigation strategy, Bias Analysis and Mitigation through Explanation (BAME),
revealing improvements in demographic representation ranging from 2% to 20%.
BAME leverages model-generated explanations to inform targeted prompt
engineering, effectively reducing biases without modifying model parameters. By
analyzing stories generated across 25 occupational groups, three large language
models (Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Llama 3.1 70B Instruct, and GPT-4 Turbo), and
multiple demographic dimensions, we identify persistent patterns of
overrepresentation and underrepresentation linked to training data stereotypes.
Our findings demonstrate that guiding models with their own internal reasoning
mechanisms can significantly enhance demographic parity, thereby contributing
to the development of more transparent generative AI systems.

TL;DR: 这篇论文通过对比斯瓦希里语和英语BERT模型的性能，证明了语言不一致对多语言语言模型性能的负面影响，尽管使用高质量翻译，本土语言训练的模型仍然表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究多语言语言模型在不同语言上的性能平等性问题，考虑到英语在训练数据中的主导地位可能对非英语用户造成不利影响。

Method: 对比两个单语言BERT模型：一个全部在斯瓦希里语新闻数据上训练和测试，另一个在相似的英语数据上训练。将斯瓦希里语数据翻译成英语后用英语模型评估，模拟多语言模型的内部翻译过程。

Result: 本土斯瓦希里语训练的模型表现较优，错误率仅为0.36%，而翻译后用英语模型评估的错误率达到1.47%，相差近四倍。

Conclusion: 翻译不能完全消除语言间的表达差异，本土语言训练对于可靠结果仍然重要。应重点关注低代表性语言的数据集开发和多语言模型评估，减少AI部署对现有数字氛沟的加剧作用。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) expand multilingual capabilities, questions
remain about the equity of their performance across languages. While many
communities stand to benefit from AI systems, the dominance of English in
training data risks disadvantaging non-English speakers. To test the hypothesis
that such data disparities may affect model performance, this study compares
two monolingual BERT models: one trained and tested entirely on Swahili data,
and another on comparable English news data. To simulate how multilingual LLMs
process non-English queries through internal translation and abstraction, we
translated the Swahili news data into English and evaluated it using the
English-trained model. This approach tests the hypothesis by evaluating whether
translating Swahili inputs for evaluation on an English model yields better or
worse performance compared to training and testing a model entirely in Swahili,
thus isolating the effect of language consistency versus cross-lingual
abstraction. The results prove that, despite high-quality translation, the
native Swahili-trained model performed better than the Swahili-to-English
translated model, producing nearly four times fewer errors: 0.36% vs. 1.47%
respectively. This gap suggests that translation alone does not bridge
representational differences between languages and that models trained in one
language may struggle to accurately interpret translated inputs due to
imperfect internal knowledge representation, suggesting that native-language
training remains important for reliable outcomes. In educational and
informational contexts, even small performance gaps may compound inequality.
Future research should focus on addressing broader dataset development for
underrepresented languages and renewed attention to multilingual model
evaluation, ensuring the reinforcing effect of global AI deployment on existing
digital divides is reduced.

Abstract: Mesh implants are widely utilized in hernia repair surgeries, but
postoperative complications present a significant concern. This study analyzes
patient reports from the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience
(MAUDE) database spanning 2000 to 2021 to investigate the emotional aspects of
patients following mesh implantation using Natural Language Processing (NLP).
Employing the National Research Council Canada (NRC) Emotion Lexicon and
TextBlob for sentiment analysis, the research categorizes patient narratives
into eight emotions (anger, fear, anticipation, trust, surprise, sadness, joy,
and disgust) and assesses sentiment polarity. The goal is to discern patterns
in patient sentiment over time and to identify reports signaling urgent
concerns, referred to as "Concern Reports," thereby understanding shifts in
patient experiences in relation to changes in medical device regulation and
technological advancements in healthcare. The study detected an increase in
Concern Reports and higher emotional intensity during the periods of 2011-2012
and 2017-2018. Through temporal analysis of Concern Reports and overall
sentiment, this research provides valuable insights for healthcare
practitioners, enhancing their understanding of patient experiences
post-surgery, which is critical for improving preoperative counselling,
postoperative care, and preparing patients for mesh implant surgeries. The
study underscores the importance of emotional considerations in medical
practices and the potential for sentiment analysis to inform and enhance

Motivation: 大型语言模型在工具使用方面表现出色，但计算资源需求大。小语言模型虽然更紧凑高效，但在工具使用能力上明显不足，需要提升其实用性

Method: 采用强化学习方法，特别是Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)技术，对小语言模型进行优化训练

Result: 该方法显著提高了小语言模型的工具使用准确率，增强了其实用价值

Conclusion: GRPO强化学习方法为提升小语言模型的工具使用能力提供了高效有效的解决方案，相比传统微调方法更具适应性和计算效率

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have progressed beyond simple text creation, and
tool use has become increasingly important for complex, real-world tasks. Tool
use in LLMs refers to their ability to utilize external resources such as APIs,
databases, or software functions to extend their functionality beyond
generating text.Tools are used for tasks such as performing calculations,
making API calls to retrieve the current time and date, and more. This
capability enables models to fetch real-time data, execute commands, or solve
problems requiring dynamic interaction, making it indispensable for
applications like AI agents in virtual assistants, robotic control, or
automated workflows.
  However, while LLMs are usually adept tool use, their vast resource
requirements and computation complexity restrict their use in every use case.As
a result, there is an increasing need for more compact and efficient Small
Language Models (SLMs). Small language models (SLMs) struggle in tool use
compared to large language models (LLMs). As soon in Table 1. SLMs are
typically trained on smaller, more specific datasets, resulting in a narrower
knowledge base and limited contextual understanding compared to LLMs.
  This research addresses these challenges by using Reinforcement Learning
(RL), specifically Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), to enhance
tool-use proficiency in SLMs. Unlike conventional fine-tuning approaches that
require heavy computation and often lack adaptability, our method provides an
efficient, effective solution that significantly boosts SLM tool-use accuracy,
increasing their practical utility.

Method: 基于提示的层次结构化匹配预测BERT模型（HSMP-BERT），使用多标签分层分割的数据集（512份放射科医生标注的报告，包含6个胃肠道器官和15种病理的90个结构化标签）

Result: 在24个器官-发现组合上，HSMP-BERT达到平均F1分数0.83±0.08和κ系数0.65±0.17，显著优于基线模型；层次推理将运行时间减少5.1倍；发现了回肠壁增厚、狭窄和狭窄前扩张之间的关联

Conclusion: HSMP-BERT为放射学结构化提取提供了可扩展的解决方案，支持克罗恩病的群体水平分析，展示了AI在低资源环境中的潜力

Abstract: Extracting structured clinical information from radiology reports is
challenging, especially in low-resource languages. This is pronounced in
Crohn's disease, with sparsely represented multi-organ findings. We developed
Hierarchical Structured Matching Prediction BERT (HSMP-BERT), a prompt-based
model for extraction from Hebrew radiology text. In an administrative database
study, we analyzed 9,683 reports from Crohn's patients imaged 2010-2023 across
Israeli providers. A subset of 512 reports was radiologist-annotated for
findings across six gastrointestinal organs and 15 pathologies, yielding 90
structured labels per subject. Multilabel-stratified split (66%
train+validation; 33% test), preserving label prevalence. Performance was
evaluated with accuracy, F1, Cohen's $\kappa$, AUC, PPV, NPV, and recall. On 24
organ-finding combinations with $>$15 positives, HSMP-BERT achieved mean F1
0.83$\pm$0.08 and $\kappa$ 0.65$\pm$0.17, outperforming the SMP zero-shot
baseline (F1 0.49$\pm$0.07, $\kappa$ 0.06$\pm$0.07) and standard fine-tuning
(F1 0.30$\pm$0.27, $\kappa$ 0.27$\pm$0.34; paired t-test $p < 10^{-7}$).
Hierarchical inference cuts runtime 5.1$\times$ vs. traditional inference.
Applied to all reports, it revealed associations among ileal wall thickening,
stenosis, and pre-stenotic dilatation, plus age- and sex-specific trends in
inflammatory findings. HSMP-BERT offers a scalable solution for structured
extraction in radiology, enabling population-level analysis of Crohn's disease
and demonstrating AI's potential in low-resource settings.

Abstract: Colombia has been submerged in decades of armed conflict, yet until recently,
the systematic documentation of violence was not a priority for the Colombian
government. This has resulted in a lack of publicly available conflict
information and, consequently, a lack of historical accounts. This study
contributes to Colombia's historical memory by utilizing GPT, a large language
model (LLM), to read and answer questions about over 200,000 violence-related
newspaper articles in Spanish. We use the resulting dataset to conduct both
descriptive analysis and a study of the relationship between violence and the
eradication of coca crops, offering an example of policy analyses that such
data can support. Our study demonstrates how LLMs have opened new research
opportunities by enabling examinations of large text corpora at a previously
infeasible depth.

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in biomedical
natural language processing, yet their rapid growth in size and computational
requirements present a major barrier to adoption in healthcare settings where
data privacy precludes cloud deployment and resources are limited. In this
study, we systematically evaluated the impact of quantization on 12
state-of-the-art large language models, including both general-purpose and
biomedical-specific models, across eight benchmark datasets covering four key
tasks: named entity recognition, relation extraction, multi-label
classification, and question answering. We show that quantization substantially
reduces GPU memory requirements-by up to 75%-while preserving model performance
across diverse tasks, enabling the deployment of 70B-parameter models on 40GB
consumer-grade GPUs. In addition, domain-specific knowledge and responsiveness
to advanced prompting methods are largely maintained. These findings provide
significant practical and guiding value, highlighting quantization as a
practical and effective strategy for enabling the secure, local deployment of
large yet high-capacity language models in biomedical contexts, bridging the
gap between technical advances in AI and real-world clinical translation.

Abstract: Transformer-based language models excel in NLP tasks, but fine-grained
control remains challenging. This paper explores methods for manipulating
transformer models through principled interventions at three levels: prompts,
activations, and weights. We formalize controllable text generation as an
optimization problem addressable via prompt engineering, parameter-efficient
fine-tuning, model editing, and reinforcement learning. We introduce a unified
framework encompassing prompt-level steering, activation interventions, and
weight-space edits. We analyze robustness and safety implications, including
adversarial attacks and alignment mitigations. Theoretically, we show minimal
weight updates can achieve targeted behavior changes with limited side-effects.
Empirically, we demonstrate >90% success in sentiment control and factual edits
while preserving base performance, though generalization-specificity trade-offs
exist. We discuss ethical dual-use risks and the need for rigorous evaluation.
This work lays groundwork for designing controllable and robust language
models.

Abstract: Sarcasm, a common feature of human communication, poses challenges in
interpersonal interactions and human-machine interactions. Linguistic research
has highlighted the importance of prosodic cues, such as variations in pitch,
speaking rate, and intonation, in conveying sarcastic intent. Although previous
work has focused on text-based sarcasm detection, the role of speech data in
recognizing sarcasm has been underexplored. Recent advancements in speech
technology emphasize the growing importance of leveraging speech data for
automatic sarcasm recognition, which can enhance social interactions for
individuals with neurodegenerative conditions and improve machine understanding
of complex human language use, leading to more nuanced interactions. This
systematic review is the first to focus on speech-based sarcasm recognition,
charting the evolution from unimodal to multimodal approaches. It covers
datasets, feature extraction, and classification methods, and aims to bridge
gaps across diverse research domains. The findings include limitations in
datasets for sarcasm recognition in speech, the evolution of feature extraction
techniques from traditional acoustic features to deep learning-based
representations, and the progression of classification methods from unimodal
approaches to multimodal fusion techniques. In so doing, we identify the need
for greater emphasis on cross-cultural and multilingual sarcasm recognition, as
well as the importance of addressing sarcasm as a multimodal phenomenon, rather
than a text-based challenge.

<details>

Motivation: 多模态基础模型需要处理不断演变的多种模态，但从头训练不现实，且现有方法需要大量配对数据，低资源模态难以集成

Method: 设计超网络适配共享投影器，通过等距变换增加训练模态多样性，使用高资源模态训练，推理时用少量样本适配任意新模态

Result: SEMI在少样本集成新模态时显著提升效率，32-shot SEMI达到的精度需要从零训练64倍数据量才能实现

Conclusion: SEMI有望扩展基础模型的模态覆盖范围，为低资源模态集成提供高效解决方案

Abstract: Multimodal foundation models can process several modalities. However, since
the space of possible modalities is large and evolving over time, training a
model from scratch to encompass all modalities is unfeasible. Moreover,
integrating a modality into a pre-existing foundation model currently requires
a significant amount of paired data, which is often not available for
low-resource modalities. In this paper, we introduce a method for
sample-efficient modality integration (SEMI) into Large Language Models (LLMs).
To this end, we devise a hypernetwork that can adapt a shared projector --
placed between modality-specific encoders and an LLM -- to any modality. The
hypernetwork, trained on high-resource modalities (i.e., text, speech, audio,
video), is conditioned on a few samples from any arbitrary modality at
inference time to generate a suitable adapter. To increase the diversity of
training modalities, we artificially multiply the number of encoders through
isometric transformations. We find that SEMI achieves a significant boost in
sample efficiency during few-shot integration of new modalities (i.e.,
satellite images, astronomical images, inertial measurements, and molecules)
with encoders of arbitrary embedding dimensionality. For instance, to reach the
same accuracy as 32-shot SEMI, training the projector from scratch needs
64$\times$ more data. As a result, SEMI holds promise to extend the modality
coverage of foundation models.

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has introduced critical
security challenges, where adversarial actors can manipulate input prompts to
cause significant harm and circumvent safety alignments. These prompt-based
attacks exploit vulnerabilities in a model's design, training, and contextual
understanding, leading to intellectual property theft, misinformation
generation, and erosion of user trust. A systematic understanding of these
attack vectors is the foundational step toward developing robust
countermeasures. This paper presents a comprehensive literature survey of
prompt-based attack methodologies, categorizing them to provide a clear threat
model. By detailing the mechanisms and impacts of these exploits, this survey
aims to inform the research community's efforts in building the next generation
of secure LLMs that are inherently resistant to unauthorized distillation,
fine-tuning, and editing.

Abstract: Twitter and other social media platforms have become vital sources of real
time information during disasters and public safety emergencies. Automatically
classifying disaster related tweets can help emergency services respond faster
and more effectively. Traditional Machine Learning (ML) models such as Logistic
Regression, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machines have been widely used for
this task, but they often fail to understand the context or deeper meaning of
words, especially when the language is informal, metaphorical, or ambiguous. We
posit that, in this context, transformer based models can perform better than
traditional ML models. In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of
transformer based models, including BERT, DistilBERT, RoBERTa, and DeBERTa, for
classifying disaster related tweets. These models are compared with traditional
ML approaches to highlight the performance gap. Experimental results show that
BERT achieved the highest accuracy (91%), significantly outperforming
traditional models like Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes (both at 82%). The
use of contextual embeddings and attention mechanisms allows transformer models
to better understand subtle language in tweets, where traditional ML models
fall short. This research demonstrates that transformer architectures are far
more suitable for public safety applications, offering improved accuracy,
deeper language understanding, and better generalization across real world
social media text.

Method: 探索两种语音学引入偏法：参数解耦（结构偏置）和半监督语音学正则化技术，通过向量量化自动编码器进行定量分析

Result: 提出模型学习的表征在未见手势的一次重构和手语识别任务上都比对照基线更有效，表现出更好的判别性

Conclusion: 明确的、语言学动机的偏置能够有效提高手语表征学习的绝套性能力，为手语识别模型的普遍化提供了量化分析支撑

Abstract: Sign language datasets are often not representative in terms of vocabulary,
underscoring the need for models that generalize to unseen signs. Vector
quantization is a promising approach for learning discrete, token-like
representations, but it has not been evaluated whether the learned units
capture spurious correlations that hinder out-of-vocabulary performance. This
work investigates two phonological inductive biases: Parameter Disentanglement,
an architectural bias, and Phonological Semi-Supervision, a regularization
technique, to improve isolated sign recognition of known signs and
reconstruction quality of unseen signs with a vector-quantized autoencoder. The
primary finding is that the learned representations from the proposed model are
more effective for one-shot reconstruction of unseen signs and more
discriminative for sign identification compared to a controlled baseline. This
work provides a quantitative analysis of how explicit, linguistically-motivated
biases can improve the generalization of learned representations of sign
language.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于dropout容忍度的推理时OOD检测方法，使用ICAD框架和有效的集成策略，在医疗专用LLM上显著优于基线方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管专用LLM在领域内任务上表现优异，但在面对OOD输入时容易产生不可靠输出，在关键应用中存在风险

Method: 利用ICAD框架，基于模型dropout容忍度设计新的非一致性度量，通过有效集成策略聚合多层信息

Result: 在医疗专用LLM上，AUROC相比基线方法提升2%到37%，能更好地检测OOD输入

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了专用LLM的OOD检测能力，同时保持了理论上的误报率界限

Abstract: We propose a novel inference-time out-of-domain (OOD) detection algorithm for
specialized large language models (LLMs). Despite achieving state-of-the-art
performance on in-domain tasks through fine-tuning, specialized LLMs remain
vulnerable to incorrect or unreliable outputs when presented with OOD inputs,
posing risks in critical applications. Our method leverages the Inductive
Conformal Anomaly Detection (ICAD) framework, using a new non-conformity
measure based on the model's dropout tolerance. Motivated by recent findings on
polysemanticity and redundancy in LLMs, we hypothesize that in-domain inputs
exhibit higher dropout tolerance than OOD inputs. We aggregate dropout
tolerance across multiple layers via a valid ensemble approach, improving
detection while maintaining theoretical false alarm bounds from ICAD.
Experiments with medical-specialized LLMs show that our approach detects OOD
inputs better than baseline methods, with AUROC improvements of $2\%$ to $37\%$
when treating OOD datapoints as positives and in-domain test datapoints as
negatives.

Method: 开发包含12个细粒度幻觉指标的评估框架，在生成式问答和摘要两个任务上评估4个阿拉伯语预训练模型、4个多语言模型和4个推理模型

Result: 事实幻觉比忠实性错误更普遍，阿拉伯语预训练模型Allam表现最佳，幻觉率低于多语言模型，与推理模型相当

Conclusion: 阿拉伯语特定模型在减少幻觉方面表现更好，需要更多针对阿拉伯语的LLM幻觉研究

Abstract: Recently, extensive research on the hallucination of the large language
models (LLMs) has mainly focused on the English language. Despite the growing
number of multilingual and Arabic-specific LLMs, evaluating LLMs' hallucination
in the Arabic context remains relatively underexplored. The knowledge gap is
particularly pressing given Arabic's widespread use across many regions and its
importance in global communication and media. This paper presents the first
comprehensive hallucination evaluation of Arabic and multilingual LLMs on two
critical Arabic natural language generation tasks: generative question
answering (GQA) and summarization. This study evaluates a total of 12 LLMs,
including 4 Arabic pre-trained models, 4 multilingual models, and 4
reasoning-based models. To assess the factual consistency and faithfulness of
LLMs' outputs, we developed a fine-grained hallucination evaluation framework
consisting of 12 fine-grained hallucination indicators that represent the
varying characteristics of each task. The results reveal that factual
hallucinations are more prevalent than faithfulness errors across all models
and tasks. Notably, the Arabic pre-trained model Allam consistently
demonstrates lower hallucination rates than multilingual models and a
comparative performance with reasoning-based models. The code is available at:

Abstract: In-Image Machine Translation (IIMT) aims to translate images containing texts
from one language to another. Current research of end-to-end IIMT mainly
conducts on synthetic data, with simple background, single font, fixed text
position, and bilingual translation, which can not fully reflect real world,
causing a significant gap between the research and practical conditions. To
facilitate research of IIMT in real-world scenarios, we explore Practical
In-Image Multilingual Machine Translation (IIMMT). In order to convince the
lack of publicly available data, we annotate the PRIM dataset, which contains
real-world captured one-line text images with complex background, various
fonts, diverse text positions, and supports multilingual translation
directions. We propose an end-to-end model VisTrans to handle the challenge of
practical conditions in PRIM, which processes visual text and background
information in the image separately, ensuring the capability of multilingual
translation while improving the visual quality. Experimental results indicate
the VisTrans achieves a better translation quality and visual effect compared
to other models. The code and dataset are available at:

*Adam Tauman Kalai,Ofir Nachum,Santosh S. Vempala,Edwin Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 语言模型产生幻觉是因为训练和评估过程奖励猜测而非承认不确定性，这源于二元分类错误和测试评分机制的问题，需要通过修改基准评分来缓解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型在面对不确定问题时倾向于猜测而非承认无知，产生看似合理但错误的陈述（幻觉），这种现象即使在最先进的系统中仍然存在，严重影响了用户信任。

Method: 通过分析现代训练流程中的统计原因，指出幻觉源于二元分类错误；论证幻觉持续存在是因为大多数评估方式奖励猜测行为，模型被优化为优秀的应试者。

Result: 研究发现幻觉并非神秘现象，而是自然统计压力下的产物；当前评估基准的评分机制与可信AI目标存在错位。

Conclusion: 需要通过社会技术缓解措施来修改现有基准的评分方式，而不是引入额外的幻觉评估，这样才能引导领域发展出更可信的AI系统。

Abstract: Like students facing hard exam questions, large language models sometimes
guess when uncertain, producing plausible yet incorrect statements instead of
admitting uncertainty. Such "hallucinations" persist even in state-of-the-art
systems and undermine trust. We argue that language models hallucinate because
the training and evaluation procedures reward guessing over acknowledging
uncertainty, and we analyze the statistical causes of hallucinations in the
modern training pipeline. Hallucinations need not be mysterious -- they
originate simply as errors in binary classification. If incorrect statements
cannot be distinguished from facts, then hallucinations in pretrained language
models will arise through natural statistical pressures. We then argue that
hallucinations persist due to the way most evaluations are graded -- language
models are optimized to be good test-takers, and guessing when uncertain
improves test performance. This "epidemic" of penalizing uncertain responses
can only be addressed through a socio-technical mitigation: modifying the
scoring of existing benchmarks that are misaligned but dominate leaderboards,
rather than introducing additional hallucination evaluations. This change may
steer the field toward more trustworthy AI systems.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) are foundational to many AI applications, but
maintaining their freshness and completeness remains costly. We present ODKE+,
a production-grade system that automatically extracts and ingests millions of
open-domain facts from web sources with high precision. ODKE+ combines modular
components into a scalable pipeline: (1) the Extraction Initiator detects
missing or stale facts, (2) the Evidence Retriever collects supporting
documents, (3) hybrid Knowledge Extractors apply both pattern-based rules and
ontology-guided prompting for large language models (LLMs), (4) a lightweight
Grounder validates extracted facts using a second LLM, and (5) the Corroborator
ranks and normalizes candidate facts for ingestion. ODKE+ dynamically generates
ontology snippets tailored to each entity type to align extractions with schema
constraints, enabling scalable, type-consistent fact extraction across 195
predicates. The system supports batch and streaming modes, processing over 9
million Wikipedia pages and ingesting 19 million high-confidence facts with
98.8% precision. ODKE+ significantly improves coverage over traditional
methods, achieving up to 48% overlap with third-party KGs and reducing update
lag by 50 days on average. Our deployment demonstrates that LLM-based
extraction, grounded in ontological structure and verification workflows, can
deliver trustworthiness, production-scale knowledge ingestion with broad
real-world applicability. A recording of the system demonstration is included

Motivation: 传统知识图谱问答方法依赖语义解析，检索严格必要的知识，但由于模式要求严格和语义模糊性，往往覆盖率较低。需要一种能够检索更广泛相关信息的方法来提升问答效果。

Method: 提出KERAG管道，采用检索-过滤-摘要方法：首先检索可能包含相关信息的大量子图，然后过滤噪声，最后使用微调的LLM在知识子图上进行思维链推理来生成答案。

Result: 实验表明KERAG在质量上超越最先进解决方案约7%，并且超过GPT-4o（工具）10-21%的性能。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates hallucination in Large
Language Models (LLMs) by incorporating external data, with Knowledge Graphs
(KGs) offering crucial information for question answering. Traditional
Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) methods rely on semantic parsing,
which typically retrieves knowledge strictly necessary for answer generation,
thus often suffer from low coverage due to rigid schema requirements and
semantic ambiguity. We present KERAG, a novel KG-based RAG pipeline that
enhances QA coverage by retrieving a broader subgraph likely to contain
relevant information. Our retrieval-filtering-summarization approach, combined
with fine-tuned LLMs for Chain-of-Thought reasoning on knowledge sub-graphs,
reduces noises and improves QA for both simple and complex questions.
Experiments demonstrate that KERAG surpasses state-of-the-art solutions by
about 7% in quality and exceeds GPT-4o (Tool) by 10-21%.

Abstract: Natural language processing (NLP) is a key technology to extract important
patient information from clinical narratives to support healthcare
applications. The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has
revolutionized many NLP tasks in the clinical domain, yet their optimal use in
patient information extraction tasks requires further exploration. This study
examines LLMs' effectiveness in patient information extraction, focusing on LLM
architectures, fine-tuning strategies, and multi-task instruction tuning
techniques for developing robust and generalizable patient information
extraction systems. This study aims to explore key concepts of using LLMs for
clinical concept and relation extraction tasks, including: (1) encoder-only or
decoder-only LLMs, (2) prompt-based parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)
algorithms, and (3) multi-task instruction tuning on few-shot learning
performance. We benchmarked a suite of LLMs, including encoder-based LLMs
(BERT, GatorTron) and decoder-based LLMs (GatorTronGPT, Llama 3.1,
GatorTronLlama), across five datasets. We compared traditional full-size
fine-tuning and prompt-based PEFT. We explored a multi-task instruction tuning
framework that combines both tasks across four datasets to evaluate the
zero-shot and few-shot learning performance using the leave-one-dataset-out
strategy.

Abstract: Accurately answering complex questions has consistently been a significant
challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs). To address this, this paper
proposes a multi-hop question decomposition method for complex questions,
building upon research within the MQUAKE framework. Utilizing the LLAMA3 model,
we systematically investigate the impact of multi-hop question decomposition
within knowledge graphs on model comprehension and reasoning accuracy, both
before and after model training. In our experiments, we systematically
partitioned and converted the MQUAKE-T dataset into two distinct formats: a
single-hop dataset designed for directly answering complex questions, and a
multi-hop dataset constructed using the multi-hop question decomposition
method. We then fine-tuned the LLAMA3 model on these datasets and conducted
inference tests. Our results demonstrate that, without fine-tuning the LLM, the
prediction performance based on the multi-hop question decomposition method
significantly outperforms the method of directly answering complex questions.
After fine-tuning using the LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) method, the performance
of both approaches improved compared to the untrained baseline. Crucially, the
method utilizing multi-hop decomposition consistently maintained its
superiority. These findings validate the effectiveness of the multi-hop
decomposition method both before and after training, demonstrating its
capability to effectively enhance the LLM's ability to answer complex
questions.

Abstract: From the dawn of the computer, Allen Turing dreamed of a robot that could
communicate using language as a human being. The recent advances in the field
of Large Language Models (LLMs) shocked the scientific community when a single
model can apply for various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, while the
output results are sometimes even better than most human communication skills.
Models such as GPT, Claude, Grok, etc. have left their mark on the scientific
community. However, it is unclear how much these models understand what they
produce, especially in a nuanced theme such as humor. The question of whether
computers understand humor is still open (among the decoders, the latest to be
checked was GPT-2). We addressed this issue in this paper; we have showed that
a fine-tuned decoder (GPT-4o) performed (Mean F1-macro score of 0.85) as well
as the best fine-tuned encoder (RoBERTa with a Mean of F1-score 0.86)

Motivation: 现有的监督微调和强化学习方法虽然能提升模型性能，但会降低输出多样性，导致响应过于狭窄和规范化

Method: 基于行列式点过程(DPPs)，对每个提示采样并嵌入一组响应，使用基于核的相似性矩阵的行列式来测量嵌入响应的体积跨度，从而衡量语义多样性

Result: 在指令跟随、摘要、故事生成和推理任务上的实验表明，该方法在不牺牲模型质量的情况下显著提高了语义多样性

Conclusion: DQO方法有效解决了LLM后训练中多样性降低的问题，通过语义层面的多样性优化实现了更好的输出效果

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning are two popular methods for
post-training large language models (LLMs). While improving the model's
performance on downstream tasks, they often reduce the model's output
diversity, leading to narrow, canonical responses. Existing methods to enhance
diversity are limited, either by operating at inference time or by focusing on
lexical differences. We propose a novel training method named DQO based on
determinantal point processes (DPPs) to jointly optimize LLMs for quality and
semantic diversity. Our approach samples and embeds a group of responses for
each prompt, then uses the determinant of a kernel-based similarity matrix to
measure diversity as the volume spanned by the embeddings of these responses.
Experiments across instruction-following, summarization, story generation, and
reasoning tasks demonstrate that our method substantially improves semantic
diversity without sacrificing model quality.

Abstract: Personality manipulation in large language models (LLMs) is increasingly
applied in customer service and agentic scenarios, yet its mechanisms and
trade-offs remain unclear. We present a systematic study of personality control
using the Big Five traits, comparing in-context learning (ICL),
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), and mechanistic steering (MS). Our
contributions are fourfold. First, we construct a contrastive dataset with
balanced high/low trait responses, enabling effective steering vector
computation and fair cross-method evaluation. Second, we introduce a unified
evaluation framework based on within-run $\Delta$ analysis that disentangles,
reasoning capability, agent performance, and demographic bias across MMLU,
GAIA, and BBQ benchmarks. Third, we develop trait purification techniques to
separate openness from conscientiousness, addressing representational overlap
in trait encoding. Fourth, we propose a three-level stability framework that
quantifies method-, trait-, and combination-level robustness, offering
practical guidance under deployment constraints. Experiments on Gemma-2-2B-IT
and LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct reveal clear trade-offs: ICL achieves strong alignment
with minimal capability loss, PEFT delivers the highest alignment at the cost
of degraded task performance, and MS provides lightweight runtime control with
competitive effectiveness. Trait-level analysis shows openness as uniquely
challenging, agreeableness as most resistant to ICL, and personality encoding
consolidating around intermediate layers. Taken together, these results
establish personality manipulation as a multi-level probe into behavioral
representation, linking surface conditioning, parameter encoding, and
activation-level steering, and positioning mechanistic steering as a
lightweight alternative to fine-tuning for both deployment and
interpretability.

TL;DR: 论文研究了语言模型在递归合成数据训练中出现的知识崩溃现象，区别于传统模型崩溃，表现为事实准确性下降但表面流畅性保持，导致"自信错误"输出。通过实验发现崩溃轨迹受指令格式影响，并提出领域特定合成训练作为缓解策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于人类编写内容稀缺，大语言模型越来越依赖合成数据，但递归训练模型生成的输出会导致模型崩溃，威胁事实可靠性。需要研究这种退化过程及其在准确性关键领域的影响。

Method: 通过控制实验进行递归合成训练，分析不同指令格式对崩溃轨迹的影响，提出领域特定合成训练策略，并开发结合模型中心指标和任务中心指标的评估框架来检测退化阶段。

Result: 研究发现崩溃轨迹和时间关键取决于指令格式，区分了指令跟随崩溃与传统模型崩溃的条件性、提示依赖性特征。领域特定合成训练显著提高了抗崩溃能力，同时保持计算效率。

Conclusion: 研究提供了对崩溃动态的理论见解，并为知识密集型应用中可持续AI训练提供了实用指导，特别是在准确性至关重要的领域。

Abstract: Large language models increasingly rely on synthetic data due to
human-written content scarcity, yet recursive training on model-generated
outputs leads to model collapse, a degenerative process threatening factual
reliability. We define knowledge collapse as a distinct three-stage phenomenon
where factual accuracy deteriorates while surface fluency persists, creating
"confidently wrong" outputs that pose critical risks in accuracy-dependent
domains. Through controlled experiments with recursive synthetic training, we
demonstrate that collapse trajectory and timing depend critically on
instruction format, distinguishing instruction-following collapse from
traditional model collapse through its conditional, prompt-dependent nature. We
propose domain-specific synthetic training as a targeted mitigation strategy
that achieves substantial improvements in collapse resistance while maintaining
computational efficiency. Our evaluation framework combines model-centric
indicators with task-centric metrics to detect distinct degradation phases,
enabling reproducible assessment of epistemic deterioration across different
language models. These findings provide both theoretical insights into collapse
dynamics and practical guidance for sustainable AI training in
knowledge-intensive applications where accuracy is paramount.

*Ilham Wicaksono,Zekun Wu,Theo King,Adriano Koshiyama,Philip Treleaven*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AgentSeer是一个基于可观测性的评估框架，用于系统评估AI代理在部署环境中的安全风险，揭示了模型级评估无法发现的代理特有漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型向代理系统过渡，现有安全评估框架在评估部署特定风险方面存在关键差距，需要新的评估范式来识别代理情境中的特有漏洞。

Method: 通过将代理执行分解为细粒度的动作和组件图，使用HarmBench单轮和迭代精化攻击对GPT-OSS-20B和Gemini-2.0-flash进行跨模型验证。

Result: 发现代理特有漏洞（工具调用攻击成功率提高24-60%），揭示了跨模型的通用代理模式、语义漏洞机制、上下文依赖的攻击有效性，以及模型特定的安全配置文件。

Conclusion: 研究证实了系统性的评估差距，确立了代理情境评估范式的迫切需求，AgentSeer提供了标准化方法和实证验证。

Abstract: As large language models transition to agentic systems, current safety
evaluation frameworks face critical gaps in assessing deployment-specific
risks. We introduce AgentSeer, an observability-based evaluation framework that
decomposes agentic executions into granular action and component graphs,
enabling systematic agentic-situational assessment. Through cross-model
validation on GPT-OSS-20B and Gemini-2.0-flash using HarmBench single turn and
iterative refinement attacks, we demonstrate fundamental differences between
model-level and agentic-level vulnerability profiles. Model-level evaluation
reveals baseline differences: GPT-OSS-20B (39.47% ASR) versus Gemini-2.0-flash
(50.00% ASR), with both models showing susceptibility to social engineering
while maintaining logic-based attack resistance. However, agentic-level
assessment exposes agent-specific risks invisible to traditional evaluation. We
discover "agentic-only" vulnerabilities that emerge exclusively in agentic
contexts, with tool-calling showing 24-60% higher ASR across both models.
Cross-model analysis reveals universal agentic patterns, agent transfer
operations as highest-risk tools, semantic rather than syntactic vulnerability
mechanisms, and context-dependent attack effectiveness, alongside
model-specific security profiles in absolute ASR levels and optimal injection
strategies. Direct attack transfer from model-level to agentic contexts shows
degraded performance (GPT-OSS-20B: 57% human injection ASR; Gemini-2.0-flash:
28%), while context-aware iterative attacks successfully compromise objectives
that failed at model-level, confirming systematic evaluation gaps. These
findings establish the urgent need for agentic-situation evaluation paradigms,
with AgentSeer providing the standardized methodology and empirical validation.

*Alexandre Nikolaev,Yu-Ying Chuang,R. Harald Baayen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究探讨判别词典模型(DLM)是否能在不建立屈折类别的情况下理解和生成芬兰语屈折名词，结果显示模型在训练数据上表现优异，测试数据准确率可接受，但对非生产性类别的处理较差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究屈折类别是否具有认知现实性，即母语者是否需要发现这些类别才能正确屈折名词，以及DLM模型能否在不建立屈折类别的情况下处理芬兰语名词屈折。

Method: 使用包含55,271个屈折名词的数据集(来自49个屈折类别的2000个高频芬兰语名词)，建立多个DLM理解和生成模型，包括不考虑使用频率的无限暴露学习和考虑词频的使用频率学习两种方法。

Result: 模型在训练数据上准确率很高，测试数据准确率有所下降但仍可接受。模型对类型更多、低频词更多、hapax legomena更多的生产性屈折类别表现更好，但对非生产性类别的处理较差。在使用频率模型中，频率是性能的主要预测因素。

Conclusion: DLM模型可以在不明确建立屈折类别的情况下学习芬兰语名词屈折，但对生产性和非生产性类别的处理存在差异，频率在使用频率学习中起主导作用。

Abstract: Descriptions of complex nominal or verbal systems make use of inflectional
classes. Inflectional classes bring together nouns which have similar stem
changes and use similar exponents in their paradigms. Although inflectional
classes can be very useful for language teaching as well as for setting up
finite state morphological systems, it is unclear whether inflectional classes
are cognitively real, in the sense that native speakers would need to discover
these classes in order to learn how to properly inflect the nouns of their
language. This study investigates whether the Discriminative Lexicon Model
(DLM) can understand and produce Finnish inflected nouns without setting up
inflectional classes, using a dataset with 55,271 inflected nouns of 2000
high-frequency Finnish nouns from 49 inflectional classes. Several DLM
comprehension and production models were set up. Some models were not informed
about frequency of use, and provide insight into learnability with infinite
exposure (endstate learning). Other models were set up from a usage based
perspective, and were trained with token frequencies being taken into
consideration (frequency-informed learning). On training data, models performed
with very high accuracies. For held-out test data, accuracies decreased, as
expected, but remained acceptable. Across most models, performance increased
for inflectional classes with more types, more lower-frequency words, and more
hapax legomena, mirroring the productivity of the inflectional classes. The
model struggles more with novel forms of unproductive and less productive
classes, and performs far better for unseen forms belonging to productive
classes. However, for usage-based production models, frequency was the dominant
predictor of model performance, and correlations with measures of productivity
were tenuous or absent.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语音语义理解（SLU）系统面临的标签数据稀缺和大语言模型部署计算负担较大的挑战

Method: 提出适应性特征蓄纳框架，使用踢余投影神经网络（RPNN）的动态适配器对准异构特征空间，通过动态蓄纳系数（DDC）根据意图和槽位预测性能进行自适应调节

Result: 在中文ProSLU基准测试中达到最佳性能：意图准确率95.67%，槽位F1分数92.02%，总体准确率85.50%

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了SLU系统的数据稀缺和计算资源问题，为实际应用提供了高效的轻量化解决方案

Abstract: Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) is a core component of conversational
systems, enabling machines to interpret user utterances. Despite its
importance, developing effective SLU systems remains challenging due to the
scarcity of labeled training data and the computational burden of deploying
Large Language Models (LLMs) in real-world applications. To further alleviate
these issues, we propose an Adaptive Feature Distillation framework that
transfers rich semantic representations from a General Text Embeddings
(GTE)-based teacher model to a lightweight student model. Our method introduces
a dynamic adapter equipped with a Residual Projection Neural Network (RPNN) to
align heterogeneous feature spaces, and a Dynamic Distillation Coefficient
(DDC) that adaptively modulates the distillation strength based on real-time
feedback from intent and slot prediction performance. Experiments on the
Chinese profile-based ProSLU benchmark demonstrate that AFD-SLU achieves
state-of-the-art results, with 95.67% intent accuracy, 92.02% slot F1 score,
and 85.50% overall accuracy.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个双视角评估框架来测试大语言模型的场景认知能力，发现当前模型主要依赖表层记忆而非深层语义理解


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大语言模型的泛化能力是来自训练数据的简单记忆还是真正的深层语义理解

Method: 构建基于虚构事实的多样化文本数据集，通过回答场景相关问题和探测内部表示来评估模型对场景元素-论元关联的编码能力

Result: 实验显示当前LLMs主要依赖表层记忆，即使在简单案例中也无法实现稳健的语义场景认知

Conclusion: 研究结果揭示了LLMs在语义理解方面的关键局限性，为提升其认知能力提供了重要见解

Abstract: Driven by vast and diverse textual data, large language models (LLMs) have
demonstrated impressive performance across numerous natural language processing
(NLP) tasks. Yet, a critical question persists: does their generalization arise
from mere memorization of training data or from deep semantic understanding? To
investigate this, we propose a bi-perspective evaluation framework to assess
LLMs' scenario cognition - the ability to link semantic scenario elements with
their arguments in context. Specifically, we introduce a novel scenario-based
dataset comprising diverse textual descriptions of fictional facts, annotated
with scenario elements. LLMs are evaluated through their capacity to answer
scenario-related questions (model output perspective) and via probing their
internal representations for encoded scenario elements-argument associations
(internal representation perspective). Our experiments reveal that current LLMs
predominantly rely on superficial memorization, failing to achieve robust
semantic scenario cognition, even in simple cases. These findings expose
critical limitations in LLMs' semantic understanding and offer cognitive
insights for advancing their capabilities.

TL;DR: 使用多步骤流水线结合临床字典和GPT-4.1的上下文学习，自动为不同语言的临床文本分配ICD-10病理编码


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动化ICD-10编码可以简化医疗专业人员的工作，确保医院编码的一致性，提高疗程记录统计和保险申报的效率

Method: 多步骤流水线：先使用临床字典匹配明确的术语，然后对未匹配项使用GPT-4.1进行上下文学习预测ICD-10编码

Result: 在西班牙语CodiEsp数据集上获得0.89类别F1分数和0.78子类别F1分数，在希腊语ElCardioCC数据集上获得0.85 F1分数

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效地为多语言临床文本自动分配ICD-10编码，为医疗信息结构化提供了可靠的解决方案

Abstract: The linking of clinical entities is a crucial part of extracting structured
information from clinical texts. It is the process of assigning a code from a
medical ontology or classification to a phrase in the text. The International
Classification of Diseases - 10th revision (ICD-10) is an international
standard for classifying diseases for statistical and insurance purposes.
Automatically assigning the correct ICD-10 code to terms in discharge summaries
will simplify the work of healthcare professionals and ensure consistent coding
in hospitals. Our paper proposes an approach for linking clinical terms to
ICD-10 codes in different languages using Large Language Models (LLMs). The
approach consists of a multistage pipeline that uses clinical dictionaries to
match unambiguous terms in the text and then applies in-context learning with
GPT-4.1 to predict the ICD-10 code for the terms that do not match the
dictionary. Our system shows promising results in predicting ICD-10 codes on
different benchmark datasets in Spanish - 0.89 F1 for categories and 0.78 F1 on
subcategories on CodiEsp, and Greek - 0.85 F1 on ElCardioCC.

TL;DR: L1RA是一种新颖的低秩适配器优化技术，通过L1正则化动态分配LoRA微调中的秩预算，在保持性能的同时减少计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型微调的计算需求过高，特别是在资源有限的情况下，需要更高效的适配方法。

Method: 使用L1正则化修剪冗余秩并重新分配秩预算，优化LoRA适配器的资源利用率。

Result: L1RA在计算开销与其他LoRA变体相当或更低的情况下，实现了相同或更好的性能，并发现前馈层和注意力输出投影层需要最多适配。

Conclusion: L1RA是提升LLM微调效率和可解释性的有前景技术，特别适用于计算资源受限的场景。

Abstract: The ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to solve complex tasks has made
them crucial in the development of AI-based applications. However, the high
computational requirements to fine-tune these LLMs on downstream tasks pose
significant challenges, particularly when resources are limited. In response to
this challenge, we introduce L1RA, a novel technique aimed at dynamically
distributing the rank of low-rank adapters during fine-tuning using LoRA. Given
a rank budget (i.e., total sum of adapters rank), L1RA leverages L1
regularisation to prune redundant ranks and redistribute them across adapters,
thereby optimising resource utilisation. Through a series of comprehensive
experiments, we empirically demonstrate that L1RA maintains comparable or even
reduced computational overhead compared to other LoRA variants, including the
vanilla approach, while achieving same or better performances. Moreover, the
post-training analysis of rank distribution unveiled insights into the specific
model components requiring the most adaptation to align with the task
objective: the feed-forward layers and the attention output projection. These
results highlight the efficacy of L1RA in not only enhancing the efficiency of
LLM fine-tuning, but also in providing valuable diagnostic information for
model refinement and customisation. In conclusion, L1RA stands as a promising
technique for advancing the performance and interpretability of LLM adaptation,
particularly in scenarios where computational resources are constrained.

Abstract: In this report, we introduce PLaMo 2, a series of Japanese-focused large
language models featuring a hybrid Samba-based architecture that transitions to
full attention via continual pre-training to support 32K token contexts.
Training leverages extensive synthetic corpora to overcome data scarcity, while
computational efficiency is achieved through weight reuse and structured
pruning. This efficient pruning methodology produces an 8B model that achieves
performance comparable to our previous 100B model. Post-training further
refines the models using a pipeline of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and direct
preference optimization (DPO), enhanced by synthetic Japanese instruction data
and model merging techniques. Optimized for inference using vLLM and
quantization with minimal accuracy loss, the PLaMo 2 models achieve
state-of-the-art results on Japanese benchmarks, outperforming similarly-sized
open models in instruction-following, language fluency, and Japanese-specific
knowledge.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法对高质量长文本响应数据的过度依赖，以及粗粒度质量优化维度无法满足多样化长文本生成场景需求的问题

Method: ACE-RL框架：1) 自动解构指令为细粒度自适应约束标准；2) 设计基于约束满足度的奖励机制；3) 使用强化学习优化模型

Result: 在WritingBench基准上分别超越SFT和RL基线20.70%和7.32%，最佳模型甚至超越GPT-4o达7.10%

Conclusion: ACE-RL为LLMs提供了更有效的训练范式，能够在多样化长文本生成场景中生成高质量内容

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in
long-context understanding, yet they face significant challenges in
high-quality long-form generation. Existing studies primarily suffer from two
limitations: (1) A heavy reliance on scarce, high-quality long-form response
data for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or for pairwise preference reward in
reinforcement learning (RL). (2) Focus on coarse-grained quality optimization
dimensions, such as relevance, coherence, and helpfulness, overlooking the
fine-grained specifics inherent to diverse long-form generation scenarios. To
address this issue, we propose a framework using Adaptive Constraint-Enhanced
reward for long-form generation Reinforcement Learning (ACE-RL). ACE-RL first
automatically deconstructs each instruction into a set of fine-grained,
adaptive constraint criteria by identifying its underlying intents and demands.
Subsequently, we design a reward mechanism that quantifies the quality of
long-form responses based on their satisfaction over corresponding constraints,
converting subjective quality evaluation into constraint verification. Finally,
we utilize reinforcement learning to guide models toward superior long-form
generation capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that our ACE-RL
framework significantly outperforms existing SFT and RL baselines by 20.70% and
7.32% on WritingBench, and our top-performing model even surpasses proprietary
systems like GPT-4o by 7.10%, providing a more effective training paradigm for
LLMs to generate high-quality content across diverse long-form generation
scenarios.

Method: 设计ToM-SSI基准，包含多模态输入和最多4个智能体的群体互动，在情境化环境中进行交流和移动，支持混合合作-阻碍设置和并行多智能体心智状态推理

Result: 评估显示当前模型在这些新任务中表现严重受限，特别是在复杂社交认知方面存在明显差距

Conclusion: ToM-SSI基准填补了现有心智理论评估的空白，揭示了模型在复杂社交推理方面的不足，为未来研究指明了关键方向

Abstract: Most existing Theory of Mind (ToM) benchmarks for foundation models rely on
variations of the Sally-Anne test, offering only a very limited perspective on
ToM and neglecting the complexity of human social interactions. To address this
gap, we propose ToM-SSI: a new benchmark specifically designed to test ToM
capabilities in environments rich with social interactions and spatial
dynamics. While current ToM benchmarks are limited to text-only or dyadic
interactions, ToM-SSI is multimodal and includes group interactions of up to
four agents that communicate and move in situated environments. This unique
design allows us to study, for the first time, mixed cooperative-obstructive
settings and reasoning about multiple agents' mental state in parallel, thus
capturing a wider range of social cognition than existing benchmarks. Our
evaluations reveal that the current models' performance is still severely
limited, especially in these new tasks, highlighting critical gaps for future
research.

Motivation: 医院分货记录含有丰富的医疗信息，但处理这些数据面临多重挑战：数据敏感性引发隐私问题、医院缺乏计算资源进行模型微调、专家手动标注数据成本高

Method: 首先在GPU上使用2k样本的开源数据集微调预训练的大语言模型，然后在CPU上使用1000样本的医院特定数据集进一步微调

Result: 通过精心筛选数据集并利用现有模型和开源数据，成功在计算资源有限的情况下完成分货数据分类

Conclusion: 该管线方法为医疗机构在计算资源受限的情况下使用现代NLP技术分析敏感医疗数据提供了可行的解决方案

Abstract: Triage notes, created at the start of a patient's hospital visit, contain a
wealth of information that can help medical staff and researchers understand
Emergency Department patient epidemiology and the degree of time-dependent
illness or injury. Unfortunately, applying modern Natural Language Processing
and Machine Learning techniques to analyse triage data faces some challenges:
Firstly, hospital data contains highly sensitive information that is subject to
privacy regulation thus need to be analysed on site; Secondly, most hospitals
and medical facilities lack the necessary hardware to fine-tune a Large
Language Model (LLM), much less training one from scratch; Lastly, to identify
the records of interest, expert inputs are needed to manually label the
datasets, which can be time-consuming and costly. We present in this paper a
pipeline that enables the classification of triage data using LLM and limited
compute resources. We first fine-tuned a pre-trained LLM with a classifier
using a small (2k) open sourced dataset on a GPU; and then further fine-tuned
the model with a hospital specific dataset of 1000 samples on a CPU. We
demonstrated that by carefully curating the datasets and leveraging existing
models and open sourced data, we can successfully classify triage data with
limited compute resources.

Conclusion: ICR框架有效解决了多模糊表达问题，显著提升了对话查询重写性能

Abstract: Most previous work on Conversational Query Rewriting employs an end-to-end
rewriting paradigm. However, this approach is hindered by the issue of multiple
fuzzy expressions within the query, which complicates the simultaneous
identification and rewriting of multiple positions. To address this issue, we
propose a novel framework ICR (Iterative Clarification and Rewriting), an
iterative rewriting scheme that pivots on clarification questions. Within this
framework, the model alternates between generating clarification questions and
rewritten queries. The experimental results show that our ICR can continuously
improve retrieval performance in the clarification-rewriting iterative process,
thereby achieving state-of-the-art performance on two popular datasets.

Motivation: 短文本情感分类面临类别不平衡、训练样本有限、标签主观性强等挑战，这些因素加剧了数据稀疏性，阻碍了有效学习

Method: 使用BERT和RoBERTa等小型Transformer模型，评估三个关键因素：领域特定继续预训练、生成式数据增强、分类头架构变体

Result: 数据增强提高了分类性能，但在增强数据集上继续预训练会引入噪声而非提升准确率，分类头修改仅带来边际收益

Conclusion: 为资源受限环境下优化BERT模型提供了实用指导，改进了短文本数据集情感分类策略

Abstract: Sentiment classification in short text datasets faces significant challenges
such as class imbalance, limited training samples, and the inherent
subjectivity of sentiment labels -- issues that are further intensified by the
limited context in short texts. These factors make it difficult to resolve
ambiguity and exacerbate data sparsity, hindering effective learning. In this
paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of small Transformer-based models (i.e.,
BERT and RoBERTa, with fewer than 1 billion parameters) for multi-label
sentiment classification, with a particular focus on short-text settings.
Specifically, we evaluated three key factors influencing model performance: (1)
continued domain-specific pre-training, (2) data augmentation using
automatically generated examples, specifically generative data augmentation,
and (3) architectural variations of the classification head. Our experiment
results show that data augmentation improves classification performance, while
continued pre-training on augmented datasets can introduce noise rather than
boost accuracy. Furthermore, we confirm that modifications to the
classification head yield only marginal benefits. These findings provide
practical guidance for optimizing BERT-based models in resource-constrained
settings and refining strategies for sentiment classification in short-text
datasets.

Result: 评估指标涵盖语言质量和任务成功率，揭示了关于显式意图建模必要性或冗余性的惊人见解

Conclusion: 研究结果挑战了对话AI管道中的传统假设，为设计更高效有效的响应生成系统提供了可行的指导方针

Abstract: In the era of conversational AI, generating accurate and contextually
appropriate service responses remains a critical challenge. A central question
remains: Is explicit intent recognition a prerequisite for generating
high-quality service responses, or can models bypass this step and produce
effective replies directly? This paper conducts a rigorous comparative study to
address this fundamental design dilemma. Leveraging two publicly available
service interaction datasets, we benchmark several state-of-the-art language
models, including a fine-tuned T5 variant, across both paradigms: Intent-First
Response Generation and Direct Response Generation. Evaluation metrics
encompass both linguistic quality and task success rates, revealing surprising
insights into the necessity or redundancy of explicit intent modelling. Our
findings challenge conventional assumptions in conversational AI pipelines,
offering actionable guidelines for designing more efficient and effective

Method: 从双曲几何中的洛伦兹变换获得灵感，提出双曲旋转位置编码(HoPE)，使用双曲函数在token表示上实现洛伦兹旋转。理论分析表明RoPE是该方法的一个特例。

Result: 大量实验结果表明，HoPE在多个扩展序列基准测试的困惑度评估中 consistently超过现有位置编码方法，表现出更强的长距离依赖表示和泛化能力。

Conclusion: HoPE通过几何重构位置编码，从根本上解决了RoPE的振荡问题，增强了长距离依赖建模能力，是位置编码方法的重要改进。

Abstract: Positional encoding mechanisms enable Transformers to model sequential
structure and long-range dependencies in text. While absolute positional
encodings struggle with extrapolation to longer sequences due to fixed
positional representations, and relative approaches like Alibi exhibit
performance degradation on extremely long contexts, the widely-used Rotary
Positional Encoding (RoPE) introduces oscillatory attention patterns that
hinder stable long-distance dependency modelling. We address these limitations
through a geometric reformulation of positional encoding. Drawing inspiration
from Lorentz transformations in hyperbolic geometry, we propose Hyperbolic
Rotary Positional Encoding (HoPE), which leverages hyperbolic functions to
implement Lorentz rotations on token representations. Theoretical analysis
demonstrates that RoPE is a special case of our generalized formulation. HoPE
fundamentally resolves RoPE's slation issues by enforcing monotonic decay of
attention weights with increasing token distances. Extensive experimental
results, including perplexity evaluations under several extended sequence
benchmarks, show that HoPE consistently exceeds existing positional encoding
methods. These findings underscore HoPE's enhanced capacity for representing
and generalizing long-range dependencies. Data and code will be available.

Motivation: 在严格数据约束下探索扩散模型在语言建模中的应用，旨在提高数据利用效率，特别是在稀有词汇学习方面

Method: 采用掩码扩散语言建模框架，结合频率感知掩码技术（优先学习稀有词汇），探索多种噪声调度策略（包括双模式方法）和噪声权重方案

Result: 在BabyLM基准测试中表现出色，在语言能力、世界知识和人类相似性方面与混合自回归-掩码基线方法竞争性相当

Conclusion: 基于扩散的训练方法为数据受限的语言学习提供了可行的替代方案，证明了扩散模型在资源受限环境下的有效性

Abstract: We present a masked diffusion language modeling framework for data-efficient
training for the BabyLM 2025 Challenge. Our approach applies diffusion training
objectives to language modeling under strict data constraints, incorporating
frequency-informed masking that prioritizes learning from rare tokens while
maintaining theoretical validity. We explore multiple noise scheduling
strategies, including two-mode approaches, and investigate different noise
weighting schemes within the NELBO objective. We evaluate our method on the
BabyLM benchmark suite, measuring linguistic competence, world knowledge, and
human-likeness. Results show performance competitive to hybrid
autoregressive-masked baselines, demonstrating that diffusion-based training
offers a viable alternative for data-restricted language learning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CURE是一个轻量级框架，通过内容提取器和反转网络分离概念无关表示，使用对比学习调整残差概念线索，有效抑制概念驱动的伪相关性，在IMDB和Yelp数据集上显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练语言模型虽然成功但容易受到虚假概念相关性的影响，损害鲁棒性和公平性，需要一种方法来系统性地解耦和抑制概念捷径。

Method: 使用内容提取器和反转网络提取概念无关表示，然后通过可控去偏模块采用对比学习精细调整残差概念线索的影响。

Result: 在IMDB数据集上F1分数绝对提升10个百分点，Yelp数据集上提升2个百分点，同时计算开销极小。

Conclusion: CURE为对抗概念偏见提供了一个灵活的无监督蓝图，为更可靠和公平的语言理解系统铺平了道路。

Abstract: Pre-trained language models have achieved remarkable success across diverse
applications but remain susceptible to spurious, concept-driven correlations
that impair robustness and fairness. In this work, we introduce CURE, a novel
and lightweight framework that systematically disentangles and suppresses
conceptual shortcuts while preserving essential content information. Our method
first extracts concept-irrelevant representations via a dedicated content
extractor reinforced by a reversal network, ensuring minimal loss of
task-relevant information. A subsequent controllable debiasing module employs
contrastive learning to finely adjust the influence of residual conceptual
cues, enabling the model to either diminish harmful biases or harness
beneficial correlations as appropriate for the target task. Evaluated on the
IMDB and Yelp datasets using three pre-trained architectures, CURE achieves an
absolute improvement of +10 points in F1 score on IMDB and +2 points on Yelp,
while introducing minimal computational overhead. Our approach establishes a
flexible, unsupervised blueprint for combating conceptual biases, paving the
way for more reliable and fair language understanding systems.

TL;DR: Entropy2Vec是一个新颖的跨语言表示框架，通过利用单语语言模型的熵来捕捉语言间的类型学关系，避免了传统类型学特征稀疏和静态的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统类型学清单存在特征稀疏和静态快照的局限性，需要一种能够动态捕捉语言间结构相似性的方法。

Method: 通过训练单语语言模型，利用其预测熵来反映语言间的结构相似性（低熵表示高相似性，高熵表示较大差异），生成密集、非稀疏的语言嵌入。

Result: 实证评估显示Entropy2Vec嵌入与既定类型学类别一致，在多语言NLP下游任务中取得了有竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: Entropy2Vec提供了一种有效的方法来推导跨语言表示，能够适应不同时间范围且无缺失值，为多语言NLP任务提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce Entropy2Vec, a novel framework for deriving cross-lingual
language representations by leveraging the entropy of monolingual language
models. Unlike traditional typological inventories that suffer from feature
sparsity and static snapshots, Entropy2Vec uses the inherent uncertainty in
language models to capture typological relationships between languages. By
training a language model on a single language, we hypothesize that the entropy
of its predictions reflects its structural similarity to other languages: Low
entropy indicates high similarity, while high entropy suggests greater
divergence. This approach yields dense, non-sparse language embeddings that are
adaptable to different timeframes and free from missing values. Empirical
evaluations demonstrate that Entropy2Vec embeddings align with established
typological categories and achieved competitive performance in downstream
multilingual NLP tasks, such as those addressed by the LinguAlchemy framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统性能评估方法无法揭示模型如何获得语言能力，需要在概念层面更好理解模型训练过程

Method: 使用稀疏交叉编码器在不同检查点之间发现对齐特征，并提出相对间接效应(RelIE)指标来跟踪特征的冲击性影响

Result: 交叉编码器能够检测到预训练过程中特征的出现、维护和中断现象

Conclusion: 该方法不依赖于网络结构，具有良好的扩展性，为预训练过程中表征学习提供了更可解释和细粒度的分析途径

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) learn non-trivial abstractions during
pretraining, like detecting irregular plural noun subjects. However, it is not
well understood when and how specific linguistic abilities emerge as
traditional evaluation methods such as benchmarking fail to reveal how models
acquire concepts and capabilities. To bridge this gap and better understand
model training at the concept level, we use sparse crosscoders to discover and
align features across model checkpoints. Using this approach, we track the
evolution of linguistic features during pretraining. We train crosscoders
between open-sourced checkpoint triplets with significant performance and
representation shifts, and introduce a novel metric, Relative Indirect Effects
(RelIE), to trace training stages at which individual features become causally
important for task performance. We show that crosscoders can detect feature
emergence, maintenance, and discontinuation during pretraining. Our approach is
architecture-agnostic and scalable, offering a promising path toward more
interpretable and fine-grained analysis of representation learning throughout
pretraining.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统解释性方法无法捕捉代理性LLM的推理路径、规划逻辑和系统影响，在高风险领域部署时存在透明度、偏见和不稳定性问题，需要新的解释性框架来增强信任和问责。

Method: 提出TAXAL（Triadic Alignment for eXplainability in Agentic LLMs）三元融合框架，整合认知维度（用户理解）、功能维度（实用效用）和因果维度（忠实推理），提供角色敏感的解释设计基础。

Result: 通过法律、教育、医疗和公共服务等案例研究展示了TAXAL的适用性，证明解释策略能够适应制度约束和利益相关者角色。

Conclusion: TAXAL将概念清晰性与设计模式和部署路径相结合，推进了解释性作为技术和社会技术实践的发展，支持代理AI时代可信赖和上下文敏感的LLM应用。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed in high-risk
domains where opacity, bias, and instability undermine trust and
accountability. Traditional explainability methods, focused on surface outputs,
do not capture the reasoning pathways, planning logic, and systemic impacts of
agentic LLMs.
  We introduce TAXAL (Triadic Alignment for eXplainability in Agentic LLMs), a
triadic fusion framework that unites three complementary dimensions: cognitive
(user understanding), functional (practical utility), and causal (faithful
reasoning). TAXAL provides a unified, role-sensitive foundation for designing,
evaluating, and deploying explanations in diverse sociotechnical settings.
  Our analysis synthesizes existing methods, ranging from post-hoc attribution
and dialogic interfaces to explanation-aware prompting, and situates them
within the TAXAL triadic fusion model. We further demonstrate its applicability
through case studies in law, education, healthcare, and public services,
showing how explanation strategies adapt to institutional constraints and
stakeholder roles.
  By combining conceptual clarity with design patterns and deployment pathways,
TAXAL advances explainability as a technical and sociotechnical practice,
supporting trustworthy and context-sensitive LLM applications in the era of
agentic AI.

Motivation: 开发支持多语言翻译的开源模型，特别关注中文与少数民族语言/方言的翻译需求，并通过慢思考模式提升测试时性能。

Method: 采用整体训练流程：通用和MT导向的预训练建立基础能力，监督微调进行任务适应，强化学习和弱到强RL进行高级对齐。Chimera模型集成多个参数设置下的输出。

Result: 模型在同等参数规模的翻译专用模型和大多数SOTA大模型中表现显著优越，特别是在中文与少数民族语言/方言翻译任务上。WMT2025共享任务中31个语言对中30个排名第一。

Conclusion: Hunyuan-MT模型在多语言翻译领域表现出色，特别是在低资源语言处理上具有强大鲁棒性，为多语言翻译提供了有效的开源解决方案。

Abstract: In this report, we introduce Hunyuan-MT-7B, our first open-source
multilingual translation model, which supports bidirectional translation across
33 major languages and places a special emphasis on translation between
Mandarin and several ethnic minority languages as well as dialects.
Furthermore, to serve and address diverse translation scenarios and enhance
model performance at test time, we introduce Hunyuan-MT-Chimera-7B, a
translation model inspired by the slow thinking mode. This model integrates
multiple outputs generated by the Hunyuan-MT-7B model under varying parameter
settings, thereby achieving performance superior to that of conventional
slow-thinking models based on Chain-of-Thought (CoT). The development of our
models follows a holistic training process specifically engineered for
multilingual translation, which begins with general and MT-oriented
pre-training to build foundational capabilities, proceeds to Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT) for task-specific adaptation, and culminates in advanced
alignment through Reinforcement Learning (RL) and weak-to-strong RL. Through
comprehensive experimentation, we demonstrate that both Hunyuan-MT-7B and
Hunyuan-MT-Chimera-7B significantly outperform all translation-specific models
of comparable parameter size and most of the SOTA large models, particularly on
the task of translation between Mandarin and minority languages as well as
dialects. In the WMT2025 shared task (General Machine Translation), our models
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, ranking first in 30 out of 31
language pairs. This result highlights the robustness of our models across a
diverse linguistic spectrum, encompassing high-resource languages such as
Chinese, English, and Japanese, as well as low-resource languages including
Czech, Marathi, Estonian, and Icelandic.

TL;DR: 这篇论文形成了一个标准化的时间序列自然语言描述评测基准，通过统一四个数据集来评估13种最新模型在识别、区分和生成任务上的表现，发现现有模型仍有显著提升空间且强猛性不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前时间序分析基础模型评估中存在的问题：新模型与新数据集同时推出导致比较困难，以及广泛的任务评测无法准确识别模型的具体能力。

Method: 形成了3个测试时间序列自然语言描述能力的任务：识别（真伪问答）、区分（多选题）和生成（开放式描述），统一四个最近的数据集进行直接比较。

Result: 评估了13种最新的语言、视觉-语言和时间序列-语言模型，发现：纯语言模型表现较差，需要时间序特定架构；视觉-语言模型表现良好；预训练多模态时间序-语言模型超过了大语言模型，但仍有显著提升空间。所有方法在强猛性测试中都显示出脆弱性。

Conclusion: 该基准为时间序推理系统提供了标准化的评估方法，显示了当前模型在时间序自然语言描述任务上的不足之处，为未来研究指明了方向。

Abstract: Many recent studies have proposed general-purpose foundation models designed
for a variety of time series analysis tasks. While several established datasets
already exist for evaluating these models, previous works frequently introduce
their models in conjunction with new datasets, limiting opportunities for
direct, independent comparisons and obscuring insights into the relative
strengths of different methods. Additionally, prior evaluations often cover
numerous tasks simultaneously, assessing a broad range of model abilities
without clearly pinpointing which capabilities contribute to overall
performance. To address these gaps, we formalize and evaluate 3 tasks that test
a model's ability to describe time series using generic natural language: (1)
recognition (True/False question-answering), (2) differentiation (multiple
choice question-answering), and (3) generation (open-ended natural language
description). We then unify 4 recent datasets to enable head-to-head model
comparisons on each task. Experimentally, in evaluating 13 state-of-the-art
language, vision--language, and time series--language models, we find that (1)
popular language-only methods largely underperform, indicating a need for time
series-specific architectures, (2) VLMs are quite successful, as expected,
identifying the value of vision models for these tasks and (3) pretrained
multimodal time series--language models successfully outperform LLMs, but still
have significant room for improvement. We also find that all approaches exhibit
clear fragility in a range of robustness tests. Overall, our benchmark provides
a standardized evaluation on a task necessary for time series reasoning
systems.

TL;DR: 通过集成监督精细调整和直接偏好优化，模型能动态调整思维深度，在简单问题上减少冗余输出同时保持复杂问题的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决链式思维推理在简单问题上产生不必要冗长输出的问题，让模型根据问题难度动态调整思考深度。

Method: 通过精心筛选的数据进行后训练，数据包含与问题难度成正比的链式思维追踪。结合监督精细调整(SFT)和直接偏好优化(DPO)方法。

Result: 模型学会了"按比例思考"，在简单问题上最小化推理长度，同时保持复杂问题的深度推理。SFT主要捐捕推理长度和格式模式，DPO保持推理准确性。

Conclusion: 无需修改模型架构，仅通过数据调整即可实现动态推理深度调节，合理结合SFT和DPO方法可以同时减少输出长度和维持或提高性能。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought reasoning, while powerful, can produce unnecessarily verbose
output for simpler problems. We present a framework for difficulty-aware
reasoning that teaches models to dynamically adjust reasoning depth based on
problem complexity. Remarkably, we show that models can be endowed with such
dynamic inference pathways without any architectural modifications; we simply
post-train on data that is carefully curated to include chain-of-thought traces
that are proportional in length to problem difficulty. Our analysis reveals
that post-training via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) primarily captures patterns
like reasoning length and format, while direct preference optimization (DPO)
preserves reasoning accuracy, with their combination reducing length and
maintaining or improving performance. Both quantitative metrics and qualitative
assessments confirm that models can learn to "think proportionally", reasoning
minimally on simple problems while maintaining depth for complex ones.

TL;DR: 本研究重新验证了英语补语从句中可选补语连词that的省略与信息密度的关系，使用现代对话语料和神经网络语言模型改进了信息密度测量方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 统一信息密度假说认为说话者会利用表达变异性来保持信息传输速率的一致性。先前研究发现补语连词that在信息密度低（可预测性高）时更可能被省略，但需要更精确的信息密度测量方法。

Method: 分析大规模现代对话语料库，使用机器学习和神经语言模型来精炼信息密度估计，比较基于矩阵动词语义次范畴化概率的传统方法和基于上下文词嵌入的新方法。

Result: 结果复制了信息密度与that提及之间的既定关系，但发现传统方法捕获了大量词汇特异性变异，而基于上下文词嵌入的估计能解释补语连词使用模式的额外方差。

Conclusion: 基于上下文词嵌入的信息密度估计方法比传统基于动词语义次范畴化概率的方法更能有效解释补语连词that的使用模式变异。

Abstract: Speakers often have multiple ways to express the same meaning. The Uniform
Information Density (UID) hypothesis suggests that speakers exploit this
variability to maintain a consistent rate of information transmission during
language production. Building on prior work linking UID to syntactic reduction,
we revisit the finding that the optional complementizer $\textit{that}$in
English complement clauses is more likely to be omitted when the clause has low
information density (i.e., more predictable). We advance this line of research
by analyzing a large-scale, contemporary conversational corpus and using
machine learning and neural language models to refine estimates of information
density. Our results replicated the established relationship between
information density and $\textit{that}$-mentioning. However, we found that
previous measures of information density based on matrix verbs'
subcategorization probability capture substantial idiosyncratic lexical
variation. By contrast, estimates derived from contextual word embeddings
account for additional variance in patterns of complementizer usage.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对线性复杂度序列模型中的衰减机制进行系统性研究，探索不同设计选择对模型性能的影响。

Method: 从四个维度分析衰减机制：参数化策略、参数共享、衰减粒度、与相对位置编码的兼容性，通过多样化语言建模任务进行实验。

Result: 1.参数化策略需精心设计，有效配置仅在特定参数范围内 2.参数共享不能随意使用，容易导致衰减值过大/过小 3.标量衰减通常差于向量衰减，但某些情况下反超 4.RoPE对大多数线性注力机制无显著改善

Conclusion: 衰减机制的设计需细致考虑，不同维度的选择会对模型性能产生重要影响，需根据具体场景进行优化。

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive investigation into the decay mechanisms
inherent in linear complexity sequence models. We systematically delineate the
design space of decay mechanisms across four pivotal dimensions:
parameterization strategy, which refers to the computational methodology for
decay; parameter sharing, which involves the utilization of supplementary
parameters for decay computation; decay granularity, comparing scalar versus
vector-based decay; and compatibility with relative positional encoding
methods, such as Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE). Through an extensive series
of experiments conducted on diverse language modeling tasks, we uncovered
several critical insights. Firstly, the design of the parameterization strategy
for decay requires meticulous consideration. Our findings indicate that
effective configurations are typically confined to a specific range of
parameters. Secondly, parameter sharing cannot be used arbitrarily, as it may
cause decay values to be too large or too small, thereby significantly
impacting performance. Thirdly, under identical parameterization strategies,
scalar decay generally underperforms compared to its vector-based counterpart.
However, in certain scenarios with alternative parameterization strategies,
scalar decay may unexpectedly surpass vector decay in efficacy. Lastly, our
analysis reveals that RoPE, a commonly employed relative positional encoding
method, typically fails to provide tangible benefits to the majority of linear
attention mechanisms.

Motivation: 评估LLMs在建筑项目管理这种高风险、伦理敏感领域的可靠性和伦理可行性

Method: 混合研究方法：量化分析（使用EDSAC评估2个LLMs在12个实际伦理场景中的表现）+质性分析（与12位行业专家的半结构访谈）

Result: LLMs在法律遵循等结构化领域表现谨慨，但在处理上下文细节、确保负责性和提供透明推理方面存在显著缺陷

Conclusion: LLMs目前仅适合作为决策支持工具，不应作为自主伦理判断工具，必须有人类监督机制

Abstract: The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into construction project
management (CPM) is accelerating, with Large Language Models (LLMs) emerging as
accessible decision-support tools. This study aims to critically evaluate the
ethical viability and reliability of LLMs when applied to the ethically
sensitive, high-risk decision-making contexts inherent in CPM. A mixed-methods
research design was employed, involving the quantitative performance testing of
two leading LLMs against twelve real-world ethical scenarios using a novel
Ethical Decision Support Assessment Checklist (EDSAC), and qualitative analysis
of semi-structured interviews with 12 industry experts to capture professional
perceptions. The findings reveal that while LLMs demonstrate adequate
performance in structured domains such as legal compliance, they exhibit
significant deficiencies in handling contextual nuance, ensuring
accountability, and providing transparent reasoning. Stakeholders expressed
considerable reservations regarding the autonomous use of AI for ethical
judgments, strongly advocating for robust human-in-the-loop oversight. To our
knowledge, this is one of the first studies to empirically test the ethical
reasoning of LLMs within the construction domain. It introduces the EDSAC
framework as a replicable methodology and provides actionable recommendations,
emphasising that LLMs are currently best positioned as decision-support aids
rather than autonomous ethical agents.

TL;DR: Maestro是一个框架无关的LLM智能体整体优化器，通过联合搜索图结构和节点配置来最大化智能体质量，在多个基准测试中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有优化器主要调整配置而固定图结构，无法解决结构性故障模式，需要一种能够同时优化图结构和节点配置的全面优化方法。

Method: 提出Maestro框架，在明确的rollout/token预算约束下，联合搜索图结构和节点配置，并利用轨迹中的反射性文本反馈来优先处理编辑，提高样本效率。

Result: 在IFBench和HotpotQA基准测试中，Maestro平均优于MIPROv2、GEPA和GEPA+Merge分别12%、4.9%和4.86%；即使在仅提示优化限制下，仍领先9.65%、2.37%和2.41%，且使用比GEPA更少的rollouts。

Conclusion: 联合图结构和配置搜索能够解决单纯提示调优无法修复的结构性故障模式，在两个应用（面试官和RAG智能体）上显示出巨大优势。

Abstract: Building reliable LLM agents requires decisions at two levels: the graph
(which modules exist and how information flows) and the configuration of each
node (models, prompts, tools, control knobs). Most existing optimizers tune
configurations while holding the graph fixed, leaving structural failure modes
unaddressed. We introduce Maestro, a framework-agnostic holistic optimizer for
LLM agents that jointly searches over graphs and configurations to maximize
agent quality, subject to explicit rollout/token budgets. Beyond numeric
metrics, Maestro leverages reflective textual feedback from traces to
prioritize edits, improving sample efficiency and targeting specific failure
modes. On the IFBench and HotpotQA benchmarks, Maestro consistently surpasses
leading prompt optimizers--MIPROv2, GEPA, and GEPA+Merge--by an average of 12%,
4.9%, and 4.86%, respectively; even when restricted to prompt-only
optimization, it still leads by 9.65%, 2.37%, and 2.41%. Maestro achieves these
results with far fewer rollouts than GEPA. We further show large gains on two
applications (interviewer & RAG agents), highlighting that joint graph &
configuration search addresses structural failure modes that prompt tuning
alone cannot fix.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于代理的建模等仿真方法在健康决策中潜力巨大，但由于模型复杂性难以被利益相关者使用。虽然LLM可以将模拟输出转化为文本，但现有通用摘要无法满足临床医生、政策制定者、患者等不同群体的多样化信息需求和风格偏好。

Method: 采用混合方法设计：首先获取不同健康利益相关者的解释需求和风格偏好，然后通过可控属性调优等方法优化LLM生成定制化输出的能力，最后通过综合评估指标进行评价和改进。

Result: 提出了一个系统性框架来识别利益相关者需求并指导LLM生成定制化的健康模拟解释，填补了在理解利益相关者需要什么解释以及如何相应定制方面的根本空白。

Conclusion: 该框架有助于充分发挥健康模拟模型的潜力，使其能够更好地服务于不同利益相关群体的决策需求，通过定制化解释提高模型的可访问性和实用性。

Abstract: Modeling & Simulation (M&S) approaches such as agent-based models hold
significant potential to support decision-making activities in health, with
recent examples including the adoption of vaccines, and a vast literature on
healthy eating behaviors and physical activity behaviors. These models are
potentially usable by different stakeholder groups, as they support
policy-makers to estimate the consequences of potential interventions and they
can guide individuals in making healthy choices in complex environments.
However, this potential may not be fully realized because of the models'
complexity, which makes them inaccessible to the stakeholders who could benefit
the most. While Large Language Models (LLMs) can translate simulation outputs
and the design of models into text, current approaches typically rely on
one-size-fits-all summaries that fail to reflect the varied informational needs
and stylistic preferences of clinicians, policymakers, patients, caregivers,
and health advocates. This limitation stems from a fundamental gap: we lack a
systematic understanding of what these stakeholders need from explanations and
how to tailor them accordingly. To address this gap, we present a step-by-step
framework to identify stakeholder needs and guide LLMs in generating tailored
explanations of health simulations. Our procedure uses a mixed-methods design
by first eliciting the explanation needs and stylistic preferences of diverse
health stakeholders, then optimizing the ability of LLMs to generate tailored
outputs (e.g., via controllable attribute tuning), and then evaluating through
a comprehensive range of metrics to further improve the tailored generation of
summaries.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统AI基准测试难以捕捉模型的细微能力，特别是在物理世界建模方面，需要更符合人类认知的评价标准

Method: 基于Perception Test和OpenEQA基准，通过深度访谈和大规模调查识别关键认知技能（优先级排序、记忆、辨别、情境化），并将这些人类洞察整合到基准设计中

Result: 研究发现参与者认为AI缺乏解释性和共情能力，但对AI性能有很高期望；提出了更符合人类认知的评估框架

Conclusion: 用户中心评估对AI发展至关重要，该工作为研究人员提供了可操作的指导方针，既改进了当前基准测试实践，也为未来AI模型评估奠定了基础

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of artificial intelligence (AI), traditional
benchmarks can fall short in attempting to capture the nuanced capabilities of
AI models. We focus on the case of physical world modeling and propose a novel
approach to augment existing benchmarks with human-derived evaluation criteria,
aiming to enhance the interpretability and applicability of model behaviors.
Grounding our study in the Perception Test and OpenEQA benchmarks, we conducted
in-depth interviews and large-scale surveys to identify key cognitive skills,
such as Prioritization, Memorizing, Discerning, and Contextualizing, that are
critical for both AI and human reasoning. Our findings reveal that participants
perceive AI as lacking in interpretive and empathetic skills yet hold high
expectations for AI performance. By integrating insights from our findings into
benchmark design, we offer a framework for developing more human-aligned means
of defining and measuring progress. This work underscores the importance of
user-centered evaluation in AI development, providing actionable guidelines for
researchers and practitioners aiming to align AI capabilities with human
cognitive processes. Our approach both enhances current benchmarking practices
and sets the stage for future advancements in AI model evaluation.

TL;DR: 本文主张通过语言模型驱动的分层世界模型来解决复杂多智能体任务中的探索困难和稀疏奖励问题，提出利用LLM动态生成层次化脚手架来指导智能体学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI发展中，语言模型和智能体模型已有显著进展，但复杂长时域多智能体任务仍受限于缺乏显式的层次化世界模型，导致探索空间难以处理且奖励稀疏。

Method: 提出利用大型语言模型动态生成层次化脚手架，构建语言驱动的世界模型，将复杂目标分解为结构化子目标，为智能体学习提供内在课程和密集学习信号。

Result: 通过对2024年多智能体足球研究的系统回顾，发现明显趋势是将符号化、层次化方法与多智能体强化学习结合，构建基于任务的世界模型来指导学习。

Conclusion: 构建具有显式、语言可配置任务层的环境，可以弥合低层反应行为与高层战略团队协作之间的差距，为训练下一代智能智能体提供强大且可推广的框架。

Abstract: The convergence of Language models, Agent models, and World models represents
a critical frontier for artificial intelligence. While recent progress has
focused on scaling Language and Agent models, the development of sophisticated,
explicit World Models remains a key bottleneck, particularly for complex,
long-horizon multi-agent tasks. In domains such as robotic soccer, agents
trained via standard reinforcement learning in high-fidelity but
structurally-flat simulators often fail due to intractable exploration spaces
and sparse rewards. This position paper argues that the next frontier in
developing capable agents lies in creating environments that possess an
explicit, hierarchical World Model. We contend that this is best achieved
through hierarchical scaffolding, where complex goals are decomposed into
structured, manageable subgoals. Drawing evidence from a systematic review of
2024 research in multi-agent soccer, we identify a clear and decisive trend
towards integrating symbolic and hierarchical methods with multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL). These approaches implicitly or explicitly
construct a task-based world model to guide agent learning. We then propose a
paradigm shift: leveraging Large Language Models to dynamically generate this
hierarchical scaffold, effectively using language to structure the World Model
on the fly. This language-driven world model provides an intrinsic curriculum,
dense and meaningful learning signals, and a framework for compositional
learning, enabling Agent Models to acquire sophisticated, strategic behaviors
with far greater sample efficiency. By building environments with explicit,
language-configurable task layers, we can bridge the gap between low-level
reactive behaviors and high-level strategic team play, creating a powerful and
generalizable framework for training the next generation of intelligent agents.

TL;DR: WiA-LLM是一个新范式，通过整合假设分析(WIA)和强化学习环境反馈，使大语言模型具备主动思考能力，在复杂游戏环境中实现了74.2%的状态变化预测准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型只能被动处理信息，缺乏系统性探索假设未来的能力，无法在行动前预测潜在后果，这限制了它们在动态高风险场景中的实用性。

Method: 整合假设分析(WIA)方法，通过强化学习获取环境反馈，动态模拟每个潜在行动的结果，使模型能够预测未来状态而不仅仅是响应当前条件。在王者荣耀复杂游戏环境中进行验证。

Result: WiA-LLM在游戏状态变化预测中达到74.2%的准确率（比基线提升两倍），在高难度场景中表现尤为突出。

Conclusion: 这是首个正式探索和整合假设分析能力到大语言模型的工作，代表了向主动推理的根本性进步，为动态环境中的稳健决策提供了可扩展框架。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at processing information reactively but
lack the ability to systemically explore hypothetical futures. They cannot ask,
"what if we take this action? how will it affect the final outcome" and
forecast its potential consequences before acting. This critical gap limits
their utility in dynamic, high-stakes scenarios like strategic planning, risk
assessment, and real-time decision making. To bridge this gap, we propose
WiA-LLM, a new paradigm that equips LLMs with proactive thinking capabilities.
Our approach integrates What-If Analysis (WIA), a systematic approach for
evaluating hypothetical scenarios by changing input variables. By leveraging
environmental feedback via reinforcement learning, WiA-LLM moves beyond
reactive thinking. It dynamically simulates the outcomes of each potential
action, enabling the model to anticipate future states rather than merely react
to the present conditions. We validate WiA-LLM in Honor of Kings (HoK), a
complex multiplayer game environment characterized by rapid state changes and
intricate interactions. The game's real-time state changes require precise
multi-step consequence prediction, making it an ideal testbed for our approach.
Experimental results demonstrate WiA-LLM achieves a remarkable 74.2% accuracy
in forecasting game-state changes (up to two times gain over baselines). The
model shows particularly significant gains in high-difficulty scenarios where
accurate foresight is critical. To our knowledge, this is the first work to
formally explore and integrate what-if analysis capabilities within LLMs.
WiA-LLM represents a fundamental advance toward proactive reasoning in LLMs,
providing a scalable framework for robust decision-making in dynamic
environments with broad implications for strategic applications.

TL;DR: TalkToAgent是一个多代理LLM框架，通过五个专业代理提供交互式自然语言解释，弥合复杂RL策略与领域专家之间的理解鸿沟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前XRL方法存在解释结果可理解性有限、工具覆盖孤立的问题，导致用户不确定使用哪种工具，需要更透明、交互式的RL策略解释方案。

Method: 采用五代理架构（协调器、解释器、编码器、评估器、调试器），自动将用户查询映射到相关XRL工具，提供关键状态变量、预期结果或反事实解释。

Result: 在四重水箱过程控制问题上验证，成功高精度映射用户查询到XRL任务，编码器-调试器交互最小化反事实生成失败，定性评估确认有效解释代理行为。

Conclusion: TalkToAgent框架通过多代理LLM实现了有效的交互式RL策略解释，能够将代理行为在问题领域内进行情境化解释，提升了RL策略的透明度。

Abstract: Explainable Reinforcement Learning (XRL) has emerged as a promising approach
in improving the transparency of Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents. However,
there remains a gap between complex RL policies and domain experts, due to the
limited comprehensibility of XRL results and isolated coverage of current XRL
approaches that leave users uncertain about which tools to employ. To address
these challenges, we introduce TalkToAgent, a multi-agent Large Language Models
(LLM) framework that delivers interactive, natural language explanations for RL
policies. The architecture with five specialized LLM agents (Coordinator,
Explainer, Coder, Evaluator, and Debugger) enables TalkToAgent to automatically
map user queries to relevant XRL tools and clarify an agent's actions in terms
of either key state variables, expected outcomes, or counterfactual
explanations. Moreover, our approach extends previous counterfactual
explanations by deriving alternative scenarios from qualitative behavioral
descriptions, or even new rule-based policies. We validated TalkToAgent on
quadruple-tank process control problem, a well-known nonlinear control
benchmark. Results demonstrated that TalkToAgent successfully mapped user
queries into XRL tasks with high accuracy, and coder-debugger interactions
minimized failures in counterfactual generation. Furthermore, qualitative
evaluation confirmed that TalkToAgent effectively interpreted agent's actions
and contextualized their meaning within the problem domain.

<details>

Motivation: 研究语言模型在多方互动环境中的长期合作与竞争行为，补充以往短期或定点游戏研究的不足

Method: 在Axelrod风格的迭代困徒困境比赛中，让语言模型代理与240种经典策略对抗，并设计策略切换实验测试适应性

Result: 语言模型表现超过或与最佳经典策略相当，在几轮内就能检测并适应对手策略变化，适应性可与人类相比拟

Conclusion: 该研究系统地描述了语言模型长期合作行为特征，为更复杂的人工智能-人类混合社会环境研究奠定基础

Abstract: Language models are increasingly deployed in interactive online environments,
from personal chat assistants to domain-specific agents, raising questions
about their cooperative and competitive behavior in multi-party settings. While
prior work has examined language model decision-making in isolated or
short-term game-theoretic contexts, these studies often neglect long-horizon
interactions, human-model collaboration, and the evolution of behavioral
patterns over time. In this paper, we investigate the dynamics of language
model behavior in the iterated prisoner's dilemma (IPD), a classical framework
for studying cooperation and conflict. We pit model-based agents against a
suite of 240 well-established classical strategies in an Axelrod-style
tournament and find that language models achieve performance on par with, and
in some cases exceeding, the best-known classical strategies. Behavioral
analysis reveals that language models exhibit key properties associated with
strong cooperative strategies - niceness, provocability, and generosity while
also demonstrating rapid adaptability to changes in opponent strategy mid-game.
In controlled "strategy switch" experiments, language models detect and respond
to shifts within only a few rounds, rivaling or surpassing human adaptability.
These results provide the first systematic characterization of long-term
cooperative behaviors in language model agents, offering a foundation for
future research into their role in more complex, mixed human-AI social
environments.

Result: 通过双知测试对22个标准（包括介绍、产品沟通、销售推动、异议处理和成交）进行评估。结果显示AI助手在常规通话方面接近人类表现，但在说服力和异议处理方面较人类差。研究者分析了这些短板并对prompt进行了精炼。

Conclusion: 该方法论在任何有通话记录的领域都具有普遍适用性。文章总结了设计经验和未来研究方向，包括大规模模拟和自动化评估。AI语音助手在自动化重复性任务方面具有强大潜力，但在复杂的人际交流场景中仍需进一步改进。

Abstract: Recent advances in language and speech modelling have made it possible to
build autonomous voice assistants that understand and generate human dialogue
in real time. These systems are increasingly being deployed in domains such as
customer service and healthcare care, where they can automate repetitive tasks,
reduce operational costs, and provide constant support around the clock. In
this paper, we present a general methodology for cloning a conversational voice
AI agent from a corpus of call recordings. Although the case study described in
this paper uses telesales data to illustrate the approach, the underlying
process generalizes to any domain where call transcripts are available. Our
system listens to customers over the telephone, responds with a synthetic
voice, and follows a structured playbook learned from top performing human
agents. We describe the domain selection, knowledge extraction, and prompt
engineering used to construct the agent, integrating automatic speech
recognition, a large language model based dialogue manager, and text to speech
synthesis into a streaming inference pipeline. The cloned agent is evaluated
against human agents on a rubric of 22 criteria covering introduction, product
communication, sales drive, objection handling, and closing. Blind tests show
that the AI agent approaches human performance in routine aspects of the call
while underperforming in persuasion and objection handling. We analyze these
shortcomings and refine the prompt accordingly. The paper concludes with design
lessons and avenues for future research, including large scale simulation and
automated evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多智能体系统中专家智能体之间深度协作的语言交互瓶颈问题，现有工作在智能体选择和结果聚合方面有进展，但高效的深度协作仍是一个关键瓶颈

Method: 引入协作知识模型(CKM)，使每个智能体能够动态感知协作者的认知状态；通过实时认知差距分析，自适应调整通信行为（内容焦点、细节层次、表达风格）；使用学习策略优化交互

Result: 在复杂推理和问题解决基准测试中，OSC显著提高了任务性能和通信效率，将"并行工作的个体"转变为"深度协作的认知团队"

Conclusion: OSC不仅优化了多智能体协作，还为LLM智能体交互行为提供了新的见解，作为选择和聚合之间的关键中间层发挥了重要作用

Abstract: This paper introduces OSC (Orchestrating Cognitive Synergy), a
knowledge-aware adaptive collaboration framework designed to enhance cognitive
synergy in multi-agent systems with large language models. While prior work has
advanced agent selection and result aggregation, efficient linguistic
interactions for deep collaboration among expert agents remain a critical
bottleneck. OSC addresses this gap as a pivotal intermediate layer between
selection and aggregation, introducing Collaborator Knowledge Models (CKM) to
enable each agent to dynamically perceive its collaborators' cognitive states.
Through real-time cognitive gap analysis, agents adaptively adjust
communication behaviors, including content focus, detail level, and expression
style, using learned strategies. Experiments on complex reasoning and
problem-solving benchmarks demonstrate that OSC significantly improves task
performance and communication efficiency, transforming "parallel-working
individuals'' into a "deeply collaborative cognitive team.'' This framework not
only optimizes multi-agent collaboration but also offers new insights into LLM
agent interaction behaviors.

TL;DR: SparkUI-Parser是一个新颖的端到端框架，通过连续坐标建模和拒绝机制，解决了现有GUI多模态大语言模型定位精度低、推理速度慢的问题，并在多个基准测试中超越了最先进方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GUI多模态大语言模型存在两个主要问题：1）基于文本自回归机制的离散坐标建模导致定位精度低和推理速度慢；2）只能定位预定义元素集合，无法解析整个界面，限制了广泛应用和下游任务支持。

Method: 提出连续坐标建模方法，在预训练多模态大语言模型基础上增加token路由器和坐标解码器；引入基于改进匈牙利匹配算法的拒绝机制来识别和拒绝不存在的元素；构建ScreenParse基准来系统评估GUI模型的结构感知能力。

Result: 在ScreenSpot、ScreenSpot-v2、CAGUI-Grounding和ScreenParse等多个基准测试中，该方法始终优于最先进的现有方法。

Conclusion: SparkUI-Parser框架通过连续坐标建模和拒绝机制，显著提高了GUI解析的定位精度和推理速度，同时实现了对整个界面的细粒度解析能力，为下游任务提供了更好的支持。

Abstract: The existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for GUI perception have
made great progress. However, the following challenges still exist in prior
methods: 1) They model discrete coordinates based on text autoregressive
mechanism, which results in lower grounding accuracy and slower inference
speed. 2) They can only locate predefined sets of elements and are not capable
of parsing the entire interface, which hampers the broad application and
support for downstream tasks. To address the above issues, we propose
SparkUI-Parser, a novel end-to-end framework where higher localization
precision and fine-grained parsing capability of the entire interface are
simultaneously achieved. Specifically, instead of using probability-based
discrete modeling, we perform continuous modeling of coordinates based on a
pre-trained Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) with an additional token
router and coordinate decoder. This effectively mitigates the limitations
inherent in the discrete output characteristics and the token-by-token
generation process of MLLMs, consequently boosting both the accuracy and the
inference speed. To further enhance robustness, a rejection mechanism based on
a modified Hungarian matching algorithm is introduced, which empowers the model
to identify and reject non-existent elements, thereby reducing false positives.
Moreover, we present ScreenParse, a rigorously constructed benchmark to
systematically assess structural perception capabilities of GUI models across
diverse scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
consistently outperforms SOTA methods on ScreenSpot, ScreenSpot-v2,
CAGUI-Grounding and ScreenParse benchmarks. The resources are available at
https://github.com/antgroup/SparkUI-Parser.

Motivation: 解决大型语言模型作为对话代理时的可控性挑战，确保可预测和用户个性化的响应，提高对话AI的透明度

Method: 使用语言描述符将定性对话特征转化为定量定义，在描述逻辑中形式化并构建本体，通过微调指导LLM进行受控文本生成

Result: 实验结果表明该方法提供了一致且可解释的熟练度定义，改善了对话AI的透明度

Conclusion: 基于本体的方法能够有效实现LLM对话的可控性，为定性对话特征提供形式化定义和一致性检查框架

Abstract: The controllability of Large Language Models (LLMs) when used as
conversational agents is a key challenge, particularly to ensure predictable
and user-personalized responses. This work proposes an ontology-based approach
to formally define conversational features that are typically qualitative in
nature. By leveraging a set of linguistic descriptors, we derive quantitative
definitions for qualitatively-defined concepts, enabling their integration into
an ontology for reasoning and consistency checking. We apply this framework to
the task of proficiency-level control in conversations, using CEFR language
proficiency levels as a case study. These definitions are then formalized in
description logic and incorporated into an ontology, which guides controlled
text generation of an LLM through fine-tuning. Experimental results demonstrate
that our approach provides consistent and explainable proficiency-level
definitions, improving transparency in conversational AI.

Motivation: AI智能体将互联网转变为智能体网络，但缺乏像PageRank那样的全局排名机制，需要基于实际性能而非声明能力来选择智能体

Method: 设计五层DOVIS协议（发现、编排、验证、激励、语义）收集隐私保护的性能聚合数据，并开发AgentRank-UC算法结合使用频率和能力指标进行动态排名

Abstract: AI agents -- powered by reasoning-capable large language models (LLMs) and
integrated with tools, data, and web search -- are poised to transform the
internet into a \emph{Web of Agents}: a machine-native ecosystem where
autonomous agents interact, collaborate, and execute tasks at scale. Realizing
this vision requires \emph{Agent Ranking} -- selecting agents not only by
declared capabilities but by proven, recent performance. Unlike Web~1.0's
PageRank, a global, transparent network of agent interactions does not exist;
usage signals are fragmented and private, making ranking infeasible without
coordination.
  We propose \textbf{DOVIS}, a five-layer operational protocol
(\emph{Discovery, Orchestration, Verification, Incentives, Semantics}) that
enables the collection of minimal, privacy-preserving aggregates of usage and
performance across the ecosystem. On this substrate, we implement
\textbf{AgentRank-UC}, a dynamic, trust-aware algorithm that combines
\emph{usage} (selection frequency) and \emph{competence} (outcome quality,
cost, safety, latency) into a unified ranking. We present simulation results
and theoretical guarantees on convergence, robustness, and Sybil resistance,
demonstrating the viability of coordinated protocols and performance-aware
ranking in enabling a scalable, trustworthy Agentic Web.

Motivation: 当前测试时扩展方法主要依赖冗余采样，忽略了历史经验的利用，限制了计算效率。需要一种更高效的方法来利用历史推理经验。

Method: 提出Sticker-TTS框架，使用三个协作的LRM模型，通过提炼关键条件（称为sticker）来提取、精炼和重用跨多轮推理的关键信息，并采用结合模仿学习和自我改进的两阶段优化策略。

Result: 在AIME-24、AIME-25和OlymMATH三个数学推理基准测试中，Sticker-TTS在可比推理预算下持续超越了包括自一致性和先进强化学习方法在内的强基线。

Conclusion: 研究证明了sticker引导的历史经验利用的有效性，为大型推理模型的测试时扩展提供了新的高效方法。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have exhibited strong performance on complex
reasoning tasks, with further gains achievable through increased computational
budgets at inference. However, current test-time scaling methods predominantly
rely on redundant sampling, ignoring the historical experience utilization,
thereby limiting computational efficiency. To overcome this limitation, we
propose Sticker-TTS, a novel test-time scaling framework that coordinates three
collaborative LRMs to iteratively explore and refine solutions guided by
historical attempts. At the core of our framework are distilled key
conditions-termed stickers-which drive the extraction, refinement, and reuse of
critical information across multiple rounds of reasoning. To further enhance
the efficiency and performance of our framework, we introduce a two-stage
optimization strategy that combines imitation learning with self-improvement,
enabling progressive refinement. Extensive evaluations on three challenging
mathematical reasoning benchmarks, including AIME-24, AIME-25, and OlymMATH,
demonstrate that Sticker-TTS consistently surpasses strong baselines, including
self-consistency and advanced reinforcement learning approaches, under
comparable inference budgets. These results highlight the effectiveness of
sticker-guided historical experience utilization. Our code and data are

TL;DR: ProToM是一个基于心智理论的AI系统，通过贝叶斯逆规划推断智能体目标，提供针对性反馈来促进多智能体系统中的亲社会行为，在任务成功率和完成时间上优于现有大型语言模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类虽然是社会性生物，但在追求独立目标时难以确定何时以及如何协助他人，这阻碍了合作。需要开发能够促进亲社会行为的AI系统。

Method: ProToM系统首先使用贝叶斯逆规划推断智能体目标，然后基于推断的目标分布最大化期望效用来选择要传达的反馈信息。

Result: 在Doors、Keys和Gems以及Overcooked两个多智能体环境中，ProToM相比基线方法实现了更高的成功率、更短的任务完成时间，并受到人类用户的一致偏好。

Conclusion: 现有大型语言和推理模型在提供情境相关且时机恰当的反馈方面存在不足，而ProToM能够提供有针对性的有用反馈，有效促进多智能体合作。

Abstract: While humans are inherently social creatures, the challenge of identifying
when and how to assist and collaborate with others - particularly when pursuing
independent goals - can hinder cooperation. To address this challenge, we aim
to develop an AI system that provides useful feedback to promote prosocial
behaviour - actions that benefit others, even when not directly aligned with
one's own goals. We introduce ProToM, a Theory of Mind-informed facilitator
that promotes prosocial actions in multi-agent systems by providing targeted,
context-sensitive feedback to individual agents. ProToM first infers agents'
goals using Bayesian inverse planning, then selects feedback to communicate by
maximising expected utility, conditioned on the inferred goal distribution. We
evaluate our approach against baselines in two multi-agent environments: Doors,
Keys, and Gems, as well as Overcooked. Our results suggest that
state-of-the-art large language and reasoning models fall short of
communicating feedback that is both contextually grounded and well-timed -
leading to higher communication overhead and task speedup. In contrast, ProToM
provides targeted and helpful feedback, achieving a higher success rate,
shorter task completion times, and is consistently preferred by human users.

In this paper, we provide a simple and intuitive formal semantics for ODRL that
is based on query answering. Our semantics refines previous formalisations, and
is aligned with the latest published specification of the language (2.2).
Building on our evaluation semantics, and motivated by data sharing scenarios,
we also define and study the problem of comparing two policies, detecting
equivalent, more restrictive or more permissive policies.

Abstract: Recent research has been increasingly focusing on developing 3D world models
that simulate complex real-world scenarios. World models have found broad
applications across various domains, including embodied AI, autonomous driving,
entertainment, etc. A more realistic simulation with accurate physics will
effectively narrow the sim-to-real gap and allow us to gather rich information
about the real world conveniently. While traditional manual modeling has
enabled the creation of virtual 3D scenes, modern approaches have leveraged
advanced machine learning algorithms for 3D world generation, with most recent
advances focusing on generative methods that can create virtual worlds based on
user instructions. This work explores such a research direction by proposing
LatticeWorld, a simple yet effective 3D world generation framework that
streamlines the industrial production pipeline of 3D environments. LatticeWorld
leverages lightweight LLMs (LLaMA-2-7B) alongside the industry-grade rendering
engine (e.g., Unreal Engine 5) to generate a dynamic environment. Our proposed
framework accepts textual descriptions and visual instructions as multimodal
inputs and creates large-scale 3D interactive worlds with dynamic agents,
featuring competitive multi-agent interaction, high-fidelity physics
simulation, and real-time rendering. We conduct comprehensive experiments to
evaluate LatticeWorld, showing that it achieves superior accuracy in scene
layout generation and visual fidelity. Moreover, LatticeWorld achieves over a
$90\times$ increase in industrial production efficiency while maintaining high
creative quality compared with traditional manual production methods. Our demo

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 处理异构来源的表格数据时，元数据稀疏且存在表示不一致问题，传统方法在有限元数据下模式推断困难

Method: 使用大语言模型仅基于列标题和单元格值来推断层次化的实体类型、属性和类型间关系

Conclusion: SI-LLM为元数据有限的表格数据提供了有效的概念模式推断解决方案，所有源代码、完整提示和数据集均已开源

Abstract: Minimally curated tabular data often contain representational inconsistencies
across heterogeneous sources, and are accompanied by sparse metadata. Working
with such data is intimidating. While prior work has advanced dataset discovery
and exploration, schema inference remains difficult when metadata are limited.
We present SI-LLM (Schema Inference using Large Language Models), which infers
a concise conceptual schema for tabular data using only column headers and cell
values. The inferred schema comprises hierarchical entity types, attributes,
and inter-type relationships. In extensive evaluation on two datasets from web
tables and open data, SI-LLM achieves promising end-to-end results, as well as
better or comparable results to state-of-the-art methods at each step. All
source code, full prompts, and datasets of SI-LLM are available at
https://github.com/PierreWoL/SILLM.

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了TreeIndex算法，通过树分解技术实现了小树宽图上高效的准确阻影距离计算，解决了以前随机游走方法效率低下的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的随机游走基于阻影距离计算方法在小树宽图上效率较低，而最短路径距离计算在这类图上效果显著。为了缩小这种差距，研究者分析了阻影距离的切割性质。

Method: 结合树分解技术，发现阻影距离r(s,t)只依赖于s和t到分解树根路径上的标签。基于此提出TreeIndex索引方法，构建紧凑的标签结构。

Result: 在USA全国路网上，TreeIndex在7小时内构建405GB标签，准确单对查询耗时10^-3秒，单源查询耗时190秒，显著超过现有方法。

Conclusion: TreeIndex是首个可扩展到大规模小树宽图的准确阻影距离计算方法，为图分析领域提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Resistance distance computation is a fundamental problem in graph analysis,
yet existing random walk-based methods are limited to approximate solutions and
suffer from poor efficiency on small-treewidth graphs (e.g., road networks). In
contrast, shortest-path distance computation achieves remarkable efficiency on
such graphs by leveraging cut properties and tree decompositions. Motivated by
this disparity, we first analyze the cut property of resistance distance. While
a direct generalization proves impractical due to costly matrix operations, we
overcome this limitation by integrating tree decompositions, revealing that the
resistance distance $r(s,t)$ depends only on labels along the paths from $s$
and $t$ to the root of the decomposition. This insight enables compact
labelling structures. Based on this, we propose \treeindex, a novel index
method that constructs a resistance distance labelling of size $O(n \cdot
h_{\mathcal{G}})$ in $O(n \cdot h_{\mathcal{G}}^2 \cdot d_{\max})$ time, where
$h_{\mathcal{G}}$ (tree height) and $d_{\max}$ (maximum degree) behave as small
constants in many real-world small-treewidth graphs (e.g., road networks). Our
labelling supports exact single-pair queries in $O(h_{\mathcal{G}})$ time and
single-source queries in $O(n \cdot h_{\mathcal{G}})$ time. Extensive
experiments show that TreeIndex substantially outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches. For instance, on the full USA road network, it constructs a $405$
GB labelling in $7$ hours (single-threaded) and answers exact single-pair
queries in $10^{-3}$ seconds and single-source queries in $190$ seconds--the
first exact method scalable to such large graphs.
