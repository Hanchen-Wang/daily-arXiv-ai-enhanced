### [1] [iFlyBot-VLA Technical Report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01914)
*Yuan Zhang,Chenyu Xue,Wenjie Xu,Chao Ji,Jiajia wu,Jia Pan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: iFlyBot-VLA是一个大规模视觉-语言-动作模型，采用双级动作表示框架和混合训练策略，在机器人操作任务中表现出色


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决视觉-语言-动作模型在机器人操作任务中的表示对齐问题，提出一个能够同时理解高级意图和低级动态的框架

Method: 使用潜在动作模型和结构化离散动作令牌的双级监督，结合机器人轨迹数据与通用QA和空间QA数据集的混合训练策略

Result: 在LIBERO Franka基准测试中表现优异，在真实世界多样化挑战性操作任务中达到有竞争力的成功率

Conclusion: iFlyBot-VLA通过双级动作表示和混合训练有效对齐了语言、视觉和动作的表示空间，为机器人操作任务提供了强大解决方案

Abstract: We introduce iFlyBot-VLA, a large-scale Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model
trained under a novel framework. The main contributions are listed as follows:
(1) a latent action model thoroughly trained on large-scale human and robotic
manipulation videos; (2) a dual-level action representation framework that
jointly supervises both the Vision-Language Model (VLM) and the action expert
during training; (3) a mixed training strategy that combines robot trajectory
data with general QA and spatial QA datasets, effectively enhancing the 3D
perceptual and reasoning capabilities of the VLM backbone. Specifically, the
VLM is trained to predict two complementary forms of actions: latent actions,
derived from our latent action model pretrained on cross-embodiment
manipulation data, which capture implicit high-level intentions; and structured
discrete action tokens, obtained through frequency-domain transformations of
continuous control signals, which encode explicit low-level dynamics. This dual
supervision aligns the representation spaces of language, vision, and action,
enabling the VLM to directly contribute to action generation. Experimental
results on the LIBERO Franka benchmark demonstrate the superiority of our
frame-work, while real-world evaluations further show that iFlyBot-VLA achieves
competitive success rates across diverse and challenging manipulation tasks.
Furthermore, we plan to open-source a portion of our self-constructed dataset
to support future research in the community

### [2] [Challenging DINOv3 Foundation Model under Low Inter-Class Variability: A Case Study on Fetal Brain Ultrasound](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01915)
*Edoardo Conti,Riccardo Rosati,Lorenzo Federici,Adriano Mancini,Maria Chiara Fiorentin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 首次全面评估基础模型在胎儿超声图像中低类间变异性条件下的表现，发现领域特定的预训练对区分解剖结构相似的胎儿脑标准切面至关重要


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然近期视觉基础模型（如DINOv3）在医学领域表现出良好的迁移能力，但其在区分解剖结构相似区域方面的能力尚未系统研究，特别是在胎儿脑标准切面这种具有高度重叠解剖特征的场景中

Method: 收集并整合所有公开可用的胎儿超声数据集，构建包含18.8万张标注图像的FetalUS-188K多中心基准。采用自监督方式预训练DINOv3学习超声感知表示，通过线性探测和全微调等标准化适应协议进行评估

Result: 在胎儿超声数据上预训练的模型始终优于基于自然图像初始化的模型，加权F1分数提升高达20%。领域自适应预训练使网络能够保留区分中间切面（如TV）所需的细微回声和结构线索

Conclusion: 通用基础模型在低类间变异性条件下无法良好泛化，而领域特定的预训练对于在胎儿脑超声成像中获得稳健且临床可靠的表示至关重要

Abstract: Purpose: This study provides the first comprehensive evaluation of foundation
models in fetal ultrasound (US) imaging under low inter-class variability
conditions. While recent vision foundation models such as DINOv3 have shown
remarkable transferability across medical domains, their ability to
discriminate anatomically similar structures has not been systematically
investigated. We address this gap by focusing on fetal brain standard
planes--transthalamic (TT), transventricular (TV), and transcerebellar
(TC)--which exhibit highly overlapping anatomical features and pose a critical
challenge for reliable biometric assessment.
  Methods: To ensure a fair and reproducible evaluation, all publicly available
fetal ultrasound datasets were curated and aggregated into a unified
multicenter benchmark, FetalUS-188K, comprising more than 188,000 annotated
images from heterogeneous acquisition settings. DINOv3 was pretrained in a
self-supervised manner to learn ultrasound-aware representations. The learned
features were then evaluated through standardized adaptation protocols,
including linear probing with frozen backbone and full fine-tuning, under two
initialization schemes: (i) pretraining on FetalUS-188K and (ii) initialization
from natural-image DINOv3 weights.
  Results: Models pretrained on fetal ultrasound data consistently outperformed
those initialized on natural images, with weighted F1-score improvements of up
to 20 percent. Domain-adaptive pretraining enabled the network to preserve
subtle echogenic and structural cues crucial for distinguishing intermediate
planes such as TV.
  Conclusion: Results demonstrate that generic foundation models fail to
generalize under low inter-class variability, whereas domain-specific
pretraining is essential to achieve robust and clinically reliable
representations in fetal brain ultrasound imaging.

### [3] [Assessing the value of Geo-Foundational Models for Flood Inundation Mapping: Benchmarking models for Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and Planetscope for end-users](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01990)
*Saurabh Kaushik,Lalit Maurya,Elizabeth Tellman,ZhiJie Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Geo-Foundational Models (GFMs) 在洪水淹没制图方面与传统U-Net模型相比，提供了小到中等的精度提升，同时具有更低的计算成本和标注工作量。Clay模型在多个传感器上表现最佳，特别是在少样本场景下优势明显。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管GFMs在从卫星图像中提取时空信息方面具有潜力，但尚不清楚它们是否优于传统模型如U-Net，且缺乏跨传感器和数据可用性场景的系统比较，这对于指导最终用户选择模型至关重要。

Method: 评估了三种GFMs（Prithvi 2.0、Clay V1.5、DOFA）和UViT，与TransNorm、U-Net和Attention U-Net进行比较，使用PlanetScope、Sentinel-1和Sentinel-2数据，进行了跨区域交叉验证和少样本实验。

Result: 所有GFMs表现竞争性，性能差异仅2-5%。Clay在PlanetScope（0.79 mIoU）和Sentinel-2（0.70）上表现最佳，Prithvi在Sentinel-1（0.57）上领先。在跨区域验证中，Clay在所有传感器上表现略好。少样本实验中，Clay仅用5张训练图像就达到0.64 mIoU。Clay模型尺寸小（26M参数），比Prithvi快3倍，比DOFA快2倍。

Conclusion: 与先前研究相反，GFMs在洪水制图精度上相比传统U-Net提供了小到中等的改进，同时计算成本和标注工作量更低。Clay因其较小的模型尺寸和更好的性能成为更好的选择。

Abstract: Geo-Foundational Models (GFMs) enable fast and reliable extraction of
spatiotemporal information from satellite imagery, improving flood inundation
mapping by leveraging location and time embeddings. Despite their potential, it
remains unclear whether GFMs outperform traditional models like U-Net. A
systematic comparison across sensors and data availability scenarios is still
lacking, which is an essential step to guide end-users in model selection. To
address this, we evaluate three GFMs, Prithvi 2.0, Clay V1.5, DOFA, and UViT (a
Prithvi variant), against TransNorm, U-Net, and Attention U-Net using
PlanetScope, Sentinel-1, and Sentinel-2. We observe competitive performance
among all GFMs, with only 2-5% variation between the best and worst models
across sensors. Clay outperforms others on PlanetScope (0.79 mIoU) and
Sentinel-2 (0.70), while Prithvi leads on Sentinel-1 (0.57). In
leave-one-region-out cross-validation across five regions, Clay shows slightly
better performance across all sensors (mIoU: 0.72(0.04), 0.66(0.07),
0.51(0.08)) compared to Prithvi (0.70(0.05), 0.64(0.09), 0.49(0.13)) and DOFA
(0.67(0.07), 0.64(0.04), 0.49(0.09)) for PlanetScope, Sentinel-2, and
Sentinel-1, respectively. Across all 19 sites, leave-one-region-out
cross-validation reveals a 4% improvement by Clay compared to U-Net. Visual
inspection highlights Clay's superior ability to retain fine details. Few-shot
experiments show Clay achieves 0.64 mIoU on PlanetScope with just five training
images, outperforming Prithvi (0.24) and DOFA (0.35). In terms of computational
time, Clay is a better choice due to its smaller model size (26M parameters),
making it ~3x faster than Prithvi (650M) and 2x faster than DOFA (410M).
Contrary to previous findings, our results suggest GFMs offer small to moderate
improvements in flood mapping accuracy at lower computational cost and labeling
effort compared to traditional U-Net.

### [4] [Locally-Supervised Global Image Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01998)
*Benjamin Walder,Daniel Toader,Robert Nuster,Günther Paltauf,Peter Burgholzer,Gregor Langer,Lukas Krainer,Markus Haltmeier*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于学习框架的图像重建方法，适用于上采样和修复任务，能够在固定、确定性采样模式下实现与全监督方法相当的性能，且所需真实数据更少。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统监督方法需要完整采样数据，而自监督方法通常依赖随机采样。本文针对固定、确定性采样模式（即使在期望中也不完整覆盖）的情况，探索图像分布的多种不变性来克服这一限制。

Method: 利用底层图像分布的多种不变性，理论上可以达到与全监督方法相同的重建性能。在光分辨率图像上采样任务中验证方法，应用于光声显微镜图像。

Result: 在光声显微镜图像上采样任务中，展示了竞争性或更优的重建结果，同时需要显著更少的真实数据。

Conclusion: 该方法能够在固定采样模式下实现高质量图像重建，减少了对完整真实数据的依赖，为图像重建任务提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: We address the problem of image reconstruction from incomplete measurements,
encompassing both upsampling and inpainting, within a learning-based framework.
Conventional supervised approaches require fully sampled ground truth data,
while self-supervised methods allow incomplete ground truth but typically rely
on random sampling that, in expectation, covers the entire image. In contrast,
we consider fixed, deterministic sampling patterns with inherently incomplete
coverage, even in expectation. To overcome this limitation, we exploit multiple
invariances of the underlying image distribution, which theoretically allows us
to achieve the same reconstruction performance as fully supervised approaches.
We validate our method on optical-resolution image upsampling in photoacoustic
microscopy (PAM), demonstrating competitive or superior results while requiring
substantially less ground truth data.

### [5] [Towards Selection of Large Multimodal Models as Engines for Burned-in Protected Health Information Detection in Medical Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02014)
*Tuan Truong,Guillermo Jimenez Perez,Pedro Osorio,Matthias Lenga*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文系统评估了三种大型多模态模型（GPT-4o、Gemini 2.5 Flash、Qwen 2.5 7B）在医疗图像中检测受保护健康信息（PHI）的性能，发现LMM在OCR准确率上优于传统模型，但OCR性能提升并不总是带来PHI检测准确率的提高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统PHI检测方法主要依赖OCR模型结合命名实体识别，而新兴的大型多模态模型为改进文本提取和语义分析提供了新机会。

Method: 使用三种LMM模型（GPT-4o、Gemini 2.5 Flash、Qwen 2.5 7B），采用两种管道配置：纯文本分析和OCR+语义分析集成，与传统OCR模型EasyOCR进行对比。

Result: LMM在OCR性能上表现优异（WER: 0.03-0.05, CER: 0.02-0.03），优于EasyOCR，但在复杂印记模式测试案例中表现最佳。当文本区域可读性好且对比度足够时，不同管道配置结果相似。

Conclusion: LMM在OCR方面优于传统模型，但OCR性能提升不一定转化为PHI检测准确率提高。研究提供了基于实证的LMM选择建议和可扩展的模块化部署策略。

Abstract: The detection of Protected Health Information (PHI) in medical imaging is
critical for safeguarding patient privacy and ensuring compliance with
regulatory frameworks. Traditional detection methodologies predominantly
utilize Optical Character Recognition (OCR) models in conjunction with named
entity recognition. However, recent advancements in Large Multimodal Model
(LMM) present new opportunities for enhanced text extraction and semantic
analysis. In this study, we systematically benchmark three prominent closed and
open-sourced LMMs, namely GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Flash, and Qwen 2.5 7B, utilizing
two distinct pipeline configurations: one dedicated to text analysis alone and
another integrating both OCR and semantic analysis. Our results indicate that
LMM exhibits superior OCR efficacy (WER: 0.03-0.05, CER: 0.02-0.03) compared to
conventional models like EasyOCR. However, this improvement in OCR performance
does not consistently correlate with enhanced overall PHI detection accuracy.
The strongest performance gains are observed on test cases with complex imprint
patterns. In scenarios where text regions are well readable with sufficient
contrast, and strong LMMs are employed for text analysis after OCR, different
pipeline configurations yield similar results. Furthermore, we provide
empirically grounded recommendations for LMM selection tailored to specific
operational constraints and propose a deployment strategy that leverages
scalable and modular infrastructure.

### [6] [StrengthSense: A Dataset of IMU Signals Capturing Everyday Strength-Demanding Activities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02027)
*Zeyu Yang,Clayton Souza Leite,Yu Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StrengthSense是一个包含11种力量需求活动和2种非力量需求活动的IMU传感器开放数据集，收集自29名健康受试者，使用10个IMU传感器放置在肢体和躯干上，并通过视频记录进行标注。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前缺乏捕捉力量需求活动的全面数据集，这对于监测肌肉力量、耐力和力量至关重要。

Method: 使用10个IMU传感器收集29名健康受试者的活动数据，包括11种力量需求活动和2种非力量需求活动，通过视频记录进行标注，并对IMU估计的关节角度与视频提取的角度进行比较分析。

Result: 数据集提供了全面的数据收集、预处理和技术验证概述，验证了传感器数据的准确性和可靠性。

Conclusion: 研究人员和开发者可以利用StrengthSense数据集推进人类活动识别算法的发展，创建健身和健康监测应用等。

Abstract: Tracking strength-demanding activities with wearable sensors like IMUs is
crucial for monitoring muscular strength, endurance, and power. However, there
is a lack of comprehensive datasets capturing these activities. To fill this
gap, we introduce \textit{StrengthSense}, an open dataset that encompasses IMU
signals capturing 11 strength-demanding activities, such as sit-to-stand,
climbing stairs, and mopping. For comparative purposes, the dataset also
includes 2 non-strength demanding activities. The dataset was collected from 29
healthy subjects utilizing 10 IMUs placed on limbs and the torso, and was
annotated using video recordings as references. This paper provides a
comprehensive overview of the data collection, pre-processing, and technical
validation. We conducted a comparative analysis between the joint angles
estimated by IMUs and those directly extracted from video to verify the
accuracy and reliability of the sensor data. Researchers and developers can
utilize \textit{StrengthSense} to advance the development of human activity
recognition algorithms, create fitness and health monitoring applications, and
more.

### [7] [Text-VQA Aug: Pipelined Harnessing of Large Multimodal Models for Automated Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02046)
*Soham Joshi,Shwet Kamal Mishra,Viswanath Gopalakrishnan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一个自动化合成文本视觉问答数据集的端到端流水线，利用OCR、区域检测、字幕生成和问题生成等技术，能够生成约72K个基于44K图像的QA对。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建大规模文本VQA数据集需要大量人工标注，过程繁琐且具有挑战性。随着基础模型和OCR技术的成熟，需要建立自动化流水线来合成基于场景文本的QA对。

Method: 整合OCR检测识别、感兴趣区域检测、字幕生成和问题生成等多个模型和算法，构建一个统一的流水线来自动合成和验证QA对。

Result: 成功构建了包含约72K个QA对的大规模文本VQA数据集，基于约44K张图像，这是首个自动合成和验证的大规模文本VQA数据集。

Conclusion: 提出的自动化流水线能够高效生成忠实于场景文本的QA对，并随着场景文本数据的可用性而扩展，为文本VQA任务提供了大规模数据集解决方案。

Abstract: Creation of large-scale databases for Visual Question Answering tasks
pertaining to the text data in a scene (text-VQA) involves skilful human
annotation, which is tedious and challenging. With the advent of foundation
models that handle vision and language modalities, and with the maturity of OCR
systems, it is the need of the hour to establish an end-to-end pipeline that
can synthesize Question-Answer (QA) pairs based on scene-text from a given
image. We propose a pipeline for automated synthesis for text-VQA dataset that
can produce faithful QA pairs, and which scales up with the availability of
scene text data. Our proposed method harnesses the capabilities of multiple
models and algorithms involving OCR detection and recognition (text spotting),
region of interest (ROI) detection, caption generation, and question
generation. These components are streamlined into a cohesive pipeline to
automate the synthesis and validation of QA pairs. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first pipeline proposed to automatically synthesize and
validate a large-scale text-VQA dataset comprising around 72K QA pairs based on
around 44K images.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 开发并临床评估了基于头戴式显示器的仅深度、无标记增强现实配准管道，在真实手术环境中评估了在小或低曲率解剖结构上的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估在小型或低曲率解剖结构上使用仅深度、无标记AR配准管道的准确性，以改进无标记AR引导的临床准备度。

Method: 在HoloLens 2上，通过深度偏差校正、人工初始化、全局和局部配准，将AHAT深度数据与CT皮肤网格对齐。在腿和足模型上验证表面追踪误差度量，并在手术中进行7次靶点试验。

Result: 临床前验证显示AR追踪与CT距离紧密一致。临床中，每点误差中位数为3.9mm，不同解剖部位的中位误差分别为：足3.2mm、耳4.3mm、小腿5.3mm，5mm覆盖率分别为92-95%、84-90%、72-86%。

Conclusion: 仅深度、无标记AR管道在活体手术环境中实现了约3-4mm的中位误差，接近中等风险任务的典型临床误差阈值，提高了无标记AR引导的临床准备度。

Abstract: Purpose: In this paper, we develop and clinically evaluate a depth-only,
markerless augmented reality (AR) registration pipeline on a head-mounted
display, and assess accuracy across small or low-curvature anatomies in
real-life operative settings. Methods: On HoloLens 2, we align Articulated HAnd
Tracking (AHAT) depth to Computed Tomography (CT)-derived skin meshes via (i)
depth-bias correction, (ii) brief human-in-the-loop initialization, (iii)
global and local registration. We validated the surface-tracing error metric by
comparing "skin-to-bone" relative distances to CT ground truth on leg and foot
models, using an AR-tracked tool. We then performed seven intraoperative target
trials (feet x2, ear x3, leg x2) during the initial stage of fibula free-flap
harvest and mandibular reconstruction surgery, and collected 500+ data per
trial. Results: Preclinical validation showed tight agreement between AR-traced
and CT distances (leg: median |Delta d| 0.78 mm, RMSE 0.97 mm; feet: 0.80 mm,
1.20 mm). Clinically, per-point error had a median of 3.9 mm. Median errors by
anatomy were 3.2 mm (feet), 4.3 mm (ear), and 5.3 mm (lower leg), with 5 mm
coverage 92-95%, 84-90%, and 72-86%, respectively. Feet vs. lower leg differed
significantly (Delta median ~1.1 mm; p < 0.001). Conclusion: A depth-only,
markerless AR pipeline on HMDs achieved ~3-4 mm median error across feet, ear,
and lower leg in live surgical settings without fiducials, approaching typical
clinical error thresholds for moderate-risk tasks. Human-guided initialization
plus global-to-local registration enabled accurate alignment on small or
low-curvature targets, improving the clinical readiness of markerless AR
guidance.

### [9] [From Instance Segmentation to 3D Growth Trajectory Reconstruction in Planktonic Foraminifera](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02142)
*Huahua Lin,Xiaohao Cai,Mark Nixon,James M. Mulqueeney,Thomas H. G. Ezard*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个端到端的自动化流程，结合实例分割和专门的腔室排序算法，从高分辨率CT扫描中自动重建浮游有孔虫的三维生长轨迹，显著减少了人工工作量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 浮游有孔虫是重要的环境指标生物，了解其腔室生长轨迹对研究生物发育和生态适应至关重要，但现有的手动分割方法耗时且主观。

Method: 集成实例分割技术和专门的腔室排序算法，定量和定性评估多种针对不同腔室空间特征优化的实例分割方法。

Result: 在专家标注的数据集上，该流程在保持生物学意义准确性的同时显著减少了人工工作量。虽然分割模型在较小腔室中存在欠分割问题，但腔室排序算法仍然稳健。

Conclusion: 这是首个完全自动化和可复现的数字有孔虫生长分析流程，为大规模数据驱动的生态研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Planktonic foraminifera, marine protists characterized by their intricate
chambered shells, serve as valuable indicators of past and present
environmental conditions. Understanding their chamber growth trajectory
provides crucial insights into organismal development and ecological adaptation
under changing environments. However, automated tracing of chamber growth from
imaging data remains largely unexplored, with existing approaches relying
heavily on manual segmentation of each chamber, which is time-consuming and
subjective. In this study, we propose an end-to-end pipeline that integrates
instance segmentation, a computer vision technique not extensively explored in
foraminifera, with a dedicated chamber ordering algorithm to automatically
reconstruct three-dimensional growth trajectories from high-resolution computed
tomography scans. We quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate multiple
instance segmentation methods, each optimized for distinct spatial features of
the chambers, and examine their downstream influence on growth-order
reconstruction accuracy. Experimental results on expert-annotated datasets
demonstrate that the proposed pipeline substantially reduces manual effort
while maintaining biologically meaningful accuracy. Although segmentation
models exhibit under-segmentation in smaller chambers due to reduced voxel
fidelity and subtle inter-chamber connectivity, the chamber-ordering algorithm
remains robust, achieving consistent reconstruction of developmental
trajectories even under partial segmentation. This work provides the first
fully automated and reproducible pipeline for digital foraminiferal growth
analysis, establishing a foundation for large-scale, data-driven ecological
studies.

*Zhicheng Wang,Junbiao Pang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合PCA和RPCA的级联框架，用于从数字图像中高效提取路面裂缝宽度，解决了传统方法在复杂裂缝形态和快速测量方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确量化路面裂缝宽度对评估结构完整性和指导维护至关重要，但传统方法在复杂裂缝边界形态和快速测量需求方面存在局限。

Method: 三阶段级联框架：1) 使用现有检测算法进行初始裂缝分割；2) 通过PCA确定准平行裂缝的主方向轴；3) 使用RPCA提取不规则裂缝几何的主传播轴。

Result: 在三个公开数据集上的综合评估表明，该方法在计算效率和测量精度方面均优于现有最先进技术。

Conclusion: 所提出的PCA-RPCA级联框架能够有效解决路面裂缝宽度测量的挑战，为路面状况评估提供了高效准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate quantification of pavement crack width plays a pivotal role in
assessing structural integrity and guiding maintenance interventions. However,
achieving precise crack width measurements presents significant challenges due
to: (1) the complex, non-uniform morphology of crack boundaries, which limits
the efficacy of conventional approaches, and (2) the demand for rapid
measurement capabilities from arbitrary pixel locations to facilitate
comprehensive pavement condition evaluation. To overcome these limitations,
this study introduces a cascaded framework integrating Principal Component
Analysis (PCA) and Robust PCA (RPCA) for efficient crack width extraction from
digital images. The proposed methodology comprises three sequential stages: (1)
initial crack segmentation using established detection algorithms to generate a
binary representation, (2) determination of the primary orientation axis for
quasi-parallel cracks through PCA, and (3) extraction of the Main Propagation
Axis (MPA) for irregular crack geometries using RPCA. Comprehensive evaluations
were conducted across three publicly available datasets, demonstrating that the
proposed approach achieves superior performance in both computational
efficiency and measurement accuracy compared to existing state-of-the-art
techniques.

### [11] [Autobiasing Event Cameras for Flickering Mitigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02180)
*Mehdi Sefidgar Dilmaghani,Waseem Shariff,Cian Ryan,Joe Lemley,Peter Corcoran*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于CNN的自适应偏置调节机制，通过动态调整事件相机的偏置设置来抑制25-500Hz范围内的闪烁效应，无需额外硬件或软件滤波。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决事件相机在不同光照环境下因光强快速变化产生的闪烁问题，提升事件相机在恶劣光照条件下的性能表现。

Method: 利用卷积神经网络在空间域识别闪烁现象，并动态调整事件相机的特定偏置参数来最小化闪烁影响。

Result: 在人脸检测框架中测试显示：YOLO置信度提升，检测到人脸的帧数比例增加，平均梯度（闪烁指标）在强光下降低38.2%，弱光下降低53.6%。

Conclusion: 该方法能显著提升事件相机在多种不利光照场景下的功能性，为事件相机应用提供了有效的闪烁抑制解决方案。

Abstract: Understanding and mitigating flicker effects caused by rapid variations in
light intensity is critical for enhancing the performance of event cameras in
diverse environments. This paper introduces an innovative autonomous mechanism
for tuning the biases of event cameras, effectively addressing flicker across a
wide frequency range -25 Hz to 500 Hz. Unlike traditional methods that rely on
additional hardware or software for flicker filtering, our approach leverages
the event cameras inherent bias settings. Utilizing a simple Convolutional
Neural Networks -CNNs, the system identifies instances of flicker in a spatial
space and dynamically adjusts specific biases to minimize its impact. The
efficacy of this autobiasing system was robustly tested using a face detector
framework under both well-lit and low-light conditions, as well as across
various frequencies. The results demonstrated significant improvements:
enhanced YOLO confidence metrics for face detection, and an increased
percentage of frames capturing detected faces. Moreover, the average gradient,
which serves as an indicator of flicker presence through edge detection,
decreased by 38.2 percent in well-lit conditions and by 53.6 percent in
low-light conditions. These findings underscore the potential of our approach
to significantly improve the functionality of event cameras in a range of
adverse lighting scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个用于Grounded Video QA任务的三阶段框架，通过引入触发时刻概念来改进视觉定位和跟踪性能，在ICCV 2025挑战赛上显著提升了HOTA分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GVQA任务需要强大的多模态模型来进行复杂的视频内容推理，并对答案进行视觉定位和时间跟踪。

Method: 将GVQA任务分解为三阶段流程：视频推理与问答、时空定位、跟踪，并引入基于CORTEX提示的触发时刻概念来精确定位目标对象最明显的帧。

Result: 实现了0.4968的HOTA分数，相比去年获胜分数0.2704有显著提升。

Conclusion: 提出的三阶段框架和触发时刻概念有效提升了GVQA任务的性能，为视频问答中的视觉定位和跟踪提供了稳健的解决方案。

Abstract: In this technical report, we introduce a framework to address Grounded Video
Question Answering (GVQA) task for the ICCV 2025 Perception Test Challenge. The
GVQA task demands robust multimodal models capable of complex reasoning over
video content, grounding the resulting answers visually, and tracking the
referenced objects temporally. To achieve this capability, our proposed
approach decomposes the GVQA task into a three-stage pipeline: (1) Video
Reasoning \& QA, (2) Spatio-temporal Grounding and (3) Tracking. Our key
contribution is the introduction of a trigger moment, derived from our proposed
CORTEX prompt, which pinpoints the single most visible frame of a target object
to serve as a robust anchor for grounding and tracking. To this end, we achieve
the HOTA score of 0.4968, which marks a significant improvement over the
previous year's winning score of 0.2704 on GVQA task.

Abstract: Accurate detection of retinal vessels plays a critical role in reflecting a
wide range of health status indicators in the clinical diagnosis of ocular
diseases. Recently, advances in deep learning have led to a surge in retinal
vessel segmentation methods, which have significantly contributed to the
quantitative analysis of vascular morphology. However, retinal vasculature
differs significantly from conventional segmentation targets in that it
consists of extremely thin and branching structures, whose global morphology
varies greatly across images. These characteristics continue to pose challenges
to segmentation precision and robustness. To address these issues, we propose
MM-UNet, a novel architecture tailored for efficient retinal vessel
segmentation. The model incorporates Morph Mamba Convolution layers, which
replace pointwise convolutions to enhance branching topological perception
through morph, state-aware feature sampling. Additionally, Reverse Selective
State Guidance modules integrate reverse guidance theory with state-space
modeling to improve geometric boundary awareness and decoding efficiency.
Extensive experiments conducted on two public retinal vessel segmentation
datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method in
segmentation accuracy. Compared to the existing approaches, MM-UNet achieves
F1-score gains of 1.64 $\%$ on DRIVE and 1.25 $\%$ on STARE, demonstrating its
effectiveness and advancement. The project code is public via

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿尔茨海默病诊断依赖淀粉样蛋白PET成像，但成本高且可及性有限。研究探索是否可以从血液生物标志物和MRI扫描预测PET空间模式。

Method: 收集566名参与者的PET、MRI和血液生物标志物数据，开发基于大语言模型和多模态信息融合的语言增强生成模型来合成PET图像，并在全自动诊断流程中评估合成图像。

Result: 合成PET图像在结构细节和区域模式上与真实PET高度相似，诊断准确性达0.80。基于合成PET的模型性能优于仅使用MRI或血液生物标志物的模型，AUC分别达到0.78、0.68和0.73。

Conclusion: 语言增强生成模型能合成逼真的PET图像，增强了MRI和血液生物标志物在淀粉样蛋白空间模式评估中的实用性，改善了阿尔茨海默病的诊断流程。

Abstract: Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis heavily relies on amyloid-beta
positron emission tomography (Abeta-PET), which is limited by high cost and
limited accessibility. This study explores whether Abeta-PET spatial patterns
can be predicted from blood-based biomarkers (BBMs) and MRI scans. Methods: We
collected Abeta-PET images, T1-weighted MRI scans, and BBMs from 566
participants. A language-enhanced generative model, driven by a large language
model (LLM) and multimodal information fusion, was developed to synthesize PET
images. Synthesized images were evaluated for image quality, diagnostic
consistency, and clinical applicability within a fully automated diagnostic
pipeline. Findings: The synthetic PET images closely resemble real PET scans in
both structural details (SSIM = 0.920 +/- 0.003) and regional patterns
(Pearson's r = 0.955 +/- 0.007). Diagnostic outcomes using synthetic PET show
high agreement with real PET-based diagnoses (accuracy = 0.80). Using synthetic
PET, we developed a fully automatic AD diagnostic pipeline integrating PET
synthesis and classification. The synthetic PET-based model (AUC = 0.78)
outperforms T1-based (AUC = 0.68) and BBM-based (AUC = 0.73) models, while
combining synthetic PET and BBMs further improved performance (AUC = 0.79).
Ablation analysis supports the advantages of LLM integration and prompt
engineering. Interpretation: Our language-enhanced generative model synthesizes
realistic PET images, enhancing the utility of MRI and BBMs for Abeta spatial
pattern assessment and improving the diagnostic workflow for Alzheimer's
disease.

Motivation: 传统植物表型分析方法耗时费力且具有破坏性，而现有3D重建方法包含背景噪声，影响草莓植株性状分析的准确性和效率。

Method: 结合Segment Anything Model v2进行前景分割和alpha通道背景掩码，使用3D高斯泼溅技术进行对象中心重建，通过DBSCAN聚类和PCA自动提取植株高度和冠层宽度等表型参数。

Abstract: Strawberries are among the most economically significant fruits in the United
States, generating over $2 billion in annual farm-gate sales and accounting for
approximately 13% of the total fruit production value. Plant phenotyping plays
a vital role in selecting superior cultivars by characterizing plant traits
such as morphology, canopy structure, and growth dynamics. However, traditional
plant phenotyping methods are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and often
destructive. Recently, neural rendering techniques, notably Neural Radiance
Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), have emerged as powerful
frameworks for high-fidelity 3D reconstruction. By capturing a sequence of
multi-view images or videos around a target plant, these methods enable
non-destructive reconstruction of complex plant architectures. Despite their
promise, most current applications of 3DGS in agricultural domains reconstruct
the entire scene, including background elements, which introduces noise,
increases computational costs, and complicates downstream trait analysis. To
address this limitation, we propose a novel object-centric 3D reconstruction
framework incorporating a preprocessing pipeline that leverages the Segment
Anything Model v2 (SAM-2) and alpha channel background masking to achieve clean
strawberry plant reconstructions. This approach produces more accurate
geometric representations while substantially reducing computational time. With
a background-free reconstruction, our algorithm can automatically estimate
important plant traits, such as plant height and canopy width, using DBSCAN
clustering and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Experimental results show
that our method outperforms conventional pipelines in both accuracy and
efficiency, offering a scalable and non-destructive solution for strawberry
plant phenotyping.

TL;DR: 本研究开发了首个自动化管道autoStrain，使用深度学习技术自动估计经食管超声心动图(TEE)中的节段纵向应变(SLS)，通过比较TeeFlow和TeeTracker两种方法，发现TeeTracker在准确性上表现更优，临床验证显示与临床参考值高度一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前左心室节段纵向应变的估计技术需要大量人工干预和专业经验，限制了其效率和监测应用。需要开发自动化解决方案来提高心脏功能评估的精确性和效率。

Method: 使用深度学习运动估计方法，比较了两种方法：基于RAFT光流模型的TeeFlow（密集帧间预测）和基于CoTracker点轨迹模型的TeeTracker（稀疏长序列预测）。利用SIMUS模拟管道生成80名患者的合成TEE数据集进行训练和评估。

Result: TeeTracker在合成TEE测试数据集上的运动估计平均距离误差为0.65mm，优于TeeFlow。临床验证显示SLS估计与临床参考值平均差异为1.09%（-8.90%至11.09%）。模拟缺血数据提高了模型量化异常变形的准确性。

Conclusion: 将AI驱动的运动估计与TEE结合可以显著提高临床环境中心脏功能评估的精确性和效率，为自动化心脏应变分析提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Segmental longitudinal strain (SLS) of the left ventricle (LV) is an
important prognostic indicator for evaluating regional LV dysfunction, in
particular for diagnosing and managing myocardial ischemia. Current techniques
for strain estimation require significant manual intervention and expertise,
limiting their efficiency and making them too resource-intensive for monitoring
purposes. This study introduces the first automated pipeline, autoStrain, for
SLS estimation in transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) using deep learning
(DL) methods for motion estimation. We present a comparative analysis of two DL
approaches: TeeFlow, based on the RAFT optical flow model for dense
frame-to-frame predictions, and TeeTracker, based on the CoTracker point
trajectory model for sparse long-sequence predictions.
  As ground truth motion data from real echocardiographic sequences are hardly
accessible, we took advantage of a unique simulation pipeline (SIMUS) to
generate a highly realistic synthetic TEE (synTEE) dataset of 80 patients with
ground truth myocardial motion to train and evaluate both models. Our
evaluation shows that TeeTracker outperforms TeeFlow in accuracy, achieving a
mean distance error in motion estimation of 0.65 mm on a synTEE test dataset.
  Clinical validation on 16 patients further demonstrated that SLS estimation
with our autoStrain pipeline aligned with clinical references, achieving a mean
difference (95\% limits of agreement) of 1.09% (-8.90% to 11.09%).
Incorporation of simulated ischemia in the synTEE data improved the accuracy of
the models in quantifying abnormal deformation. Our findings indicate that
integrating AI-driven motion estimation with TEE can significantly enhance the
precision and efficiency of cardiac function assessment in clinical settings.

Conclusion: 基础模型有潜力改变移动稀疏感知的格局，但集成到移动稀疏感知系统中仍存在开放挑战。

Abstract: Mobile sensing systems have long faced a fundamental trade-off between
sensing quality and efficiency due to constraints in computation, power, and
other limitations. Sparse sensing, which aims to acquire and process only a
subset of sensor data, has been a key strategy for maintaining performance
under such constraints. However, existing sparse sensing methods often suffer
from reduced accuracy, as missing information across space and time introduces
uncertainty into many sensing systems. In this work, we investigate whether
foundation models can change the landscape of mobile sparse sensing. Using
real-world mobile AR data, our evaluations demonstrate that foundation models
offer significant improvements in geometry-aware image warping, a central
technique for enabling accurate reuse of cross-frame information. Furthermore,
our study demonstrates the scalability of foundation model-based sparse sensing
and shows its leading performance in 3D scene reconstruction. Collectively, our
study reveals critical aspects of the promises and the open challenges of
integrating foundation models into mobile sparse sensing systems.

Conclusion: 该框架通过有效整合多模态特征并解决模态分布差异问题，为阿尔茨海默病的早期诊断提供了更准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia, and its
early diagnosis is essential for slowing disease progression. Recent studies on
multimodal neuroimaging fusion using MRI and PET have achieved promising
results by integrating multi-scale complementary features. However, most
existing approaches primarily emphasize cross-modal complementarity while
overlooking the diagnostic importance of modality-specific features. In
addition, the inherent distributional differences between modalities often lead
to biased and noisy representations, degrading classification performance. To
address these challenges, we propose a Collaborative Attention and
Consistent-Guided Fusion framework for MRI and PET based AD diagnosis. The
proposed model introduces a learnable parameter representation (LPR) block to
compensate for missing modality information, followed by a shared encoder and
modality-independent encoders to preserve both shared and specific
representations. Furthermore, a consistency-guided mechanism is employed to
explicitly align the latent distributions across modalities. Experimental
results on the ADNI dataset demonstrate that our method achieves superior
diagnostic performance compared with existing fusion strategies.

Conclusion: 提出的潜在特征对齐方法有效减少了域差距，显著提升了内窥镜场景中的绝对深度估计精度。

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation (MDE) is a critical task to guide autonomous
medical robots. However, obtaining absolute (metric) depth from an endoscopy
camera in surgical scenes is difficult, which limits supervised learning of
depth on real endoscopic images. Current image-level unsupervised domain
adaptation methods translate synthetic images with known depth maps into the
style of real endoscopic frames and train depth networks using these translated
images with their corresponding depth maps. However a domain gap often remains
between real and translated synthetic images. In this paper, we present a
latent feature alignment method to improve absolute depth estimation by
reducing this domain gap in the context of endoscopic videos of the central
airway. Our methods are agnostic to the image translation process and focus on
the depth estimation itself. Specifically, the depth network takes translated
synthetic and real endoscopic frames as input and learns latent
domain-invariant features via adversarial learning and directional feature
consistency. The evaluation is conducted on endoscopic videos of central airway
phantoms with manually aligned absolute depth maps. Compared to
state-of-the-art MDE methods, our approach achieves superior performance on
both absolute and relative depth metrics, and consistently improves results
across various backbones and pretrained weights. Our code is available at

Motivation: 现有医学报告生成模型面临三个主要挑战：领域知识理解不足、文本-视觉实体嵌入对齐差、跨模态偏差导致的伪相关。之前的工作只解决单个挑战，本文旨在同时解决所有三个挑战。

Method: HTSC-CIF框架将挑战分为三个层次：低层任务（对齐医学实体特征与空间位置）、中层任务（使用前缀语言建模和掩码图像建模增强跨模态对齐）、高层任务（跨模态因果干预模块减少混杂因素）。

Result: 大量实验证实HTSC-CIF的有效性，显著优于现有的最先进医学报告生成方法。

Conclusion: HTSC-CIF框架通过分层任务分解成功解决了医学报告生成的三个关键挑战，在性能上显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Medical Report Generation (MRG) is a key part of modern medical diagnostics,
as it automatically generates reports from radiological images to reduce
radiologists' burden. However, reliable MRG models for lesion description face
three main challenges: insufficient domain knowledge understanding, poor
text-visual entity embedding alignment, and spurious correlations from
cross-modal biases. Previous work only addresses single challenges, while this
paper tackles all three via a novel hierarchical task decomposition approach,
proposing the HTSC-CIF framework. HTSC-CIF classifies the three challenges into
low-, mid-, and high-level tasks: 1) Low-level: align medical entity features
with spatial locations to enhance domain knowledge for visual encoders; 2)
Mid-level: use Prefix Language Modeling (text) and Masked Image Modeling
(images) to boost cross-modal alignment via mutual guidance; 3) High-level: a
cross-modal causal intervention module (via front-door intervention) to reduce
confounders and improve interpretability. Extensive experiments confirm
HTSC-CIF's effectiveness, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art (SOTA)
MRG methods. Code will be made public upon paper acceptance.

Motivation: 物体姿态估计在3D计算机视觉中很重要，但单一姿态估计在传感器约束或物体对称性导致姿态不明确时不够，需要概率性姿态输出。

Method: 使用欧拉角参数化作为归一化流模型的基础，探索其在姿态估计中的应用价值。

Result: 欧拉角参数化尽管有缺点，但在某些方面可能比复杂参数化产生更有用的模型。

Conclusion: 欧拉角参数化在物体姿态估计的归一化流模型中具有实用价值，值得进一步探索。

Abstract: Object pose estimation is a task that is of central importance in 3D Computer
Vision. Given a target image and a canonical pose, a single point estimate may
very often be sufficient; however, a probabilistic pose output is related to a
number of benefits when pose is not unambiguous due to sensor and projection
constraints or inherent object symmetries. With this paper, we explore the
usefulness of using the well-known Euler angles parameterisation as a basis for
a Normalizing Flows model for pose estimation. Isomorphic to spatial rotation,
3D pose has been parameterized in a number of ways, either in or out of the
context of parameter estimation. We explore the idea that Euler angles, despite
their shortcomings, may lead to useful models in a number of aspects, compared
to a model built on a more complex parameterisation.

Motivation: 现有方法受到结果监督的限制，只奖励正确答案而不确保推理过程的合理性，且采用统一的思考策略，导致简单任务过度思考而复杂任务思考不足。

Method: SAIL-RL采用双奖励系统：思考奖励通过事实基础、逻辑一致性和答案一致性来评估推理质量；判断奖励自适应地决定是进行深度推理还是直接回答。

Conclusion: SAIL-RL为构建更可靠和自适应的多模态大语言模型提供了一个原则性框架。

Abstract: We introduce SAIL-RL, a reinforcement learning (RL) post-training framework
that enhances the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) by teaching them when and how to think. Existing approaches are limited
by outcome-only supervision, which rewards correct answers without ensuring
sound reasoning, and by uniform thinking strategies, which often lead to
overthinking on simple tasks and underthinking on complex ones. SAIL-RL
addresses these challenges with a dual reward system: the Thinking Reward,
which evaluates reasoning quality through factual grounding, logical coherence,
and answer consistency, and the Judging Reward, which adaptively determines
whether deep reasoning or direct answering is appropriate. Experiments on the
state-of-the-art SAIL-VL2 show that SAIL-RL improves reasoning and multimodal
understanding benchmarks at both 4B and 8B scales, achieving competitive
performance against commercial closed-source models such as GPT-4o, and
substantially reduces hallucinations, establishing it as a principled framework
for building more reliable and adaptive MLLMs. The code will be available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的相机姿态估计方法通常依赖束调整，计算复杂且对异常值敏感。本文旨在开发一个鲁棒的全局框架，利用循环一致性信息来简化相机姿态估计过程。

Method: 1. 改进MPLS方法，强调循环一致性信息；2. 使用前次迭代估计的距离重新定义循环一致性；3. 引入Welsch型鲁棒损失函数；4. 集成基于鲁棒子空间恢复的异常值剔除模块；5. 将循环一致性完全整合到旋转同步中。

Conclusion: Cycle-Sync提供了一个鲁棒的全局相机姿态估计框架，通过循环一致性实现了优异的性能，避免了束调整的需要，在理论和实验上都表现出色。

Abstract: We introduce Cycle-Sync, a robust and global framework for estimating camera
poses (both rotations and locations). Our core innovation is a location solver
that adapts message-passing least squares (MPLS) -- originally developed for
group synchronization -- to camera location estimation. We modify MPLS to
emphasize cycle-consistent information, redefine cycle consistencies using
estimated distances from previous iterations, and incorporate a Welsch-type
robust loss. We establish the strongest known deterministic exact-recovery
guarantee for camera location estimation, showing that cycle consistency alone
-- without access to inter-camera distances -- suffices to achieve the lowest
sample complexity currently known. To further enhance robustness, we introduce
a plug-and-play outlier rejection module inspired by robust subspace recovery,
and we fully integrate cycle consistency into MPLS for rotation
synchronization. Our global approach avoids the need for bundle adjustment.
Experiments on synthetic and real datasets show that Cycle-Sync consistently
outperforms leading pose estimators, including full structure-from-motion
pipelines with bundle adjustment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有后处理OOD检测方法往往忽略特征与logits之间的内在相关性，而这对有效的OOD检测至关重要。

Method: 1. 基于分类权重进行全局感知特征解耦，提取正相关特征和负相关特征；2. 自适应融合解耦特征与多尺度logit置信度。

Result: 在大规模基准测试中表现出竞争性性能和强泛化能力。

Conclusion: GAFD-CC方法通过利用特征-logits相关性，在OOD检测方面优于现有最先进方法。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is paramount to ensuring the reliability
and robustness of learning models in real-world applications. Existing post-hoc
OOD detection methods detect OOD samples by leveraging their features and
logits information without retraining. However, they often overlook the
inherent correlation between features and logits, which is crucial for
effective OOD detection. To address this limitation, we propose Global-Aware
Feature Decoupling with Confidence Calibration (GAFD-CC). GAFD-CC aims to
refine decision boundaries and increase discriminative performance. Firstly, it
performs global-aware feature decoupling guided by classification weights. This
involves aligning features with the direction of global classification weights
to decouple them. From this, GAFD-CC extracts two types of critical
information: positively correlated features that promote in-distribution
(ID)/OOD boundary refinement and negatively correlated features that suppress
false positives and tighten these boundaries. Secondly, it adaptively fuses
these decoupled features with multi-scale logit-based confidence for
comprehensive and robust OOD detection. Extensive experiments on large-scale
benchmarks demonstrate GAFD-CC's competitive performance and strong
generalization ability compared to those of state-of-the-art methods.

challenges caused by motion artifacts, lighting variations, and single-view
constraints. Few studies have demonstrated reliable application to
cardiovascular patients, and no widely used open datasets exist for
cross-device accuracy. To address these limitations, we introduce the M3PD
dataset, the first publicly available dual-view mobile photoplethysmography
dataset, comprising synchronized facial and fingertip videos captured
simultaneously via front and rear smartphone cameras from 60 participants
(including 47 cardiovascular patients). Building on this dual-view setting, we
further propose F3Mamba, which fuses the facial and fingertip views through
Mamba-based temporal modeling. The model reduces heart-rate error by 21.9 to
30.2 percent over existing single-view baselines while improving robustness in
challenging real-world scenarios. Data and code:

### [27] [CoCoVa: Chain of Continuous Vision-Language Thought for Latent Space Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02360)
*Jizheng Ma,Xiaofei Zhou,Yanlong Song,Han Yan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoCoVa是一个新颖的视觉语言模型框架，通过连续跨模态推理解决传统VLMs在离散语言空间中推理的局限性，使用潜在思维向量链进行迭代推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类认知中存在许多难以用语言表达的隐性思维过程，而当前的视觉语言模型被限制在离散的语言标记空间中推理，这限制了视觉感知的丰富多维特性。

Method: 采用迭代推理循环，使用新颖的Latent Q-Former作为动态推理引擎，通过跨模态融合迭代优化潜在思维向量链；引入token选择机制动态识别显著视觉区域；使用对比学习和基于扩散的重构多任务目标训练模型。

Result: CoCoVa在准确性和token效率上优于强基线模型。使用1.5B骨干网络时，在几乎所有基准测试中与或超过7B-9B大模型；扩展到7B LLM骨干时仍保持与最先进模型的竞争力。

Conclusion: 定性分析验证了学习的潜在空间能够捕捉可解释的结构化推理模式，凸显了CoCoVa在弥合离散语言处理与连续视觉理解之间表征差距的潜力。

Abstract: In human cognition, there exist numerous thought processes that are tacit and
beyond verbal expression, enabling us to understand and interact with the world
in multiple ways. However, contemporary Vision-Language Models (VLMs) remain
constrained to reasoning within the discrete and rigid space of linguistic
tokens, thereby bottlenecking the rich, high-dimensional nature of visual
perception. To bridge this gap, we propose CoCoVa (Chain of Continuous
Vision-Language Thought), a novel framework for vision-language model that
leverages continuous cross-modal reasoning for diverse vision-language tasks.
The core of CoCoVa is an iterative reasoning cycle, where a novel Latent
Q-Former (LQ-Former) acts as a dynamic reasoning engine, iteratively refining a
chain of latent thought vectors through cross-modal fusion. To focus this
process, a token selection mechanism dynamically identifies salient visual
regions, mimicking attentional focus. To ensure these latent thoughts remain
grounded, we train the model with a multi-task objective that combines
contrastive learning and diffusion-based reconstruction, enforcing alignment
between latent representations and both visual and textual modalities.
Evaluations show CoCoVa improves accuracy and token efficiency over strong
baselines. With a 1.5B backbone, it competes with or surpasses larger 7B-9B
models on almost all benchmarks. When scaled to 7B LLM backbones, it remains
competitive with state-of-the-art models. Qualitative analysis validates that
learned latent space captures interpretable and structured reasoning patterns,
highlighting the potential of CoCoVa to bridge the representational gap between
discrete language processing and the continuous nature of visual understanding.

TL;DR: 提出了RxnCaption框架，将化学反应图解析任务重新定义为图像描述问题，使用BIVP策略和MolYOLO分子检测器，在RxnCaption-11k数据集上实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有化学反应数据多以图像形式存在于论文中，无法被机器读取和用于机器学习模型训练，需要开发能够解析化学文献中反应图的方法。

Method: 将传统的坐标预测驱动解析过程重新定义为图像描述问题，引入BIVP策略，使用MolYOLO分子检测器在输入图像上预绘制分子边界框和索引，将下游解析转化为自然语言描述问题。

Result: BIVP策略显著提高了结构提取质量并简化了模型设计，RxnCaption-VL在多个指标上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法、数据集和模型将推进化学文献中结构化信息提取，并催化化学领域更广泛的人工智能应用。

Abstract: Large-scale chemical reaction datasets are crucial for AI research in
chemistry. However, existing chemical reaction data often exist as images
within papers, making them not machine-readable and unusable for training
machine learning models. In response to this challenge, we propose the
RxnCaption framework for the task of chemical Reaction Diagram Parsing (RxnDP).
Our framework reformulates the traditional coordinate prediction driven parsing
process into an image captioning problem, which Large Vision-Language Models
(LVLMs) handle naturally. We introduce a strategy termed "BBox and Index as
Visual Prompt" (BIVP), which uses our state-of-the-art molecular detector,
MolYOLO, to pre-draw molecular bounding boxes and indices directly onto the
input image. This turns the downstream parsing into a natural-language
description problem. Extensive experiments show that the BIVP strategy
significantly improves structural extraction quality while simplifying model
design. We further construct the RxnCaption-11k dataset, an order of magnitude
larger than prior real-world literature benchmarks, with a balanced test subset
across four layout archetypes. Experiments demonstrate that RxnCaption-VL
achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple metrics. We believe our
method, dataset, and models will advance structured information extraction from
chemical literature and catalyze broader AI applications in chemistry. We will
release data, models, and code on GitHub.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于稀疏噪声雷达点云的自监督运动物体分割方法，通过对比学习和聚类损失预训练网络，再用少量标注数据微调，显著提升了标签效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 雷达传感器可直接测量点云的多普勒速度，适合单次扫描的运动物体分割，但雷达点云稀疏噪声大，人工标注成本高昂。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：首先使用基于聚类的对比自监督表示学习预训练网络，然后使用有限标注数据进行监督微调。

Result: 该方法提高了标签效率，通过自监督预训练有效提升了最先进方法的性能。

Conclusion: 自监督预训练是解决雷达点云标注困难的有效方法，能够显著提升运动物体分割的性能和效率。

Abstract: Moving object segmentation is a crucial task for safe and reliable autonomous
mobile systems like self-driving cars, improving the reliability and robustness
of subsequent tasks like SLAM or path planning. While the segmentation of
camera or LiDAR data is widely researched and achieves great results, it often
introduces an increased latency by requiring the accumulation of temporal
sequences to gain the necessary temporal context. Radar sensors overcome this
problem with their ability to provide a direct measurement of a point's Doppler
velocity, which can be exploited for single-scan moving object segmentation.
However, radar point clouds are often sparse and noisy, making data annotation
for use in supervised learning very tedious, time-consuming, and
cost-intensive. To overcome this problem, we address the task of
self-supervised moving object segmentation of sparse and noisy radar point
clouds. We follow a two-step approach of contrastive self-supervised
representation learning with subsequent supervised fine-tuning using limited
amounts of annotated data. We propose a novel clustering-based contrastive loss
function with cluster refinement based on dynamic points removal to pretrain
the network to produce motion-aware representations of the radar data. Our
method improves label efficiency after fine-tuning, effectively boosting
state-of-the-art performance by self-supervised pretraining.

Abstract: Recent advances in multi-modal models have demonstrated strong performance in
tasks such as image generation and reasoning. However, applying these models to
the fire domain remains challenging due to the lack of publicly available
datasets with high-quality fire domain annotations. To address this gap, we
introduce DetectiumFire, a large-scale, multi-modal dataset comprising of 22.5k
high-resolution fire-related images and 2.5k real-world fire-related videos

boxes) and detailed textual prompts describing the scene, enabling applications
such as synthetic data generation and fire risk reasoning. DetectiumFire offers
clear advantages over existing benchmarks in scale, diversity, and data
quality, significantly reducing redundancy and enhancing coverage of real-world
scenarios. We validate the utility of DetectiumFire across multiple tasks,
including object detection, diffusion-based image generation, and
vision-language reasoning. Our results highlight the potential of this dataset

Abstract: Color consistency correction for color point clouds is a fundamental yet
important task in 3D rendering and compression applications. In the past, most
previous color correction methods aimed at correcting color for color images.
The purpose of this paper is to propose a grouping-based hybrid color
correction algorithm for color point clouds. Our algorithm begins by estimating
the overlapping rate between the aligned source and target point clouds, and
then adaptively partitions the target points into two groups, namely the close
proximity group Gcl and the moderate proximity group Gmod, or three groups,
namely Gcl, Gmod, and the distant proximity group Gdist, when the estimated
overlapping rate is low or high, respectively. To correct color for target
points in Gcl, a K-nearest neighbors based bilateral interpolation (KBI) method
is proposed. To correct color for target points in Gmod, a joint KBI and the
histogram equalization (JKHE) method is proposed. For target points in Gdist, a
histogram equalization (HE) method is proposed for color correction. Finally,
we discuss the grouping-effect free property and the ablation study in our
algorithm. The desired color consistency correction benefit of our algorithm
has been justified through 1086 testing color point cloud pairs against the
state-of-the-art methods. The C++ source code of our algorithm can be accessed
from the website: https://github.com/ivpml84079/Point-cloud-color-correction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniChange是一个基于多模态大语言模型的统一变化检测框架，首次将二进制变化检测(BCD)和语义变化检测(SCD)任务统一起来，通过特殊token和文本提示实现多源数据集的知识获取。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前变化检测模型通常只能从单一类型标注数据中学习，无法同时利用多样化的BCD和SCD数据集，导致泛化能力差和功能有限。多模态大语言模型为统一变化检测框架提供了新的可能性。

Method: 利用MLLMs的语言先验和统一能力，引入三个特殊token [T1]、[T2]和[CHANGE]，通过文本提示指导变化类别的识别，无需预定义分类头。

Result: 在四个公开基准测试(WHU-CD、S2Looking、LEVIR-CD+、SECOND)上达到最先进性能，IoU分数分别为90.41、53.04、78.87和57.62。

Conclusion: UniChange成功统一了BCD和SCD任务，展示了MLLMs在变化检测领域的潜力，能够有效处理多源数据集，即使类别定义存在冲突。

Abstract: Change detection (CD) is a fundamental task for monitoring and analyzing land
cover dynamics. While recent high performance models and high quality datasets
have significantly advanced the field, a critical limitation persists. Current
models typically acquire limited knowledge from single-type annotated data and
cannot concurrently leverage diverse binary change detection (BCD) and semantic
change detection (SCD) datasets. This constraint leads to poor generalization
and limited versatility. The recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) introduce new possibilities for a unified CD framework. We
leverage the language priors and unification capabilities of MLLMs to develop
UniChange, the first MLLM-based unified change detection model. UniChange
integrates generative language abilities with specialized CD functionalities.
Our model successfully unifies both BCD and SCD tasks through the introduction
of three special tokens: [T1], [T2], and [CHANGE]. Furthermore, UniChange
utilizes text prompts to guide the identification of change categories,
eliminating the reliance on predefined classification heads. This design allows
UniChange to effectively acquire knowledge from multi-source datasets, even
when their class definitions conflict. Experiments on four public benchmarks
(WHU-CD, S2Looking, LEVIR-CD+, and SECOND) demonstrate SOTA performance,
achieving IoU scores of 90.41, 53.04, 78.87, and 57.62, respectively,
surpassing all previous methods. The code is available at

*Arya Shah,Vaibhav Tripathi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究通过统一基准测试发现，自监督ViT模型（特别是DINO）在猫与人类视觉系统表征对齐方面表现最佳，表明自监督学习能产生跨物种视觉计算收敛的特征表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 猫与人类在眼部解剖结构上存在差异（如猫的垂直瞳孔），但尚不清楚这种差异如何影响下游视觉表征。研究旨在量化猫-人类跨物种视觉表征对齐程度。

Method: 使用统一冻结编码器基准，在卷积网络、监督ViT、窗口Transformer和自监督ViT（DINO）上，通过层间中心核对齐（线性和RBF）和表征相似性分析等方法进行测试。

Result: DINO ViT-B/16获得最高对齐度（平均CKA-RBF≈0.814，CKA-linear≈0.745，RSA≈0.698），峰值出现在早期块，表明自监督能产生桥接物种特定统计的早期特征。监督ViT在CKA上表现良好但几何对应较弱。

Conclusion: 自监督与ViT归纳偏置结合产生的表征几何比广泛使用的CNN和窗口Transformer更接近猫与人类视觉系统的对齐，为跨物种视觉计算收敛提供了可测试的神经科学假设。

Abstract: Cats and humans differ in ocular anatomy. Most notably, Felis Catus (domestic
cats) have vertically elongated pupils linked to ambush predation; yet, how
such specializations manifest in downstream visual representations remains
incompletely understood. We present a unified, frozen-encoder benchmark that
quantifies feline-human cross-species representational alignment in the wild,
across convolutional networks, supervised Vision Transformers, windowed
transformers, and self-supervised ViTs (DINO), using layer-wise Centered Kernel
Alignment (linear and RBF) and Representational Similarity Analysis, with
additional distributional and stability tests reported in the paper. Across
models, DINO ViT-B/16 attains the most substantial alignment (mean CKA-RBF
$\approx0.814$, mean CKA-linear $\approx0.745$, mean RSA $\approx0.698$),
peaking at early blocks, indicating that token-level self-supervision induces
early-stage features that bridge species-specific statistics. Supervised ViTs
are competitive on CKA yet show weaker geometric correspondence than DINO
(e.g., ViT-B/16 RSA $\approx0.53$ at block8; ViT-L/16 $\approx0.47$ at
block14), revealing depth-dependent divergences between similarity and
representational geometry. CNNs remain strong baselines but below plain ViTs on
alignment, and windowed transformers underperform plain ViTs, implicating
architectural inductive biases in cross-species alignment. Results indicate
that self-supervision coupled with ViT inductive biases yields representational
geometries that more closely align feline and human visual systems than widely
used CNNs and windowed Transformers, providing testable neuroscientific
hypotheses about where and how cross-species visual computations converge. We
release our code and dataset for reference and reproducibility.

TL;DR: IllumFlow是一个结合条件整流流和Retinex理论的低光图像增强框架，通过分别优化光照和反射分量来处理光照变化和噪声问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低光图像中光照变化范围大和复杂噪声的问题，传统方法难以同时有效处理这两个挑战。

Method: 基于Retinex理论分解图像为反射和光照分量；使用条件整流流框架建模光照变化的连续流场；通过流驱动数据增强的降噪网络去除反射噪声。

Result: 在低光增强和曝光校正任务上表现出优越的定量和定性性能，超越现有方法。

Conclusion: IllumFlow能够精确适应不同光照条件，自然支持可定制的亮度增强，为低光图像增强提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We present IllumFlow, a novel framework that synergizes conditional Rectified
Flow (CRF) with Retinex theory for low-light image enhancement (LLIE). Our
model addresses low-light enhancement through separate optimization of
illumination and reflectance components, effectively handling both lighting
variations and noise. Specifically, we first decompose an input image into
reflectance and illumination components following Retinex theory. To model the
wide dynamic range of illumination variations in low-light images, we propose a
conditional rectified flow framework that represents illumination changes as a
continuous flow field. While complex noise primarily resides in the reflectance
component, we introduce a denoising network, enhanced by flow-derived data
augmentation, to remove reflectance noise and chromatic aberration while
preserving color fidelity. IllumFlow enables precise illumination adaptation
across lighting conditions while naturally supporting customizable brightness
enhancement. Extensive experiments on low-light enhancement and exposure
correction demonstrate superior quantitative and qualitative performance over
existing methods.

Abstract: Complex chart understanding tasks demand advanced visual recognition and
reasoning capabilities from multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However,
current research provides limited coverage of complex chart scenarios and
computation-intensive reasoning tasks prevalent in real-world applications.
This study proposes an automated multi-stage code-driven pipeline for
systematically generating visual reasoning datasets to address these
limitations. The pipeline integrates retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to
retrieve professional chart templates and employs chain-of-thought (CoT)
strategies to generate reasoning codes that simulate real data distributions,
thereby driving chart rendering and question-related statistical computations.
Through model-based evaluation, the pipeline enhances chart diversity and data
quality. Using this framework, we construct ChartM$^3$, a multi-dimensional and
multi-step dataset containing 38K charts and 142K Q&A pairs for training, along
with 2,871 high-quality evaluation samples for enabling practical performance
assessment. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL)
experiments demonstrate that our dataset significantly improves reasoning
capabilities and cross-domain generalization performance, enabling smaller
models to achieve performance comparable to larger-scale models in complex
chart comprehension.

Motivation: 当前AI进展主要集中在语言中心任务，而视觉中心编码未被充分探索。受人类草图推理启发，提倡使用SVG代码作为紧凑、可解释的可执行视觉表示。

Method: 引入VCode基准，将多模态理解重构为代码生成任务；提出CodeVQA评估协议验证符号保真度；开发VCoder代理框架，包含"思考与修订"和"使用视觉工具行动"两个维度。

Result: 前沿VLM在生成忠实SVG方面表现不佳，VCoder相比表现最佳的Claude-4-Opus实现了12.3分的整体提升。人类研究显示人类和VLM在渲染SVG上表现都更差，但一致性揭示了符号视觉表示的潜力。

Conclusion: SVG代码作为视觉表示具有前景，但当前VLM在视觉中心编码方面仍有局限，VCoder框架有效提升了性能，揭示了符号视觉表示的价值。

Abstract: Code has emerged as a precise and executable medium for reasoning and action
in the agent era. Yet, progress has largely focused on language-centric tasks
such as program synthesis and debugging, leaving visual-centric coding
underexplored. Inspired by how humans reason over sketches, we advocate SVG
code as a compact, interpretable, and executable visual representation. We
introduce VCode, a benchmark that reframes multimodal understanding as code
generation: given an image, a model must produce SVG that preserves symbolic
meaning for downstream reasoning. VCode covers three domains - general
commonsense (MM-Vet), professional disciplines (MMMU), and visual-centric
perception (CV-Bench). To assess symbolic fidelity, we propose CodeVQA, a novel
evaluation protocol in which a policy model answers questions over rendered
SVGs; correct answers indicate faithful symbolic preservation. Empirically,
frontier VLMs struggle to generate faithful SVGs, revealing a persistent gap
between language-centric and visual-centric coding. To close this gap, we
introduce VCoder, an agentic framework that augments VLMs along two axes: (i)
Thinking with Revision, which iteratively analyzes discrepancies and refines
SVG code; and (ii) Acting with Visual Tools, where detectors and parsers supply
structured cues such as objects, shapes, and text beyond the model's intrinsic
capacity. Across benchmarks, frontier VLMs with strong reasoning capabilities
score well overall yet remain limited in professional knowledge and 3D
reasoning. VCoder delivers a 12.3-point overall gain over the top-performing
Claude-4-Opus. Human studies show that both humans and VLMs perform worse on
rendered SVGs, their consistency reveals the promise of symbolic visual
representation. The benchmark and code are available at

Abstract: Precise semantic segmentation of crops and weeds is necessary for
agricultural weeding robots. However, training deep learning models requires
large annotated datasets, which are costly to obtain in real fields. Synthetic
data can reduce this burden, but the gap between simulated and real images
remains a challenge. In this paper, we present a pipeline for procedural
generation of synthetic crop-weed images using Blender, producing annotated
datasets under diverse conditions of plant growth, weed density, lighting, and
camera angle. We benchmark several state-of-the-art segmentation models on
synthetic and real datasets and analyze their cross-domain generalization. Our
results show that training on synthetic images leads to a sim-to-real gap of
10%, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, synthetic data
demonstrates good generalization properties, outperforming real datasets in
cross-domain scenarios. These findings highlight the potential of synthetic
agricultural datasets and support hybrid strategies for more efficient model
training.

Abstract: Video Understanding, Scene Interpretation and Commonsense Reasoning are
highly challenging tasks enabling the interpretation of visual information,
allowing agents to perceive, interact with and make rational decisions in its
environment. Large Language Models (LLMs) and Visual Language Models (VLMs)
have shown remarkable advancements in these areas in recent years, enabling
domain-specific applications as well as zero-shot open vocabulary tasks,
combining multiple domains. However, the required computational complexity
poses challenges for their application on edge devices and in the context of
Mobile Robotics, especially considering the trade-off between accuracy and
inference time. In this paper, we investigate the capabilities of
state-of-the-art VLMs for the task of Scene Interpretation and Action
Recognition, with special regard to small VLMs capable of being deployed to
edge devices in the context of Mobile Robotics. The proposed pipeline is
evaluated on a diverse dataset consisting of various real-world cityscape,

potential of these small models on edge devices, with particular emphasis on

*Teerapong Panboonyuen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: KAO是一个基于核自适应优化的扩散模型框架，专门用于高分辨率卫星图像修复，通过潜在空间条件化和显式传播技术实现高效准确的修复效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 卫星图像修复在遥感领域至关重要，但现有方法要么需要大量重新训练，要么计算开销巨大，难以处理超高分辨率卫星数据集。

Method: 提出KAO框架，采用核自适应优化和潜在空间条件化方法，在紧凑的潜在空间中进行优化，并引入显式传播实现前向-后向融合。

Result: 实验结果表明KAO在DeepGlobe和Massachusetts Roads Dataset等高分辨率卫星数据集上建立了新的性能基准。

Conclusion: KAO提供了一个可扩展的高性能解决方案，在预条件模型的效率和后条件模型的灵活性之间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: Satellite image inpainting is a crucial task in remote sensing, where
accurately restoring missing or occluded regions is essential for robust image
analysis. In this paper, we propose KAO, a novel framework that utilizes
Kernel-Adaptive Optimization within diffusion models for satellite image
inpainting. KAO is specifically designed to address the challenges posed by
very high-resolution (VHR) satellite datasets, such as DeepGlobe and the
Massachusetts Roads Dataset. Unlike existing methods that rely on
preconditioned models requiring extensive retraining or postconditioned models
with significant computational overhead, KAO introduces a Latent Space
Conditioning approach, optimizing a compact latent space to achieve efficient
and accurate inpainting. Furthermore, we incorporate Explicit Propagation into
the diffusion process, facilitating forward-backward fusion, which improves the
stability and precision of the method. Experimental results demonstrate that
KAO sets a new benchmark for VHR satellite image restoration, providing a
scalable, high-performance solution that balances the efficiency of
preconditioned models with the flexibility of postconditioned models.

### [40] [MVAFormer: RGB-based Multi-View Spatio-Temporal Action Recognition with Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02473)
*Taiga Yamane,Satoshi Suzuki,Ryo Masumura,Shotaro Tora*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了MVAFormer，一种用于时空动作识别（STAR）的多视角动作识别方法，通过基于transformer的协作模块在保留空间信息的特征图上进行多视角合作，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多视角动作识别方法主要针对从整个视频中识别单个动作的任务设置，无法适用于需要按顺序识别每个人动作的时空动作识别（STAR）设置。

Method: 提出MVAFormer方法，引入基于transformer的协作模块，利用保留空间信息的特征图而非丢失空间信息的嵌入向量，并将自注意力分为相同视角和不同视角两部分来有效建模多视角关系。

Result: 在新收集的数据集上的实验结果表明，MVAFormer在F-measure上比基线方法提升了约4.4个百分点。

Conclusion: MVAFormer通过有效的多视角协作机制，成功解决了STAR设置下的多视角动作识别问题，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Multi-view action recognition aims to recognize human actions using multiple
camera views and deals with occlusion caused by obstacles or crowds. In this
task, cooperation among views, which generates a joint representation by
combining multiple views, is vital. Previous studies have explored promising
cooperation methods for improving performance. However, since their methods
focus only on the task setting of recognizing a single action from an entire
video, they are not applicable to the recently popular spatio-temporal action
recognition~(STAR) setting, in which each person's action is recognized
sequentially. To address this problem, this paper proposes a multi-view action
recognition method for the STAR setting, called MVAFormer. In MVAFormer, we
introduce a novel transformer-based cooperation module among views. In contrast
to previous studies, which utilize embedding vectors with lost spatial
information, our module utilizes the feature map for effective cooperation in
the STAR setting, which preserves the spatial information. Furthermore, in our
module, we divide the self-attention for the same and different views to model
the relationship between multiple views effectively. The results of experiments
using a newly collected dataset demonstrate that MVAFormer outperforms the
comparison baselines by approximately $4.4$ points on the F-measure.

*Xilong Zhou,Jianchun Chen,Pramod Rao,Timo Teufel,Linjie Lyu,Tigran Minasian,Oleksandr Sotnychenko,Xiaoxiao Long,Marc Habermann,Christian Theobalt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OLATverse是一个大规模真实世界物体数据集，包含约900万张图像，涵盖765个真实物体，在精确控制的光照条件下从多个视角拍摄，为逆向渲染和重光照研究提供高质量基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于逆向渲染、新视角合成和重光照的方法主要依赖合成数据集进行训练和小规模真实数据集进行基准测试，这限制了方法的真实性和泛化能力。OLATverse旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 收集765个常见和不常见的真实世界物体，使用35台DSLR相机和331个独立控制的光源进行拍摄，提供精确校准的相机参数、物体掩码、光度表面法线和漫反射反照率等辅助资源。

Result: 构建了大规模真实世界物体中心基准，包含丰富的材料和光照变化，为逆向渲染和法线估计等任务提供首个全面的真实世界评估集。

Conclusion: OLATverse代表了将下一代逆向渲染和重光照方法与真实世界数据整合的关键一步，将公开发布以促进相关研究发展。

Abstract: We introduce OLATverse, a large-scale dataset comprising around 9M images of
765 real-world objects, captured from multiple viewpoints under a diverse set
of precisely controlled lighting conditions. While recent advances in
object-centric inverse rendering, novel view synthesis and relighting have
shown promising results, most techniques still heavily rely on the synthetic
datasets for training and small-scale real-world datasets for benchmarking,
which limits their realism and generalization. To address this gap, OLATverse
offers two key advantages over existing datasets: large-scale coverage of real
objects and high-fidelity appearance under precisely controlled illuminations.
Specifically, OLATverse contains 765 common and uncommon real-world objects,
spanning a wide range of material categories. Each object is captured using 35
DSLR cameras and 331 individually controlled light sources, enabling the
simulation of diverse illumination conditions. In addition, for each object, we
provide well-calibrated camera parameters, accurate object masks, photometric
surface normals, and diffuse albedo as auxiliary resources. We also construct
an extensive evaluation set, establishing the first comprehensive real-world
object-centric benchmark for inverse rendering and normal estimation. We
believe that OLATverse represents a pivotal step toward integrating the next
generation of inverse rendering and relighting methods with real-world data.
The full dataset, along with all post-processing workflows, will be publicly
released at https://vcai.mpi-inf.mpg.de/projects/OLATverse/.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于目标检测和图像匹配的跨视角无人机定位框架，通过图神经网络处理异构图像间的匹配问题，在GNSS拒止环境下实现有效定位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着低空经济的发展，无人机在巡逻系统中日益重要，但在GNSS拒止区域，基于卫星的定位方法容易失效。现有方法在跨域差异处理上存在对齐错误、内容丢失和真实感有限等问题。

Method: 利用现代目标检测技术从无人机和卫星图像中准确提取显著实例，集成图神经网络推理图像间和图像内的节点关系，使用细粒度的基于图的节点相似性度量。

Result: 在公开和真实世界数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法能有效处理异构外观差异，泛化性能良好，适用于更大模态差距的场景（如红外-可见光图像匹配）。

Conclusion: 该方法通过目标检测和图神经网络实现了强健的检索和定位性能，能够有效应对跨时间、跨视角、异构航空图像的匹配挑战。

Abstract: With the rapid growth of the low-altitude economy, UAVs have become crucial
for measurement and tracking in patrol systems. However, in GNSS-denied areas,
satellite-based localization methods are prone to failure. This paper presents
a cross-view UAV localization framework that performs map matching via object
detection, aimed at effectively addressing cross-temporal, cross-view,
heterogeneous aerial image matching. In typical pipelines, UAV visual
localization is formulated as an image-retrieval problem: features are
extracted to build a localization map, and the pose of a query image is
estimated by matching it to a reference database with known poses. Because
publicly available UAV localization datasets are limited, many approaches
recast localization as a classification task and rely on scene labels in these
datasets to ensure accuracy. Other methods seek to reduce cross-domain
differences using polar-coordinate reprojection, perspective transformations,
or generative adversarial networks; however, they can suffer from misalignment,
content loss, and limited realism. In contrast, we leverage modern object
detection to accurately extract salient instances from UAV and satellite
images, and integrate a graph neural network to reason about inter-image and
intra-image node relationships. Using a fine-grained, graph-based
node-similarity metric, our method achieves strong retrieval and localization
performance. Extensive experiments on public and real-world datasets show that
our approach handles heterogeneous appearance differences effectively and
generalizes well, making it applicable to scenarios with larger modality gaps,
such as infrared-visible image matching. Our dataset will be publicly available
at the following URL: https://github.com/liutao23/ODGNNLoc.git.

*Robinson Umeike,Neil Getty,Yin Xiangyu,Yi Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PtychoBench是一个用于评估基础模型在科学任务中专业化策略的多模态基准，研究发现视觉任务中监督微调与上下文学习互补，而文本任务中上下文学习更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基础模型在科学工作流自动化中的专业化适应问题，确定最佳领域适应策略。

Method: 引入PtychoBench基准，系统比较监督微调(SFT)和上下文学习(ICL)两种专业化策略，在数据稀缺环境下评估视觉伪影检测和文本参数推荐任务。

Result: 视觉任务中SFT和ICL互补，微调模型结合上下文示例达到最高性能(Micro-F1 0.728)；文本任务中ICL优于SFT，达到峰值Micro-F1 0.847。

Conclusion: 最佳专业化路径取决于任务模态，为开发更有效的科学智能系统提供了明确框架。

Abstract: The automation of workflows in advanced microscopy is a key goal where
foundation models like Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs)
show great potential. However, adapting these general-purpose models for
specialized scientific tasks is critical, and the optimal domain adaptation
strategy is often unclear. To address this, we introduce PtychoBench, a new
multi-modal, multi-task benchmark for ptychographic analysis. Using this
benchmark, we systematically compare two specialization strategies: Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT) and In-Context Learning (ICL). We evaluate these strategies
on a visual artifact detection task with VLMs and a textual parameter
recommendation task with LLMs in a data-scarce regime. Our findings reveal that
the optimal specialization pathway is task-dependent. For the visual task, SFT
and ICL are highly complementary, with a fine-tuned model guided by
context-aware examples achieving the highest mean performance (Micro-F1 of
0.728). Conversely, for the textual task, ICL on a large base model is the
superior strategy, reaching a peak Micro-F1 of 0.847 and outperforming a
powerful "super-expert" SFT model (0-shot Micro-F1 of 0.839). We also confirm
the superiority of context-aware prompting and identify a consistent contextual
interference phenomenon in fine-tuned models. These results, benchmarked
against strong baselines including GPT-4o and a DINOv3-based classifier, offer
key observations for AI in science: the optimal specialization path in our
benchmark is dependent on the task modality, offering a clear framework for
developing more effective science-based agentic systems.

Result: 开发出能够学习参考视频组装风格的系统，即使无视频编辑经验的用户也能创建视觉吸引力强的视频。

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了自动化镜头组装，同时保持了艺术风格的一致性，为视频编辑提供了智能且个性化的解决方案。

Abstract: Shot assembly is a crucial step in film production and video editing,
involving the sequencing and arrangement of shots to construct a narrative,
convey information, or evoke emotions. Traditionally, this process has been
manually executed by experienced editors. While current intelligent video
editing technologies can handle some automated video editing tasks, they often
fail to capture the creator's unique artistic expression in shot assembly.To
address this challenge, we propose an energy-based optimization method for
video shot assembly. Specifically, we first perform visual-semantic matching
between the script generated by a large language model and a video library to
obtain subsets of candidate shots aligned with the script semantics. Next, we
segment and label the shots from reference videos, extracting attributes such
as shot size, camera motion, and semantics. We then employ energy-based models
to learn from these attributes, scoring candidate shot sequences based on their
alignment with reference styles. Finally, we achieve shot assembly optimization
by combining multiple syntax rules, producing videos that align with the
assembly style of the reference videos. Our method not only automates the
arrangement and combination of independent shots according to specific logic,
narrative requirements, or artistic styles but also learns the assembly style
of reference videos, creating a coherent visual sequence or holistic visual
expression. With our system, even users with no prior video editing experience
can create visually compelling videos. Project page:

Motivation: 深度学习使机器人系统能够与动态非结构化环境交互，但在关键任务应用中需要评估大量异构数据，自动报告生成有助于促进此类系统的评估和接受

Method: 开发了基于本地模型的自动化报告生成管道，利用多模态传感器数据，能够在边缘计算设备上部署

Result: 在包含室内、室外和城市环境的多样化数据集上进行了评估，提供了定量和定性评估结果

Conclusion: 该方法能够生成自然语言报告，保护隐私且无需依赖外部服务，适用于移动机器人的自动化评估

Abstract: Recent advancements in Deep Learning enable hardware-based cognitive systems,
that is, mechatronic systems in general and robotics in particular with
integrated Artificial Intelligence, to interact with dynamic and unstructured
environments. While the results are impressive, the application of such systems
to critical tasks like autonomous driving as well as service and care robotics
necessitate the evaluation of large amount of heterogeneous data. Automated
report generation for Mobile Robotics can play a crucial role in facilitating
the evaluation and acceptance of such systems in various domains. In this
paper, we propose a pipeline for generating automated reports in natural
language utilizing various multi-modal sensors that solely relies on local
models capable of being deployed on edge computing devices, thus preserving the
privacy of all actors involved and eliminating the need for external services.
In particular, we evaluate our implementation on a diverse dataset spanning
multiple domains including indoor, outdoor and urban environments, providing
quantitative as well as qualitative evaluation results. Various generated
example reports and other supplementary materials are available via a public
repository.

### [46] [LiteVoxel: Low-memory Intelligent Thresholding for Efficient Voxel Rasterization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02510)
*Jee Won Lee,Jongseong Brad Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LiteVoxel是一个自调节训练管道，通过逆Sobel重加权和深度分位数剪枝等方法，解决了稀疏体素光栅化在低频内容拟合、剪枝启发式和VRAM过度增长方面的问题，显著降低了峰值内存使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏体素光栅化虽然快速且可微分，但存在对低频内容拟合不足、依赖脆弱的剪枝启发式以及VRAM过度增长的问题，需要更稳定和轻量的解决方案。

Method: 采用逆Sobel重加权损失函数，结合训练中期的gamma斜坡调整；使用基于深度分位数的剪枝逻辑，通过EMA滞后保护和基于射线足迹的优先级驱动细分来优化结构，并在明确的增长预算下进行。

Result: 在Mip-NeRF 360和Tanks & Temples数据集上的实验显示，LiteVoxel减少了低频区域和边界不稳定性错误，同时保持PSNR/SSIM、训练时间和FPS与强基线相当，峰值VRAM降低40%-60%。

Conclusion: LiteVoxel实现了更可预测、内存效率更高的训练，无需牺牲感知质量，并保留了先前设置中缺失的低频细节。

Abstract: Sparse-voxel rasterization is a fast, differentiable alternative for
optimization-based scene reconstruction, but it tends to underfit low-frequency
content, depends on brittle pruning heuristics, and can overgrow in ways that
inflate VRAM. We introduce LiteVoxel, a self-tuning training pipeline that
makes SV rasterization both steadier and lighter. Our loss is made
low-frequency aware via an inverse-Sobel reweighting with a mid-training
gamma-ramp, shifting gradient budget to flat regions only after geometry
stabilize. Adaptation replaces fixed thresholds with a depth-quantile pruning
logic on maximum blending weight, stabilized by EMA-hysteresis guards and
refines structure through ray-footprint-based, priority-driven subdivision
under an explicit growth budget. Ablations and full-system results across
Mip-NeRF 360 (6scenes) and Tanks & Temples (3scenes) datasets show mitigation
of errors in low-frequency regions and boundary instability while keeping
PSNR/SSIM, training time, and FPS comparable to a strong SVRaster pipeline.
Crucially, LiteVoxel reduces peak VRAM by ~40%-60% and preserves low-frequency
detail that prior setups miss, enabling more predictable, memory-efficient
training without sacrificing perceptual quality.

Result: 师生特征匹配方法在分类鲁棒性方面表现最优，并能够实现精确的缺陷定位。与基于自编码器的模型相比，该方法在特征表示的可分离性方面有所改进，通过t-SNE嵌入可视化得到验证。

Conclusion: 本研究强调了无监督深度学习在工业环境中实现可扩展、标签高效的剪切散斑检测的潜力，师生方法在自动异常检测和定位方面展现出优越性能。

Abstract: Shearography is a non-destructive testing method for detecting subsurface
defects, offering high sensitivity and full-field inspection capabilities.
However, its industrial adoption remains limited due to the need for expert
interpretation. To reduce reliance on labeled data and manual evaluation, this
study explores unsupervised learning methods for automated anomaly detection in
shearographic images. Three architectures are evaluated: a fully connected
autoencoder, a convolutional autoencoder, and a student-teacher feature
matching model. All models are trained solely on defect-free data. A controlled
dataset was developed using a custom specimen with reproducible defect
patterns, enabling systematic acquisition of shearographic measurements under
both ideal and realistic deformation conditions. Two training subsets were
defined: one containing only undistorted, defect-free samples, and one
additionally including globally deformed, yet defect-free, data. The latter
simulates practical inspection conditions by incorporating deformation-induced
fringe patterns that may obscure localized anomalies. The models are evaluated
in terms of binary classification and, for the student-teacher model, spatial
defect localization. Results show that the student-teacher approach achieves
superior classification robustness and enables precise localization. Compared
to the autoencoder-based models, it demonstrates improved separability of
feature representations, as visualized through t-SNE embeddings. Additionally,
a YOLOv8 model trained on labeled defect data serves as a reference to
benchmark localization quality. This study underscores the potential of
unsupervised deep learning for scalable, label-efficient shearographic
inspection in industrial environments.

Conclusion: 深度学习可以在体素级别可靠地预测参与者特异性的大脑MRI，为个体化预后提供了新的机会。

Abstract: Predicting future brain state from a baseline magnetic resonance image (MRI)
is a central challenge in neuroimaging and has important implications for
studying neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Most
existing approaches predict future cognitive scores or clinical outcomes, such
as conversion from mild cognitive impairment to dementia. Instead, here we
investigate longitudinal MRI image-to-image prediction that forecasts a
participant's entire brain MRI several years into the future, intrinsically
modeling complex, spatially distributed neurodegenerative patterns. We
implement and evaluate five deep learning architectures (UNet, U2-Net, UNETR,
Time-Embedding UNet, and ODE-UNet) on two longitudinal cohorts (ADNI and AIBL).
Predicted follow-up MRIs are directly compared with the actual follow-up scans
using metrics that capture global similarity and local differences. The best
performing models achieve high-fidelity predictions, and all models generalize
well to an independent external dataset, demonstrating robust cross-cohort
performance. Our results indicate that deep learning can reliably predict
participant-specific brain MRI at the voxel level, offering new opportunities
for individualized prognosis.

Abstract: This report describes the UVH-26 dataset, the first public release by
AIM@IISc of a large-scale dataset of annotated traffic-camera images from
India. The dataset comprises 26,646 high-resolution (1080p) images sampled from
2800 Bengaluru's Safe-City CCTV cameras over a 4-week period, and subsequently
annotated through a crowdsourced hackathon involving 565 college students from
across India. In total, 1.8 million bounding boxes were labeled across 14
vehicle classes specific to India: Cycle, 2-Wheeler (Motorcycle), 3-Wheeler
(Auto-rickshaw), LCV (Light Commercial Vehicles), Van, Tempo-traveller,
Hatchback, Sedan, SUV, MUV, Mini-bus, Bus, Truck and Other. Of these, 283k-316k
consensus ground truth bounding boxes and labels were derived for distinct
objects in the 26k images using Majority Voting and STAPLE algorithms. Further,
we train multiple contemporary detectors, including YOLO11-S/X, RT-DETR-S/X,
and DAMO-YOLO-T/L using these datasets, and report accuracy based on mAP50,
mAP75 and mAP50:95. Models trained on UVH-26 achieve 8.4-31.5% improvements in
mAP50:95 over equivalent baseline models trained on COCO dataset, with
RT-DETR-X showing the best performance at 0.67 (mAP50:95) as compared to 0.40
for COCO-trained weights for common classes (Car, Bus, and Truck). This
demonstrates the benefits of domain-specific training data for Indian traffic
scenarios. The release package provides the 26k images with consensus
annotations based on Majority Voting (UVH-26-MV) and STAPLE (UVH-26-ST) and the
6 fine-tuned YOLO and DETR models on each of these datasets. By capturing the
heterogeneity of Indian urban mobility directly from operational traffic-camera
streams, UVH-26 addresses a critical gap in existing global benchmarks, and
offers a foundation for advancing detection, classification, and deployment of
intelligent transportation systems in emerging nations with complex traffic
conditions.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决跨视角视频行人重识别中的极端视角偏移、尺度差异和时间不一致问题，这些挑战在如空中-地面监控等场景中尤为突出。

Method: 在ViT-B/16骨干网络上引入7个模块：跨流特征归一化(CSFN)校正相机和视角偏差；多分辨率特征协调(MRFH)稳定跨海拔尺度；身份感知记忆模块(IAMM)强化持久身份特征；时序动态建模(TDM)进行运动感知的短期时序编码；跨视角特征对齐(IVFA)实现视角不变表示对齐；分层时序模式学习(HTPL)捕获多尺度时序规律；多视角身份一致性学习(MVICL)通过对比学习强制跨视角身份一致性。

Abstract: Video-based person re-identification (ReID) in cross-view domains (for
example, aerial-ground surveillance) remains an open problem because of extreme
viewpoint shifts, scale disparities, and temporal inconsistencies. To address
these challenges, we propose MTF-CVReID, a parameter-efficient framework that
introduces seven complementary modules over a ViT-B/16 backbone. Specifically,
we include: (1) Cross-Stream Feature Normalization (CSFN) to correct camera and
view biases; (2) Multi-Resolution Feature Harmonization (MRFH) for scale
stabilization across altitudes; (3) Identity-Aware Memory Module (IAMM) to
reinforce persistent identity traits; (4) Temporal Dynamics Modeling (TDM) for
motion-aware short-term temporal encoding; (5) Inter-View Feature Alignment
(IVFA) for perspective-invariant representation alignment; (6) Hierarchical
Temporal Pattern Learning (HTPL) to capture multi-scale temporal regularities;
and (7) Multi-View Identity Consistency Learning (MVICL) that enforces
cross-view identity coherence using a contrastive learning paradigm. Despite
adding only about 2 million parameters and 0.7 GFLOPs over the baseline,
MTF-CVReID maintains real-time efficiency (189 FPS) and achieves

TL;DR: VCFlow是一个无需特定训练即可从fMRI重建视觉体验的脑解码框架，通过模拟人类视觉系统的腹背侧结构来学习多维表征，在仅牺牲7%准确率的情况下实现快速视频重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决跨被试泛化问题，开发无需特定训练即可从fMRI重建视觉体验的临床适用脑解码方法。

Method: 提出分层解码框架VCFlow，显式建模人类视觉系统的腹背侧架构，使用特征级对比学习提取被试不变语义表征。

Result: 相比传统方法需要12小时数据和大量计算，VCFlow仅牺牲7%准确率，可在10秒内重建视频且无需重新训练。

Conclusion: VCFlow为脑解码提供了快速且临床可扩展的解决方案，具有重要的临床应用潜力。

Abstract: Subject-agnostic brain decoding, which aims to reconstruct continuous visual
experiences from fMRI without subject-specific training, holds great potential
for clinical applications. However, this direction remains underexplored due to
challenges in cross-subject generalization and the complex nature of brain
signals. In this work, we propose Visual Cortex Flow Architecture (VCFlow), a
novel hierarchical decoding framework that explicitly models the ventral-dorsal
architecture of the human visual system to learn multi-dimensional
representations. By disentangling and leveraging features from early visual
cortex, ventral, and dorsal streams, VCFlow captures diverse and complementary
cognitive information essential for visual reconstruction. Furthermore, we
introduce a feature-level contrastive learning strategy to enhance the
extraction of subject-invariant semantic representations, thereby enhancing
subject-agnostic applicability to previously unseen subjects. Unlike
conventional pipelines that need more than 12 hours of per-subject data and
heavy computation, VCFlow sacrifices only 7\% accuracy on average yet generates
each reconstructed video in 10 seconds without any retraining, offering a fast
and clinically scalable solution. The source code will be released upon
acceptance of the paper.

*Daichi Nagai,Ryugo Morita,Shunsuke Kitada,Hitoshi Iyatomi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TAUE是一个无需训练的零样本分层图像生成框架，通过噪声移植和培育技术实现前景、背景和合成层的语义结构一致性，解决了现有方法需要大量训练数据或只能生成孤立前景元素的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像扩散模型只能输出单张扁平图像，无法满足专业应用对分层控制的需求。现有解决方案要么需要大量不可访问的数据集进行微调，要么只能生成孤立的前景元素而无法产生完整连贯的场景。

Method: 提出噪声移植和培育技术，从前景和合成生成过程中提取中间潜在表示，将其移植到后续层的初始噪声中，确保跨层的语义和结构一致性。

Result: 无需训练的方法达到了与微调方法相当的性能，在保持高图像质量和保真度的同时增强了分层一致性。

Conclusion: TAUE不仅消除了昂贵的训练和数据集需求，还解锁了复杂组合编辑等新的下游应用，为更易访问和可控的生成工作流程铺平了道路。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable success of text-to-image diffusion models, their
output of a single, flattened image remains a critical bottleneck for
professional applications requiring layer-wise control. Existing solutions
either rely on fine-tuning with large, inaccessible datasets or are
training-free yet limited to generating isolated foreground elements, failing
to produce a complete and coherent scene. To address this, we introduce the
Training-free Noise Transplantation and Cultivation Diffusion Model (TAUE), a
novel framework for zero-shot, layer-wise image generation. Our core technique,
Noise Transplantation and Cultivation (NTC), extracts intermediate latent
representations from both foreground and composite generation processes,
transplanting them into the initial noise for subsequent layers. This ensures
semantic and structural coherence across foreground, background, and composite
layers, enabling consistent, multi-layered outputs without requiring
fine-tuning or auxiliary datasets. Extensive experiments show that our
training-free method achieves performance comparable to fine-tuned methods,
enhancing layer-wise consistency while maintaining high image quality and
fidelity. TAUE not only eliminates costly training and dataset requirements but
also unlocks novel downstream applications, such as complex compositional
editing, paving the way for more accessible and controllable generative
workflows.

Motivation: 多动物追踪对理解动物生态和行为至关重要，但由于栖息地、运动模式和物种外观的差异，传统方法需要大量模型微调和启发式设计。

Method: 结合Grounding Dino目标检测器和Segment Anything Model 2追踪器，并设计精心设计的启发式方法，构建零样本追踪框架。

Conclusion: 证明了视觉基础模型在零样本多动物追踪中的潜力，为动物行为研究提供了无需重新训练的有效工具。

Abstract: Multi-animal tracking is crucial for understanding animal ecology and
behavior. However, it remains a challenging task due to variations in habitat,
motion patterns, and species appearance. Traditional approaches typically
require extensive model fine-tuning and heuristic design for each application
scenario. In this work, we explore the potential of recent vision foundation
models for zero-shot multi-animal tracking. By combining a Grounding Dino
object detector with the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) tracker and carefully
designed heuristics, we develop a tracking framework that can be applied to new
datasets without any retraining or hyperparameter adaptation. Evaluations on
ChimpAct, Bird Flock Tracking, AnimalTrack, and a subset of GMOT-40 demonstrate
strong and consistent performance across diverse species and environments. The

Conclusion: 该轻量级CNN框架能有效检测多种呈现攻击，确保生物特征认证系统的安全性，并通过演示视频验证了架构的有效性。

Abstract: Biometric technologies are widely adopted in security, legal, and financial
systems. Face recognition can authenticate a person based on the unique facial
features such as shape and texture. However, recent works have demonstrated the
vulnerability of Face Recognition Systems (FRS) towards presentation attacks.
Using spoofing (aka.,presentation attacks), a malicious actor can get
illegitimate access to secure systems. This paper proposes a novel light-weight
CNN framework to identify print/display, video and wrap attacks. The proposed
robust architecture provides seamless liveness detection ensuring faster
biometric authentication (1-2 seconds on CPU). Further, this also presents a
newly created 2D spoof attack dataset consisting of more than 500 videos
collected from 60 subjects. To validate the effectiveness of this architecture,
we provide a demonstration video depicting print/display, video and wrap attack
detection approaches. The demo can be viewed in the following link:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的概念相关性传播方法需要专家手动检查激活图像来命名概念并从相关性图中合成冗长解释，限制了解释的可访问性和可扩展性。

Method: 开发了一个模块化管道，将CRP与多模态大语言模型耦合，通过精心设计的提示教导语言模型CRP语义，并强制分离命名和解释任务。

Result: 在ImageNet数据集上的VGG16模型上进行了定性评估，能够自动生成针对不同受众的定制化解释。

Conclusion: 将基于概念的可归因方法与大型语言模型集成可以显著降低解释深度神经网络的门槛，为更透明的AI系统铺平道路。

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) underpin many modern computer vision
systems. With applications ranging from common to critical areas, a need to
explain and understand the model and its decisions (XAI) emerged. Prior works
suggest that in the top layers of CNNs, the individual channels can be
attributed to classifying human-understandable concepts. Concept relevance
propagation (CRP) methods can backtrack predictions to these channels and find
images that most activate these channels. However, current CRP workflows are
largely manual: experts must inspect activation images to name the discovered
concepts and must synthesize verbose explanations from relevance maps, limiting
the accessibility of the explanations and their scalability.
  To address these issues, we introduce Large Language model EXplaIns COncept
Relevance Propagation (LLEXICORP), a modular pipeline that couples CRP with a
multimodal large language model. Our approach automatically assigns descriptive
names to concept prototypes and generates natural-language explanations that
translate quantitative relevance distributions into intuitive narratives. To
ensure faithfulness, we craft prompts that teach the language model the
semantics of CRP through examples and enforce a separation between naming and
explanation tasks. The resulting text can be tailored to different audiences,
offering low-level technical descriptions for experts and high-level summaries
for non-technical stakeholders.
  We qualitatively evaluate our method on various images from ImageNet on a
VGG16 model. Our findings suggest that integrating concept-based attribution
methods with large language models can significantly lower the barrier to
interpreting deep neural networks, paving the way for more transparent AI
systems.

TL;DR: 提出了UniPruneBench，一个用于多模态大模型中视觉token剪枝的统一基准测试框架，评估了10种压缩算法在3类LMMs上的表现，发现随机剪枝是强基线，没有单一方法在所有场景下表现最优，剪枝敏感度因任务而异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型多模态模型存在严重的推理效率问题，主要源于图像编码器引入的大量视觉token。现有的token压缩方法评估零散且不一致，需要统一的评估标准。

Method: 构建UniPruneBench基准测试，在6个能力维度和10个数据集上提供标准化协议，涵盖10种代表性压缩算法和3类LMMs（LLaVA-v1.5、Intern-VL3、Qwen2.5-VL），除了任务准确率外还包含运行时和预填充延迟等系统级指标。

Result: 实验发现：(1)随机剪枝是强基线；(2)没有单一方法在所有场景下表现最优；(3)剪枝敏感度因任务而异，OCR任务最脆弱；(4)剪枝比例是影响性能下降的主导因素。

Conclusion: UniPruneBench为未来高效多模态建模研究提供了可靠的基础，有助于系统评估和比较不同的视觉token压缩方法。

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) often suffer from severe inference
inefficiency due to the large number of visual tokens introduced by image
encoders. While recent token compression methods, such as pruning and merging,
have shown promise in reducing redundancy, their evaluation remains fragmented
and inconsistent. In this work, we present UniPruneBench, a unified and
extensible benchmark for visual token pruning in multimodal LLMs. UniPruneBench
provides standardized protocols across six ability dimensions and ten datasets,
covering ten representative compression algorithms and three families of LMMs
(LLaVA-v1.5, Intern-VL3, and Qwen2.5-VL). Beyond task accuracy, it incorporates
system-level metrics such as runtime and prefilling latency to provide a
holistic view. Our experiments uncover several key findings: (1) random pruning
is a surprisingly strong baseline, (2) no single method consistently
outperforms others across scenarios, (3) pruning sensitivity varies
significantly across tasks, with OCR being most vulnerable, and (4) pruning
ratio is the dominant factor governing performance degradation. We believe
UniPruneBench will serve as a reliable foundation for future research on
efficient multimodal modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的Vision Transformers使用固定的patch token，忽略了图像的空间和语义结构。

semantic structure of images. In this work, we introduce an end-to-end
differentiable tokenizer that adapts to image content with pixel-level
granularity while remaining backward-compatible with existing architectures for
retrofitting pretrained models. Our method uses hierarchical model selection
with information criteria to provide competitive performance in both
image-level classification and dense-prediction tasks, and even supports
out-of-the-box raster-to-vector conversion.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VI-ReID方法主要依赖中间表示来对齐跨模态特征，但存在中间特征生成方式不够有效、参数过多、缺乏可解释性等问题，且未能充分利用中间特征。

Method: 使用生成的中间图像作为可见光到红外模态的转换器，该图像与原始可见光图像完全对齐且与红外模态相似，并采用模态转换对比损失和模态查询正则化损失进行训练。

Result: 在三个典型VI-ReID数据集上的实验结果表明，该模型显著且持续优于现有最优方法。

Conclusion: 提出的MTRL框架无需额外参数，在保持骨干网络推理速度的同时有效提升了VI-ReID任务的性能。

Abstract: Visible-infrared person re-identification (VI-ReID) technique could associate
the pedestrian images across visible and infrared modalities in the practical
scenarios of background illumination changes. However, a substantial gap
inherently exists between these two modalities. Besides, existing methods
primarily rely on intermediate representations to align cross-modal features of
the same person. The intermediate feature representations are usually create by
generating intermediate images (kind of data enhancement), or fusing
intermediate features (more parameters, lack of interpretability), and they do
not make good use of the intermediate features. Thus, we propose a novel
VI-ReID framework via Modality-Transition Representation Learning (MTRL) with a
middle generated image as a transmitter from visible to infrared modals, which
are fully aligned with the original visible images and similar to the infrared
modality. After that, using a modality-transition contrastive loss and a
modality-query regularization loss for training, which could align the
cross-modal features more effectively. Notably, our proposed framework does not
need any additional parameters, which achieves the same inference speed to the
backbone while improving its performance on VI-ReID task. Extensive
experimental results illustrate that our model significantly and consistently
outperforms existing SOTAs on three typical VI-ReID datasets.

Conclusion: 提出的情感线索引导推理框架有效解决了视频情感分析的挑战，为情感理解任务提供了重要资源和方法基础。

Abstract: Understanding and predicting emotion from videos has gathered significant
attention in recent studies, driven by advancements in video large language
models (VideoLLMs). While advanced methods have made progress in video emotion
analysis, the intrinsic nature of emotions poses significant challenges.
Emotions are characterized by dynamic and cues-dependent properties, making it
difficult to understand complex and evolving emotional states with reasonable
rationale. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel affective cues-guided
reasoning framework that unifies fundamental attribute perception, expression
analysis, and high-level emotional understanding in a stage-wise manner. At the
core of our approach is a family of video emotion foundation models (VidEmo),
specifically designed for emotion reasoning and instruction-following. These
models undergo a two-stage tuning process: first, curriculum emotion learning
for injecting emotion knowledge, followed by affective-tree reinforcement
learning for emotion reasoning. Moreover, we establish a foundational data
infrastructure and introduce a emotion-centric fine-grained dataset (Emo-CFG)
consisting of 2.1M diverse instruction-based samples. Emo-CFG includes
explainable emotional question-answering, fine-grained captions, and associated
rationales, providing essential resources for advancing emotion understanding
tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive
performance, setting a new milestone across 15 face perception tasks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然图像与文本的对齐研究已取得显著进展，但视频数据的时序特性在此背景下仍未被充分探索。本文旨在研究视频-文本表示对齐，探索现代视频和语言编码器的能力。

Method: 通过综合研究视频-文本表示对齐，分析不同编码器的能力，提出参数化测试时缩放定律来捕捉对齐行为，并调查语义对齐与下游任务性能的相关性。

Result: 研究发现跨模态对齐高度依赖于测试时提供的视觉（静态图像vs多帧视频）和文本（单字幕vs集合）数据的丰富度，特别是在使用最先进的视频编码器时。提出的缩放定律对经验观察具有显著预测能力。

Conclusion: 视频-文本对齐是探索时空数据表示能力的信息化零样本方法，强对齐可能与通用视频表示和理解相关，为视觉和语言模型提供了具有挑战性的测试平台。

Abstract: The alignment of representations from different modalities has recently been
shown to provide insights on the structural similarities and downstream
capabilities of different encoders across diverse data types. While significant
progress has been made in aligning images with text, the temporal nature of
video data remains largely unexplored in this context. In this work, we conduct
the first comprehensive study of video-text representation alignment, probing
the capabilities of modern video and language encoders. Our findings reveal
several key insights. First, we demonstrate that cross-modal alignment highly
depends on the richness of both visual (static images vs. multi-frame videos)
and text (single caption vs. a collection) data provided at test time,
especially when using state-of-the-art video encoders. We propose parametric
test-time scaling laws that capture this behavior and show remarkable
predictive power against empirical observations. Secondly, we investigate the
correlation between semantic alignment and performance on both semantic and
non-semantic downstream tasks, providing initial evidence that strong alignment
against text encoders may be linked to general-purpose video representation and
understanding. Finally, we correlate temporal reasoning with cross-modal
alignment providing a challenging test-bed for vision and language models.
Overall, our work introduces video-text alignment as an informative zero-shot
way to probe the representation power of different encoders for spatio-temporal
data. Project page can be found at https://video-prh.github.io/

Conclusion: PercHead提供了一个统一的3D头部重建和编辑框架，通过感知监督和模块化设计实现了高质量的重建和直观的语义编辑能力。

Abstract: We present PercHead, a method for single-image 3D head reconstruction and
semantic 3D editing - two tasks that are inherently challenging due to severe
view occlusions, weak perceptual supervision, and the ambiguity of editing in
3D space. We develop a unified base model for reconstructing view-consistent 3D
heads from a single input image. The model employs a dual-branch encoder
followed by a ViT-based decoder that lifts 2D features into 3D space through
iterative cross-attention. Rendering is performed using Gaussian Splatting. At
the heart of our approach is a novel perceptual supervision strategy based on
DINOv2 and SAM2.1, which provides rich, generalized signals for both geometric
and appearance fidelity. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in
novel-view synthesis and, furthermore, exhibits exceptional robustness to
extreme viewing angles compared to established baselines. Furthermore, this
base model can be seamlessly extended for semantic 3D editing by swapping the
encoder and finetuning the network. In this variant, we disentangle geometry
and style through two distinct input modalities: a segmentation map to control
geometry and either a text prompt or a reference image to specify appearance.
We highlight the intuitive and powerful 3D editing capabilities of our model
through a lightweight, interactive GUI, where users can effortlessly sculpt
geometry by drawing segmentation maps and stylize appearance via natural
language or image prompts.

TL;DR: MIRA是一个新的基准测试，用于评估模型在需要生成中间视觉图像进行推理的场景中的表现。该基准包含546个多模态问题，要求模型生成草图、结构图等中间图像来指导推理过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统思维链方法仅依赖文本，而许多复杂问题需要视觉化思考。MIRA旨在评估模型在需要"画图思考"的场景中的能力，模拟人类解决复杂问题的方式。

Method: MIRA包含546个高质量多模态问题，标注了中间视觉图像和最终答案。提出统一评估协议，涵盖三个评估输入级别：仅图像和问题的直接输入、带思维提示的文本思维链输入、带注释图像线索和文本提示的视觉思维链输入。

Result: 实验结果显示，现有多模态大语言模型在仅依赖文本提示时表现不佳，但当提供中间视觉线索时，模型性能平均相对提升33.7%。扩展搜索空间和设计对齐视觉思维链的文本提示仅带来有限改进。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了想象视觉信息在MIRA基准上成功推理的关键作用，表明视觉化思考对于复杂推理任务至关重要。

Abstract: We propose MIRA, a new benchmark designed to evaluate models in scenarios
where generating intermediate visual images is essential for successful
reasoning. Unlike traditional CoT methods that rely solely on text, tasks in
MIRA require models to generate and utilize intermediate images - such as
sketches, structural diagrams, or path drawings - to guide their reasoning
process. This setup closely mirrors how humans solve complex problems through
"drawing to think". To solve this, MIRA focuses on tasks that are intrinsically
challenging and involve complex structures, spatial relationships, or reasoning
steps that are difficult to express through language alone. To ensure that our
evaluation data is of high-quality, we include 546 multimodal problems,
annotated with intermediate visual images and final answers. We also propose a
unified evaluation protocol for MIRA that spans three levels of evaluation
input: direct input with image and question only, text-only CoT input with
image and thinking prompts, and Visual-CoT input with both annotated image
clues and textual thinking prompts. To probe the upper bound of model capacity
on our benchmark, we also report pass@k and majority voting accuracies under
different k settings. Experimental results show that existing multimodal large
language models, including strongest private models as well as strong
open-weight models, perform poorly when relying solely on textual prompts.
However, when intermediate visual cues are provided, model performance improves
consistently, yielding an average relative gain of 33.7% across all models and
tasks. We also probe the upper bound by expanding the search space and
designing textual prompts aligned with Visual-CoT, but both yield only limited
improvements compared to our Visual-CoT setting. These results underscore the
critical role of imagined visual information in enabling successful reasoning
on MIRA.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI生成的深度伪造媒体对多媒体取证、错误信息检测和生物识别系统构成严重威胁，导致公众对法律系统的信任度下降、欺诈案件显著增加和社会工程攻击。现有取证方法存在三个关键问题：非标准化基准、不一致的训练协议和有限的评估指标。

Abstract: The threats posed by AI-generated media, particularly deepfakes, are now
raising significant challenges for multimedia forensics, misinformation
detection, and biometric system resulting in erosion of public trust in the
legal system, significant increase in frauds, and social engineering attacks.
Although several forensic methods have been proposed, they suffer from three
critical gaps: (i) use of non-standardized benchmarks with GAN- or
diffusion-generated images, (ii) inconsistent training protocols (e.g.,
scratch, frozen, fine-tuning), and (iii) limited evaluation metrics that fail
to capture generalization and explainability. These limitations hinder fair
comparison, obscure true robustness, and restrict deployment in
security-critical applications. This paper introduces a unified benchmarking
framework for systematic evaluation of forensic methods under controlled and
reproducible conditions. We benchmark ten SoTA forensic methods (scratch,
frozen, and fine-tuned) and seven publicly available datasets (GAN and
diffusion) to perform extensive and systematic evaluations. We evaluate
performance using multiple metrics, including accuracy, average precision,
ROC-AUC, error rate, and class-wise sensitivity. We also further analyze model
interpretability using confidence curves and Grad-CAM heatmaps. Our evaluations
demonstrate substantial variability in generalization, with certain methods
exhibiting strong in-distribution performance but degraded cross-model
transferability. This study aims to guide the research community toward a
deeper understanding of the strengths and limitations of current forensic
approaches, and to inspire the development of more robust, generalizable, and
explainable solutions.

TL;DR: PLUTO-4是新一代病理学基础模型，包含紧凑型PLUTO-4S和前沿规模PLUTO-4G两个架构，在55万张WSI上预训练，在多种病理任务中实现SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于大规模病理图像训练的基础模型已展示出强大的迁移能力，需要扩展到前沿规模以进一步提升性能。

Method: 使用DINOv2自监督目标在55万张WSI上预训练两个ViT架构：PLUTO-4S采用FlexiViT和2D-RoPE嵌入实现多尺度部署，PLUTO-4G使用单一补丁尺寸最大化表示能力。

Result: PLUTO-4在多种任务中实现SOTA性能，PLUTO-4S提供高吞吐量部署，PLUTO-4G在皮肤病理诊断中提升11%，在多个基准测试中建立新性能前沿。

Conclusion: PLUTO-4作为转化研究和诊断用例的骨干模型，有潜力改变实际应用。

Abstract: Foundation models trained on large-scale pathology image corpora have
demonstrated strong transfer capabilities across diverse histopathology tasks.
Building on this progress, we introduce PLUTO-4, our next generation of
pathology foundation models that extend the Pathology-Universal Transformer
(PLUTO) to frontier scale. We share two complementary Vision Transformer
architectures in the PLUTO-4 family: a compact and efficient PLUTO-4S model
optimized for multi-scale deployment using a FlexiViT setup with 2D-RoPE
embeddings, and a frontier-scale PLUTO-4G model trained with a single patch
size to maximize representation capacity and stability. Both models are
pretrained using a self-supervised objective derived from DINOv2 on a large
multi-institutional corpus containing 551,164 WSIs from 137,144 patients across
over 50 institutions, spanning over 60 disease types and over 100 stains.
Comprehensive evaluation across public and internal benchmarks demonstrates
that PLUTO-4 achieves state-of-the-art performance on tasks requiring varying
spatial and biological context, including patch-level classification,
segmentation, and slide-level diagnosis. The compact PLUTO-4S provides
high-throughput and robust performance for practical deployment, while PLUTO-4G
establishes new performance frontiers across multiple pathology benchmarks,
including an 11% improvement in dermatopathology diagnosis. These diverse
improvements underscore PLUTO-4's potential to transform real-world
applications as a backbone for translational research and diagnostic use cases.

*Dmitrii Pozdeev,Alexey Artemov,Ananta R. Bhattarai,Artem Sevastopolsky*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DenseMarks是一种新的人类头部学习表示方法，通过Vision Transformer网络为每个像素预测3D嵌入，在3D规范单元立方体中建立对应关系，用于高质量密集对应、面部跟踪和立体重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决人类头部图像的高质量密集对应问题，特别是在不同姿态和个体间保持一致性，同时覆盖整个头部包括头发区域。

Method: 使用Vision Transformer网络预测像素级3D嵌入，通过对比损失训练配对点匹配，结合多任务学习（面部关键点和分割约束），并利用潜在立方体特征保证空间连续性。

Result: 在几何感知点匹配和单目头部跟踪方面达到最先进水平，对姿态变化具有鲁棒性，能够覆盖整个头部区域。

Conclusion: DenseMarks提供了一个可解释和可查询的规范空间，能够实现跨姿态和个体的表示一致性，在多种头部相关任务中表现优异。

Abstract: We propose DenseMarks - a new learned representation for human heads,
enabling high-quality dense correspondences of human head images. For a 2D
image of a human head, a Vision Transformer network predicts a 3D embedding for
each pixel, which corresponds to a location in a 3D canonical unit cube. In
order to train our network, we collect a dataset of pairwise point matches,
estimated by a state-of-the-art point tracker over a collection of diverse
in-the-wild talking heads videos, and guide the mapping via a contrastive loss,
encouraging matched points to have close embeddings. We further employ
multi-task learning with face landmarks and segmentation constraints, as well
as imposing spatial continuity of embeddings through latent cube features,
which results in an interpretable and queryable canonical space. The
representation can be used for finding common semantic parts, face/head
tracking, and stereo reconstruction. Due to the strong supervision, our method
is robust to pose variations and covers the entire head, including hair.
Additionally, the canonical space bottleneck makes sure the obtained
representations are consistent across diverse poses and individuals. We
demonstrate state-of-the-art results in geometry-aware point matching and
monocular head tracking with 3D Morphable Models. The code and the model
checkpoint will be made available to the public.

### [66] [Multi-Personality Generation of LLMs at Decoding-time](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01891)
*Rongxin Chen,Yunfan Li,Yige Yuan,Bingbing Xu,Huawei Shen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需重新训练的多人格生成框架MPG，通过解码时组合单维人格模型的隐式密度比来灵活控制多个人格属性，并设计了高效的推测性块级拒绝采样方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于重新训练的多人格生成方法成本高且扩展性差，而解码时方法依赖外部模型或启发式方法，限制了灵活性和鲁棒性。

Method: MPG框架利用单维人格模型中的隐式密度比作为"免费午餐"，将任务重新表述为从聚合这些比率的目标策略中采样，并设计了推测性块级拒绝采样(SCR)来高效实现。

Result: 在MBTI人格和角色扮演任务上的实验表明，MPG有效性提升达16%-18%。

Conclusion: MPG框架能够在不依赖稀缺多维模型或额外训练的情况下，灵活控制多个人格属性，同时保持高质量生成并显著降低计算开销。

Abstract: Multi-personality generation for LLMs, enabling simultaneous embodiment of
multiple personalization attributes, is a fundamental challenge. Existing
retraining-based approaches are costly and poorly scalable, while decoding-time
methods often rely on external models or heuristics, limiting flexibility and
robustness. In this paper, we propose a novel Multi-Personality Generation
(MPG) framework under the decoding-time combination paradigm. It flexibly
controls multi-personality without relying on scarce multi-dimensional models
or extra training, leveraging implicit density ratios in single-dimensional
models as a "free lunch" to reformulate the task as sampling from a target
strategy aggregating these ratios. To implement MPG efficiently, we design
Speculative Chunk-level based Rejection sampling (SCR), which generates
responses in chunks and parallelly validates them via estimated thresholds
within a sliding window. This significantly reduces computational overhead
while maintaining high-quality generation. Experiments on MBTI personality and
Role-Playing demonstrate the effectiveness of MPG, showing improvements up to
16%-18%. Code and data are available at https://github.com/Libra117/MPG .

TL;DR: GEMS提出了一种基于图神经网络的人类模拟方法，在离散选择模拟任务中，能以比大型语言模型小三个数量级的规模实现相当或更好的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索在人类模拟任务中，是否必须使用大型语言模型，或者更小、领域特定的模型就足够了。

Method: 将离散选择模拟任务转化为图上的链接预测问题，使用图神经网络，仅在需要时融入语言表示。

Result: 在三个关键设置和三个模拟数据集上的评估显示，GEMS在准确性上达到或超过强LLM基线，同时具有更高的效率、可解释性和透明度。

Conclusion: 基于图的建模是LLM在人类模拟任务中的轻量级替代方案，具有显著优势。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to simulate humans, with
applications ranging from survey prediction to decision-making. However, are
LLMs strictly necessary, or can smaller, domain-grounded models suffice? We
identify a large class of simulation problems in which individuals make choices
among discrete options, where a graph neural network (GNN) can match or surpass
strong LLM baselines despite being three orders of magnitude smaller. We
introduce Graph-basEd Models for human Simulation (GEMS), which casts discrete
choice simulation tasks as a link prediction problem on graphs, leveraging
relational knowledge while incorporating language representations only when
needed. Evaluations across three key settings on three simulation datasets show
that GEMS achieves comparable or better accuracy than LLMs, with far greater
efficiency, interpretability, and transparency, highlighting the promise of
graph-based modeling as a lightweight alternative to LLMs for human simulation.

*Kangyu Qiao,Shaolei Zhang,Yang Feng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: IG-Pruning是一种新颖的输入感知块级剪枝方法，通过动态选择层掩码来减少大语言模型的计算成本，无需大量训练即可实现高效推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型计算需求增长，高效推理对实际部署变得至关重要。现有深度剪枝方法依赖固定块掩码，在不同任务和输入上表现不佳。

Method: 两阶段方法：1) 通过语义聚类和L0优化发现多样化掩码候选；2) 在推理时动态选择层掩码，无需大量训练。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在多个任务上持续优于最先进的静态深度剪枝方法。

Conclusion: IG-Pruning特别适合资源受限的部署场景，为大规模语言模型的高效推理提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: With the growing computational demands of large language models (LLMs),
efficient inference has become increasingly critical for practical deployment.
Depth pruning has emerged as a promising approach for reducing the
computational costs of large language models by removing transformer layers.
However, existing methods typically rely on fixed block masks, which can lead
to suboptimal performance across different tasks and inputs. In this paper, we
propose IG-Pruning, a novel input-aware block-wise pruning method that
dynamically selects layer masks at inference time. Our approach consists of two
stages: (1) Discovering diverse mask candidates through semantic clustering and
L0 optimization, and (2) Implementing efficient dynamic pruning without the
need for extensive training. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art static depth pruning methods, making
it particularly suitable for resource-constrained deployment scenarios.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 开发了一个自动化基础设施来测试医疗聊天机器人在不同人口统计因素下的表现，发现LLM评估者之间一致性很低，建议使用多个LLM评估器以避免统计显著但不具普适性的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗聊天机器人在涉及非医疗因素（如人口统计信息）时必须提供一致的建议，需要了解其在什么条件下会表现不佳。

Method: 开发了自动生成查询的基础设施：1）通过采样患者人口统计、病史、疾病和写作风格创建真实问题；2）使用LLM-as-a-judge设置和提示来评估答案，包括幻觉和遗漏检测。

Result: LLM注释者表现出较低的一致性（平均Cohen's Kappa κ=0.118），只有特定的（回答、评估）LLM对在不同写作风格、性别和种族上产生统计显著差异。

Conclusion: 建议使用多个LLM作为评估器以避免得出统计显著但不具普适性的结果，特别是在缺乏真实数据的情况下，并建议发布LLM间一致性指标以提高透明度。

Abstract: Recent research has shown that hallucinations, omissions, and biases are
prevalent in everyday use-cases of LLMs. However, chatbots used in medical
contexts must provide consistent advice in situations where non-medical factors
are involved, such as when demographic information is present. In order to
understand the conditions under which medical chatbots fail to perform as
expected, we develop an infrastructure that 1) automatically generates queries
to probe LLMs and 2) evaluates answers to these queries using multiple
LLM-as-a-judge setups and prompts. For 1), our prompt creation pipeline samples
the space of patient demographics, histories, disorders, and writing styles to
create realistic questions that we subsequently use to prompt LLMs. In 2), our
evaluation pipeline provides hallucination and omission detection using
LLM-as-a-judge as well as agentic workflows, in addition to LLM-as-a-judge
treatment category detectors. As a baseline study, we perform two case studies
on inter-LLM agreement and the impact of varying the answering and evaluation
LLMs. We find that LLM annotators exhibit low agreement scores (average Cohen's
Kappa $\kappa=0.118$), and only specific (answering, evaluation) LLM pairs
yield statistically significant differences across writing styles, genders, and
races. We recommend that studies using LLM evaluation use multiple LLMs as
evaluators in order to avoid arriving at statistically significant but
non-generalizable results, particularly in the absence of ground-truth data. We
also suggest publishing inter-LLM agreement metrics for transparency. Our code
and dataset are available here:

*Liuhao Lin,Ke Li,Zihan Xu,Yuchen Shi,Yulei Qin,Yan Zhang,Xing Sun,Rongrong Ji*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LTD-Bench是一个突破性的基准测试，通过要求模型生成点阵绘图或可执行代码，将LLM评估从抽象分数转化为可直接观察的视觉输出，暴露了模型在空间推理方面的严重缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM评估范式存在关键盲点，依赖不透明的数值指标掩盖了空间推理的基本限制，无法直观理解模型能力，导致报告性能与实际能力之间存在危险脱节。

Method: LTD-Bench采用综合方法，包含互补的生成任务（测试空间想象力）和识别任务（评估空间感知），在三个渐进难度级别上系统评估语言-空间映射的两个关键方向。

Result: 实验显示令人担忧的能力差距：即使在传统基准测试中表现优异的LLM，在建立语言与空间概念双向映射方面也存在严重缺陷，这削弱了它们作为真正世界模型的潜力。

Conclusion: LTD-Bench的视觉输出支持强大的诊断分析，为研究模型相似性提供了潜在方法，揭示了LLM在空间推理方面的根本局限性。

Abstract: Current evaluation paradigms for large language models (LLMs) represent a
critical blind spot in AI research--relying on opaque numerical metrics that
conceal fundamental limitations in spatial reasoning while providing no
intuitive understanding of model capabilities. This deficiency creates a
dangerous disconnect between reported performance and practical abilities,
particularly for applications requiring physical world understanding. We
introduce LTD-Bench, a breakthrough benchmark that transforms LLM evaluation
from abstract scores to directly observable visual outputs by requiring models
to generate drawings through dot matrices or executable code. This approach
makes spatial reasoning limitations immediately apparent even to non-experts,
bridging the fundamental gap between statistical performance and intuitive
assessment. LTD-Bench implements a comprehensive methodology with complementary
generation tasks (testing spatial imagination) and recognition tasks (assessing
spatial perception) across three progressively challenging difficulty levels,
methodically evaluating both directions of the critical language-spatial
mapping. Our extensive experiments with state-of-the-art models expose an
alarming capability gap: even LLMs achieving impressive results on traditional
benchmarks demonstrate profound deficiencies in establishing bidirectional
mappings between language and spatial concept--a fundamental limitation that
undermines their potential as genuine world models. Furthermore, LTD-Bench's
visual outputs enable powerful diagnostic analysis, offering a potential
approach to investigate model similarity.

*Wongyu Kim,Hochang Lee,Sanghak Lee,Yoonsung Kim,Jaehyun Park*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: M-Solomon是一个多模态嵌入器，能够自适应地决定何时进行查询增强，只在必要时进行增强，从而在保持性能的同时显著降低嵌入延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于LLM的嵌入器对所有查询都进行增强，导致显著的嵌入延迟，且某些查询的增强反而会损害性能。此外，先前方法未在多模态环境中探索。

Method: 首先将训练数据集中的查询分为需要增强和不需要增强两组；然后利用强大的多模态LLM为需要增强的查询生成适当的增强内容；最后通过自适应查询增强，M-Solomon只在必要时进行增强。

Result: 实验结果表明，M-Solomon不仅大幅超越了不进行增强的基线，也优于总是进行增强的基线，同时提供了更快的嵌入延迟。

Conclusion: M-Solomon通过自适应查询增强策略，在多模态检索任务中实现了更好的性能和效率平衡。

Abstract: Query augmentation makes queries more meaningful by appending further
information to the queries to find relevant documents. Current studies have
proposed Large Language Model (LLM)-based embedders, which learn representation
for embedding and generation for query augmentation in a multi-task manner by
leveraging the generative capabilities of LLM. During inference, these jointly
trained embedders have conducted query augmentation followed by embedding,
showing effective results. However, augmenting every query leads to substantial
embedding latency and query augmentation can be detrimental to performance for
some queries. Also, previous methods have not been explored in multimodal
environments. To tackle these problems, we propose M-Solomon, a universal
multimodal embedder that can adaptively determine when to augment queries. Our
approach first divides the queries of the training datasets into two groups at
the dataset level. One includes queries that require augmentation and the other
includes queries that do not. Then, we introduces a synthesis process that
generates appropriate augmentations for queries that require them by leveraging
a powerful Multimodal LLM (MLLM). Next, we present adaptive query augmentation.
Through this step, M-Solomon can conduct query augmentation only when necessary
by learning to generate synthetic augmentations with the prefix /augment for
queries that demand them and to generate the simple string /embed for others.
Experimental results showed that M-Solomon not only surpassed the baseline
without augmentation by a large margin but also outperformed the baseline that
always used augmentation, providing much faster embedding latency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏专门针对中文语言环境和法律社会框架的LLM安全评估基准，需要建立动态更新的安全评估体系来应对不断变化的安全威胁。

Method: 构建包含合法性、伦理、事实性、隐私、对抗鲁棒性和推理安全六个维度的评估框架，采用动态更新机制，定期纳入新的威胁向量。

Result: 当前版本(v251030)已评估18个LLM，提供了中文语境下AI安全现状的全面视图，并建立了公开可访问的排行榜。

Conclusion: LiveSecBench为中文LLM安全评估提供了标准化框架，其动态更新特性确保了评估的持续相关性，有助于推动中文AI安全的发展。

Abstract: In this work, we propose LiveSecBench, a dynamic and continuously updated

LiveSecBench evaluates models across six critical dimensions (Legality, Ethics,
Factuality, Privacy, Adversarial Robustness, and Reasoning Safety) rooted in
the Chinese legal and social frameworks. This benchmark maintains relevance
through a dynamic update schedule that incorporates new threat vectors, such as
the planned inclusion of Text-to-Image Generation Safety and Agentic Safety in

TL;DR: AyurParam-2.9B是一个专门针对阿育吠陀医学领域的双语语言模型，在专业医学任务上超越了同规模的开源模型，甚至能与更大模型竞争。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型在需要深厚文化、语言和专业知识的专业领域表现不佳，特别是传统医学系统如阿育吠陀包含的复杂知识，主流LLMs无法准确解释和应用。

Method: 从Param-1-2.9B模型微调，使用专家精心策划的阿育吠陀数据集，包含古典文本和临床指南，采用上下文感知、推理和客观风格的双语问答，并有严格的事实准确性和教学清晰度标注协议。

Result: 在BhashaBench-Ayur基准测试中，AyurParam不仅超越了同规模（1.5-3B参数）的所有开源指令调优模型，还显示出与更大模型竞争甚至更优的性能。

Conclusion: AyurParam的结果强调了在提供可靠、文化一致的AI用于专业医学知识时，真实领域适应和高质量监督的必要性。

Abstract: Current large language models excel at broad, general-purpose tasks, but
consistently underperform when exposed to highly specialized domains that
require deep cultural, linguistic, and subject-matter expertise. In particular,
traditional medical systems such as Ayurveda embody centuries of nuanced
textual and clinical knowledge that mainstream LLMs fail to accurately
interpret or apply. We introduce AyurParam-2.9B, a domain-specialized,
bilingual language model fine-tuned from Param-1-2.9B using an extensive,
expertly curated Ayurveda dataset spanning classical texts and clinical
guidance. AyurParam's dataset incorporates context-aware, reasoning, and
objective-style Q&A in both English and Hindi, with rigorous annotation
protocols for factual precision and instructional clarity. Benchmarked on
BhashaBench-Ayur, AyurParam not only surpasses all open-source
instruction-tuned models in its size class (1.5--3B parameters), but also
demonstrates competitive or superior performance compared to much larger
models. The results from AyurParam highlight the necessity for authentic domain
adaptation and high-quality supervision in delivering reliable, culturally
congruent AI for specialized medical knowledge.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AutoAdv是一个无需训练的多轮越狱攻击框架，通过自适应机制在6轮对话内对Llama-3.1-8B达到95%攻击成功率，比单轮攻击提升24%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM安全评估主要关注单轮交互，而真实攻击往往通过多轮自适应对话展开，当前对齐策略对多轮攻击防御不足。

Method: 结合三种自适应机制：模式管理器从成功攻击中学习改进提示、温度管理器基于失败模式动态调整采样参数、两阶段重写策略先伪装有害请求再迭代优化。

Result: 在商业和开源模型（GPT-4o-mini、Qwen3-235B、Mistral-7B）上广泛评估显示，多轮攻击始终优于单轮方法，现有安全机制存在持续漏洞。

Conclusion: 针对单轮交互优化的对齐策略无法在扩展对话中保持鲁棒性，迫切需要开发多轮感知的防御机制。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks where
adversarial prompts elicit harmful outputs, yet most evaluations focus on
single-turn interactions while real-world attacks unfold through adaptive
multi-turn conversations. We present AutoAdv, a training-free framework for
automated multi-turn jailbreaking that achieves up to 95% attack success rate
on Llama-3.1-8B within six turns a 24 percent improvement over single turn
baselines. AutoAdv uniquely combines three adaptive mechanisms: a pattern
manager that learns from successful attacks to enhance future prompts, a
temperature manager that dynamically adjusts sampling parameters based on
failure modes, and a two-phase rewriting strategy that disguises harmful
requests then iteratively refines them. Extensive evaluation across commercial
and open-source models (GPT-4o-mini, Qwen3-235B, Mistral-7B) reveals persistent
vulnerabilities in current safety mechanisms, with multi-turn attacks
consistently outperforming single-turn approaches. These findings demonstrate
that alignment strategies optimized for single-turn interactions fail to
maintain robustness across extended conversations, highlighting an urgent need
for multi-turn-aware defenses.

*Kentaro Ueda,François Portet,Hirohiko Suwa,Keiichi Yasumoto*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了如何通过合并领域特定的持续预训练专家模型来构建多技能大语言模型，特别是在金融领域。作者提出了三阶段评估框架，比较了三种模型合并方法，发现合并专家模型可以恢复丢失的通用知识并产生新兴的跨领域技能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在专业领域（如金融）表现不佳，需要融合领域知识、数学推理和多语言处理等多种技能。直接进行多技能训练成本高且不稳定，而合并领域特定的持续预训练专家模型是一个实用的替代方案，但这一领域尚未被充分探索。

Method: 创建金融、数学和日语领域的专家模型，提出三阶段评估框架（知识恢复、互补性和涌现性），在包含18个任务、8个数据集的综合金融基准上评估三种模型合并方法：任务算术、TIES和DARE-TIES。

Result: 合并专家模型与其基础模型可以恢复在持续预训练中丢失的通用知识；合并不同专家模型能提高性能并可能产生新兴的跨领域技能。任务算术方法表现强劲但对超参数敏感，TIES方法更稳健。模型相似性与合并成功相关，但新兴技能取决于更复杂的因素。

Conclusion: 这项工作首次对持续预训练模型合并进行了基础性分析，建立了原则性框架，为从现有资产构建多技能大语言模型提供了明确指导。

Abstract: While LLMs excel at general tasks, they struggle in specialized domains like
finance, requiring diverse skills in domain knowledge, mathematical reasoning,
and multilingual processing. Merging domain-specific Continual Pre-training
(CPT) "experts" offers a practical alternative to costly and unstable
multi-skill training. However, unlike established Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)
model-based merging, CPT model merging remains largely unexplored. We address
this gap by creating financial LLMs from experts in finance, math, and
Japanese. We propose a three-stage evaluation focusing on knowledge recovery,
complementarity, and emergence, and assess three merging methods (Task
Arithmetic, TIES, and DARE-TIES) on a comprehensive financial benchmark curated
from 18 tasks across 8 established datasets. Results show that merging an
expert with its base model recovers general knowledge lost during CPT, while
merging experts improves performance and can yield emergent cross-domain
skills. Among the methods, Task Arithmetic performs strongly but is
hyperparameter-sensitive, whereas TIES is more robust. Our findings also
suggest that while model similarity correlates with merging success, emergent
skills depend on more complex factors. This work presents the first
foundational analysis of CPT model merging, establishing a principled framework
and providing clear guidance for building multi-skill LLMs from existing
assets.

TL;DR: 研究评估了基于角色的提示是否能提升大语言模型在宏观经济预测任务中的表现，发现GPT-4o与人类专家预测准确度相似，但角色描述对预测准确性没有显著影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索角色提示是否能改善LLM在宏观经济预测中的性能，特别是复制欧洲央行专业预测者调查的准确性。

Method: 使用PersonaHub语料库中的2,368个经济学相关角色提示GPT-4o，在50个季度（2013-2025）中复制ECB专业预测者调查，并与无角色描述的基线预测进行比较。

Result: GPT-4o与人类预测者准确度相似，差异统计显著但实际微小；角色描述没有带来可测量的预测优势；GPT-4o在样本外数据上保持竞争力但表现有差异。

Conclusion: GPT-4o在提供相关上下文数据时能在宏观经济预测中达到竞争力，但多样化提示产生的预测比人类专家组更加同质化，角色描述可省略以降低计算成本。

Abstract: We evaluate whether persona-based prompting improves Large Language Model
(LLM) performance on macroeconomic forecasting tasks. Using 2,368
economics-related personas from the PersonaHub corpus, we prompt GPT-4o to
replicate the ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters across 50 quarterly rounds
(2013-2025). We compare the persona-prompted forecasts against the human
experts panel, across four target variables (HICP, core HICP, GDP growth,
unemployment) and four forecast horizons. We also compare the results against
100 baseline forecasts without persona descriptions to isolate its effect. We
report two main findings. Firstly, GPT-4o and human forecasters achieve
remarkably similar accuracy levels, with differences that are statistically
significant yet practically modest. Our out-of-sample evaluation on 2024-2025
data demonstrates that GPT-4o can maintain competitive forecasting performance
on unseen events, though with notable differences compared to the in-sample
period. Secondly, our ablation experiment reveals no measurable forecasting
advantage from persona descriptions, suggesting these prompt components can be
omitted to reduce computational costs without sacrificing accuracy. Our results
provide evidence that GPT-4o can achieve competitive forecasting accuracy even
on out-of-sample macroeconomic events, if provided with relevant context data,
while revealing that diverse prompts produce remarkably homogeneous forecasts
compared to human panels.

Abstract: Hiring processes often involve the manual screening of hundreds of resumes
for each job, a task that is time and effort consuming, error-prone, and
subject to human bias. This paper presents Smart-Hiring, an end-to-end Natural
Language Processing (NLP) pipeline de- signed to automatically extract
structured information from unstructured resumes and to semantically match
candidates with job descriptions. The proposed system combines document
parsing, named-entity recognition, and contextual text embedding techniques to
capture skills, experience, and qualifications. Using advanced NLP technics,
Smart-Hiring encodes both resumes and job descriptions in a shared vector space
to compute similarity scores between candidates and job postings. The pipeline
is modular and explainable, allowing users to inspect extracted entities and
matching rationales. Experiments were conducted on a real-world dataset of
resumes and job descriptions spanning multiple professional domains,
demonstrating the robustness and feasibility of the proposed approach. The
system achieves competitive matching accuracy while preserving a high degree of
interpretability and transparency in its decision process. This work introduces
a scalable and practical NLP frame- work for recruitment analytics and outlines
promising directions for bias mitigation, fairness-aware modeling, and
large-scale deployment of data-driven hiring solutions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: NTKT将知识追踪重构为基于预训练大语言模型的下一个token预测任务，通过将学生历史和问题内容表示为文本序列，显著提升了预测性能和在冷启动场景下的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识追踪模型通常只使用答题正确性和元数据（如技能标签和时间戳），而忽略了问题文本这一重要的教学信息源，这限制了预测性能的提升。

Method: 提出NTKT方法，将知识追踪重构为下一个token预测任务，使用预训练大语言模型同时学习学生行为模式和问题语言模式。

Result: 实验表明NTKT在性能上显著优于最先进的神经知识追踪模型，在冷启动问题和用户场景下具有更好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 问题内容在知识追踪中具有重要作用，利用预训练大语言模型的表示能力可以更有效地建模学生学习过程。

Abstract: Modelling student knowledge is a key challenge when leveraging AI in
education, with major implications for personalised learning. The Knowledge
Tracing (KT) task aims to predict how students will respond to educational
questions in learning environments, based on their prior interactions. Existing
KT models typically use response correctness along with metadata like skill
tags and timestamps, often overlooking the question text, which is an important
source of pedagogical insight. This omission poses a lost opportunity while
limiting predictive performance. We propose Next Token Knowledge Tracing
(NTKT), a novel approach that reframes KT as a next-token prediction task using
pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs). NTKT represents both student histories
and question content as sequences of text, allowing LLMs to learn patterns in
both behaviour and language. Our series of experiments significantly improves
performance over state-of-the-art neural KT models and generalises much better
to cold-start questions and users. These findings highlight the importance of
question content in KT and demonstrate the benefits of leveraging pretrained
representations of LLMs to model student learning more effectively.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于贝叶斯框架的置信度引导早停方法(CGES)，通过置信度信号自适应停止采样，在保持准确率的同时显著减少大语言模型的调用次数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自一致性策略需要固定次数的模型调用，且当正确答案罕见时容易失败，需要更高效的采样策略。

Method: 使用贝叶斯框架，基于token概率或奖励模型得到的置信度信号构建候选答案的后验分布，当某个候选的后验质量超过阈值时自适应停止采样。

Result: 在五个推理基准测试中，CGES将平均模型调用次数减少约69%(如从16.0次降至4.9次)，同时准确率与自一致性方法相差不超过0.06个百分点。

Conclusion: CGES方法能够显著提高大语言模型推理的效率，在保持准确性的同时大幅减少计算成本。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are often queried multiple times at test time,
with predictions aggregated by majority vote. While effective, this
self-consistency strategy (arXiv:2203.11171) requires a fixed number of calls
and can fail when the correct answer is rare. We introduce Confidence-Guided
Early Stopping (CGES), a Bayesian framework that forms posteriors over
candidate answers using scalar confidence signals derived from token
probabilities or reward models. CGES adaptively halts sampling once the
posterior mass of a candidate exceeds a threshold. We provide theoretical
guarantees for both perfectly calibrated confidences and realistic noisy
confidence signals. Across five reasoning benchmarks, CGES reduces the average
number of model calls by about 69 percent (for example, from 16.0 to 4.9) while
matching the accuracy of self-consistency within 0.06 percentage points.

TL;DR: TRACE框架通过程序化策略应用解决大语言模型与现实政策之间的对齐差距，实现精确的遗忘学习，在保持模型性能的同时更新策略对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型对齐方法产生静态、脆弱且维护成本高的模型，无法跟上不断演变的规范和政策，存在对齐-现实差距问题。

Method: TRACE框架通过程序化筛选现有偏好数据、使用对齐影响评分识别高冲突样本，并应用混合优化来反转、丢弃或保留偏好，同时保护模型性能。

Result: 在多种模型家族上验证，TRACE能在复杂政策变化下强制执行新原则而不降低通用能力，在合成基准和PKU-SafeRLHF数据集上表现稳健。

Conclusion: TRACE为维护LLM对齐提供了可扩展、动态且经济高效的范式，为可持续和负责任AI部署奠定了基础。

Abstract: The alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) with human values is central to
their safe deployment, yet current practice produces static, brittle, and
costly-to-maintain models that fail to keep pace with evolving norms and
policies. This misalignment, which we term the Alignment-Reality Gap, poses a
growing challenge for reliable long-term use. Existing remedies are inadequate:
large-scale re-annotation is economically prohibitive, and standard unlearning
methods act as blunt instruments that erode utility rather than enable precise
policy updates. We introduce TRACE (Triage and Re-align by Alignment Conflict
Evaluation), a framework for principled unlearning that reconceives
re-alignment as a programmatic policy application problem. TRACE
programmatically triages existing preference data against a new policy,
identifies high-impact conflicts via a alignment impact score, and applies a
hybrid optimization that cleanly inverts, discards, or preserves preferences
while safeguarding model performance. Empirical results show that TRACE
achieves robust re-alignment across diverse model families (Qwen2.5-7B,
Gemma-2-9B, Llama-3.1-8B). On both synthetic benchmarks and the PKU-SafeRLHF
dataset under complex policy shift, TRACE enforces new principles without
degrading general capabilities. Our work establishes a scalable, dynamic, and
cost-effective paradigm for maintaining LLM alignment, providing a foundation
for sustainable and responsible AI deployment.

Motivation: 现有研究未深入探讨新知识微调导致的事实幻觉的具体表现和机制，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 设计了Biography-Reasoning数据集，进行细粒度分析，并提出KnownPatch方法在训练后期加入已知知识样本。

Result: 发现特定知识类型的高陌生度是幻觉的主要驱动因素，新知识学习会降低模型对问题关键实体的注意力。KnownPatch方法有效缓解了幻觉并提升了性能。

Conclusion: 新知识学习会干扰模型对关键实体的注意力模式，导致事实幻觉。KnownPatch方法通过恢复注意力模式有效缓解了这一问题。

Abstract: Previous studies show that introducing new knowledge during large language
models (LLMs) fine-tuning can lead to the generation of erroneous output when
tested on known information, thereby triggering factual hallucinations.
However, existing studies have not deeply investigated the specific
manifestations and underlying mechanisms of these hallucinations. Our work
addresses this gap by designing a controlled dataset Biography-Reasoning, and
conducting a fine-grained analysis across multiple knowledge types and two task
types, including knowledge question answering (QA) and knowledge reasoning
tasks. We find that when fine-tuned on a dataset in which a specific knowledge
type consists entirely of new knowledge, LLMs exhibit significantly increased
hallucination tendencies. This suggests that the high unfamiliarity of a
particular knowledge type, rather than the overall proportion of new knowledge,
is a stronger driver of hallucinations, and these tendencies can even affect
other knowledge types in QA tasks. To mitigate such factual hallucinations, we
propose KnownPatch, which patches a small number of known knowledge samples in
the later stages of training, effectively alleviating new-knowledge-induced
hallucinations. Through attention analysis, we find that learning new knowledge
reduces the model's attention to key entities in the question, thus causing
excessive focus on the surrounding context, which may increase the risk of
hallucination. Moreover, the attention pattern can propagate to similar
contexts, facilitating the spread of hallucinations to textually similar
questions. Our method effectively mitigates the disruption of new knowledge
learning to the model's attention on key entities, accompanied by improved
performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型微调后仅影响少量参数，但存储这些微调模型仍面临挑战。现有方法单独使用低秩近似或稀疏化可能丢弃重要的奇异成分，影响模型表达能力。

Method: 提出最优奇异值损伤方法，通过利用奇异向量的交错重要性，在相同内存预算下选择性稀疏化低秩近似更新，保留最具影响力的组件。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在相同内存预算下实现了显著的存储效率提升和更优的准确率，优于单独使用低秩近似或稀疏化的方法。

Conclusion: 结合低秩近似和稀疏化的方法能够更有效地存储微调模型参数更新，在保持模型性能的同时大幅减少存储需求。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly prevalent across diverse
applications. However, their enormous size limits storage and processing
capabilities to a few well-resourced stakeholders. As a result, most
applications rely on pre-trained LLMs, fine-tuned for specific tasks. However,
even storing the fine-tuned versions of these models remains a significant
challenge due to the wide range of tasks they address. Recently, studies show
that fine-tuning these models primarily affects a small fraction of parameters,
highlighting the need for more efficient storage of fine-tuned models. This
paper focuses on efficient storage of parameter updates in pre-trained models
after fine-tuning. To address this challenge, we leverage the observation that
fine-tuning updates are both low-rank and sparse, which can be utilized for
storage efficiency. However, using only low-rank approximation or
sparsification may discard critical singular components that enhance model
expressivity. We first observe that given the same memory budget, sparsified
low-rank approximations with larger ranks outperform standard low-rank
approximations with smaller ranks. Building on this, we propose our method,
optimal singular damage, that selectively sparsifies low-rank approximated
updates by leveraging the interleaved importance of singular vectors, ensuring
that the most impactful components are retained. We demonstrate through
extensive experiments that our proposed methods lead to significant storage
efficiency and superior accuracy within the same memory budget compared to
employing the low-rank approximation or sparsification individually.

TL;DR: PragExTra是首个多语言语料库和检测框架，用于识别翻译中的语用显化现象，通过主动学习提高分类准确率，为文化感知机器翻译奠定基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 翻译中经常需要添加背景信息来向新受众明确隐含的文化含义，这种现象被称为语用显化，在翻译理论中广泛讨论但很少进行计算建模。

Method: 构建了覆盖8种语言对的语料库，通过空对齐识别候选显化案例，并使用主动学习和人工标注进行精炼。

Result: 实体和系统级显化最为频繁，主动学习将分类器准确率提高了7-8个百分点，在跨语言中达到最高0.88准确率和0.82 F1值。

Conclusion: PragExTra将语用显化确立为可测量的跨语言现象，并为构建文化感知机器翻译迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Translators often enrich texts with background details that make implicit
cultural meanings explicit for new audiences. This phenomenon, known as
pragmatic explicitation, has been widely discussed in translation theory but
rarely modeled computationally. We introduce PragExTra, the first multilingual
corpus and detection framework for pragmatic explicitation. The corpus covers
eight language pairs from TED-Multi and Europarl and includes additions such as
entity descriptions, measurement conversions, and translator remarks. We
identify candidate explicitation cases through null alignments and refined
using active learning with human annotation. Our results show that entity and
system-level explicitations are most frequent, and that active learning
improves classifier accuracy by 7-8 percentage points, achieving up to 0.88
accuracy and 0.82 F1 across languages. PragExTra establishes pragmatic
explicitation as a measurable, cross-linguistic phenomenon and takes a step
towards building culturally aware machine translation. Keywords: translation,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人工智能在全球快速扩散但采用不均衡，前沿大语言模型在低资源语言上表现不佳，作者假设这种性能缺陷降低了AI的效用，从而减缓了低资源语言国家的采用速度

Method: 使用加权回归模型从社会经济和人口因素中分离出语言效应

Result: 低资源语言国家的AI用户比例比基准水平低约20%

Conclusion: 语言可访问性是AI公平扩散的重要独立障碍

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is diffusing globally at unprecedented speed,
but adoption remains uneven. Frontier Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to
perform poorly on low-resource languages due to data scarcity. We hypothesize
that this performance deficit reduces the utility of AI, thereby slowing
adoption in Low-Resource Language Countries (LRLCs). To test this, we use a
weighted regression model to isolate the language effect from socioeconomic and
demographic factors, finding that LRLCs have a share of AI users that is
approximately 20% lower relative to their baseline. These results indicate that
linguistic accessibility is a significant, independent barrier to equitable AI
diffusion.

Motivation: 现有去中心化多LLM系统对每个输入都调用多个模型，导致推理成本高昂且不可控。需要设计能够选择性协调专家模型的集中式框架，在保证性能的同时控制成本。

Method: 提出CoRL强化学习框架，将多LLM协调问题建模为具有双重目标的强化学习：最大化任务性能同时最小化总体推理成本。使用中央控制器选择性地调用专家模型池。

Result: 在四个不同基准测试上的实验表明，CoRL在高预算设置下能超越最佳专家LLM，在低预算模式下仍保持强劲性能。

Conclusion: 集中式协调为可扩展且成本高效的多代理LLM系统提供了有效解决方案，能够在不同预算条件下实现性能与成本的优化平衡。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit complementary strengths across domains
and come with varying inference costs, motivating the design of multi-agent LLM
systems where specialized models collaborate efficiently. Existing approaches
predominantly rely on decentralized frameworks, which invoke multiple LLMs for
every input and thus lead to substantial and uncontrolled inference costs. In
this work, we introduce a centralized multi-LLM framework, where a controller
LLM selectively coordinates a pool of expert models in a cost-efficient and
cost-controllable manner. We formulate this coordination problem as
reinforcement learning with dual objectives: maximizing task performance while
minimizing the overall inference cost. In addition, we expect the multi-agent
system to have adapted behavior with different budget conditions during
inference. To this end, we propose CoRL, a reinforcement learning framework
that optimizes the performance cost trade-off in a controllable multi-budget
setting. Experiments on four diverse benchmarks demonstrate that CoRL enables a
single system to surpass the best expert LLM under high-budget settings, while
maintaining strong performance in more economical low-budget modes,
highlighting the effectiveness of centralized coordination for scalable and
cost-efficient multi-agent LLM systems.

TL;DR: AMER是一种新的检索器架构，通过自回归生成多个查询向量来检索多模态相关文档，相比单向量检索器在目标文档嵌入距离较大时表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检索器只生成一个查询向量，但查询的相关文档分布可能是多模态的（如不同解释），单向量难以捕捉这种多样性。

Method: 开发了自回归多嵌入检索器(AMER)，自回归生成多个查询向量，所有预测的查询向量都用于从语料库中检索文档。

Result: 在合成向量化数据上完美捕捉多个目标分布，性能比单嵌入模型好4倍；在真实世界多答案检索数据集上，相比单嵌入基线分别获得4%和21%的相对增益；在目标文档嵌入相似度较低的子集上增益更明显。

Conclusion: 多查询向量检索器具有潜力，为未来研究开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Most text retrievers generate \emph{one} query vector to retrieve relevant
documents. Yet, the conditional distribution of relevant documents for the
query may be multimodal, e.g., representing different interpretations of the
query. We first quantify the limitations of existing retrievers. All retrievers
we evaluate struggle more as the distance between target document embeddings
grows. To address this limitation, we develop a new retriever architecture,
\emph{A}utoregressive \emph{M}ulti-\emph{E}mbedding \emph{R}etriever (AMER).
Our model autoregressively generates multiple query vectors, and all the
predicted query vectors are used to retrieve documents from the corpus. We show
that on the synthetic vectorized data, the proposed method could capture
multiple target distributions perfectly, showing 4x better performance than
single embedding model. We also fine-tune our model on real-world multi-answer
retrieval datasets and evaluate in-domain. AMER presents 4 and 21\% relative
gains over single-embedding baselines on two datasets we evaluate on.
Furthermore, we consistently observe larger gains on the subset of dataset
where the embeddings of the target documents are less similar to each other. We
demonstrate the potential of using a multi-query vector retriever and open up a
new direction for future work.

TL;DR: MemSearcher是一种搜索代理工作流，通过迭代维护紧凑内存来平衡信息完整性和效率，在多轮交互中稳定上下文长度，显著提升性能同时降低计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统搜索代理要么保留完整交互历史导致上下文过长、计算成本高，要么仅使用当前轮次丢弃重要信息，这种权衡限制了搜索代理的可扩展性。

Method: 提出MemSearcher工作流，在每个轮次将用户问题与内存融合生成推理轨迹，执行搜索动作，并更新内存仅保留任务解决必需信息。引入多上下文GRPO强化学习框架联合优化推理、搜索策略和内存管理。

Result: 在七个公共基准测试上相比强基线取得显著提升：Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct平均提升11%，Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct平均提升12%。3B版本的MemSearcher甚至超越7B基线模型。

Conclusion: 在信息完整性和效率之间取得平衡能够同时实现更高准确性和更低计算开销，MemSearcher证明了这种方法的有效性。

Abstract: Typical search agents concatenate the entire interaction history into the LLM
context, preserving information integrity but producing long, noisy contexts,
resulting in high computation and memory costs. In contrast, using only the
current turn avoids this overhead but discards essential information. This
trade-off limits the scalability of search agents. To address this challenge,
we propose MemSearcher, an agent workflow that iteratively maintains a compact
memory and combines the current turn with it. At each turn, MemSearcher fuses
the user's question with the memory to generate reasoning traces, perform
search actions, and update memory to retain only information essential for
solving the task. This design stabilizes context length across multi-turn
interactions, improving efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. To optimize
this workflow, we introduce multi-context GRPO, an end-to-end RL framework that
jointly optimize reasoning, search strategies, and memory management of
MemSearcher Agents. Specifically, multi-context GRPO samples groups of
trajectories under different contexts and propagates trajectory-level
advantages across all conversations within them. Trained on the same dataset as
Search-R1, MemSearcher achieves significant improvements over strong baselines
on seven public benchmarks: +11% on Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct and +12% on
Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct relative average gains. Notably, the 3B-based MemSearcher
even outperforms 7B-based baselines, demonstrating that striking a balance
between information integrity and efficiency yields both higher accuracy and
lower computational overhead. The code and models will be publicly available at

TL;DR: Oolong是一个长上下文推理基准测试，包含合成任务和真实世界任务，要求模型分析大量文本片段并进行聚合推理，前沿模型在128K上下文长度下准确率均低于50%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有长上下文评估主要依赖检索任务，允许模型忽略大部分上下文作为噪声，这仅代表一种任务类型。需要评估模型在需要分析每个文本片段并进行聚合推理的长上下文任务上的能力。

Method: 开发Oolong基准测试，分为Oolong-synth（自然合成任务，便于消融分析）和Oolong-real（真实世界对话数据推理）。任务要求模型对大量示例进行推理，执行分类和计数，并处理时间和用户关系。

Result: 前沿模型在Oolong上表现不佳，GPT-5、Claude-Sonnet-4和Gemini-2.5-Pro在128K上下文长度下在两个任务集上的准确率均低于50%。

Conclusion: 当前模型在需要分析大量文本片段并进行聚合推理的长上下文任务上仍有困难，Oolong基准测试的发布将促进能够在大规模文本上进行推理的模型的进一步发展。

Abstract: As model context lengths continue to grow, concerns about whether models
effectively use the full context length have persisted. While several carefully
designed long-context evaluations have recently been released, these
evaluations tend to rely on retrieval from one or more sections of the context,
which allows nearly all of the context tokens to be disregarded as noise. This
represents only one type of task that might be performed with long context. We
introduce Oolong, a benchmark of long-context reasoning tasks that require
analyzing individual chunks of text on an atomic level, and then aggregating
these analyses to answer distributional questions. Oolong is separated into two
task sets: Oolong-synth, a set of naturalistic synthetic tasks, where we can
easily ablate components of the reasoning problem; and Oolong-real, a
downstream setting which requires reasoning over real-world conversational
data. Oolong requires models to reason over large quantities of examples, to
perform both classification and counting in-context, and to reason over
temporal and user relations. Even frontier models struggle on Oolong, with
GPT-5, Claude-Sonnet-4, and Gemini-2.5-Pro all achieving less than 50% accuracy
on both splits at 128K. We release the data and evaluation harness for Oolong
to enable further development of models that can reason over large quantities
of text.

Conclusion: 通过镜像神经元动力学建模的内在动机可以通过在AI架构中直接嵌入共情样机制来补充现有的对齐技术。

Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) advances toward superhuman capabilities,
aligning these systems with human values becomes increasingly critical. Current
alignment strategies rely largely on externally specified constraints that may
prove insufficient against future super-intelligent AI capable of circumventing
top-down controls.
  This research investigates whether artificial neural networks (ANNs) can
develop patterns analogous to biological mirror neurons cells that activate
both when performing and observing actions, and how such patterns might
contribute to intrinsic alignment in AI. Mirror neurons play a crucial role in
empathy, imitation, and social cognition in humans. The study therefore asks:
(1) Can simple ANNs develop mirror-neuron patterns? and (2) How might these
patterns contribute to ethical and cooperative decision-making in AI systems?
  Using a novel Frog and Toad game framework designed to promote cooperative
behaviors, we identify conditions under which mirror-neuron patterns emerge,
evaluate their influence on action circuits, introduce the Checkpoint Mirror
Neuron Index (CMNI) to quantify activation strength and consistency, and
propose a theoretical framework for further study.
  Our findings indicate that appropriately scaled model capacities and
self/other coupling foster shared neural representations in ANNs similar to
biological mirror neurons. These empathy-like circuits support cooperative
behavior and suggest that intrinsic motivations modeled through mirror-neuron
dynamics could complement existing alignment techniques by embedding
empathy-like mechanisms directly within AI architectures.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出人机协同具身智能系统，将人类用户、智能代理AI和可穿戴硬件集成，用于现实世界实验和智能制造，实现物理领域的智能推理和执行。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器学习模型局限于虚拟领域，而现实世界实验和制造仍依赖人类监督，机器智能与物理执行之间的差距限制了科学和制造工作流程的可重复性、可扩展性和可访问性。

Method: 开发APEX系统，通过混合现实将智能推理与物理执行结合，系统观察和解释人类动作，与标准操作程序对齐，提供3D视觉指导并分析每个步骤。

Result: 在柔性电子制造洁净室中实施，APEX系统实现上下文感知推理，准确率超过通用多模态大语言模型，实时纠正错误，并将专业知识传递给初学者。

Conclusion: 建立了一类新的智能-物理-人类智能系统，将智能推理从计算领域扩展到物理领域，使科学研究和制造转变为自主、可追溯、可解释和可扩展的过程。

Abstract: Scientific experiment and manufacture rely on complex, multi-step procedures
that demand continuous human expertise for precise execution and
decision-making. Despite advances in machine learning and automation,
conventional models remain confined to virtual domains, while real-world
experiment and manufacture still rely on human supervision and expertise. This
gap between machine intelligence and physical execution limits reproducibility,
scalability, and accessibility across scientific and manufacture workflows.
Here, we introduce human-AI co-embodied intelligence, a new form of physical AI
that unites human users, agentic AI, and wearable hardware into an integrated
system for real-world experiment and intelligent manufacture. In this paradigm,
humans provide precise execution and control, while agentic AI contributes
memory, contextual reasoning, adaptive planning, and real-time feedback. The
wearable interface continuously captures the experimental and manufacture
processes, facilitates seamless communication between humans and AI for
corrective guidance and interpretable collaboration. As a demonstration, we
present Agentic-Physical Experimentation (APEX) system, coupling agentic
reasoning with physical execution through mixed-reality. APEX observes and
interprets human actions, aligns them with standard operating procedures,
provides 3D visual guidance, and analyzes every step. Implemented in a
cleanroom for flexible electronics fabrication, APEX system achieves
context-aware reasoning with accuracy exceeding general multimodal large
language models, corrects errors in real time, and transfers expertise to
beginners. These results establish a new class of agentic-physical-human
intelligence that extends agentic reasoning beyond computation into the
physical domain, transforming scientific research and manufacturing into
autonomous, traceable, interpretable, and scalable processes.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 使用基础模型自动搜索奖励函数，通过文本指令生成Gran Turismo 7赛车游戏的强化学习智能体，结合LLM奖励生成、VLM偏好评估和人类反馈，产生与冠军级GT Sophy竞争的赛车智能体和新颖行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在强化学习中，设计者通过定义奖励函数来传达期望的智能体行为，但在复杂环境（如自动驾驶赛车）中将期望行为映射到奖励函数很困难。

Method: 结合LLM生成奖励函数、VLM基于偏好的评估和人类反馈，搜索奖励函数空间来生成符合文本指令的强化学习智能体。

Result: 系统能够生成与冠军级GT Sophy赛车智能体竞争的智能体，并产生新颖的行为。

Conclusion: 该方法为实际应用中自动化奖励设计铺平了道路。

Abstract: When designing reinforcement learning (RL) agents, a designer communicates
the desired agent behavior through the definition of reward functions -
numerical feedback given to the agent as reward or punishment for its actions.
However, mapping desired behaviors to reward functions can be a difficult
process, especially in complex environments such as autonomous racing. In this
paper, we demonstrate how current foundation models can effectively search over
a space of reward functions to produce desirable RL agents for the Gran Turismo
7 racing game, given only text-based instructions. Through a combination of
LLM-based reward generation, VLM preference-based evaluation, and human
feedback we demonstrate how our system can be used to produce racing agents
competitive with GT Sophy, a champion-level RL racing agent, as well as
generate novel behaviors, paving the way for practical automated reward design
in real world applications.

### [93] [Deep Value Benchmark: Measuring Whether Models Generalize Deep values or Shallow Preferences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02109)
*Joshua Ashkinaze,Hua Shen,Sai Avula,Eric Gilbert,Ceren Budak*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Deep Value Benchmark (DVB) 是一个评估框架，用于测试大语言模型是否学习基本人类价值观而非表面偏好。研究发现模型主要基于浅层特征而非深层价值观进行泛化，平均深度价值泛化率仅为0.30。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 区分AI系统是学习基本人类价值观还是仅捕捉表面偏好模式，这对AI对齐至关重要。学习深层价值观的系统能更稳健地泛化人类意图，而仅学习表面模式的风险产生不对齐行为。

Method: 使用新颖的实验设计，在训练阶段让LLM接触深度和浅层特征故意相关的人类偏好数据，测试阶段打破这些相关性，通过选择任务测量模型的深度价值泛化率(DVGR)。

Result: 在9个不同模型中，平均DVGR仅为0.30，所有模型基于深层价值观的泛化都低于随机水平。较大模型的DVGR略低于较小模型。

Conclusion: 当前大语言模型主要基于浅层特征而非深层价值观进行泛化，这表明AI对齐面临重要挑战。DVB提供了一个可解释的衡量核心对齐特征的方法。

Abstract: We introduce the Deep Value Benchmark (DVB), an evaluation framework that
directly tests whether large language models (LLMs) learn fundamental human
values or merely surface-level preferences. This distinction is critical for AI
alignment: Systems that capture deeper values are likely to generalize human
intentions robustly, while those that capture only superficial patterns in
preference data risk producing misaligned behavior. The DVB uses a novel
experimental design with controlled confounding between deep values (e.g.,
moral principles) and shallow features (e.g., superficial attributes). In the
training phase, we expose LLMs to human preference data with deliberately
correlated deep and shallow features -- for instance, where a user consistently
prefers (non-maleficence, formal language) options over (justice, informal
language) alternatives. The testing phase then breaks these correlations,
presenting choices between (justice, formal language) and (non-maleficence,
informal language) options. This design allows us to precisely measure a
model's Deep Value Generalization Rate (DVGR) -- the probability of
generalizing based on the underlying value rather than the shallow feature.
Across 9 different models, the average DVGR is just 0.30. All models generalize
deep values less than chance. Larger models have a (slightly) lower DVGR than
smaller models. We are releasing our dataset, which was subject to three
separate human validation experiments. DVB provides an interpretable measure of
a core feature of alignment.

*Ziheng Geng,Jiachen Liu,Ran Cao,Lu Cheng,Dan M. Frangopol,Minghui Cheng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究提出了InsurAgent，一个基于大语言模型的智能体，用于模拟洪水保险购买决策行为，解决了LLMs在量化概率估计方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 美国高风险人群的洪水保险参与率很低，需要理解保险决策的行为机制，而大语言模型为模拟人类决策提供了有前景的工具。

Method: 构建基准数据集评估LLMs能力，提出InsurAgent智能体，包含感知、检索、推理、行动和记忆五个模块，其中检索模块使用RAG技术基于调查数据，推理模块利用LLM常识进行推断。

Result: LLMs对因素有定性理解但量化概率估计不足；InsurAgent能够准确估计边际和双变量概率，捕捉传统模型难以处理的上下文信息，支持时间决策演化模拟。

Conclusion: InsurAgent为行为建模和政策分析提供了有价值的工具，能够模拟复杂的保险决策过程。

Abstract: Flood insurance is an effective strategy for individuals to mitigate
disaster-related losses. However, participation rates among at-risk populations
in the United States remain strikingly low. This gap underscores the need to
understand and model the behavioral mechanisms underlying insurance decisions.
Large language models (LLMs) have recently exhibited human-like intelligence
across wide-ranging tasks, offering promising tools for simulating human
decision-making. This study constructs a benchmark dataset to capture insurance
purchase probabilities across factors. Using this dataset, the capacity of LLMs
is evaluated: while LLMs exhibit a qualitative understanding of factors, they
fall short in estimating quantitative probabilities. To address this
limitation, InsurAgent, an LLM-empowered agent comprising five modules
including perception, retrieval, reasoning, action, and memory, is proposed.
The retrieval module leverages retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to ground
decisions in empirical survey data, achieving accurate estimation of marginal
and bivariate probabilities. The reasoning module leverages LLM common sense to
extrapolate beyond survey data, capturing contextual information that is
intractable for traditional models. The memory module supports the simulation
of temporal decision evolutions, illustrated through a roller coaster life
trajectory. Overall, InsurAgent provides a valuable tool for behavioral
modeling and policy analysis.

TL;DR: Re-FORC是一种自适应奖励预测方法，能够根据未来思考token数量预测预期奖励，实现推理链的早期停止、模型优化选择和自适应测试扩展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决推理过程中计算资源浪费和效率低下的问题，需要一种能够预测推理质量并动态调整推理长度的方法。

Method: 在推理模型上训练轻量级适配器，根据上下文预测不同思考token数量下的预期未来奖励。

Result: 减少26%计算量同时保持准确性；在相同计算量下提升4%准确率；在高计算场景下提升11%准确率，在低计算场景下提升7%准确率。

Conclusion: Re-FORC能够有效控制推理成本，实现动态推理长度控制，并提前估算计算时间。

Abstract: We propose Re-FORC, an adaptive reward prediction method that, given a
context, enables prediction of the expected future rewards as a function of the
number of future thinking tokens. Re-FORC trains a lightweight adapter on
reasoning models, demonstrating improved prediction with longer reasoning and
larger models. Re-FORC enables: 1) early stopping of unpromising reasoning
chains, reducing compute by 26% while maintaining accuracy, 2) optimized model
and thinking length selection that achieves 4% higher accuracy at equal compute
and 55% less compute at equal accuracy compared to the largest model, 3)
adaptive test-time scaling, which increases accuracy by 11% in high compute
regime, and 7% in low compute regime. Re-FORC allows dynamic reasoning with
length control via cost-per-token thresholds while estimating computation time
upfront.

TL;DR: 提出了ATHENA框架，通过结合符号效用发现和语义适应来建模个性化决策，在旅行模式和疫苗选择任务中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 个体决策模型与群体最优预测存在差距，因为个体决策受数值属性和语言因素共同影响，需要同时考虑效用理论和语言推理能力。

Method: ATHENA框架包含两个阶段：1）通过LLM增强的符号发现找到群体级符号效用函数；2）基于最优效用进行个体级语义适应，创建个性化语义模板。

Result: 在真实世界旅行模式和疫苗选择任务中，ATHENA持续优于基于效用、机器学习和LLM的模型，F1分数比最强基线至少提升6.5%。

Conclusion: 通过有机整合符号效用建模和语义适应，ATHENA为建模以人为本的决策提供了新方案，两个阶段都至关重要且互补。

Abstract: Decision-making models for individuals, particularly in high-stakes scenarios
like vaccine uptake, often diverge from population optimal predictions. This
gap arises from the uniqueness of the individual decision-making process,
shaped by numerical attributes (e.g., cost, time) and linguistic influences
(e.g., personal preferences and constraints). Developing upon Utility Theory
and leveraging the textual-reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models
(LLMs), this paper proposes an Adaptive Textual-symbolic Human-centric
Reasoning framework (ATHENA) to address the optimal information integration.
ATHENA uniquely integrates two stages: First, it discovers robust, group-level
symbolic utility functions via LLM-augmented symbolic discovery; Second, it
implements individual-level semantic adaptation, creating personalized semantic
templates guided by the optimal utility to model personalized choices.
Validated on real-world travel mode and vaccine choice tasks, ATHENA
consistently outperforms utility-based, machine learning, and other LLM-based
models, lifting F1 score by at least 6.5% over the strongest cutting-edge
models. Further, ablation studies confirm that both stages of ATHENA are
critical and complementary, as removing either clearly degrades overall
predictive performance. By organically integrating symbolic utility modeling
and semantic adaptation, ATHENA provides a new scheme for modeling
human-centric decisions. The project page can be found at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体系统虽然能够整合专业知识解决复杂任务，但其潜力受到僵化的代理调度和低效协调策略的限制，无法适应不断变化的任务需求。

Method: 提出STRMAC框架，分别编码交互历史和代理知识来驱动路由器，自适应选择最合适的单个代理；引入自演进数据生成方法加速高质量执行路径的收集。

Result: 在挑战性协作推理基准上实现SOTA性能，比基线提升23.8%，与穷举搜索相比减少90.1%的数据收集开销。

Conclusion: STRMAC通过状态感知路由和自演进数据生成，显著提升了多智能体系统的协作效率和性能。

Abstract: The emergence of multi-agent systems powered by large language models (LLMs)
has unlocked new frontiers in complex task-solving, enabling diverse agents to
integrate unique expertise, collaborate flexibly, and address challenges
unattainable for individual models. However, the full potential of such systems
is hindered by rigid agent scheduling and inefficient coordination strategies
that fail to adapt to evolving task requirements. In this paper, we propose
STRMAC, a state-aware routing framework designed for efficient collaboration in
multi-agent systems. Our method separately encodes interaction history and
agent knowledge to power the router, which adaptively selects the most suitable
single agent at each step for efficient and effective collaboration.
Furthermore, we introduce a self-evolving data generation approach that
accelerates the collection of high-quality execution paths for efficient system
training. Experiments on challenging collaborative reasoning benchmarks
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, achieving up
to 23.8% improvement over baselines and reducing data collection overhead by up
to 90.1% compared to exhaustive search.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工作主要关注任务成功率，但现实世界中的有效智能体需要同时优化生产力（任务完成）、主动性（提出关键问题）和个性化（适应用户偏好）三个维度。

Method: 引入UserVille交互环境，使用基于LLM的用户模拟器支持多样化、可配置的用户偏好。提出PPP多目标强化学习方法，联合优化三个维度。

Result: 在软件工程和深度研究任务上的实验表明，PPP训练的智能体相比GPT-5等强基线平均提升21.6%，能够提出战略性澄清问题、适应未见过的用户偏好，并通过更好的交互提高任务成功率。

Conclusion: 明确优化以用户为中心的交互对于构建实用有效的AI智能体至关重要。

Abstract: While existing work focuses primarily on task success, we argue that
effective real-world agents require optimizing three dimensions: productivity
(task completion), proactivity (asking essential questions), and
personalization (adapting to diverse user preferences). We introduce UserVille,
an interactive environment with LLM-based user simulators enabling diverse,
configurable user preferences. Leveraging UserVille, we introduce PPP, a
multi-objective reinforcement learning approach that jointly optimizes all
three dimensions: Productivity, Proactivity, and Personalization. Experiments
on software engineering and deep research tasks show that agents trained with
PPP achieve substantial improvements over strong baselines such as GPT-5 (+21.6
on average), demonstrating the ability to ask strategic clarifying questions,
adapt to unseen user preferences, and improve task success through better
interaction. This work demonstrates that explicitly optimizing for
user-centered interaction is critical for building practical and effective AI
agents.

Abstract: Complex reasoning over tabular data is crucial in real-world data analysis,
yet large language models (LLMs) often underperform due to complex queries,
noisy data, and limited numerical capabilities. To address these issues, we
propose \method, a framework consisting of: (1) a query decomposer that breaks
down complex questions, (2) a table sanitizer that cleans and filters noisy
tables, and (3) a program-of-thoughts (PoT)-based reasoner that generates
executable code to derive the final answer from the sanitized table. To ensure
unbiased evaluation and mitigate data leakage, we introduce a new dataset,
CalTab151, specifically designed for complex numerical reasoning over tables.
Experimental results demonstrate that \method consistently outperforms existing
methods, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with 8.79%, 6.08%, and
19.87% accuracy improvement on TAT-QA, TableBench, and \method, respectively.
Moreover, our framework integrates seamlessly with mainstream LLMs, providing a

Abstract: Novel research ideas play a critical role in advancing scientific inquiries.
Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated their
potential to generate novel research ideas by leveraging large-scale scientific
literature. However, previous work in research ideation has primarily relied on
simplistic methods, such as keyword co-occurrence or semantic similarity. These
approaches focus on identifying statistical associations in the literature but
overlook the complex, contextual relationships between scientific concepts,
which are essential to effectively leverage knowledge embedded in human
literature. For instance, papers that simultaneously mention "keyword A" and
"keyword B" often present research ideas that integrate both concepts.
Additionally, some LLM-driven methods propose and refine research ideas using
the model's internal knowledge, but they fail to effectively utilize the
scientific concept network, limiting the grounding of ideas in established
research. To address these challenges, we propose the Deep Ideation framework
to address these challenges, integrating a scientific network that captures
keyword co-occurrence and contextual relationships, enriching LLM-driven
ideation. The framework introduces an explore-expand-evolve workflow to
iteratively refine research ideas, using an Idea Stack to track progress. A
critic engine, trained on real-world reviewer feedback, guides the process by
providing continuous feedback on the novelty and feasibility of ideas. Our
experiments show that our approach improves the quality of generated ideas by
10.67% compared to other methods, with ideas surpassing top conference
acceptance levels. Human evaluation highlights their practical value in
scientific research, and ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each
component in the workflow. Code repo is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究仅用粗粒度的数据集级统计来衡量MLLMs在模态冲突时的行为，忽略了模型在单模态推理中的置信度影响，需要更精细的分析框架。

Method: 构建可控数据集系统变化视觉和文本输入的推理难度，使用熵作为细粒度不确定性度量，通过层间预测分析揭示内部机制。

Result: 发现模态跟随概率随相对不确定性单调下降的普遍规律，在平衡点处模型对两种模态的跟随概率相当，揭示了模型在模糊区域跨层振荡的内部机制。

Conclusion: 相对不确定性和固有模态偏好是控制模态跟随的两个基本原则，提供了量化框架和机制性洞察，有助于理解MLLMs如何解决冲突信息。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) must resolve conflicts when
different modalities provide contradictory information, a process we term
modality following. Prior work measured this behavior only with coarse
dataset-level statistics, overlooking the influence of model's confidence in
unimodal reasoning. In this paper, we introduce a new framework that decomposes
modality following into two fundamental factors: relative reasoning uncertainty
(the case-specific confidence gap between unimodal predictions) and inherent
modality preference( a model's stable bias when uncertainties are balanced). To
validate this framework, we construct a controllable dataset that
systematically varies the reasoning difficulty of visual and textual inputs.
Using entropy as a fine-grained uncertainty metric, we uncover a universal law:
the probability of following a modality decreases monotonically as its relative
uncertainty increases. At the relative difficulty level where the model tends
to follow both modalities with comparable probability what we call the balance
point, a practical indicator of the model's inherent preference. Unlike
traditional macro-level ratios, this measure offers a more principled and less
confounded way to characterize modality bias, disentangling it from unimodal
capabilities and dataset artifacts. Further, by probing layer-wise predictions,
we reveal the internal mechanism of oscillation: in ambiguous regions near the
balance point, models vacillate between modalities across layers, explaining
externally observed indecision. Together, these findings establish relative
uncertainty and inherent preference as the two governing principles of modality
following, offering both a quantitative framework and mechanistic insight into
how MLLMs resolve conflicting information.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) trained with reinforcement learning and
verifiable rewards have achieved strong results on complex reasoning tasks.
Recent work extends this paradigm to a multi-agent setting, where a
meta-thinking agent proposes plans and monitors progress while a reasoning
agent executes subtasks through sequential conversational turns. Despite
promising performance, we identify a critical limitation: lazy agent behavior,
in which one agent dominates while the other contributes little, undermining
collaboration and collapsing the setup to an ineffective single agent. In this
paper, we first provide a theoretical analysis showing why lazy behavior
naturally arises in multi-agent reasoning. We then introduce a stable and
efficient method for measuring causal influence, helping mitigate this issue.
Finally, as collaboration intensifies, the reasoning agent risks getting lost
in multi-turn interactions and trapped by previous noisy responses. To counter
this, we propose a verifiable reward mechanism that encourages deliberation by
allowing the reasoning agent to discard noisy outputs, consolidate
instructions, and restart its reasoning process when necessary. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our framework alleviates lazy agent behavior and
unlocks the full potential of multi-agent framework for complex reasoning
tasks.

Abstract: Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) affects nearly 10\% of the global population and
often progresses to end-stage renal failure. Accurate prognosis prediction is
vital for timely interventions and resource optimization. We present a
transformer-based framework for predicting CKD progression using multi-modal
electronic health records (EHR) from the Seoul National University Hospital
OMOP Common Data Model. Our approach (\textbf{ProQ-BERT}) integrates
demographic, clinical, and laboratory data, employing quantization-based
tokenization for continuous lab values and attention mechanisms for
interpretability. The model was pretrained with masked language modeling and
fine-tuned for binary classification tasks predicting progression from stage 3a
to stage 5 across varying follow-up and assessment periods. Evaluated on a
cohort of 91,816 patients, our model consistently outperformed CEHR-BERT,
achieving ROC-AUC up to 0.995 and PR-AUC up to 0.989 for short-term prediction.
These results highlight the effectiveness of transformer architectures and
temporal design choices in clinical prognosis modeling, offering a promising
direction for personalized CKD care.

worldwide, with early diagnosis being critical for effective treatment and
improved survival rates. However, timely detection continues to be a challenge
due to the complex nature of the disease and variability in patient risk
factors. This study presents a fuzzy soft set theory-based expert system
designed to assess the risk of breast cancer in patients using measurable
clinical and physiological parameters. The proposed system integrates Body Mass
Index, Insulin Level, Leptin Level, Adiponectin Level, and age as input
variables to estimate breast cancer risk through a set of fuzzy inference rules
and soft set computations. These parameters can be obtained from routine blood
analyses, enabling a non-invasive and accessible method for preliminary
assessment. The dataset used for model development and validation was obtained
from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The proposed expert system aims to
support healthcare professionals in identifying high-risk patients and
determining the necessity of further diagnostic procedures such as biopsies.

TL;DR: 提出基于二元分类的新框架来估计生成模型的完整PR曲线，扩展了现有仅关注曲线极值的方法，并进行了统计分析和实验验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成模型在图像和文本领域取得成功后，其评估方法受到广泛关注。现有方法多依赖标量指标，而PR曲线提供了更丰富的分析维度，但估计面临挑战。

Method: 基于二元分类视角构建新框架来估计完整PR曲线，进行统计分析并获得PR估计风险的极小极大上界。

Result: 框架扩展了文献中多个里程碑式的PR指标，这些指标原本仅限于曲线的极值点。实验研究了不同设置下曲线的行为差异。

Conclusion: 提出的框架能够有效估计生成模型的完整PR曲线，为生成模型评估提供了更全面的分析工具。

Abstract: With the recent success of generative models in image and text, the question
of their evaluation has recently gained a lot of attention. While most methods
from the state of the art rely on scalar metrics, the introduction of Precision
and Recall (PR) for generative model has opened up a new avenue of research.
The associated PR curve allows for a richer analysis, but their estimation
poses several challenges. In this paper, we present a new framework for
estimating entire PR curves based on a binary classification standpoint. We
conduct a thorough statistical analysis of the proposed estimates. As a
byproduct, we obtain a minimax upper bound on the PR estimation risk. We also
show that our framework extends several landmark PR metrics of the literature
which by design are restrained to the extreme values of the curve. Finally, we
study the different behaviors of the curves obtained experimentally in various
settings.

*Jae-Woo Choi,Hyungmin Kim,Hyobin Ong,Minsu Jang,Dohyung Kim,Jaehong Kim,Youngwoo Yoon*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ReAcTree是一种分层任务规划方法，通过构建动态代理树将复杂目标分解为更易管理的子目标，结合推理、行动和控制流节点，显著提升了长时程任务的执行效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理复杂长时程任务时，依赖单一轨迹来整合所有历史决策和观察，导致性能受限。需要一种能够有效分解复杂目标的方法。

Method: 提出分层任务规划方法ReAcTree，构建动态代理树分解复杂目标，每个代理节点负责推理、行动和扩展树，控制流节点协调执行策略，并集成情景记忆和工作记忆系统。

Result: 在WAH-NL和ALFRED数据集上的实验表明，ReAcTree在多种LLM上均优于ReAct等基线方法。在WAH-NL上，使用Qwen 2.5 72B时目标成功率达到61%，几乎是ReAct（31%）的两倍。

Conclusion: ReAcTree通过分层分解和记忆系统集成，有效解决了复杂长时程任务的规划问题，显著提升了任务执行成功率。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have enabled significant
progress in decision-making and task planning for embodied autonomous agents.
However, most existing methods still struggle with complex, long-horizon tasks
because they rely on a monolithic trajectory that entangles all past decisions
and observations, attempting to solve the entire task in a single unified
process. To address this limitation, we propose ReAcTree, a hierarchical
task-planning method that decomposes a complex goal into more manageable
subgoals within a dynamically constructed agent tree. Each subgoal is handled
by an LLM agent node capable of reasoning, acting, and further expanding the
tree, while control flow nodes coordinate the execution strategies of agent
nodes. In addition, we integrate two complementary memory systems: each agent
node retrieves goal-specific, subgoal-level examples from episodic memory and
shares environment-specific observations through working memory. Experiments on
the WAH-NL and ALFRED datasets demonstrate that ReAcTree consistently
outperforms strong task-planning baselines such as ReAct across diverse LLMs.
Notably, on WAH-NL, ReAcTree achieves a 61% goal success rate with Qwen 2.5
72B, nearly doubling ReAct's 31%.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出VMR方法，将开放式任务重构为可验证的多选格式，使RLVR范式能够应用于缺乏标准答案的开放领域任务，显著提升LLM性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR方法依赖标准答案验证，无法应用于缺乏真实解的开放式任务（如创意写作、指令遵循），但这些任务中推理能力的潜在价值被忽视。

Method: 提出可验证多选重构(VMR)训练策略，将开放式数据重构为可验证的多选格式，使得RLVR范式能够在没有明确真实解的情况下有效训练。

Result: 在多个基准测试中验证了方法的有效性，在八个开放式基准上平均比基线提升5.99分。

Conclusion: VMR方法成功将RLVR范式扩展到开放领域，证明了强化推理能力能够提升开放式任务性能，为LLM在更广泛场景中的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has demonstrated great
potential in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs), achieving remarkable progress in domains such as mathematics and
programming where standard answers are available. However, for open-ended tasks
lacking ground-truth solutions (e.g., creative writing and instruction
following), existing studies typically regard them as non-reasoning scenarios,
thereby overlooking the latent value of reasoning capabilities. This raises a
key question: Can strengthening reasoning improve performance in open-ended
tasks? To address this, we explore the transfer of the RLVR paradigm to the
open domain. Yet, since RLVR fundamentally relies on verifiers that presuppose
the existence of standard answers, it cannot be directly applied to open-ended
tasks. To overcome this challenge, we introduce Verifiable Multiple-Choice
Reformulation (VMR), a novel training strategy that restructures open-ended
data into verifiable multiple-choice formats, enabling effective training even
in the absence of explicit ground truth. Experimental results on multiple
benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our method in improving LLM
performance on open-ended tasks. Notably, across eight open-ended benchmarks,
our VMR-based training delivers an average gain of 5.99 points over the
baseline. Code will be released upon acceptance to facilitate reproducibility.

TL;DR: 本文提出了Agentic AI在5G/6G网络中的应用框架，通过大型AI模型实现自主决策和RAN优化，解决了复杂网络环境下手动优化的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 5G和未来6G网络的复杂性使得手动优化变得低效，需要一种能够自主决策的AI系统来应对动态RAN环境。尽管Agentic AI发展迅速，但缺乏标准化的框架和定义。

Method: 提出Agentic AI核心设计模式：反思、规划、工具使用和多智能体协作，并在5G RAN案例中展示时间序列分析和LAM驱动智能体的协作决策。

Result: 建立了Agentic AI在移动网络中的理论基础，并通过实际案例验证了基于KPI的自主决策机制的有效性。

Conclusion: Agentic AI为5G/6G网络优化提供了可行的自动化解决方案，其核心设计模式能够有效协调智能行为，实现动态环境下的自主决策。

Abstract: Agentic AI represents a new paradigm for automating complex systems by using
Large AI Models (LAMs) to provide human-level cognitive abilities with
multimodal perception, planning, memory, and reasoning capabilities. This will
lead to a new generation of AI systems that autonomously decompose goals,
retain context over time, learn continuously, operate across tools and
environments, and adapt dynamically. The complexity of 5G and upcoming 6G
networks renders manual optimization ineffective, pointing to Agentic AI as a
method for automating decisions in dynamic RAN environments. However, despite
its rapid advances, there is no established framework outlining the
foundational components and operational principles of Agentic AI systems nor a
universally accepted definition.
  This paper contributes to ongoing research on Agentic AI in 5G and 6G
networks by outlining its core concepts and then proposing a practical use case
that applies Agentic principles to RAN optimization. We first introduce Agentic
AI, tracing its evolution from classical agents and discussing the progress
from workflows and simple AI agents to Agentic AI. Core design
patterns-reflection, planning, tool use, and multi-agent collaboration-are then
described to illustrate how intelligent behaviors are orchestrated. These
theorical concepts are grounded in the context of mobile networks, with a focus
on RAN management and optimization. A practical 5G RAN case study shows how
time-series analytics and LAM-driven agents collaborate for KPI-based
autonomous decision-making.

TL;DR: 提出了KLPEG框架，通过构建知识图谱来系统建模游戏元素、任务依赖和因果关系，利用LLM解析更新日志并基于知识图谱进行多跳推理，为增量游戏更新生成针对性测试用例，显著提升测试效率和效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代视频游戏的快速迭代和频繁更新对测试效率和针对性提出了重大挑战。现有的基于大语言模型的自动化游戏测试方法缺乏结构化知识积累机制，难以针对增量游戏更新进行精确高效的测试。

Method: 提出KLPEG框架：1) 构建和维护知识图谱来系统建模游戏元素、任务依赖和因果关系；2) 利用LLM解析自然语言更新日志；3) 通过知识图谱上的多跳推理识别影响范围；4) 生成针对更新的测试用例。

Result: 在Overcooked和Minecraft两个代表性游戏环境中的实验表明，KLPEG能够更准确地定位受更新影响的功能，用更少的步骤完成测试，显著提高了游戏测试的效果和效率。

Conclusion: KLPEG框架通过知识图谱的知识积累和重用机制，结合LLM的更新解析能力，为增量游戏更新提供了精确高效的自动化测试解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid iteration and frequent updates of modern video games pose
significant challenges to the efficiency and specificity of testing. Although
automated playtesting methods based on Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown
promise, they often lack structured knowledge accumulation mechanisms, making
it difficult to conduct precise and efficient testing tailored for incremental
game updates. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a KLPEG framework.
The framework constructs and maintains a Knowledge Graph (KG) to systematically
model game elements, task dependencies, and causal relationships, enabling
knowledge accumulation and reuse across versions. Building on this foundation,
the framework utilizes LLMs to parse natural language update logs, identify the
scope of impact through multi-hop reasoning on the KG, enabling the generation
of update-tailored test cases. Experiments in two representative game
environments, Overcooked and Minecraft, demonstrate that KLPEG can more
accurately locate functionalities affected by updates and complete tests in
fewer steps, significantly improving both playtesting effectiveness and
efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数学数据集无法充分评估大语言模型在真实世界多领域定量推理中的表现，特别是逐步推理、数值精度和领域泛化能力。

Method: 使用Omni计算引擎验证的500个自然语言任务，涵盖金融、物理、健康、统计等多个领域，评估5个最先进大语言模型的性能。

Result: 所有模型准确率在45-63%之间，35%错误来自舍入，33%来自计算错误。模型在数学和工程领域表现较好，但在物理和自然科学领域较弱。

Conclusion: 大语言模型在真实世界定量推理任务中仍有显著局限性，不同模型存在部分互补性而非完全冗余，需要改进数值计算精度和领域泛化能力。

Abstract: We present ORCA (Omni Research on Calculation in AI) Benchmark -- a novel
benchmark that evaluates large language models (LLMs) on multi-domain,
real-life quantitative reasoning using verified outputs from Omni's calculator
engine. In 500 natural-language tasks across domains such as finance, physics,
health, and statistics, the five state-of-the-art systems (ChatGPT-5,
Gemini~2.5~Flash, Claude~Sonnet~4.5, Grok~4, and DeepSeek~V3.2) achieved only
$45\text{--}63\,\%$ accuracy, with errors mainly related to rounding ($35\,\%$)
and calculation mistakes ($33\,\%$). Results in specific domains indicate
strengths in mathematics and engineering, but weaknesses in physics and natural
sciences. Correlation analysis ($r \approx 0.40\text{--}0.65$) shows that the
models often fail together but differ in the types of errors they make,
highlighting their partial complementarity rather than redundancy. Unlike
standard math datasets, ORCA evaluates step-by-step reasoning, numerical
precision, and domain generalization across real problems from finance,
physics, health, and statistics.

TL;DR: 提出了首个基于GR(1)规范的自适应屏蔽框架，通过运行时检测环境假设违规并使用归纳逻辑编程在线修复规范，确保屏蔽器优雅演化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统静态屏蔽方法假设固定逻辑规范和手工抽象，在环境假设被违反时无法适应，导致安全性失效。

Method: 基于GR(1)规范，运行时检测环境假设违规，使用归纳逻辑编程在线自动修复GR(1)规范，确保屏蔽器自适应演化。

Result: 在Minepump和Atari Seaquest案例中，自适应屏蔽的RL智能体相比静态屏蔽保持接近最优奖励和完美逻辑合规性。

Conclusion: 自适应屏蔽框架能够有效应对环境假设变化，在保证安全性的同时维持性能，优于静态屏蔽方法。

Abstract: Shielding is widely used to enforce safety in reinforcement learning (RL),
ensuring that an agent's actions remain compliant with formal specifications.
Classical shielding approaches, however, are often static, in the sense that
they assume fixed logical specifications and hand-crafted abstractions. While
these static shields provide safety under nominal assumptions, they fail to
adapt when environment assumptions are violated. In this paper, we develop the
first adaptive shielding framework - to the best of our knowledge - based on
Generalized Reactivity of rank 1 (GR(1)) specifications, a tractable and
expressive fragment of Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) that captures both safety
and liveness properties. Our method detects environment assumption violations
at runtime and employs Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) to automatically
repair GR(1) specifications online, in a systematic and interpretable way. This
ensures that the shield evolves gracefully, ensuring liveness is achievable and
weakening goals only when necessary. We consider two case studies: Minepump and
Atari Seaquest; showing that (i) static symbolic controllers are often severely
suboptimal when optimizing for auxiliary rewards, and (ii) RL agents equipped
with our adaptive shield maintain near-optimal reward and perfect logical
compliance compared with static shields.

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于多智能体心理模拟系统，通过模拟内部认知-情感过程来生成可信的人类行为，用于人类中心领域的培训和教育。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类中心领域的培训需要真实的实践，但现有的人类行为模拟缺乏真实性和透明度。

Method: 基于心理学理论（自我效能、思维模式、社会建构主义等）构建多智能体系统，模拟'内部议会'中的心理因素智能体进行协商互动。

Result: 系统能够生成符合人类心理学的可信行为，并在教师培训和研究中得到应用验证。

Conclusion: 该系统实现了前所未有的透明度，体现了社会学习、认知学徒制、刻意练习和元认知等原则。

Abstract: Training and education in human-centered fields require authentic practice,
yet realistic simulations of human behavior have remained limited. We present a
multi-agent psychological simulation system that models internal
cognitive-affective processes to generate believable human behaviors. In
contrast to black-box neural models, this system is grounded in established
psychological theories (e.g., self-efficacy, mindset, social constructivism)
and explicitly simulates an ``inner parliament'' of agents corresponding to key
psychological factors. These agents deliberate and interact to determine the
system's output behavior, enabling unprecedented transparency and alignment
with human psychology. We describe the system's architecture and theoretical
foundations, illustrate its use in teacher training and research, and discuss
how it embodies principles of social learning, cognitive apprenticeship,
deliberate practice, and meta-cognition.

TL;DR: DecompSR是一个用于分析组合空间推理能力的大规模基准数据集和生成框架，包含500多万个数据点，可以独立控制组合性的多个方面。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了深入分析大型语言模型在组合空间推理方面的能力，特别是针对生产性、系统性等关键组合性维度的表现。

Method: 通过程序化生成方法构建数据集，确保构造正确性，并使用符号求解器独立验证数据集的正确性。数据集可以独立变化组合性的多个方面。

Result: 基准测试显示，LLMs在空间推理任务中难以进行生产性和系统性泛化，但对语言变异性表现更稳健。

Conclusion: DecompSR提供了一个可证明正确且严谨的基准数据集，能够独立控制组合性的关键维度，为LLMs的组合推理能力提供了精细化的评估工具。

Abstract: We introduce DecompSR, decomposed spatial reasoning, a large benchmark
dataset (over 5m datapoints) and generation framework designed to analyse
compositional spatial reasoning ability. The generation of DecompSR allows
users to independently vary several aspects of compositionality, namely:
productivity (reasoning depth), substitutivity (entity and linguistic
variability), overgeneralisation (input order, distractors) and systematicity
(novel linguistic elements). DecompSR is built procedurally in a manner which
makes it is correct by construction, which is independently verified using a
symbolic solver to guarantee the correctness of the dataset. DecompSR is
comprehensively benchmarked across a host of Large Language Models (LLMs) where
we show that LLMs struggle with productive and systematic generalisation in
spatial reasoning tasks whereas they are more robust to linguistic variation.
DecompSR provides a provably correct and rigorous benchmarking dataset with a
novel ability to independently vary the degrees of several key aspects of
compositionality, allowing for robust and fine-grained probing of the
compositional reasoning abilities of LLMs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一个协作迷宫求解基准，评估了32个领先AI模型在协作任务中的表现，发现存在"协作差距"：单独表现良好的模型在协作时性能大幅下降，并提出"接力推理"方法改善协作效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI发展，我们将越来越多依赖由不同信息、权限和工具的独立开发智能体组成的系统，这些系统的成功关键在于异构智能体在部分可观测环境下的有效协作，但目前缺乏大规模评估此类协作的实证研究。

Method: 提出了一个协作迷宫求解基准框架，该框架能够：(i)隔离协作能力，(ii)调节问题复杂度，(iii)实现可扩展的自动评分，(iv)不限制输出格式以保持生态合理性。使用该框架评估了32个领先的开源和闭源模型在单独、同质和异质配对中的表现。

Result: 发现了明显的"协作差距"：单独表现良好的模型在需要协作时性能显著下降。协作可能完全崩溃，例如单独能很好解决迷宫的小型蒸馏模型在某些配对中几乎完全失败。发现从较强智能体开始通常能改善结果，这启发了"接力推理"方法。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明需要：(1)协作感知的评估方法，(2)专门训练策略来增强协作能力，(3)能够可靠激发智能体潜在技能的交互设计。这些指导原则适用于AI-AI协作和人类-AI协作。

Abstract: The trajectory of AI development suggests that we will increasingly rely on
agent-based systems composed of independently developed agents with different
information, privileges, and tools. The success of these systems will
critically depend on effective collaboration among these heterogeneous agents,
even under partial observability. Despite intense interest, few empirical
studies have evaluated such agent-agent collaboration at scale. We propose a
collaborative maze-solving benchmark that (i) isolates collaborative
capabilities, (ii) modulates problem complexity, (iii) enables scalable
automated grading, and (iv) imposes no output-format constraints, preserving
ecological plausibility. Using this framework, we evaluate 32 leading open- and
closed-source models in solo, homogeneous, and heterogeneous pairings. Our
results reveal a "collaboration gap": models that perform well solo often
degrade substantially when required to collaborate. Collaboration can break
down dramatically; for instance, small distilled models that solve mazes well
alone may fail almost completely in certain pairings. We find that starting
with the stronger agent often improves outcomes, motivating a "relay inference"
approach where the stronger agent leads before handing off to the weaker one,
closing much of the gap. Our findings argue for (1) collaboration-aware
evaluation, (2) training strategies developed to enhance collaborative
capabilities, and (3) interaction design that reliably elicits agents' latent
skills, guidance that applies to AI-AI and human-AI collaboration.

TL;DR: CostBench是一个专注于成本优化的基准测试，用于评估LLM代理的经济推理和重新规划能力，发现现有模型在成本感知规划和动态适应方面存在显著不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM代理评估主要关注任务完成度，忽视了资源效率和适应性，特别是代理在变化环境中制定和调整成本最优计划的能力。

Method: 在旅行规划领域构建CostBench基准，包含可通过多种工具序列解决的任务，支持四种动态阻塞事件（如工具故障和成本变化）来模拟现实世界的不确定性。

Result: 评估显示现有模型在成本感知规划方面存在显著差距：在静态设置中经常无法找到成本最优解，GPT-5在最难任务上的精确匹配率低于75%，动态条件下性能进一步下降约40%。

Conclusion: CostBench通过诊断这些弱点，为开发既经济理性又鲁棒的未来代理奠定了基础。

Abstract: Current evaluations of Large Language Model (LLM) agents primarily emphasize
task completion, often overlooking resource efficiency and adaptability. This
neglects a crucial capability: agents' ability to devise and adjust
cost-optimal plans in response to changing environments. To bridge this gap, we
introduce CostBench, a scalable, cost-centric benchmark designed to evaluate
agents' economic reasoning and replanning abilities. Situated in the
travel-planning domain, CostBench comprises tasks solvable via multiple
sequences of atomic and composite tools with diverse, customizable costs. It
also supports four types of dynamic blocking events, such as tool failures and
cost changes, to simulate real-world unpredictability and necessitate agents to
adapt in real time. Evaluating leading open-sourced and proprietary models on
CostBench reveals a substantial gap in cost-aware planning: agents frequently
fail to identify cost-optimal solutions in static settings, with even GPT-5
achieving less than 75% exact match rate on the hardest tasks, and performance
further dropping by around 40% under dynamic conditions. By diagnosing these
weaknesses, CostBench lays the groundwork for developing future agents that are
both economically rational and robust.

*Paul Castro,Nick Mitchell,Nathan Ordonez,Thomas Parnell,Mudhakar Srivatsa,Antoni Viros i Martin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了span query概念，将推理服务器接口泛化，支持聊天、RAG、推理时扩展和智能体工作负载，通过可交换性约束优化KV缓存命中率，在vLLM中实现高性能执行。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前推理服务器主要针对聊天完成优化，但客户端已发展到包含各种推理时扩展和深度推理技术。现有解决方案通常只针对单一用例（如RAG）优化，缺乏通用性。

Method: 引入span query作为推理调用的表达式树，通过可交换性约束链接，自动优化KV缓存局部性。对vLLM进行少量修改（仅492行代码）以支持高性能span query执行。

Result: span query在两种不同的非聊天用例中实现了10-20倍的TTFT降低。注意力优化的span query在2b参数模型上显著优于使用8b模型的普通推理服务器精度。

Conclusion: span query为推理服务器提供了通用接口，能够有效支持多种新兴工作负载，显著提升性能并解决注意力局部性问题。

Abstract: Clients are evolving beyond chat completion, and now include a variety of
innovative inference-time scaling and deep reasoning techniques. At the same
time, inference servers remain heavily optimized for chat completion. Prior
work has shown that large improvements to KV cache hit rate are possible if
inference servers evolve towards these non-chat use cases. However, they offer
solutions that are also optimized for a single use case, RAG. In this paper, we
introduce the span query to generalize the interface to the inference server.
We demonstrate that chat, RAG, inference-time scaling, and agentic workloads
can all be expressed as span queries. We show how the critical distinction that
had been assumed by prior work lies in whether the order of the inputs matter
-- do they commute? In chat, they do not. In RAG, they often do. This paper
introduces span queries, which are expression trees of inference calls, linked
together with commutativity constraints. We describe span query syntax and
semantics. We show how they can be automatically optimized to improve KV cache
locality. We show how a small change to vLLM (affecting only 492 lines) can
enable high-performance execution of span queries. Using this stack, we
demonstrate that span queries can achieve 10-20x reductions in TTFT for two
distinct non-chat use cases. Finally, we show that span queries can also be
optimized to improve attention locality, so as to avoid the so-called
lost-in-the-middle problem. We demonstrate that an attention-optimized span
query on a 2b parameter model vastly outperforms the accuracy of a stock
inference server using an 8b model.

Abstract: The rapid growth of research output in control engineering calls for new

describes an LLM-supported method for semi-automated generation of formal
knowledge representations that combine human readability with machine
interpretability and increased expressiveness. Based on the Imperative
Representation of Knowledge (PyIRK) framework, we demonstrate how language
models can assist in transforming natural-language descriptions and
mathematical definitions (available as LaTeX source code) into a formalized
knowledge graph. As a first application we present the generation of an
``interactive semantic layer'' to enhance the source documents in order to
facilitate knowledge transfer. From our perspective this contributes to the
vision of easily accessible, collaborative, and verifiable knowledge bases for
the control engineering domain.

reasoning traces remain opaque: it is often unclear which modality drives a
prediction, how conflicts are resolved, or when one stream dominates. In this
paper, we introduce modality sabotage, a diagnostic failure mode in which a
high-confidence unimodal error overrides other evidence and misleads the fused
result. To analyze such dynamics, we propose a lightweight, model-agnostic
evaluation layer that treats each modality as an agent, producing candidate
labels and a brief self-assessment used for auditing. A simple fusion mechanism
aggregates these outputs, exposing contributors (modalities supporting correct
outcomes) and saboteurs (modalities that mislead). Applying our diagnostic
layer in a case study on multimodal emotion recognition benchmarks with
foundation models revealed systematic reliability profiles, providing insight
into whether failures may arise from dataset artifacts or model limitations.
More broadly, our framework offers a diagnostic scaffold for multimodal
reasoning, supporting principled auditing of fusion dynamics and informing
possible interventions.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Orion-MSP是一个用于表格数据上下文学习的新架构，通过多尺度处理、块稀疏注意力和感知器风格内存解决了现有方法的局限性，在保持高性能的同时实现了可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有表格上下文学习方法存在单尺度特征处理、密集注意力计算复杂度高、组件间缺乏双向通信等问题，限制了模型性能和可扩展性。

Method: 提出Orion-MSP架构，包含三个创新：多尺度处理捕获层次特征交互；块稀疏注意力结合窗口化、全局和随机模式；感知器风格内存实现组件间双向信息流。

Result: 在多样化基准测试中，Orion-MSP达到或超越了最先进方法的性能，同时能够有效扩展到高维表格数据。

Conclusion: Orion-MSP为高效的表格上下文学习设立了新标准，解决了现有架构的关键限制，实现了性能与可扩展性的平衡。

Abstract: Tabular data remain the predominant format for real-world applications. Yet,
developing effective neural models for tabular data remains challenging due to
heterogeneous feature types and complex interactions occurring at multiple
scales. Recent advances in tabular in-context learning (ICL), such as TabPFN
and TabICL, have achieved state-of-the-art performance comparable to
gradient-boosted trees (GBTs) without task-specific fine-tuning. However,
current architectures exhibit key limitations: (1) single-scale feature
processing that overlooks hierarchical dependencies, (2) dense attention with
quadratic scaling in table width, and (3) strictly sequential component
processing that prevents iterative representation refinement and
cross-component communication. To address these challenges, we introduce
Orion-MSP, a tabular ICL architecture featuring three key innovations: (1)
multi-scale processing to capture hierarchical feature interactions; (2)
block-sparse attention combining windowed, global, and random patterns for
scalable efficiency and long-range connectivity; and (3) a Perceiver-style
memory enabling safe bidirectional information flow across components. Across
diverse benchmarks, Orion-MSP matches or surpasses state-of-the-art performance
while scaling effectively to high-dimensional tables, establishing a new
standard for efficient tabular in-context learning. The model is publicly
available at https://github.com/Lexsi-Labs/Orion-MSP .

*Chloe Loughridge,Paul Colognese,Avery Griffin,Tyler Tracy,Jon Kutasov,Joe Benton*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种在复杂AI环境中优化攻击策略的方法，通过将攻击能力分解为五个技能组件并分别优化，显著提升了攻击强度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI部署变得复杂且高风险，准确评估其风险变得至关重要。AI控制框架需要强大的攻击策略，但在复杂环境中由于计算限制导致数据不足，这带来了挑战。

Method: 将攻击能力分解为五个技能组件（怀疑建模、攻击选择、计划合成、执行和隐蔽性），分别优化每个组件。开发攻击动态的概率模型，在模拟中优化超参数，然后将结果迁移到SHADE-Arena环境中。

Result: 攻击强度显著提升，安全评分从基线0.87降低到0.41，表明该方法能有效增强攻击能力。

Conclusion: 通过分解攻击能力并利用概率模型优化，可以在数据有限的情况下有效提升AI控制评估中的攻击策略强度。

Abstract: As AI deployments become more complex and high-stakes, it becomes
increasingly important to be able to estimate their risk. AI control is one
framework for doing so. However, good control evaluations require eliciting
strong attack policies. This can be challenging in complex agentic environments
where compute constraints leave us data-poor. In this work, we show how to
optimize attack policies in SHADE-Arena, a dataset of diverse realistic control
environments. We do this by decomposing attack capability into five constituent
skills -- suspicion modeling, attack selection, plan synthesis, execution and
subtlety -- and optimizing each component individually. To get around the
constraint of limited data, we develop a probabilistic model of attack
dynamics, optimize our attack hyperparameters using this simulation, and then
show that the results transfer to SHADE-Arena. This results in a substantial
improvement in attack strength, reducing safety score from a baseline of 0.87
to 0.41 using our scaffold.

TL;DR: Kosmos是一个AI科学家系统，能够自动化数据驱动的科学发现过程，通过结构化世界模型在数据分析和文献搜索代理之间共享信息，实现长达12小时、200次代理部署的连贯研究，生成可追溯的科学报告。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的AI科研代理在采取多次行动后会失去连贯性，限制了其发现深度。需要开发能够进行长时间连贯科学研究的AI系统。

Method: 使用结构化世界模型连接数据分析代理和文献搜索代理，进行并行数据分析、文献搜索和假设生成的迭代循环，每次运行执行约42,000行代码并阅读1,500篇论文。

Result: Kosmos报告中的79.4%陈述被独立科学家认定为准确，单次20循环运行相当于研究人员6个月的工作量，有价值的科学发现数量与循环次数呈线性关系。在代谢组学、材料科学、神经科学和统计遗传学领域做出了7个发现，其中3个独立重现了未发表成果，4个是新颖贡献。

Conclusion: Kosmos展示了AI科学家能够进行长时间连贯的科学研究，生成可追溯的准确发现，显著提高科研效率，为自动化科学发现提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Data-driven scientific discovery requires iterative cycles of literature
search, hypothesis generation, and data analysis. Substantial progress has been
made towards AI agents that can automate scientific research, but all such
agents remain limited in the number of actions they can take before losing
coherence, thus limiting the depth of their findings. Here we present Kosmos,
an AI scientist that automates data-driven discovery. Given an open-ended
objective and a dataset, Kosmos runs for up to 12 hours performing cycles of
parallel data analysis, literature search, and hypothesis generation before
synthesizing discoveries into scientific reports. Unlike prior systems, Kosmos
uses a structured world model to share information between a data analysis
agent and a literature search agent. The world model enables Kosmos to
coherently pursue the specified objective over 200 agent rollouts, collectively
executing an average of 42,000 lines of code and reading 1,500 papers per run.
Kosmos cites all statements in its reports with code or primary literature,
ensuring its reasoning is traceable. Independent scientists found 79.4% of
statements in Kosmos reports to be accurate, and collaborators reported that a
single 20-cycle Kosmos run performed the equivalent of 6 months of their own
research time on average. Furthermore, collaborators reported that the number
of valuable scientific findings generated scales linearly with Kosmos cycles
(tested up to 20 cycles). We highlight seven discoveries made by Kosmos that
span metabolomics, materials science, neuroscience, and statistical genetics.
Three discoveries independently reproduce findings from preprinted or
unpublished manuscripts that were not accessed by Kosmos at runtime, while four
make novel contributions to the scientific literature.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI虽然强大但缺乏语义基础，使得科学发现难以被理解。需要建立一个框架将AI的洞察转化为可理解的科学知识。

Method: 引入语义编码框架，明确神经网络与逻辑之间的映射关系，并整合现有的各种编码和知识提取方法。

Result: 建立了连接逻辑语义与神经网络的统一框架，能够表征各种现有方法的共同要素。

Conclusion: 逻辑为深度学习提供了急需的语义基础，但实际应用中识别语义编码仍面临挑战，类似于心灵哲学中的类似问题。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a powerful new language of science as
evidenced by recent Nobel Prizes in chemistry and physics that recognized
contributions to AI applied to those areas. Yet, this new language lacks
semantics, which makes AI's scientific discoveries unsatisfactory at best. With
the purpose of uncovering new facts but also improving our understanding of the
world, AI-based science requires formalization through a framework capable of
translating insight into comprehensible scientific knowledge. In this paper, we
argue that logic offers an adequate framework. In particular, we use logic in a
neurosymbolic framework to offer a much needed semantics for deep learning, the
neural network-based technology of current AI. Deep learning and neurosymbolic
AI lack a general set of conditions to ensure that desirable properties are
satisfied. Instead, there is a plethora of encoding and knowledge extraction
approaches designed for particular cases. To rectify this, we introduced a
framework for semantic encoding, making explicit the mapping between neural
networks and logic, and characterizing the common ingredients of the various
existing approaches. In this paper, we describe succinctly and exemplify how
logical semantics and neural networks are linked through this framework, we
review some of the most prominent approaches and techniques developed for
neural encoding and knowledge extraction, provide a formal definition of our
framework, and discuss some of the difficulties of identifying a semantic
encoding in practice in light of analogous problems in the philosophy of mind.

Motivation: 现有MLLM局限于固定模态对，需要大量对齐数据进行微调，构建全能力模型不切实际且缺乏鲁棒推理支持

Method: 使用主代理解释用户意图，委托子任务给模态特定代理，并整合输出为连贯响应

Result: 在文本、图像、音频、视频和全模态基准测试中持续实现最先进性能，特别是在需要复杂跨模态推理的任务上

Conclusion: 基于代理的设计能够无缝集成专业基础模型，确保对多样化输入的适应性，同时保持透明度和可解释性，框架模块化且易于扩展

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown strong capabilities but
remain limited to fixed modality pairs and require costly fine-tuning with
large aligned datasets. Building fully omni-capable models that can integrate
text, images, audio, and video remains impractical and lacks robust reasoning
support. In this paper, we propose an Agent-Omni framework that coordinates
existing foundation models through a master-agent system, enabling flexible
multimodal reasoning without retraining. The master agent interprets user
intent, delegates subtasks to modality-specific agents, and integrates their
outputs into coherent responses. Extensive experiments across text, image,
audio, video, and omni benchmarks show that Agent-Omni consistently achieves
state-of-the-art performance, particularly on tasks requiring complex
cross-modal reasoning. Its agent-based design enables seamless integration of
specialized foundation models, ensuring adaptability to diverse inputs while
maintaining transparency and interpretability. In addition, the framework is
modular and easily extensible, allowing future improvements as stronger models
become available. %We release an open-source implementation to support
continued research on scalable and reliable omni-modal reasoning.

TL;DR: 本文评估了7种最先进的事件日志增强技术，通过8个事件日志数据集比较了它们在相似性、预测信息保留、信息损失/增强和计算时间等方面的表现。结果显示，基于随机转移系统结合资源队列建模的技术能生成更高质量的合成事件日志。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 过程挖掘依赖于大型事件日志，但现实中往往缺乏足够的数据。事件日志增强技术通过生成模拟真实过程执行的额外轨迹来解决这一限制，但现有技术缺乏全面的效果比较。

Method: 在8个事件日志上评估7种最先进的增强技术，并与基于随机转移系统的基线技术进行比较。从相似性、预测信息保留、信息损失/增强和计算时间四个维度进行分析。

Result: 结果显示，基于随机转移系统结合资源队列建模的技术在各项标准中表现最佳。与传统数据增强技术相比，事件日志增强技术能显著提升效果，而传统方法无法考虑过程约束。

Conclusion: 事件日志增强技术能有效解决过程挖掘中的数据不足问题，其中基于随机转移系统结合资源队列建模的方法能生成最高质量的合成事件日志，优于传统数据增强方法。

Abstract: Process mining analyzes and improves processes by examining transactional
data stored in event logs, which record sequences of events with timestamps.
However, the effectiveness of process mining, especially when combined with
machine or deep learning, depends on having large event logs. Event log
augmentation addresses this limitation by generating additional traces that
simulate realistic process executions while considering various perspectives
like time, control-flow, workflow, resources, and domain-specific attributes.
Although prior research has explored event-log augmentation techniques, there
has been no comprehensive comparison of their effectiveness. This paper reports
on an evaluation of seven state-of-the-art augmentation techniques across eight
event logs. The results are also compared with those obtained by a baseline
technique based on a stochastic transition system. The comparison has been
carried on analyzing four different aspects: similarity, preservation of
predictive information, information loss/enhancement, and computational times
required. Results show that, considering the different criteria, a technique
based on a stochastic transition system combined with resource queue modeling
would provide higher quality synthetic event logs. Event-log augmentation
techniques are also compared with traditional data-augmentation techniques,
showing that the former provide significant benefits, whereas the latter fail
to consider process constraints.

Conclusion: 综合RDM基础设施成功解决了异构数据源和格式的挑战，为材料设计中的缺陷相图研究提供了有效的数据管理解决方案。

Abstract: Defect phase diagrams provide a unified description of crystal defect states
for materials design and are central to the scientific objectives of the
Collaborative Research Centre (CRC) 1394. Their construction requires the
systematic integration of heterogeneous experimental and simulation data across
research groups and locations. In this setting, research data management (RDM)
is a key enabler of new scientific insight by linking distributed research
activities and making complex data reproducible and reusable.
  To address the challenge of heterogeneous data sources and formats, a
comprehensive RDM infrastructure has been established that links experiment,
data, and analysis in a seamless workflow. The system combines: (1) a joint
electronic laboratory notebook and laboratory information management system,
(2) easy-to-use large-object data storage, (3) automatic metadata extraction
from heterogeneous and proprietary file formats, (4) interactive provenance
graphs for data exploration and reuse, and (5) automated reporting and analysis
workflows. The two key technological elements are the openBIS electronic
laboratory notebook and laboratory information management system, and a newly
developed companion application that extends openBIS with large-scale data
handling, automated metadata capture, and federated access to distributed
research data.
  This integrated approach reduces friction in data capture and curation,
enabling traceable and reusable datasets that accelerate the construction of
defect phase diagrams across institutions.

TL;DR: InteracSPARQL是一个交互式SPARQL查询生成和优化系统，通过自然语言解释和LLM结合规则方法，帮助非专家用户理解并迭代优化SPARQL查询。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SPARQL查询语言语法复杂，需要理解复杂数据结构，对非专家用户具有挑战性，需要更易用的查询界面。

Method: 结合LLM和基于规则的方法，从SPARQL抽象语法树生成结构化解释，然后通过LLM进行语言优化，支持用户交互式反馈或LLM驱动的自我优化。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，相比基线方法，在查询准确性、解释清晰度和用户满意度方面均有显著提升。

Conclusion: 结合基于规则方法和LLM驱动的优化，能够创建更易访问和鲁棒的SPARQL接口。

Abstract: In recent years, querying semantic web data using SPARQL has remained
challenging, especially for non-expert users, due to the language's complex
syntax and the prerequisite of understanding intricate data structures. To
address these challenges, we propose InteracSPARQL, an interactive SPARQL query
generation and refinement system that leverages natural language explanations
(NLEs) to enhance user comprehension and facilitate iterative query refinement.
InteracSPARQL integrates LLMs with a rule-based approach to first produce
structured explanations directly from SPARQL abstract syntax trees (ASTs),
followed by LLM-based linguistic refinements. Users can interactively refine
queries through direct feedback or LLM-driven self-refinement, enabling the
correction of ambiguous or incorrect query components in real time. We evaluate
InteracSPARQL on standard benchmarks, demonstrating significant improvements in
query accuracy, explanation clarity, and overall user satisfaction compared to
baseline approaches. Our experiments further highlight the effectiveness of
combining rule-based methods with LLM-driven refinements to create more
accessible and robust SPARQL interfaces.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着ML推理和知识检索服务需求的增长，特别是AI代理集成到终端应用中的需求，这些服务需要满足严格的服务级别延迟目标(SLOs)，而现有ML服务平台因使用批处理优化高吞吐量而面临不可预测的尾部延迟问题

Method: Vortex采用SLO优先的方法，构建了专门的流水线架构，支持RDMA以进一步提升性能

Result: 在相同任务下，Vortex相比TorchServe和Ray Serve在各种工作负载下实现了显著更低且更稳定的延迟，在相同SLO目标下支持两倍以上的请求率，当使用RDMA时优势更加明显

Conclusion: Vortex证明了SLO优先方法在ML推理服务中的有效性，能够为AI代理等延迟敏感应用提供可靠的低延迟服务

Abstract: There is growing interest in deploying ML inference and knowledge retrieval
as services that could support both interactive queries by end users and more
demanding request flows that arise from AIs integrated into a end-user
applications and deployed as agents. Our central premise is that these latter
cases will bring service level latency objectives (SLOs). Existing ML serving
platforms use batching to optimize for high throughput, exposing them to
unpredictable tail latencies. Vortex enables an SLO-first approach. For
identical tasks, Vortex's pipelines achieve significantly lower and more stable
latencies than TorchServe and Ray Serve over a wide range of workloads, often
enabling a given SLO target at more than twice the request rate. When RDMA is
available, the Vortex advantage is even more significant.

Motivation: 动机源于数据仓库模型中多值维度和桥接表的设计和实现挑战。

Method: 使用组合数系统为实体生成唯一编码(h,k)，基于k-组合表示方法，将组合关系信息封装到G实体的单个列中，不物理存储关系表，并引入Rank-Join操作到关系代数中。

Result: 实现了组合关系集的表示，G实体通过新增的候选键列编码关系信息，避免了传统多对多关系的物理表存储。

Conclusion: 组合关系集方法有效解决了多值维度和桥接表的实现问题，通过编码技术和新的关系操作简化了数据仓库模型设计。

Abstract: In this paper we propose an approach to implement specific relation-ship set
between two entities called combinatorial relationship set. For the
combinatorial relationship set B between entity sets G and I the mapping
cardinality is many-to-many. Additionally, entities from G can be uniquely
encoded with a pair of values (h, k) generated with the procedure for numbering
combinations of entities from I. The encoding procedure is based on
combinatorial number system that provides a representation of all possible k
-combinations of a set of n elements by a single number. In general
many-to-many relationship sets are represented by a relation or table, while
the combinatorial relationship is not physically stored as separate table.
However, all information is encapsulated into a single column added to G. The
new column is a candidate key in G. Additional operation named Rank-Join to
fundamental relational-algebra is presented to combine information from g and i
associated with a combinatorial relationship set. Motivation for combinatorial
relationship originates from challenges in designing and implementing
multivalued dimensions and bridge tables in data-warehouse models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图编辑距离(GED)是衡量图相似性的重要指标，但其精确计算是NP难问题。图相似性搜索虽然通过阈值约束降低了复杂度，但现有过滤方法的效率仍有提升空间。

Method: 提出基于整数线性规划的下界方法，证明其优于分支匹配下界；构建多层次下界算法层次结构；开发利用阈值参数的新型整数规划公式。

Result: 在标准测试集上的大量计算实验表明，该方法在大多数阈值下显著优于现有最优算法。

Conclusion: 基于整数线性规划的下界方法能有效提升图相似性搜索的过滤效率，为大规模图相似性计算提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: The Graph Edit Distance (GED) is an important metric for measuring the
similarity between two (labeled) graphs. It is defined as the minimum cost
required to convert one graph into another through a series of (elementary)
edit operations. Its effectiveness in assessing the similarity of large graphs
is limited by the complexity of its exact calculation, which is NP-hard
theoretically and computationally challenging in practice. The latter can be
mitigated by switching to the Graph Similarity Search under GED constraints,
which determines whether the edit distance between two graphs is below a given
threshold. A popular framework for solving Graph Similarity Search under GED
constraints in a graph database for a query graph is the
filter-and-verification framework. Filtering discards unpromising graphs, while
the verification step certifies the similarity between the filtered graphs and
the query graph. To improve the filtering step, we define a lower bound based
on an integer linear programming formulation. We prove that this lower bound
dominates the effective branch match-based lower bound and can also be computed
efficiently. Consequently, we propose a graph similarity search algorithm that
uses a hierarchy of lower bound algorithms and solves a novel integer
programming formulation that exploits the threshold parameter. An extensive
computational experience on a well-assessed test bed shows that our approach
significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithm on most of the
examined thresholds.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据湖虽然简化了异构数据的维护，但将数据准备和查询处理的复杂性转移到了数据发现任务上，特别是表联合搜索任务需要高效解决方案。

Method: 采用模块化三步流程：表序列化（统一格式和采样）、表表示（利用LLM生成嵌入向量）、向量搜索（使用近似最近邻索引进行语义匹配）。

Result: 在TUSBench测试中，EasyTUS在平均精度上提升达34.3%，数据准备速度提升79.2倍，查询处理性能提升7.7倍，且在元数据缺失情况下仍保持强劲性能。

Conclusion: EasyTUS提供了一个高效、可扩展且鲁棒的表联合搜索解决方案，能够适应不同数据湖环境，显著推进了该领域的发展。

Abstract: Data lakes enable easy maintenance of heterogeneous data in its native form.
While this flexibility can accelerate data ingestion, it shifts the complexity
of data preparation and query processing to data discovery tasks. One such task
is Table Union Search (TUS), which identifies tables that can be unioned with a
given input table. In this work, we present EasyTUS, a comprehensive framework
that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform efficient and scalable
Table Union Search across data lakes. EasyTUS implements the search pipeline as
three modular steps: Table Serialization for consistent formatting and
sampling, Table Representation that utilizes LLMs to generate embeddings, and
Vector Search that leverages approximate nearest neighbor indexing for semantic
matching. To enable reproducible and systematic evaluation, in this paper, we
also introduce TUSBench, a novel standardized benchmarking environment within
the EasyTUS framework. TUSBench supports unified comparisons across approaches
and data lakes, promoting transparency and progress in the field. Our
experiments using TUSBench show that EasyTUS consistently outperforms most of
the state-of the-art approaches, achieving improvements in average of up to
34.3% in Mean Average Precision (MAP), up to 79.2x speedup in data preparation,
and up to 7.7x faster query processing performance. Furthermore, EasyTUS
maintains strong performance even in metadata-absent settings, highlighting its
robustness and adaptability across data lakes.

TL;DR: ReDD框架通过动态发现查询特定模式、填充关系表并确保错误感知提取，显著降低数据提取错误率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非结构化数据普遍存在，但分析查询需要结构化表示，现有方法如RAG缺乏模式意识且跨文档对齐困难，导致高错误率

Method: 两阶段流水线：迭代模式发现(ISD)识别最小可连接模式，表格数据填充(TDP)使用基于LLM隐藏状态训练的轻量级分类器提取和校正数据，主要贡献是SCAPE统计校准错误检测方法和SCAPE-HYB混合方法

Result: 在多样化数据集上，ReDD将数据提取错误率从最高30%降至1%以下，同时保持高模式完整性(100%召回率)和精确度

Conclusion: ReDD的模块化设计实现了精度-成本权衡的细粒度控制，为高风险分析查询提供了稳健解决方案

Abstract: Unstructured data is pervasive, but analytical queries demand structured
representations, creating a significant extraction challenge. Existing methods
like RAG lack schema awareness and struggle with cross-document alignment,
leading to high error rates. We propose ReDD (Relational Deep Dive), a
framework that dynamically discovers query-specific schemas, populates
relational tables, and ensures error-aware extraction with provable guarantees.
ReDD features a two-stage pipeline: (1) Iterative Schema Discovery (ISD)
identifies minimal, joinable schemas tailored to each query, and (2) Tabular
Data Population (TDP) extracts and corrects data using lightweight classifiers
trained on LLM hidden states. A main contribution of ReDD is SCAPE, a
statistically calibrated method for error detection with coverage guarantees,
and SCAPE-HYB, a hybrid approach that optimizes the trade-off between accuracy
and human correction costs. Experiments across diverse datasets demonstrate
ReDD's effectiveness, reducing data extraction errors from up to 30% to below
1% while maintaining high schema completeness (100% recall) and precision.
ReDD's modular design enables fine-grained control over accuracy-cost
trade-offs, making it a robust solution for high-stakes analytical queries over
unstructured corpora.
