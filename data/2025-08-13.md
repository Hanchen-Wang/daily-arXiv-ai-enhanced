Abstract: Addressing plant diseases and pests is critical for enhancing crop production
and preventing economic losses. Recent advances in artificial intelligence
(AI), machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) have significantly improved
the precision and efficiency of detection methods, surpassing the limitations
of manual identification. This study reviews modern computer-based techniques
for detecting plant diseases and pests from images, including recent AI
developments. The methodologies are organized into five categories:
hyperspectral imaging, non-visualization techniques, visualization approaches,
modified deep learning architectures, and transformer models. This structured
taxonomy provides researchers with detailed, actionable insights for selecting
advanced state-of-the-art detection methods. A comprehensive survey of recent
work and comparative studies demonstrates the consistent superiority of modern
AI-based approaches, which often outperform older image analysis methods in
speed and accuracy. In particular, vision transformers such as the Hierarchical
Vision Transformer (HvT) have shown accuracy exceeding 99.3% in plant disease
detection, outperforming architectures like MobileNetV3. The study concludes by
discussing system design challenges, proposing solutions, and outlining
promising directions for future research.

### [2] [ImageDDI: Image-enhanced Molecular Motif Sequence Representation for Drug-Drug Interaction Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08338)
*Yuqin He,Tengfei Ma,Chaoyi Li,Pengsen Ma,Hongxin Xiang,Jianmin Wang,Yiping Liu,Bosheng Song,Xiangxiang Zeng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ImageDDI框架通过结合分子图像信息和功能基序序列，提升了药物相互作用（DDI）预测的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在药物相互作用预测中受限于功能基序表示学习不足，而DDI主要由基序相互作用引起。

Method: ImageDDI将分子分解为功能基序，通过Transformer编码器嵌入序列，并结合分子图像信息（如纹理、颜色等）增强空间表示。

Result: 实验表明，ImageDDI在常用数据集上优于现有方法，并在2D和3D图像增强场景中表现优异。

Conclusion: ImageDDI通过融合全局和局部结构信息，显著提升了DDI预测性能。

Abstract: To mitigate the potential adverse health effects of simultaneous multi-drug
use, including unexpected side effects and interactions, accurately identifying
and predicting drug-drug interactions (DDIs) is considered a crucial task in
the field of deep learning. Although existing methods have demonstrated
promising performance, they suffer from the bottleneck of limited functional
motif-based representation learning, as DDIs are fundamentally caused by motif
interactions rather than the overall drug structures. In this paper, we propose
an Image-enhanced molecular motif sequence representation framework for
\textbf{DDI} prediction, called ImageDDI, which represents a pair of drugs from
both global and local structures. Specifically, ImageDDI tokenizes molecules
into functional motifs. To effectively represent a drug pair, their motifs are
combined into a single sequence and embedded using a transformer-based encoder,
starting from the local structure representation. By leveraging the
associations between drug pairs, ImageDDI further enhances the spatial
representation of molecules using global molecular image information (e.g.
texture, shadow, color, and planar spatial relationships). To integrate
molecular visual information into functional motif sequence, ImageDDI employs
Adaptive Feature Fusion, enhancing the generalization of ImageDDI by
dynamically adapting the fusion process of feature representations.
Experimental results on widely used datasets demonstrate that ImageDDI
outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, extensive experiments show that
ImageDDI achieved competitive performance in both 2D and 3D image-enhanced
scenarios compared to other models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于物联网设备数量激增且计算能力有限，传统深度学习模型难以部署，因此需要优化技术以实现高效边缘计算。

Abstract: Object detection (OD) has become vital for numerous computer vision
applications, but deploying it on resource-constrained IoT devices presents a
significant challenge. These devices, often powered by energy-efficient
microcontrollers, struggle to handle the computational load of deep
learning-based OD models. This issue is compounded by the rapid proliferation
of IoT devices, predicted to surpass 150 billion by 2030. TinyML offers a
compelling solution by enabling OD on ultra-low-power devices, paving the way
for efficient and real-time processing at the edge. Although numerous survey
papers have been published on this topic, they often overlook the optimization
challenges associated with deploying OD models in TinyML environments. To
address this gap, this survey paper provides a detailed analysis of key
optimization techniques for deploying OD models on resource-constrained
devices. These techniques include quantization, pruning, knowledge
distillation, and neural architecture search. Furthermore, we explore both
theoretical approaches and practical implementations, bridging the gap between
academic research and real-world edge artificial intelligence deployment.
Finally, we compare the key performance indicators (KPIs) of existing OD
implementations on microcontroller devices, highlighting the achieved maturity
level of these solutions in terms of both prediction accuracy and efficiency.
We also provide a public repository to continually track developments in this
fast-evolving field:

### [4] [Neural Tangent Knowledge Distillation for Optical Convolutional Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08421)
*Jinlin Xiang,Minho Choi,Yubo Zhang,Zhihao Zhou,Arka Majumdar,Eli Shlizerman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种任务无关和硬件无关的混合光学神经网络（ONN）优化流程，通过NTKD方法缩小精度差距，并在实验验证中提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 混合ONN在能效上优于全数字网络，但存在精度差距和模拟与实际系统差异的问题，限制了其应用。

Method: 提出任务无关和硬件无关的优化流程，包括预训练精度估计和NTKD方法，用于训练和后端微调。

Result: 在多个数据集和硬件配置上验证，流程显著提升ONN性能，支持实际部署。

Conclusion: 该流程解决了ONN的通用性和精度问题，为其实际应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Hybrid Optical Neural Networks (ONNs, typically consisting of an optical
frontend and a digital backend) offer an energy-efficient alternative to fully
digital deep networks for real-time, power-constrained systems. However, their
adoption is limited by two main challenges: the accuracy gap compared to
large-scale networks during training, and discrepancies between simulated and
fabricated systems that further degrade accuracy. While previous work has
proposed end-to-end optimizations for specific datasets (e.g., MNIST) and
optical systems, these approaches typically lack generalization across tasks
and hardware designs. To address these limitations, we propose a task-agnostic
and hardware-agnostic pipeline that supports image classification and
segmentation across diverse optical systems. To assist optical system design
before training, we estimate achievable model accuracy based on user-specified
constraints such as physical size and the dataset. For training, we introduce
Neural Tangent Knowledge Distillation (NTKD), which aligns optical models with
electronic teacher networks, thereby narrowing the accuracy gap. After
fabrication, NTKD also guides fine-tuning of the digital backend to compensate
for implementation errors. Experiments on multiple datasets (e.g., MNIST,
CIFAR, Carvana Masking) and hardware configurations show that our pipeline
consistently improves ONN performance and enables practical deployment in both
pre-fabrication simulations and physical implementations.

### [5] [MAViS: A Multi-Agent Framework for Long-Sequence Video Storytelling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08487)
*Qian Wang,Ziqi Huang,Ruoxi Jia,Paul Debevec,Ning Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MAViS是一个多智能体协作框架，用于生成长序列视频叙事，解决了现有框架在辅助能力、视觉质量和表现力上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前长序列视频生成框架存在辅助能力差、视觉质量不佳和表现力有限的问题，MAViS旨在通过多智能体协作解决这些问题。

Method: MAViS采用多阶段多智能体协作，包括脚本编写、镜头设计、角色建模、关键帧生成、视频动画和音频生成，遵循3E原则（探索、检查、增强）。

Result: 实验表明，MAViS在辅助能力、视觉质量和表现力上达到最先进水平，并能与多种生成模型和工具兼容。

Conclusion: MAViS是首个提供多模态设计输出（带叙事和背景音乐的视频）的框架，显著提升了用户创作灵感和创造力。

Abstract: Despite recent advances, long-sequence video generation frameworks still
suffer from significant limitations: poor assistive capability, suboptimal
visual quality, and limited expressiveness. To mitigate these limitations, we
propose MAViS, an end-to-end multi-agent collaborative framework for
long-sequence video storytelling. MAViS orchestrates specialized agents across
multiple stages, including script writing, shot designing, character modeling,
keyframe generation, video animation, and audio generation. In each stage,
agents operate under the 3E Principle -- Explore, Examine, and Enhance -- to
ensure the completeness of intermediate outputs. Considering the capability
limitations of current generative models, we propose the Script Writing
Guidelines to optimize compatibility between scripts and generative tools.
Experimental results demonstrate that MAViS achieves state-of-the-art
performance in assistive capability, visual quality, and video expressiveness.
Its modular framework further enables scalability with diverse generative
models and tools. With just a brief user prompt, MAViS is capable of producing
high-quality, expressive long-sequence video storytelling, enriching
inspirations and creativity for users. To the best of our knowledge, MAViS is
the only framework that provides multimodal design output -- videos with
narratives and background music.

### [6] [MuGa-VTON: Multi-Garment Virtual Try-On via Diffusion Transformers with Prompt Customization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08488)
*Ankan Deria,Dwarikanath Mahapatra,Behzad Bozorgtabar,Mohna Chakraborty,Snehashis Chakraborty,Sudipta Roy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MuGa-VTON是一个统一的多服装虚拟试穿框架，通过联合建模上下服装和人物身份，解决了现有方法在真实性和灵活性上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有虚拟试穿方法通常单独处理上下服装，依赖复杂预处理，且难以保留人物特定特征（如纹身、配饰和体型），导致真实性和灵活性受限。

Method: 提出MuGa-VTON框架，包含三个关键模块：服装表示模块（GRM）、人物表示模块（PRM）和A-DiT融合模块，通过扩散变换器整合服装、人物和文本提示特征。

Result: 在VITON-HD和DressCode基准测试中，MuGa-VTON在定性和定量评估上均优于现有方法，生成高保真且保留身份的结果。

Conclusion: MuGa-VTON为虚拟试穿提供了更真实、灵活的解决方案，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Virtual try-on seeks to generate photorealistic images of individuals in
desired garments, a task that must simultaneously preserve personal identity
and garment fidelity for practical use in fashion retail and personalization.
However, existing methods typically handle upper and lower garments separately,
rely on heavy preprocessing, and often fail to preserve person-specific cues
such as tattoos, accessories, and body shape-resulting in limited realism and
flexibility. To this end, we introduce MuGa-VTON, a unified multi-garment
diffusion framework that jointly models upper and lower garments together with
person identity in a shared latent space. Specifically, we proposed three key
modules: the Garment Representation Module (GRM) for capturing both garment
semantics, the Person Representation Module (PRM) for encoding identity and
pose cues, and the A-DiT fusion module, which integrates garment, person, and
text-prompt features through a diffusion transformer. This architecture
supports prompt-based customization, allowing fine-grained garment
modifications with minimal user input. Extensive experiments on the VITON-HD
and DressCode benchmarks demonstrate that MuGa-VTON outperforms existing
methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations, producing
high-fidelity, identity-preserving results suitable for real-world virtual
try-on applications.

### [7] [CObL: Toward Zero-Shot Ordinal Layering without User Prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08498)
*Aneel Damaraju,Dean Hazineh,Todd Zickler*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CObL的扩散架构，用于从图像中推断出由遮挡有序的物体层组成的场景表示，无需用户提示或预先知道物体数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉任务需要将像素分组为物体并理解其空间关系（包括深度和横向）。现有的方法在无监督物体表示学习或遮挡物体完成方面存在局限性。

Method: 采用扩散模型（CObL）并行生成物体层，利用Stable Diffusion作为自然物体的先验，并通过推理时指导确保层合成回输入图像。

Result: CObL在合成图像上训练后，能够零样本泛化到真实世界桌面的照片，且无需预先知道物体数量或用户提示。

Conclusion: CObL在无监督物体表示学习和遮挡物体完成方面优于现有方法，具有更强的泛化能力。

Abstract: Vision benefits from grouping pixels into objects and understanding their
spatial relationships, both laterally and in depth. We capture this with a
scene representation comprising an occlusion-ordered stack of "object layers,"
each containing an isolated and amodally-completed object. To infer this
representation from an image, we introduce a diffusion-based architecture named
Concurrent Object Layers (CObL). CObL generates a stack of object layers in
parallel, using Stable Diffusion as a prior for natural objects and
inference-time guidance to ensure the inferred layers composite back to the
input image. We train CObL using a few thousand synthetically-generated images
of multi-object tabletop scenes, and we find that it zero-shot generalizes to
photographs of real-world tabletops with varying numbers of novel objects. In
contrast to recent models for amodal object completion, CObL reconstructs
multiple occluded objects without user prompting and without knowing the number
of objects beforehand. Unlike previous models for unsupervised object-centric
representation learning, CObL is not limited to the world it was trained in.

*Aaditya Baranwal,Madhav Kataria,Naitik Agrawal,Yogesh S Rawat,Shruti Vyas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 当前视觉语言模型（VLMs）在序列视觉叙事处理中存在表面识别与深度叙事推理的显著差距。研究发现，尽管大型多模态模型擅长单面板解读，但在时间因果关系和跨面板连贯性上表现不佳。论文提出了一种新的评估框架，结合多模态标注和跨模态嵌入分析，揭示了现有模型的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示当前VLMs在长叙事理解中的不足，特别是在时间因果关系和跨面板连贯性方面的缺陷，以推动更深入的叙事智能研究。

Method: 提出综合评估框架，包括多模态标注、跨模态嵌入分析和检索增强评估，应用于《Re:Zero》漫画的308个标注面板。

Result: 现有模型缺乏真正的故事级智能，在非线性叙事、角色一致性和长序列因果推理方面表现不佳。

Conclusion: 该研究为评估叙事智能提供了基础和方法论，并指出了多模态模型在深度序列理解上的改进方向。

Abstract: Current Vision Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate a critical gap between
surface-level recognition and deep narrative reasoning when processing
sequential visual storytelling. Through a comprehensive investigation of manga
narrative understanding, we reveal that while recent large multimodal models
excel at individual panel interpretation, they systematically fail at temporal
causality and cross-panel cohesion, core requirements for coherent story
comprehension. We introduce a novel evaluation framework that combines
fine-grained multimodal annotation, cross-modal embedding analysis, and
retrieval-augmented assessment to systematically characterize these
limitations.
  Our methodology includes (i) a rigorous annotation protocol linking visual
elements to narrative structure through aligned light novel text, (ii)
comprehensive evaluation across multiple reasoning paradigms, including direct
inference and retrieval-augmented generation, and (iii) cross-modal similarity
analysis revealing fundamental misalignments in current VLMs' joint
representations. Applying this framework to Re:Zero manga across 11 chapters
with 308 annotated panels, we conduct the first systematic study of long-form
narrative understanding in VLMs through three core evaluation axes: generative
storytelling, contextual dialogue grounding, and temporal reasoning. Our
findings demonstrate that current models lack genuine story-level intelligence,
struggling particularly with non-linear narratives, character consistency, and
causal inference across extended sequences. This work establishes both the
foundation and practical methodology for evaluating narrative intelligence,
while providing actionable insights into the capability of deep sequential
understanding of Discrete Visual Narratives beyond basic recognition in
Multimodal Models.

### [9] [VISOR: Visual Input-based Steering for Output Redirection in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08521)
*Mansi Phute,Ravikumar Balakrishnan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VISOR是一种通过优化视觉输入实现行为控制的新方法，无需访问模型内部，适用于所有VLM服务模式，且在安全性和隐蔽性上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有行为控制方法（如系统提示）易检测且效果有限，而基于激活的转向向量需要侵入式访问模型内部，不适用于API服务和闭源部署。

Method: VISOR通过生成通用转向图像，诱导目标激活模式，实现行为控制，无需修改模型内部。

Result: 在LLaVA-1.5-7B上验证，VISOR在拒绝、奉承和生存本能任务中表现优异，单张150KB图像即可实现显著行为偏移（最高25%），且不影响无关任务性能。

Conclusion: VISOR重新定义了多模态模型控制方式，同时揭示了视觉转向攻击的安全漏洞，亟需防御措施。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly being used in a broad range of
applications, bringing their security and behavioral control to the forefront.
While existing approaches for behavioral control or output redirection, like
system prompting in VLMs, are easily detectable and often ineffective,
activation-based steering vectors require invasive runtime access to model
internals--incompatible with API-based services and closed-source deployments.
We introduce VISOR (Visual Input-based Steering for Output Redirection), a
novel method that achieves sophisticated behavioral control through optimized
visual inputs alone. By crafting universal steering images that induce target
activation patterns, VISOR enables practical deployment across all VLM serving
modalities while remaining imperceptible compared to explicit textual
instructions. We validate VISOR on LLaVA-1.5-7B across three critical alignment
tasks: refusal, sycophancy and survival instinct. A single 150KB steering image
matches steering vector performance within 1-2% for positive behavioral shifts
while dramatically exceeding it for negative steering--achieving up to 25%
shifts from baseline compared to steering vectors' modest changes. Unlike
system prompting (3-4% shifts), VISOR provides robust bidirectional control
while maintaining 99.9% performance on 14,000 unrelated MMLU tasks. Beyond
eliminating runtime overhead and model access requirements, VISOR exposes a
critical security vulnerability: adversaries can achieve sophisticated
behavioral manipulation through visual channels alone, bypassing text-based
defenses. Our work fundamentally re-imagines multimodal model control and
highlights the urgent need for defenses against visual steering attacks.

### [10] [Training Kindai OCR with parallel textline images and self-attention feature distance-based loss](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08537)
*Anh Le,Asanobu Kitamoto*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究通过利用平行文本行图像（近代日语原文与当代日语字体配对）来扩充训练数据集，解决了近代日语文档转录数据稀缺的问题。采用基于距离的目标函数（欧几里得距离和最大均值差异）优化自注意力特征，显著降低了字符错误率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近代日语文档具有重要历史价值，但转录工作耗时且数据稀缺，限制了OCR系统的训练。

Method: 利用平行文本行图像，提出基于距离的目标函数（欧几里得距离和MMD）来优化自注意力特征。

Result: 实验显示，字符错误率分别降低了2.23%（欧几里得距离）和3.94%（MMD），自注意力表示质量提升。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了历史文档OCR性能，解决了数据稀缺问题。

Abstract: Kindai documents, written in modern Japanese from the late 19th to early 20th
century, hold significant historical value for researchers studying societal
structures, daily life, and environmental conditions of that period. However,
transcribing these documents remains a labor-intensive and time-consuming task,
resulting in limited annotated data for training optical character recognition
(OCR) systems. This research addresses this challenge of data scarcity by
leveraging parallel textline images - pairs of original Kindai text and their
counterparts in contemporary Japanese fonts - to augment training datasets. We
introduce a distance-based objective function that minimizes the gap between
self-attention features of the parallel image pairs. Specifically, we explore
Euclidean distance and Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) as domain adaptation
metrics. Experimental results demonstrate that our method reduces the character
error rate (CER) by 2.23% and 3.94% over a Transformer-based OCR baseline when
using Euclidean distance and MMD, respectively. Furthermore, our approach
improves the discriminative quality of self-attention representations, leading
to more effective OCR performance for historical documents.

### [11] [Calibration Attention: Instance-wise Temperature Scaling for Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08547)
*Wenhao Liang,Wei Emma Zhang,Lin Yue,Miao Xu,Olaf Maennel,Weitong Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CalAttn是一种自适应温度校准模块，通过ViT的CLS令牌学习实例级温度，显著降低校准误差，且不增加额外参数负担。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在风险敏感应用中，Vision Transformers的概率校准至关重要，传统方法使用单一全局标量且需验证集。

Method: 提出Calibration Attention (CalAttn)，直接从ViT的CLS令牌学习自适应实例级温度。

Result: 在多个数据集上，CalAttn将校准误差降低至多4倍，且参数增加不到0.1%。

Conclusion: CalAttn简单高效，适用于多种架构，提供更可信的概率且不牺牲准确性。

Abstract: Probability calibration is critical when Vision Transformers are deployed in
risk-sensitive applications. The standard fix, post-hoc temperature scaling,
uses a single global scalar and requires a held-out validation set. We
introduce Calibration Attention (CalAttn), a drop-in module that learns an
adaptive, per-instance temperature directly from the ViT's CLS token. Across
CIFAR-10/100, MNIST, Tiny-ImageNet, and ImageNet-1K, CalAttn reduces
calibration error by up to 4x on ViT-224, DeiT, and Swin, while adding under
0.1 percent additional parameters. The learned temperatures cluster tightly
around 1.0, in contrast to the large global values used by standard temperature
scaling. CalAttn is simple, efficient, and architecture-agnostic, and yields
more trustworthy probabilities without sacrificing accuracy. Code:

### [12] [Boosting Generic Semi-Supervised Medical Image Segmentation via Diverse Teaching and Label Propagation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08549)
*Wei Li,Pengcheng Zhou,Linye Ma,Wenyi Zhao,Huihua Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通用的框架DTLP-Net，用于解决医学图像分割中的半监督学习、领域泛化和无监督领域适应问题，通过多样化的教师模型和标签传播提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割中标注数据有限和领域偏移是常见挑战，现有方法通常针对单一任务，导致性能受限。本文旨在开发一个通用框架，解决这些问题。

Method: 采用DTLP-Net框架，包含一个学生模型和两个多样化教师模型，生成可靠的伪标签，并结合数据增强和标签传播技术。

Result: 在五个基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法在SSMIS、UMDA和Semi-MDG任务中均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DTLP-Net框架在多种半监督学习场景中表现出色，具有解决更复杂问题的潜力。

Abstract: Both limited annotation and domain shift are significant challenges
frequently encountered in medical image segmentation, leading to derivative
scenarios like semi-supervised medical (SSMIS), semi-supervised medical domain
generalization (Semi-MDG) and unsupervised medical domain adaptation (UMDA).
Conventional methods are generally tailored to specific tasks in isolation, the
error accumulation hinders the effective utilization of unlabeled data and
limits further improvements, resulting in suboptimal performance when these
issues occur. In this paper, we aim to develop a generic framework that masters
all three tasks. We found that the key to solving the problem lies in how to
generate reliable pseudo labels for the unlabeled data in the presence of
domain shift with labeled data and increasing the diversity of the model. To
tackle this issue, we employ a Diverse Teaching and Label Propagation Network
(DTLP-Net) to boosting the Generic Semi-Supervised Medical Image Segmentation.
Our DTLP-Net involves a single student model and two diverse teacher models,
which can generate reliable pseudo-labels for the student model. The first
teacher model decouple the training process with labeled and unlabeled data,
The second teacher is momentum-updated periodically, thus generating reliable
yet divers pseudo-labels. To fully utilize the information within the data, we
adopt inter-sample and intra-sample data augmentation to learn the global and
local knowledge. In addition, to further capture the voxel-level correlations,
we propose label propagation to enhance the model robust. We evaluate our
proposed framework on five benchmark datasets for SSMIS, UMDA, and Semi-MDG
tasks. The results showcase notable improvements compared to state-of-the-art
methods across all five settings, indicating the potential of our framework to
tackle more challenging SSL scenarios.

*Yunqi Miao,Zhiyu Qu,Mingqi Gao,Changrui Chen,Jifei Song,Jungong Han,Jiankang Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FLIPNET通过切换恢复和退化模式，解决了扩散模型在盲人脸恢复中的适应性差距，提升了真实性和保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在盲人脸恢复中存在适应性差距，主要源于高质量与低质量图像以及合成与真实图像之间的差异。

Method: FLIPNET采用统一网络，切换恢复模式（整合BFR特征和人脸嵌入）和退化模式（合成真实退化图像）。

Result: 在基准数据集上，FLIPNET在真实性和保真度上优于现有方法，且能更好地模拟真实退化。

Conclusion: FLIPNET通过双模式设计有效解决了扩散模型在盲人脸恢复中的局限性，表现优异。

Abstract: Although diffusion prior is rising as a powerful solution for blind face
restoration (BFR), the inherent gap between the vanilla diffusion model and BFR
settings hinders its seamless adaptation. The gap mainly stems from the
discrepancy between 1) high-quality (HQ) and low-quality (LQ) images and 2)
synthesized and real-world images. The vanilla diffusion model is trained on
images with no or less degradations, whereas BFR handles moderately to severely
degraded images. Additionally, LQ images used for training are synthesized by a
naive degradation model with limited degradation patterns, which fails to
simulate complex and unknown degradations in real-world scenarios. In this
work, we use a unified network FLIPNET that switches between two modes to
resolve specific gaps. In Restoration mode, the model gradually integrates
BFR-oriented features and face embeddings from LQ images to achieve authentic
and faithful face restoration. In Degradation mode, the model synthesizes
real-world like degraded images based on the knowledge learned from real-world
degradation datasets. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets show that our
model 1) outperforms previous diffusion prior based BFR methods in terms of
authenticity and fidelity, and 2) outperforms the naive degradation model in
modeling the real-world degradations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AutoSAME框架结合SAM的视觉理解能力，同时完成分割和关键点定位任务，通过FCBA和SGPA优化性能，实验证明其在LV指标测量中的优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有算法因训练数据少难以捕捉通用视觉表示，而SAM等基础模型虽擅长分割但无法定位关键解剖点，因此需结合两者优势。

Method: 提出AutoSAME框架，结合SAM的分割能力与关键点定位任务，引入FCBA和SGPA优化特征表示和空间引导。

Result: 在超声心动图数据集上，AutoSAME在分割、关键点定位和指标测量中表现优异。

Conclusion: AutoSAME通过结合分割与定位任务，优化视觉表示，实现了与临床指南一致的LV指标测量。

Abstract: Left ventricular (LV) indicator measurements following clinical
echocardiog-raphy guidelines are important for diagnosing cardiovascular
disease. Alt-hough existing algorithms have explored automated LV
quantification, they can struggle to capture generic visual representations due
to the normally small training datasets. Therefore, it is necessary to
introduce vision founda-tional models (VFM) with abundant knowledge. However,
VFMs represented by the segment anything model (SAM) are usually suitable for
segmentation but incapable of identifying key anatomical points, which are
critical in LV indicator measurements. In this paper, we propose a novel
framework named AutoSAME, combining the powerful visual understanding of SAM
with seg-mentation and landmark localization tasks simultaneously.
Consequently, the framework mimics the operation of cardiac sonographers,
achieving LV indi-cator measurements consistent with clinical guidelines. We
further present fil-tered cross-branch attention (FCBA) in AutoSAME, which
leverages relatively comprehensive features in the segmentation to enhance the
heatmap regression (HR) of key points from the frequency domain perspective,
optimizing the vis-ual representation learned by the latter. Moreover, we
propose spatial-guided prompt alignment (SGPA) to automatically generate prompt
embeddings guid-ed by spatial properties of LV, thereby improving the accuracy
of dense pre-dictions by prior spatial knowledge. The extensive experiments on
an echocar-diography dataset demonstrate the efficiency of each design and the
superiori-ty of our AutoSAME in LV segmentation, landmark localization, and
indicator measurements. The code will be available at

Abstract: To enhance group robustness to spurious correlations, prior work often relies
on auxiliary annotations for groups or spurious features and assumes identical
sets of groups across source and target domains. These two requirements are
both unnatural and impractical in real-world settings. To overcome these
limitations, we propose a method that leverages the semantic structure inherent
in class labels--specifically, superclass information--to naturally reduce
reliance on spurious features. Our model employs gradient-based attention
guided by a pre-trained vision-language model to disentangle
superclass-relevant and irrelevant features. Then, by promoting the use of all
superclass-relevant features for prediction, our approach achieves robustness
to more complex spurious correlations without the need to annotate any source
samples. Experiments across diverse datasets demonstrate that our method
significantly outperforms baselines in domain generalization tasks, with clear
improvements in both quantitative metrics and qualitative visualizations.

Motivation: 现有方法无法独立控制视频的四个关键元素（前景、背景、轨迹、动作），限制了视频生成的灵活性。

Method: 构建3D世界坐标系，在3D空间中编辑运动；通过文本到运动方法生成动作；基于扩散变换器模型注入控制信号。

Conclusion: 该框架实现了灵活的视频元素组合，生成高质量且可控的人体视频。

Abstract: Generating human videos with realistic and controllable motions is a
challenging task. While existing methods can generate visually compelling
videos, they lack separate control over four key video elements: foreground
subject, background video, human trajectory and action patterns. In this paper,
we propose a decomposed human motion control and video generation framework
that explicitly decouples motion from appearance, subject from background, and
action from trajectory, enabling flexible mix-and-match composition of these
elements. Concretely, we first build a ground-aware 3D world coordinate system
and perform motion editing directly in the 3D space. Trajectory control is
implemented by unprojecting edited 2D trajectories into 3D with focal-length
calibration and coordinate transformation, followed by speed alignment and
orientation adjustment; actions are supplied by a motion bank or generated via
text-to-motion methods. Then, based on modern text-to-video diffusion
transformer models, we inject the subject as tokens for full attention,
concatenate the background along the channel dimension, and add motion
(trajectory and action) control signals by addition. Such a design opens up the
possibility for us to generate realistic videos of anyone doing anything
anywhere. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets and real-world cases
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both
element-wise controllability and overall video quality.

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在文档理解中表现出色，但其推理过程缺乏透明性，难以确保可靠性，尤其是在法律、金融和医疗等高风险领域。现有方法存在灾难性遗忘、适应性差和跨领域任务泛化能力有限的问题。

Method: DocThinker采用基于规则的强化学习框架，通过策略学习动态优化推理策略，生成可解释的中间结果，包括结构化推理过程、问题重述、支持答案的兴趣区域和最终答案。结合多目标规则奖励和KL约束优化，提升适应性和透明度。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，DocThinker显著提升了泛化能力，并生成更易解释和人类理解的推理步骤。

Conclusion: 强化学习是增强多模态大语言模型在文档理解中可解释性和适应性的有效方法。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in document understanding. However, their reasoning processes
remain largely black-box, making it difficult to ensure reliability and
trustworthiness, especially in high-stakes domains such as legal, financial,
and medical document analysis. Existing methods use fixed Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) reasoning with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) but suffer from catastrophic
forgetting, poor adaptability, and limited generalization across domain tasks.
In this paper, we propose DocThinker, a rule-based Reinforcement Learning (RL)
framework for dynamic inference-time reasoning. Instead of relying on static
CoT templates, DocThinker autonomously refines reasoning strategies via policy
learning, generating explainable intermediate results, including structured
reasoning processes, rephrased questions, regions of interest (RoI) supporting
the answer, and the final answer. By integrating multi-objective rule-based
rewards and KL-constrained optimization, our method mitigates catastrophic
forgetting and enhances both adaptability and transparency. Extensive
experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that DocThinker significantly
improves generalization while producing more explainable and
human-understandable reasoning steps. Our findings highlight RL as a powerful
alternative for enhancing explainability and adaptability in MLLM-based
document understanding. Code will be available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DETR-based方法在HOI检测中因随机初始化查询缺乏明确语义而性能受限。

Method: 提出QueryCraft框架，包括ACTOR（跨模态Transformer）和PDQD（感知蒸馏查询解码器），分别用于语义查询初始化和对象查询增强。

Result: 在HICO-Det和V-COCO基准测试中达到最优性能，并表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: QueryCraft通过语义引导的查询初始化显著提升了HOI检测性能，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection aims to localize human-object pairs
and recognize their interactions in images. Although DETR-based methods have
recently emerged as the mainstream framework for HOI detection, they still
suffer from a key limitation: Randomly initialized queries lack explicit
semantics, leading to suboptimal detection performance. To address this
challenge, we propose QueryCraft, a novel plug-and-play HOI detection framework
that incorporates semantic priors and guided feature learning through
transformer-based query initialization. Central to our approach is
\textbf{ACTOR} (\textbf{A}ction-aware \textbf{C}ross-modal
\textbf{T}ransf\textbf{OR}mer), a cross-modal Transformer encoder that jointly
attends to visual regions and textual prompts to extract action-relevant
features. Rather than merely aligning modalities, ACTOR leverages
language-guided attention to infer interaction semantics and produce
semantically meaningful query representations. To further enhance object-level
query quality, we introduce a \textbf{P}erceptual \textbf{D}istilled
\textbf{Q}uery \textbf{D}ecoder (\textbf{PDQD}), which distills object category
awareness from a pre-trained detector to serve as object query initiation. This
dual-branch query initialization enables the model to generate more
interpretable and effective queries for HOI detection. Extensive experiments on
HICO-Det and V-COCO benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance and strong generalization. Code will be released
upon publication.

interactive simulation. Multi-Modal Generation: We introduce a hierarchical
autoregressive caption method that injects game-specific knowledge into
open-domain multi-modal video diffusion models (VDMs), then transforming the
VDM into a frame-wise, action-controllable, real-time infinite interactive
video generator. Notably, when the textual and visual prompts are sourced from
different domains, the model demonstrates strong generalization, allowing it to
blend and compose the style and mechanics across domains flexibly according to
user prompts. Multi-Granularity Editing: We propose a hybrid model that
explicitly disentangles interactive mechanics simulation from visual rendering,
enabling multi-granularity video content editing during interaction through
text. Collectively, Yan offers an integration of these modules, pushing
interactive video generation beyond isolated capabilities toward a
comprehensive AI-driven interactive creation paradigm, paving the way for the

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视觉语言模型规模和复杂度的增加，微调成本高昂，需要一种高效的方法将适配知识从弱模型迁移到强模型。

Method: 提出TransMiter，以无监督方式捕捉预训练和微调模型之间的知识差距，无需反向传播即可跨模型迁移。

Result: 实验表明，TransMiter能高效迁移适配知识，保持模型泛化能力，且额外推理成本极低。

Conclusion: TransMiter为视觉语言模型提供了一种高效、轻量的适配知识迁移方案。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been widely used in various visual
recognition tasks due to their remarkable generalization capabilities. As these
models grow in size and complexity, fine-tuning becomes costly, emphasizing the
need to reuse adaptation knowledge from 'weaker' models to efficiently enhance
'stronger' ones. However, existing adaptation transfer methods exhibit limited
transferability across models due to their model-specific design and high
computational demands. To tackle this, we propose Transferable Model-agnostic
adapter (TransMiter), a light-weight adapter that improves vision-language
models 'without backpropagation'. TransMiter captures the knowledge gap between
pre-trained and fine-tuned VLMs, in an 'unsupervised' manner. Once trained,
this knowledge can be seamlessly transferred across different models without
the need for backpropagation. Moreover, TransMiter consists of only a few
layers, inducing a negligible additional inference cost. Notably, supplementing
the process with a few labeled data further yields additional performance gain,
often surpassing a fine-tuned stronger model, with a marginal training cost.
Experimental results and analyses demonstrate that TransMiter effectively and
efficiently transfers adaptation knowledge while preserving generalization
abilities across VLMs of different sizes and architectures in visual
recognition tasks.

Abstract: Shooting video with a handheld mobile phone, the most common photographic
device, often results in blurry frames due to shaking hands and other
instability factors. Although previous video deblurring methods have achieved
impressive progress, they still struggle to perform satisfactorily on
real-world handheld video due to the blur domain gap between training and
testing data. To address the issue, we propose a self-supervised method for
handheld video deblurring, which is driven by sharp clues in the video. First,
to train the deblurring model, we extract the sharp clues from the video and
take them as misalignment labels of neighboring blurry frames. Second, to
improve the model's ability, we propose a novel Self-Enhanced Video Deblurring
(SEVD) method to create higher-quality paired video data. Third, we propose a
Self-Constrained Spatial Consistency Maintenance (SCSCM) method to regularize
the model, preventing position shifts between the output and input frames.
Moreover, we construct a synthetic and a real-world handheld video dataset for
handheld video deblurring. Extensive experiments on these two and other common
real-world datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms
existing self-supervised ones. The code and datasets are publicly available at

Abstract: Neural artistic style transfers and blends the content and style
representation of one image with the style of another. This enables artists to
create unique innovative visuals and enhances artistic expression in various
fields including art, design, and film. Color transfer algorithms are an
important in digital image processing by adjusting the color information in a
target image based on the colors in the source image. Color transfer enhances
images and videos in film and photography, and can aid in image correction. We
introduce a methodology that combines neural artistic style with color
transfer. The method uses the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to
quantitatively evaluate color and luminance histogram matching algorithms
including Reinhard global color transfer, iteration distribution transfer
(IDT), IDT with regrain, Cholesky, and PCA between the original and neural
artistic style transferred image using deep learning. We estimate the color
channel kernel densities. Various experiments are performed to evaluate the KL
of these algorithms and their color histograms for style to content transfer.

Result: HVPL模型在实验中表现优于基线方法，有效解决了灾难性遗忘问题。

Conclusion: HVPL模型通过分层提示学习，显著提升了视频实例分割的动态类别适应能力。

Abstract: Video instance segmentation (VIS) has gained significant attention for its
capability in tracking and segmenting object instances across video frames.
However, most of the existing VIS approaches unrealistically assume that the
categories of object instances remain fixed over time. Moreover, they
experience catastrophic forgetting of old classes when required to continuously
learn object instances belonging to new categories. To resolve these
challenges, we develop a novel Hierarchical Visual Prompt Learning (HVPL) model
that overcomes catastrophic forgetting of previous categories from both
frame-level and video-level perspectives. Specifically, to mitigate forgetting
at the frame level, we devise a task-specific frame prompt and an orthogonal
gradient correction (OGC) module. The OGC module helps the frame prompt encode
task-specific global instance information for new classes in each individual
frame by projecting its gradients onto the orthogonal feature space of old
classes. Furthermore, to address forgetting at the video level, we design a
task-specific video prompt and a video context decoder. This decoder first
embeds structural inter-class relationships across frames into the frame prompt
features, and then propagates task-specific global video contexts from the
frame prompt features to the video prompt. Through rigorous comparisons, our
HVPL model proves to be more effective than baseline approaches. The code is
available at https://github.com/JiahuaDong/HVPL.

Conclusion: AME是一种即插即用的模块，无需修改主干架构，适用于广泛的视觉-语言蒸馏框架，且理论分析表明其能提供更紧的泛化误差界。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation is a long-established technique for knowledge
transfer, and has regained attention in the context of the recent emergence of
large vision-language models (VLMs). However, vision-language knowledge
distillation often requires sufficient training data to achieve robust
generalization on amples with ambiguous or boundary-adjacent representations,
which are associated with high predictive uncertainty. Critically, collecting
such large-scale, task-specific data for training is often impractical in
real-world scenarios. To address this major challenge arising from the
entanglement of uncertainty and cross-modal feature representation, we propose
Aligned Manifold Entropy for Robust Vision-Language Distillation (AME), aiming
to achieve robust generalization under real-world conditions. AME applies
entropy minimization over a reconfigured shared manifold, where multi-modal
data (i.e., image and text) are bridged through a pair of projection functions,
conducive to structural compression for cross-modal feature representations.
This enables robust knowledge distillation under low-data regimes, while
requiring no architectural modifications to the backbone. As a result, it can
serve as a plug-and-play module compatible with a wide range of vision-language
distillation frameworks. Notably, our theoretical analysis reveals that
integrating knowledge distillation with entropy minimization over the shared
manifold leads to a tighter generalization error bound. Extensive experiments
across diverse distillation architectures and training settings demonstrate
that AME consistently facilitates robust knowledge distillation, resulting in
superior generalization performance across a wide spectrum of downstream tasks.

Abstract: Most prior unsupervised domain adaptation approaches for medical image
segmentation are narrowly tailored to either the source-accessible setting,
where adaptation is guided by source-target alignment, or the source-free
setting, which typically resorts to implicit supervision mechanisms such as
pseudo-labeling and model distillation. This substantial divergence in
methodological designs between the two settings reveals an inherent flaw: the
lack of an explicit, structured construction of anatomical knowledge that
naturally generalizes across domains and settings. To bridge this longstanding
divide, we introduce a unified, semantically grounded framework that supports
both source-accessible and source-free adaptation. Fundamentally distinct from
all prior works, our framework's adaptability emerges naturally as a direct
consequence of the model architecture, without the need for any handcrafted
adaptation strategies. Specifically, our model learns a domain-agnostic
probabilistic manifold as a global space of anatomical regularities, mirroring
how humans establish visual understanding. Thus, the structural content in each
image can be interpreted as a canonical anatomy retrieved from the manifold and
a spatial transformation capturing individual-specific geometry. This
disentangled, interpretable formulation enables semantically meaningful
prediction with intrinsic adaptability. Extensive experiments on challenging
cardiac and abdominal datasets show that our framework achieves
state-of-the-art results in both settings, with source-free performance closely
approaching its source-accessible counterpart, a level of consistency rarely
observed in prior works. Beyond quantitative improvement, we demonstrate strong
interpretability of the proposed framework via manifold traversal for smooth
shape manipulation.

Conclusion: HiWL有效解决了深度图像水印的三大核心问题，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Deep image watermarking, which refers to enable imperceptible watermark
embedding and reliable extraction in cover images, has shown to be effective
for copyright protection of image assets. However, existing methods face
limitations in simultaneously satisfying three essential criteria for
generalizable watermarking: 1) invisibility (imperceptible hide of watermarks),
2) robustness (reliable watermark recovery under diverse conditions), and 3)
broad applicability (low latency in watermarking process). To address these
limitations, we propose a Hierarchical Watermark Learning (HiWL), a two-stage
optimization that enable a watermarking model to simultaneously achieve three
criteria. In the first stage, distribution alignment learning is designed to
establish a common latent space with two constraints: 1) visual consistency
between watermarked and non-watermarked images, and 2) information invariance
across watermark latent representations. In this way, multi-modal inputs
including watermark message (binary codes) and cover images (RGB pixels) can be
well represented, ensuring the invisibility of watermarks and robustness in
watermarking process thereby. The second stage employs generalized watermark
representation learning to establish a disentanglement policy for separating
watermarks from image content in RGB space. In particular, it strongly
penalizes substantial fluctuations in separated RGB watermarks corresponding to
identical messages. Consequently, HiWL effectively learns generalizable
latent-space watermark representations while maintaining broad applicability.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed method. In
particular, it achieves 7.6\% higher accuracy in watermark extraction than
existing methods, while maintaining extremely low latency (100K images
processed in 8s).

Abstract: Multimodal medical image fusion (MMIF) aims to integrate images from
different modalities to produce a comprehensive image that enhances medical
diagnosis by accurately depicting organ structures, tissue textures, and
metabolic information. Capturing both the unique and complementary information
across multiple modalities simultaneously is a key research challenge in MMIF.
To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel image fusion method,
MMIF-AMIN, which features a new architecture that can effectively extract these
unique and complementary features. Specifically, an Invertible Dense Network
(IDN) is employed for lossless feature extraction from individual modalities.
To extract complementary information between modalities, a Multi-scale
Complementary Feature Extraction Module (MCFEM) is designed, which incorporates
a hybrid attention mechanism, convolutional layers of varying sizes, and
Transformers. An adaptive loss function is introduced to guide model learning,
addressing the limitations of traditional manually-designed loss functions and
enhancing the depth of data mining. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MMIF-AMIN outperforms nine state-of-the-art MMIF methods, delivering superior
results in both quantitative and qualitative analyses. Ablation experiments
confirm the effectiveness of each component of the proposed method.
Additionally, extending MMIF-AMIN to other image fusion tasks also achieves
promising performance.

Abstract: Ultrasound deformable registration estimates spatial transformations between
pairs of deformed ultrasound images, which is crucial for capturing
biomechanical properties and enhancing diagnostic accuracy in diseases such as
thyroid nodules and breast cancer. However, ultrasound deformable registration
remains highly challenging, especially under large deformation. The inherently
low contrast, heavy noise and ambiguous tissue boundaries in ultrasound images
severely hinder reliable feature extraction and correspondence matching.
Existing methods often suffer from poor anatomical alignment and lack physical
interpretability. To address the problem, we propose PADReg, a physics-aware
deformable registration framework guided by contact force. PADReg leverages
synchronized contact force measured by robotic ultrasound systems as a physical
prior to constrain the registration. Specifically, instead of directly
predicting deformation fields, we first construct a pixel-wise stiffness map
utilizing the multi-modal information from contact force and ultrasound images.
The stiffness map is then combined with force data to estimate a dense
deformation field, through a lightweight physics-aware module inspired by

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种仅使用RGB图像的越野自由空间检测方法ROD，通过预训练的Vision Transformer和轻量级解码器，显著提高了检测精度和推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 越野场景中自由空间检测的边界模糊，现有基于多模态（RGB+LiDAR）的方法因计算量大无法满足实时性需求。

Method: 利用预训练的Vision Transformer提取RGB图像特征，设计轻量级解码器，避免使用LiDAR数据。

Result: 在ORFD和RELLIS-3D数据集上达到新SOTA，推理速度达50 FPS。

Conclusion: ROD方法在精度和速度上均优于现有方法，适用于实时越野自由空间检测。

Abstract: Off-road freespace detection is more challenging than on-road scenarios
because of the blurred boundaries of traversable areas. Previous
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods employ multi-modal fusion of RGB images and
LiDAR data. However, due to the significant increase in inference time when
calculating surface normal maps from LiDAR data, multi-modal methods are not
suitable for real-time applications, particularly in real-world scenarios where
higher FPS is required compared to slow navigation. This paper presents a novel
RGB-only approach for off-road freespace detection, named ROD, eliminating the
reliance on LiDAR data and its computational demands. Specifically, we utilize
a pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT) to extract rich features from RGB
images. Additionally, we design a lightweight yet efficient decoder, which
together improve both precision and inference speed. ROD establishes a new SOTA
on ORFD and RELLIS-3D datasets, as well as an inference speed of 50 FPS,
significantly outperforming prior models.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的无参考视频质量评估方法CBAND，用于检测和评估视频压缩中的带状伪影，并发布了首个公开带状伪影视频数据集LIVE-YT-Banding。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高清晰度视频在压缩过程中产生的带状伪影严重影响观看质量，现有数据集仅针对静态图像，无法捕捉时间动态。

Method: 创建了包含160个视频的LIVE-YT-Banding数据集，收集了7,200个主观评价，并开发了基于深度神经网络的无参考质量评估模型CBAND。

Result: CBAND在带状伪影预测性能上显著优于现有模型，且速度更快，还可作为可微损失函数优化视频去带状伪影模型。

Conclusion: CBAND和LIVE-YT-Banding数据集为视频质量评估和优化提供了有效工具，推动了相关领域的研究。

Abstract: Although there have been notable advancements in video compression
technologies in recent years, banding artifacts remain a serious issue
affecting the quality of compressed videos, particularly on smooth regions of
high-definition videos. Noticeable banding artifacts can severely impact the
perceptual quality of videos viewed on a high-end HDTV or high-resolution
screen. Hence, there is a pressing need for a systematic investigation of the
banding video quality assessment problem for advanced video codecs. Given that
the existing publicly available datasets for studying banding artifacts are
limited to still picture data only, which cannot account for temporal banding
dynamics, we have created a first-of-a-kind open video dataset, dubbed
LIVE-YT-Banding, which consists of 160 videos generated by four different
compression parameters using the AV1 video codec. A total of 7,200 subjective
opinions are collected from a cohort of 45 human subjects. To demonstrate the
value of this new resources, we tested and compared a variety of models that
detect banding occurrences, and measure their impact on perceived quality.
Among these, we introduce an effective and efficient new no-reference (NR)
video quality evaluator which we call CBAND. CBAND leverages the properties of
the learned statistics of natural images expressed in the embeddings of deep
neural networks. Our experimental results show that the perceptual banding
prediction performance of CBAND significantly exceeds that of previous
state-of-the-art models, and is also orders of magnitude faster. Moreover,
CBAND can be employed as a differentiable loss function to optimize video
debanding models. The LIVE-YT-Banding database, code, and pre-trained model are
all publically available at https://github.com/uniqzheng/CBAND.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度学习模型在视觉识别中因语义子群体代表性不足而导致的系统性错误，并克服现有修复方法中分布偏移和语义错误的问题。

Method: 结合可解释的失败归因流程，使用条件文本到图像模型生成目标图像，并通过大型视觉语言模型（LVLM）过滤输出，确保数据分布和语义一致性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著减少了与罕见案例相关的错误，提升了模型的鲁棒性，且未引入新问题。

Conclusion: 提出的目标修复策略有效提升了视觉识别模型的性能，为系统性错误修复提供了新思路。

Abstract: Deep learning models for visual recognition often exhibit systematic errors
due to underrepresented semantic subpopulations. Although existing debugging
frameworks can pinpoint these failures by identifying key failure attributes,
repairing the model effectively remains difficult. Current solutions often rely
on manually designed prompts to generate synthetic training images -- an
approach prone to distribution shift and semantic errors. To overcome these
challenges, we introduce a model repair module that builds on an interpretable
failure attribution pipeline. Our approach uses a conditional text-to-image
model to generate semantically faithful and targeted images for failure cases.
To preserve the quality and relevance of the generated samples, we further
employ a large vision-language model (LVLM) to filter the outputs, enforcing
alignment with the original data distribution and maintaining semantic
consistency. By retraining vision models with this rare-case-augmented
synthetic dataset, we significantly reduce errors associated with rare cases.
Our experiments demonstrate that this targeted repair strategy improves model
robustness without introducing new bugs. Code is available at

### [32] [Adaptive Confidence-Wise Loss for Improved Lens Structure Segmentation in AS-OCT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08705)
*Zunjie Xiao,Xiao Wu,Tianhang Liu,Lingxi Hu,Yinling Zhang,Xiaoqing Zhang,Risa Higashita,Jiang Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应置信度损失（ACW）和边界预期校准误差（BECE）指标，用于提高眼内透镜结构分割的精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分割方法对所有像素平等加权，忽略了透镜子区域的不均匀性和边界区域的校准问题。临床专家注释时对不同子区域有不同置信度，这启发了ACW的设计。

Method: ACW通过置信度阈值将透镜子区域分为高低置信度组，并应用区域加权损失。同时设计了自适应置信度阈值优化算法和BECE指标。

Result: 在多个数据集上，ACW显著优于现有方法，如在U-Net下IoU提升6.13%，DSC增加4.33%，BECE降低4.79%。

Conclusion: ACW和BECE有效提升了透镜结构分割的精度和校准性能，适用于多种分割网络。

Abstract: Precise lens structure segmentation is essential for the design of
intraocular lenses (IOLs) in cataract surgery. Existing deep segmentation
networks typically weight all pixels equally under cross-entropy (CE) loss,
overlooking the fact that sub-regions of lens structures are inhomogeneous
(e.g., some regions perform better than others) and that boundary regions often
suffer from poor segmentation calibration at the pixel level. Clinically,
experts annotate different sub-regions of lens structures with varying
confidence levels, considering factors such as sub-region proportions,
ambiguous boundaries, and lens structure shapes. Motivated by this observation,
we propose an Adaptive Confidence-Wise (ACW) loss to group each lens structure
sub-region into different confidence sub-regions via a confidence threshold
from the unique region aspect, aiming to exploit the potential of expert
annotation confidence prior. Specifically, ACW clusters each target region into
low-confidence and high-confidence groups and then applies a region-weighted
loss to reweigh each confidence group. Moreover, we design an adaptive
confidence threshold optimization algorithm to adjust the confidence threshold
of ACW dynamically. Additionally, to better quantify the miscalibration errors
in boundary region segmentation, we propose a new metric, termed Boundary
Expected Calibration Error (BECE). Extensive experiments on a clinical lens
structure AS-OCT dataset and other multi-structure datasets demonstrate that
our ACW significantly outperforms competitive segmentation loss methods across
different deep segmentation networks (e.g., MedSAM). Notably, our method
surpasses CE with 6.13% IoU gain, 4.33% DSC increase, and 4.79% BECE reduction
in lens structure segmentation under U-Net. The code of this paper is available

TL;DR: 提出了一种模拟社交网络视频分享管道的框架，通过估计压缩和调整参数来生成平台特定的数据，以改进深度伪造检测器的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交网络上的AI生成视频对深度伪造检测提出新挑战，现有检测器在真实场景中泛化能力不足，主要原因是平台专有压缩破坏了低级取证线索。

Method: 提出框架，通过少量上传视频估计压缩和调整参数，模拟平台特定的人工痕迹，无需直接API访问即可生成大规模数据集。

Result: 实验表明，模拟数据与真实上传视频的退化模式高度匹配，基于模拟数据微调的检测器性能接近真实共享媒体训练的检测器。

Conclusion: 该方法为实验室训练与真实部署之间的差距提供了可扩展的解决方案，尤其在压缩视频内容领域具有实际意义。

Abstract: The growing presence of AI-generated videos on social networks poses new
challenges for deepfake detection, as detectors trained under controlled
conditions often fail to generalize to real-world scenarios. A key factor
behind this gap is the aggressive, proprietary compression applied by platforms
like YouTube and Facebook, which launder low-level forensic cues. However,
replicating these transformations at scale is difficult due to API limitations
and data-sharing constraints. For these reasons, we propose a first framework
that emulates the video sharing pipelines of social networks by estimating
compression and resizing parameters from a small set of uploaded videos. These
parameters enable a local emulator capable of reproducing platform-specific
artifacts on large datasets without direct API access. Experiments on
FaceForensics++ videos shared via social networks demonstrate that our emulated
data closely matches the degradation patterns of real uploads. Furthermore,
detectors fine-tuned on emulated videos achieve comparable performance to those
trained on actual shared media. Our approach offers a scalable and practical
solution for bridging the gap between lab-based training and real-world
deployment of deepfake detectors, particularly in the underexplored domain of
compressed video content.

TL;DR: ROOMELSA是一个新基准，用于评估系统在复杂场景中通过自然语言检索3D模型的能力，包含大量场景和查询数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中的3D检索更复杂，需要从杂乱场景和模糊描述中识别对象，现有系统对此能力不足。

Method: ROOMELSA通过全景房间图像中的特定区域和自然语言查询，从大型数据库中检索对应3D模型。

Result: 实验显示，粗粒度检索已解决，但细粒度检索仅一个模型表现优异；轻量级CLIP模型表现良好但存在材料、结构等细节错误。

Conclusion: ROOMELSA通过结合视觉与语言理解，为复杂场景的3D识别系统设立了新基准。

Abstract: Recent 3D retrieval systems are typically designed for simple, controlled
scenarios, such as identifying an object from a cropped image or a brief
description. However, real-world scenarios are more complex, often requiring
the recognition of an object in a cluttered scene based on a vague, free-form
description. To this end, we present ROOMELSA, a new benchmark designed to
evaluate a system's ability to interpret natural language. Specifically,
ROOMELSA attends to a specific region within a panoramic room image and
accurately retrieves the corresponding 3D model from a large database. In
addition, ROOMELSA includes over 1,600 apartment scenes, nearly 5,200 rooms,
and more than 44,000 targeted queries. Empirically, while coarse object
retrieval is largely solved, only one top-performing model consistently ranked
the correct match first across nearly all test cases. Notably, a lightweight
CLIP-based model also performed well, although it struggled with subtle
variations in materials, part structures, and contextual cues, resulting in
occasional errors. These findings highlight the importance of tightly
integrating visual and language understanding. By bridging the gap between
scene-level grounding and fine-grained 3D retrieval, ROOMELSA establishes a new
benchmark for advancing robust, real-world 3D recognition systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动物姿态估计在生态监测和行为分析中具有重要价值，但由于物种形态多样性和标注数据有限，传统方法面临挑战。

Method: 提出DiffPose-Animal框架，将姿态估计重新定义为扩散模型中的去噪过程，并利用语言模型提取解剖学先验，通过交叉注意力模块与图像特征融合。

Result: 在公开数据集上验证了方法的有效性，尤其在物种多样、背景复杂和关键点缺失的情况下表现优异。

Conclusion: DiffPose-Animal通过结合生成模型和语义先验，显著提升了动物姿态估计的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Animal pose estimation is a fundamental task in computer vision, with growing
importance in ecological monitoring, behavioral analysis, and intelligent
livestock management. Compared to human pose estimation, animal pose estimation
is more challenging due to high interspecies morphological diversity, complex
body structures, and limited annotated data. In this work, we introduce
DiffPose-Animal, a novel diffusion-based framework for top-down animal pose
estimation. Unlike traditional heatmap regression methods, DiffPose-Animal
reformulates pose estimation as a denoising process under the generative
framework of diffusion models. To enhance semantic guidance during keypoint
generation, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to extract both global
anatomical priors and local keypoint-wise semantics based on species-specific
prompts. These textual priors are encoded and fused with image features via
cross-attention modules to provide biologically meaningful constraints
throughout the denoising process. Additionally, a diffusion-based keypoint
decoder is designed to progressively refine pose predictions, improving
robustness to occlusion and annotation sparsity. Extensive experiments on
public animal pose datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization
capability of our method, especially under challenging scenarios with diverse
species, cluttered backgrounds, and incomplete keypoints.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于区域自适应的视频锐化模型RPO-AdaSharp，用于感知增强和比特率节省。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统均匀锐化强度忽略了纹理变化，降低了视频质量，同时增加了比特率，且缺乏优化比特分配的技术。

Method: 使用编码树单元（CTU）分区掩码作为先验信息，指导并约束增加的比特分配。

Result: 在基准测试中，模型在定性和定量上均表现出有效性。

Conclusion: RPO-AdaSharp是一种有效的端到端区域自适应视频锐化模型，兼顾感知增强和比特率优化。

Abstract: Sharpening is a widely adopted video enhancement technique. However, uniform
sharpening intensity ignores texture variations, degrading video quality.
Sharpening also increases bitrate, and there's a lack of techniques to
optimally allocate these additional bits across diverse regions. Thus, this
paper proposes RPO-AdaSharp, an end-to-end region-adaptive video sharpening
model for both perceptual enhancement and bitrate savings. We use the coding
tree unit (CTU) partition mask as prior information to guide and constrain the
allocation of increased bits. Experiments on benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed model qualitatively and quantitatively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在复杂姿态变化和遮挡恢复方面表现不佳，导致边界过渡不自然和遮挡区域重建不准确。

Method: 结合刚性和非刚性变形的双向变形模型，参数化表面-时间空间采样，部分姿态嵌入机制，以及关键帧姿态检索和插值。

Result: 在ZJU-MoCap和MonoCap数据集上显著优于现有方法，实现了更好的关节对齐、纹理保真和结构连续性。

Conclusion: MonoPartNeRF在单目动态人体渲染中表现出色，解决了复杂姿态和遮挡问题。

Abstract: In recent years, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have achieved remarkable
progress in dynamic human reconstruction and rendering. Part-based rendering
paradigms, guided by human segmentation, allow for flexible parameter
allocation based on structural complexity, thereby enhancing representational
efficiency. However, existing methods still struggle with complex pose
variations, often producing unnatural transitions at part boundaries and
failing to reconstruct occluded regions accurately in monocular settings. We
propose MonoPartNeRF, a novel framework for monocular dynamic human rendering
that ensures smooth transitions and robust occlusion recovery. First, we build
a bidirectional deformation model that combines rigid and non-rigid
transformations to establish a continuous, reversible mapping between
observation and canonical spaces. Sampling points are projected into a
parameterized surface-time space (u, v, t) to better capture non-rigid motion.
A consistency loss further suppresses deformation-induced artifacts and
discontinuities. We introduce a part-based pose embedding mechanism that
decomposes global pose vectors into local joint embeddings based on body
regions. This is combined with keyframe pose retrieval and interpolation, along
three orthogonal directions, to guide pose-aware feature sampling. A learnable
appearance code is integrated via attention to model dynamic texture changes
effectively. Experiments on the ZJU-MoCap and MonoCap datasets demonstrate that
our method significantly outperforms prior approaches under complex pose and
occlusion conditions, achieving superior joint alignment, texture fidelity, and
structural continuity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖复杂的条件生成模型，训练需求高且身份保留效果不佳，因此需要一种更简单且能保证身份一致性的方法。

Method: 利用StyleGAN2的潜在空间，通过支持向量建模和特征选择找到身份保留子空间，并估计年龄编辑参数的限制。

Result: 生成了一个公开数据集，可用于跨年龄人脸识别和合成图像检测的基准测试。

Conclusion: 该方法简单实用，能有效实现年龄编辑并保留身份，为相关领域提供了新的工具和数据支持。

Abstract: Face aging or de-aging with generative AI has gained significant attention
for its applications in such fields like forensics, security, and media.
However, most state of the art methods rely on conditional Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs), Diffusion-based models, or Visual Language Models
(VLMs) to age or de-age faces based on predefined age categories and
conditioning via loss functions, fine-tuning, or text prompts. The reliance on
such conditioning leads to complex training requirements, increased data needs,
and challenges in generating consistent results. Additionally, identity
preservation is rarely taken into accountor evaluated on a single face
recognition system without any control or guarantees on whether identity would
be preserved in a generated aged/de-aged face. In this paper, we propose to
synthesize aged and de-aged faces via editing latent space of StyleGAN2 using a
simple support vector modeling of aging/de-aging direction and several feature
selection approaches. By using two state-of-the-art face recognition systems,
we empirically find the identity preserving subspace within the StyleGAN2
latent space, so that an apparent age of a given face can changed while
preserving the identity. We then propose a simple yet practical formula for
estimating the limits on aging/de-aging parameters that ensures identity
preservation for a given input face. Using our method and estimated parameters
we have generated a public dataset of synthetic faces at different ages that
can be used for benchmarking cross-age face recognition, age assurance systems,
or systems for detection of synthetic images. Our code and dataset are
available at the project page https://www.idiap.ch/paper/agesynth/

<details>

Motivation: 现有轻量级语义分割方法通过逐像素分类范式实现实时推理，但该范式假设同一类别的像素特征在不同图像中不应变化，导致类别表示与图像特征不对齐。

Result: 在四个数据集（ADE20K、Cityscapes、COCO-Stuff-164K和Pascal Context）上的实验表明，该方法显著提升了性能，例如在ADE20K上，SegFormer-B0、SegNeXt-T和Mask2Former-Tiny的mIoU分别提高了2.7%、1.9%和2.6%，仅需0.1-0.2M额外参数。

Conclusion: 提出的偏移学习范式能有效解决类别表示与图像特征不对齐问题，且无需额外架构改动即可应用于现有方法，显著提升了轻量级语义分割的性能。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is fundamental to vision systems requiring pixel-level
scene understanding, yet deploying it on resource-constrained devices demands
efficient architectures. Although existing methods achieve real-time inference
through lightweight designs, we reveal their inherent limitation: misalignment
between class representations and image features caused by a per-pixel
classification paradigm. With experimental analysis, we find that this paradigm
results in a highly challenging assumption for efficient scenarios: Image pixel
features should not vary for the same category in different images. To address
this dilemma, we propose a coupled dual-branch offset learning paradigm that
explicitly learns feature and class offsets to dynamically refine both class
representations and spatial image features. Based on the proposed paradigm, we
construct an efficient semantic segmentation network, OffSeg. Notably, the
offset learning paradigm can be adopted to existing methods with no additional
architectural changes. Extensive experiments on four datasets, including
ADE20K, Cityscapes, COCO-Stuff-164K, and Pascal Context, demonstrate consistent
improvements with negligible parameters. For instance, on the ADE20K dataset,
our proposed offset learning paradigm improves SegFormer-B0, SegNeXt-T, and
Mask2Former-Tiny by 2.7%, 1.9%, and 2.6% mIoU, respectively, with only 0.1-0.2M
additional parameters required.

Motivation: 解决多概念LoRA模块组合中的身份丢失和视觉特征泄漏问题。

Method: 提出Token-Aware LoRA (TARA)，引入令牌掩码和训练目标，避免模块间干扰并确保空间对齐。

Result: TARA实现了无需训练的多概念组合，有效保留了每个概念的视觉身份。

Conclusion: TARA在多概念推理中表现出色，避免了模块间的相互干扰。

Abstract: Personalized text-to-image generation aims to synthesize novel images of a
specific subject or style using only a few reference images. Recent methods
based on Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) enable efficient single-concept
customization by injecting lightweight, concept-specific adapters into
pre-trained diffusion models. However, combining multiple LoRA modules for
multi-concept generation often leads to identity missing and visual feature
leakage. In this work, we identify two key issues behind these failures: (1)
token-wise interference among different LoRA modules, and (2) spatial
misalignment between the attention map of a rare token and its corresponding
concept-specific region. To address these issues, we propose Token-Aware LoRA
(TARA), which introduces a token mask to explicitly constrain each module to
focus on its associated rare token to avoid interference, and a training
objective that encourages the spatial attention of a rare token to align with
its concept region. Our method enables training-free multi-concept composition
by directly injecting multiple independently trained TARA modules at inference
time. Experimental results demonstrate that TARA enables efficient
multi-concept inference and effectively preserving the visual identity of each
concept by avoiding mutual interference between LoRA modules. The code and
models are available at https://github.com/YuqiPeng77/TARA.

Abstract: Recent Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong
capabilities in learning joint representations from text and images. However,
their spatial reasoning remains limited. We introduce 3DFroMLLM, a novel
framework that enables the generation of 3D object prototypes directly from
MLLMs, including geometry and part labels. Our pipeline is agentic, comprising
a designer, coder, and visual inspector operating in a refinement loop.
Notably, our approach requires no additional training data or detailed user
instructions. Building on prior work in 2D generation, we demonstrate that
rendered images produced by our framework can be effectively used for image
classification pretraining tasks and outperforms previous methods by 15%. As a
compelling real-world use case, we show that the generated prototypes can be
leveraged to improve fine-grained vision-language models by using the rendered,
part-labeled prototypes to fine-tune CLIP for part segmentation and achieving a
55% accuracy improvement without relying on any additional human-labeled data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像质量评估方法难以准确量化不同失真类型的影响，本文旨在通过ATR指标和两阶段系统解决这一问题。

Method: 提出ATR指标，利用两个可调阈值量化正交纹理抑制；设计两阶段系统，先分类主要失真类型（模糊或噪声），再通过回归模型量化质量。

Result: 在LIVE数据集上，ATR指标与人类感知的Spearman相关性达-0.93（模糊）和-0.95（噪声）；完整系统的R2为0.892，RMSE为5.17 DMOS点。

Conclusion: 该框架在图像质量分类与量化方面表现出高精度，为NR-IQA提供了一种有效的双用途工具。

Abstract: This work presents a novel framework for No-Reference Image Quality
Assessment (NR-IQA) founded on the analysis of directional image curvature.
Within this framework, we define a measure of Anisotropic Texture Richness
(ATR), which is computed at the pixel level using two tunable thresholds -- one
permissive and one restrictive -- that quantify orthogonal texture suppression.
When its parameters are optimized for a specific artifact, the resulting ATR
score serves as a high-performance quality metric, achieving Spearman
correlations with human perception of approximately -0.93 for Gaussian blur and
-0.95 for white noise on the LIVE dataset. The primary contribution is a
two-stage system that leverages the differential response of ATR to various
distortions. First, the system utilizes the signature from two specialist ATR
configurations to classify the primary artifact type (blur vs. noise) with over
97% accuracy. Second, following classification, it employs a dedicated
regression model mapping the relevant ATR score to a quality rating to quantify
the degradation. On a combined dataset, the complete system predicts human
scores with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.892 and a Root Mean Square
Error (RMSE) of 5.17 DMOS points. This error corresponds to just 7.4% of the
dataset's total quality range, demonstrating high predictive accuracy. This
establishes our framework as a robust, dual-purpose tool for the classification
and subsequent quantification of image degradation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于学习的自适应高频预处理框架，通过FFPN预测最佳预处理策略，优化视频编码的比特率与质量平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高频分量对视频清晰度和真实感至关重要，但会增加编码比特率，导致带宽和存储成本上升。

Method: 使用FFPN预测最佳高频预处理策略，并通过伪标签训练，比较不同预处理类型和强度的率失真性能。

Result: 在多数据集上的评估表明，该框架能显著提升视觉质量并节省比特率。

Conclusion: 该框架在视频编码中实现了比特率与主观质量的优化平衡。

Abstract: High-frequency components are crucial for maintaining video clarity and
realism, but they also significantly impact coding bitrate, resulting in
increased bandwidth and storage costs. This paper presents an end-to-end
learning-based framework for adaptive high-frequency preprocessing to enhance
subjective quality and save bitrate in video coding. The framework employs the
Frequency-attentive Feature pyramid Prediction Network (FFPN) to predict the
optimal high-frequency preprocessing strategy, guiding subsequent filtering
operators to achieve the optimal tradeoff between bitrate and quality after
compression. For training FFPN, we pseudo-label each training video with the
optimal strategy, determined by comparing the rate-distortion (RD) performance
across different preprocessing types and strengths. Distortion is measured
using the latest quality assessment metric. Comprehensive evaluations on
multiple datasets demonstrate the visually appealing enhancement capabilities
and bitrate savings achieved by our framework.

Abstract: Novel view synthesis with neural models has advanced rapidly in recent years,
yet adapting these models to scene changes remains an open problem. Existing
methods are either labor-intensive, requiring extensive model retraining, or
fail to capture detailed types of changes over time. In this paper, we present
GaussianUpdate, a novel approach that combines 3D Gaussian representation with
continual learning to address these challenges. Our method effectively updates
the Gaussian radiance fields with current data while preserving information
from past scenes. Unlike existing methods, GaussianUpdate explicitly models
different types of changes through a novel multi-stage update strategy.
Additionally, we introduce a visibility-aware continual learning approach with
generative replay, enabling self-aware updating without the need to store
images. The experiments on the benchmark dataset demonstrate our method
achieves superior and real-time rendering with the capability of visualizing
changes over different times

Abstract: Robust depth estimation in light field imaging remains a critical challenge
for pattern recognition applications such as augmented reality, biomedical
imaging, and scene reconstruction. While existing approaches often rely heavily
on deep convolutional neural networks, they tend to incur high computational
costs and struggle in noisy real-world environments. This paper proposes a
novel lightweight depth estimation pipeline that integrates light field-based
disparity information with a directed random walk refinement algorithm. Unlike
traditional CNN-based methods, our approach enhances depth map consistency
without requiring extensive training or large-scale datasets. The proposed
method was evaluated on the 4D Light Field Benchmark dataset and a diverse set
of real-world images. Experimental results indicate that while performance
slightly declines under uncontrolled conditions, the algorithm consistently
maintains low computational complexity and competitive accuracy compared to
state-of-the-art deep learning models. These findings highlight the potential
of our method as a robust and efficient alternative for depth estimation and
segmentation in light field imaging. The work provides insights into practical
algorithm design for light field-based pattern recognition and opens new
directions for integrating probabilistic graph models with depth sensing
frameworks.

Abstract: Vision transformers (ViTs) have recently been widely applied to 3D point
cloud understanding, with masked autoencoding as the predominant pre-training
paradigm. However, the challenge of learning dense and informative semantic
features from point clouds via standard ViTs remains underexplored. We propose
MaskClu, a novel unsupervised pre-training method for ViTs on 3D point clouds
that integrates masked point modeling with clustering-based learning. MaskClu
is designed to reconstruct both cluster assignments and cluster centers from
masked point clouds, thus encouraging the model to capture dense semantic
information. Additionally, we introduce a global contrastive learning mechanism
that enhances instance-level feature learning by contrasting different masked
views of the same point cloud. By jointly optimizing these complementary
objectives, i.e., dense semantic reconstruction, and instance-level contrastive
learning. MaskClu enables ViTs to learn richer and more semantically meaningful
representations from 3D point clouds. We validate the effectiveness of our
method via multiple 3D tasks, including part segmentation, semantic
segmentation, object detection, and classification, where MaskClu sets new
competitive results. The code and models will be released
at:https://github.com/Amazingren/maskclu.

Conclusion: 该流程实现了术后影像的自动化分割、分类和标准化报告生成，提升了临床决策效率，并整合到开源软件Raidionics中。

Abstract: Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is essential for evaluating central nervous
system (CNS) tumors, guiding surgical planning, treatment decisions, and
assessing postoperative outcomes and complication risks. While recent work has
advanced automated tumor segmentation and report generation, most efforts have
focused on preoperative data, with limited attention to postoperative imaging
analysis. This study introduces a comprehensive pipeline for standardized
postsurtical reporting in CNS tumors. Using the Attention U-Net architecture,
segmentation models were trained for the preoperative (non-enhancing) tumor
core, postoperative contrast-enhancing residual tumor, and resection cavity.
Additionally, MR sequence classification and tumor type identification for
contrast-enhancing lesions were explored using the DenseNet architecture. The
models were integrated into a reporting pipeline, following the RANO 2.0
guidelines. Training was conducted on multicentric datasets comprising 2000 to
7000 patients, using a 5-fold cross-validation. Evaluation included patient-,
voxel-, and object-wise metrics, with benchmarking against the latest BraTS
challenge results. The segmentation models achieved average voxel-wise Dice
scores of 87%, 66%, 70%, and 77% for the tumor core, non-enhancing tumor core,
contrast-enhancing residual tumor, and resection cavity, respectively.
Classification models reached 99.5% balanced accuracy in MR sequence
classification and 80% in tumor type classification. The pipeline presented in
this study enables robust, automated segmentation, MR sequence classification,
and standardized report generation aligned with RANO 2.0 guidelines, enhancing
postoperative evaluation and clinical decision-making. The proposed models and
methods were integrated into Raidionics, open-source software platform for CNS
tumor analysis, now including a dedicated module for postsurgical analysis.

Conclusion: 该方法通过几何建模和特征空间优化，显著提升了LiDAR地点识别的性能，尤其在复杂场景中表现突出。

Abstract: LiDAR-based Place Recognition (LPR) remains a critical task in Embodied
Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Autonomous Driving, primarily addressing
localization challenges in GPS-denied environments and supporting loop closure
detection. Existing approaches reduce place recognition to a Euclidean
distance-based metric learning task, neglecting the feature space's intrinsic
structures and intra-class variances. Such Euclidean-centric formulation
inherently limits the model's capacity to capture nonlinear data distributions,
leading to suboptimal performance in complex environments and temporal-varying
scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a novel cross-view network
based on an innovative fusion paradigm. Our framework introduces a
pseudo-global information guidance mechanism that coordinates multi-modal
branches to perform feature learning within a unified semantic space.
Concurrently, we propose a Manifold Adaptation and Pairwise Variance-Locality
Learning Metric that constructs a Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) matrix to
compute Mahalanobis distance, superseding traditional Euclidean distance
metrics. This geometric formulation enables the model to accurately
characterize intrinsic data distributions and capture complex inter-class
dependencies within the feature space. Experimental results demonstrate that
the proposed algorithm achieves competitive performance, particularly excelling
in complex environmental conditions.

Conclusion: 该系统提高了脊柱成像的一致性、可重复性和解剖理解，为手术导航提供了新工具。

Abstract: Ultrasound (US) imaging is increasingly used in spinal procedures due to its
real-time, radiation-free capabilities; however, its effectiveness is hindered
by shadowing artifacts that obscure deeper tissue structures. Traditional
approaches, such as CT-to-US registration, incorporate anatomical information
from preoperative CT scans to guide interventions, but they are limited by
complex registration requirements, differences in spine curvature, and the need
for recent CT imaging. Recent shape completion methods can offer an alternative
by reconstructing spinal structures in US data, while being pretrained on large
set of publicly available CT scans. However, these approaches are typically
offline and have limited reproducibility. In this work, we introduce a novel
integrated system that combines robotic ultrasound with real-time shape
completion to enhance spinal visualization. Our robotic platform autonomously
acquires US sweeps of the lumbar spine, extracts vertebral surfaces from
ultrasound, and reconstructs the complete anatomy using a deep learning-based
shape completion network. This framework provides interactive, real-time
visualization with the capability to autonomously repeat scans and can enable
navigation to target locations. This can contribute to better consistency,
reproducibility, and understanding of the underlying anatomy. We validate our
approach through quantitative experiments assessing shape completion accuracy
and evaluations of multiple spine acquisition protocols on a phantom setup.
Additionally, we present qualitative results of the visualization on a
volunteer scan.

Result: 稀疏训练将训练时间减少63.7%，PSNR仅下降0.59 dB，SSIM下降0.008，压缩率达到14。

Conclusion: 该方法为体数据压缩提供了高效、无结构的解决方案，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Volumetric data compression is critical in fields like medical imaging,
scientific simulation, and entertainment. We introduce a structure-free neural
compression method combining Fourierfeature encoding with selective voxel
sampling, yielding compact volumetric representations and faster convergence.
Our dynamic voxel selection uses morphological dilation to prioritize active
regions, reducing redundant computation without any hierarchical metadata. In
the experiment, sparse training reduced training time by 63.7 % (from 30 to 11
minutes) with only minor quality loss: PSNR dropped 0.59 dB (from 32.60 to
32.01) and SSIM by 0.008 (from 0.948 to 0.940). The resulting neural
representation, stored solely as network weights, achieves a compression rate
of 14 and eliminates traditional data-loading overhead. This connects
coordinate-based neural representation with efficient volumetric compression,
offering a scalable, structure-free solution for practical applications.

Conclusion: 无需微调的基础模型结合提示工程可有效解决MAD问题，展示了其通用部署潜力。

Abstract: Face Morphing Attack Detection (MAD) is a critical challenge in face
recognition security, where attackers can fool systems by interpolating the
identity information of two or more individuals into a single face image,
resulting in samples that can be verified as belonging to multiple identities
by face recognition systems. While multimodal foundation models (FMs) like CLIP
offer strong zero-shot capabilities by jointly modeling images and text, most
prior works on FMs for biometric recognition have relied on fine-tuning for
specific downstream tasks, neglecting their potential for direct, generalizable
deployment. This work explores a pure zero-shot approach to MAD by leveraging
CLIP without any additional training or fine-tuning, focusing instead on the
design and aggregation of multiple textual prompts per class. By aggregating
the embeddings of diverse prompts, we better align the model's internal
representations with the MAD task, capturing richer and more varied cues
indicative of bona-fide or attack samples. Our results show that prompt
aggregation substantially improves zero-shot detection performance,
demonstrating the effectiveness of exploiting foundation models' built-in
multimodal knowledge through efficient prompt engineering.

Abstract: Skeleton-based action recognition (SAR) has achieved impressive progress with
transformer architectures. However, existing methods often rely on complex
module compositions and heavy designs, leading to increased parameter counts,
high computational costs, and limited scalability. In this paper, we propose a
unified spatio-temporal lightweight transformer framework that integrates
spatial and temporal modeling within a single attention module, eliminating the
need for separate temporal modeling blocks. This approach reduces redundant
computations while preserving temporal awareness within the spatial modeling
process. Furthermore, we introduce a simplified multi-scale pooling fusion
module that combines local and global pooling pathways to enhance the model's
ability to capture fine-grained local movements and overarching global motion
patterns. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our
lightweight model achieves a superior balance between accuracy and efficiency,
reducing parameter complexity by over 58% and lowering computational cost by
over 60% compared to state-of-the-art transformer-based baselines, while
maintaining competitive recognition performance.

Abstract: Storytelling tasks involving generating consistent subjects have gained
significant attention recently. However, existing methods, whether
training-free or training-based, continue to face challenges in maintaining
subject consistency due to the lack of fine-grained guidance and inter-frame
interaction. Additionally, the scarcity of high-quality data in this field
makes it difficult to precisely control storytelling tasks, including the
subject's position, appearance, clothing, expression, and posture, thereby
hindering further advancements. In this paper, we demonstrate that layout
conditions, such as the subject's position and detailed attributes, effectively
facilitate fine-grained interactions between frames. This not only strengthens
the consistency of the generated frame sequence but also allows for precise
control over the subject's position, appearance, and other key details.
Building on this, we introduce an advanced storytelling task: Layout-Togglable
Storytelling, which enables precise subject control by incorporating layout
conditions. To address the lack of high-quality datasets with layout
annotations for this task, we develop Lay2Story-1M, which contains over 1
million 720p and higher-resolution images, processed from approximately 11,300
hours of cartoon videos. Building on Lay2Story-1M, we create Lay2Story-Bench, a
benchmark with 3,000 prompts designed to evaluate the performance of different
methods on this task. Furthermore, we propose Lay2Story, a robust framework
based on the Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) architecture for Layout-Togglable
Storytelling tasks. Through both qualitative and quantitative experiments, we
find that our method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA)
techniques, achieving the best results in terms of consistency, semantic
correlation, and aesthetic quality.

Result: 实验表明TCSSM在性能上优于现有先进模型。

Conclusion: TCSSM和BrightVQA数据集为CDVQA的领域泛化研究提供了有效工具。

Abstract: The Earth's surface is constantly changing, and detecting these changes
provides valuable insights that benefit various aspects of human society. While
traditional change detection methods have been employed to detect changes from
bi-temporal images, these approaches typically require expert knowledge for
accurate interpretation. To enable broader and more flexible access to change
information by non-expert users, the task of Change Detection Visual Question
Answering (CDVQA) has been introduced. However, existing CDVQA methods have
been developed under the assumption that training and testing datasets share
similar distributions. This assumption does not hold in real-world
applications, where domain shifts often occur. In this paper, the CDVQA task is
revisited with a focus on addressing domain shift. To this end, a new
multi-modal and multi-domain dataset, BrightVQA, is introduced to facilitate
domain generalization research in CDVQA. Furthermore, a novel state space
model, termed Text-Conditioned State Space Model (TCSSM), is proposed. The
TCSSM framework is designed to leverage both bi-temporal imagery and
geo-disaster-related textual information in an unified manner to extract
domain-invariant features across domains. Input-dependent parameters existing
in TCSSM are dynamically predicted by using both bi-temporal images and
geo-disaster-related description, thereby facilitating the alignment between
bi-temporal visual data and the associated textual descriptions. Extensive
experiments are conducted to evaluate the proposed method against
state-of-the-art models, and superior performance is consistently demonstrated.
The code and dataset will be made publicly available upon acceptance at

Result: 在多个数据集上，TaoCache在相同加速下比现有方法具有更高的视觉质量（LPIPS、SSIM、PSNR）。

Conclusion: TaoCache是一种高效且兼容性强的缓存策略，显著提升视频扩散模型的生成质量。

Abstract: Existing cache-based acceleration methods for video diffusion models
primarily skip early or mid denoising steps, which often leads to structural
discrepancies relative to full-timestep generation and can hinder instruction
following and character consistency. We present TaoCache, a training-free,
plug-and-play caching strategy that, instead of residual-based caching, adopts
a fixed-point perspective to predict the model's noise output and is
specifically effective in late denoising stages. By calibrating cosine
similarities and norm ratios of consecutive noise deltas, TaoCache preserves
high-resolution structure while enabling aggressive skipping. The approach is
orthogonal to complementary accelerations such as Pyramid Attention Broadcast
(PAB) and TeaCache, and it integrates seamlessly into DiT-based frameworks.
Across Latte-1, OpenSora-Plan v110, and Wan2.1, TaoCache attains substantially
higher visual quality (LPIPS, SSIM, PSNR) than prior caching methods under the
same speedups.

suggesting appropriate colors to complete or refine a design when one or more
colors are missing or require alteration. Traditional methods often struggled
with these challenges due to the complex nature of color design and the limited
data availability. In this study, we explored the use of pretrained Large
Language Models (LLMs) and their commonsense reasoning capabilities for color
recommendation, raising the question: Can pretrained LLMs serve as superior
designers for color recommendation tasks? To investigate this, we developed a
robust, rigorously validated pipeline, ColorGPT, that was built by
systematically testing multiple color representations and applying effective
prompt engineering techniques. Our approach primarily targeted color palette
completion by recommending colors based on a set of given colors and
accompanying context. Moreover, our method can be extended to full palette
generation, producing an entire color palette corresponding to a provided
textual description. Experimental results demonstrated that our LLM-based
pipeline outperformed existing methods in terms of color suggestion accuracy
and the distribution of colors in the color palette completion task. For the
full palette generation task, our approach also yielded improvements in color
diversity and similarity compared to current techniques.

*Ming Nie,Chunwei Wang,Hang Xu,Li Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: KFFocus提出了一种高效压缩视频标记并突出关键帧信息的方法，显著提升了视频LLMs的计算效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频LLMs采用均匀采样和压缩策略，可能忽略关键帧信息，导致语义和时间细节丢失。

Method: KFFocus通过基于时间冗余的关键帧识别和动态压缩比分配，结合时空建模模块，优化视频标记压缩。

Result: 在长视频场景的基准测试中，KFFocus显著优于现有方法，提高了计算效率和准确性。

Conclusion: KFFocus为视频LLMs提供了一种高效且保留关键信息的压缩方法，适用于复杂视频理解任务。

Abstract: Recently, with the emergence of large language models, multimodal LLMs have
demonstrated exceptional capabilities in image and video modalities. Despite
advancements in video comprehension, the substantial computational demands of
long video sequences lead current video LLMs (Vid-LLMs) to employ compression
strategies at both the inter-frame level (e.g., uniform sampling of video
frames) and intra-frame level (e.g., condensing all visual tokens of each frame
into a limited number). However, this approach often neglects the uneven
temporal distribution of critical information across frames, risking the
omission of keyframes that contain essential temporal and semantic details. To
tackle these challenges, we propose KFFocus, a method designed to efficiently
compress video tokens and emphasize the informative context present within
video frames. We substitute uniform sampling with a refined approach inspired
by classic video compression principles to identify and capture keyframes based
on their temporal redundancy. By assigning varying condensation ratios to
frames based on their contextual relevance, KFFocus efficiently reduces token
redundancy while preserving informative content details. Additionally, we
introduce a spatiotemporal modeling module that encodes both the temporal
relationships between video frames and the spatial structure within each frame,
thus providing Vid-LLMs with a nuanced understanding of spatial-temporal
dynamics. Extensive experiments on widely recognized video understanding
benchmarks, especially long video scenarios, demonstrate that KFFocus
significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving substantial computational
efficiency and enhanced accuracy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种多尺度量化方法MSQ，用于解决现有运动表示在复杂模式建模和组合灵活性方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的运动表示方法无法从多尺度捕捉运动，且缺乏组合灵活性，限制了其在复杂任务中的泛化能力。

Method: MSQ通过多尺度离散化空间和时间维度的运动序列，使用不同编码器捕捉空间粒度的身体部分，并在时间维度插值后量化。基于此表示，构建生成掩码模型支持运动编辑、控制和条件生成。

Result: MSQ无需专门设计或重新训练即可无缝组合运动标记，且在多个基准测试中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MSQ为运动生成提供了更灵活和高效的多尺度表示，显著提升了复杂任务的性能。

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in human motion generation, current motion
representations, typically formulated as discrete frame sequences, still face
two critical limitations: (i) they fail to capture motion from a multi-scale
perspective, limiting the capability in complex patterns modeling; (ii) they
lack compositional flexibility, which is crucial for model's generalization in
diverse generation tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce MSQ, a
novel quantization method that compresses the motion sequence into multi-scale
discrete tokens across spatial and temporal dimensions. MSQ employs distinct
encoders to capture body parts at varying spatial granularities and temporally
interpolates the encoded features into multiple scales before quantizing them
into discrete tokens. Building on this representation, we establish a
generative mask modeling model to effectively support motion editing, motion
control, and conditional motion generation. Through quantitative and
qualitative analysis, we show that our quantization method enables the seamless
composition of motion tokens without requiring specialized design or
re-training. Furthermore, extensive evaluations demonstrate that our approach
outperforms existing baseline methods on various benchmarks.

Motivation: 传统大核卷积网络（ConvNets）虽然有效感受野大，但存在高参数和计算成本问题，且会破坏ERF的渐近高斯分布。

Method: 通过组合小核扩展ERF并保持AGD，设计了Three-layer Receptive Field Aggregator和Layer Operator，构建了通用模型UniConvNet。

Result: UniConvNet在ImageNet-1K、COCO2017和ADE20K上表现优于现有CNN和ViT，UniConvNet-T达到84.2% top-1准确率（30M参数，5.1G FLOPs），UniConvNet-XL达到88.4%。

Conclusion: UniConvNet通过高效扩展ERF并保持AGD，在性能和效率上均优于现有方法，展示了通用性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) with large effective receptive field
(ERF), still in their early stages, have demonstrated promising effectiveness
while constrained by high parameters and FLOPs costs and disrupted
asymptotically Gaussian distribution (AGD) of ERF. This paper proposes an
alternative paradigm: rather than merely employing extremely large ERF, it is
more effective and efficient to expand the ERF while maintaining AGD of ERF by
proper combination of smaller kernels, such as $7\times{7}$, $9\times{9}$,
$11\times{11}$. This paper introduces a Three-layer Receptive Field Aggregator
and designs a Layer Operator as the fundamental operator from the perspective
of receptive field. The ERF can be expanded to the level of existing
large-kernel ConvNets through the stack of proposed modules while maintaining
AGD of ERF. Using these designs, we propose a universal model for ConvNet of
any scale, termed UniConvNet. Extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K, COCO2017,
and ADE20K demonstrate that UniConvNet outperforms state-of-the-art CNNs and
ViTs across various vision recognition tasks for both lightweight and
large-scale models with comparable throughput. Surprisingly, UniConvNet-T
achieves $84.2\%$ ImageNet top-1 accuracy with $30M$ parameters and $5.1G$
FLOPs. UniConvNet-XL also shows competitive scalability to big data and large
models, acquiring $88.4\%$ top-1 accuracy on ImageNet. Code and models are

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的Inter-correction Retinex模型（IRetinex），通过减少分解和增强阶段的互分量残差（ICR）来提升低光图像增强效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Retinex深度学习方法在分解图像为光照和反射分量时存在互分量残差（ICR），影响分解精度和最终图像质量。

Method: 在分解阶段引入互分量残差减少模块，降低光照和反射分量的特征相似性；在增强阶段利用特征相似性检测和减轻ICR的影响。

Result: 在三个低光基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法在定性和定量上均优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 通过减少ICR，IRetinex显著提升了低光图像增强的效果。

Abstract: In low-light image enhancement, Retinex-based deep learning methods have
garnered significant attention due to their exceptional interpretability. These
methods decompose images into mutually independent illumination and reflectance
components, allows each component to be enhanced separately. In fact, achieving
perfect decomposition of illumination and reflectance components proves to be
quite challenging, with some residuals still existing after decomposition. In
this paper, we formally name these residuals as inter-component residuals
(ICR), which has been largely underestimated by previous methods. In our
investigation, ICR not only affects the accuracy of the decomposition but also
causes enhanced components to deviate from the ideal outcome, ultimately
reducing the final synthesized image quality. To address this issue, we propose
a novel Inter-correction Retinex model (IRetinex) to alleviate ICR during the
decomposition and enhancement stage. In the decomposition stage, we leverage
inter-component residual reduction module to reduce the feature similarity
between illumination and reflectance components. In the enhancement stage, we
utilize the feature similarity between the two components to detect and
mitigate the impact of ICR within each enhancement unit. Extensive experiments
on three low-light benchmark datasets demonstrated that by reducing ICR, our
method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches both qualitatively and
quantitatively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有半监督方法过度依赖学生模型和忽略认知偏差的问题，以及生成高置信度伪标签的挑战。

Method: 提出UC-Seg框架，包含交叉子网一致性保护策略和不确定性感知伪标签生成组件。

Result: 在多种医学图像模态上验证，UC-Seg优于现有半监督方法。

Conclusion: UC-Seg能有效提升分割精度和泛化性能，代码已开源。

Abstract: Semi-supervised learning has gained considerable popularity in medical image
segmentation tasks due to its capability to reduce reliance on expert-examined
annotations. Several mean-teacher (MT) based semi-supervised methods utilize
consistency regularization to effectively leverage valuable information from
unlabeled data. However, these methods often heavily rely on the student model
and overlook the potential impact of cognitive biases within the model.
Furthermore, some methods employ co-training using pseudo-labels derived from
different inputs, yet generating high-confidence pseudo-labels from perturbed
inputs during training remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we
propose an Uncertainty-aware Cross-training framework for semi-supervised
medical image Segmentation (UC-Seg). Our UC-Seg framework incorporates two
distinct subnets to effectively explore and leverage the correlation between
them, thereby mitigating cognitive biases within the model. Specifically, we
present a Cross-subnet Consistency Preservation (CCP) strategy to enhance
feature representation capability and ensure feature consistency across the two
subnets. This strategy enables each subnet to correct its own biases and learn
shared semantics from both labeled and unlabeled data. Additionally, we propose
an Uncertainty-aware Pseudo-label Generation (UPG) component that leverages
segmentation results and corresponding uncertainty maps from both subnets to
generate high-confidence pseudo-labels. We extensively evaluate the proposed
UC-Seg on various medical image segmentation tasks involving different modality
images, such as MRI, CT, ultrasound, colonoscopy, and so on. The results
demonstrate that our method achieves superior segmentation accuracy and
generalization performance compared to other state-of-the-art semi-supervised
methods. Our code will be released at https://github.com/taozh2017/UCSeg.

Motivation: 随着AI生成内容越来越逼真，人工标注变得耗时且不可靠，亟需能有效利用大规模未标记数据的方法。

Method: DPGNet包含文本引导的跨域对齐和课程驱动的伪标签生成模块，结合跨域知识蒸馏防止灾难性遗忘。

Result: 在11个数据集上，DPGNet比现有方法性能提升6.3%，证明了其有效性。

Conclusion: DPGNet通过利用未标记数据和跨域对齐，成功解决了深度伪造检测中的标注和域差异挑战。

Abstract: Existing deepfake detection methods heavily depend on labeled training data.
However, as AI-generated content becomes increasingly realistic, even
\textbf{human annotators struggle to distinguish} between deepfakes and
authentic images. This makes the labeling process both time-consuming and less
reliable. Specifically, there is a growing demand for approaches that can
effectively utilize large-scale unlabeled data from online social networks.
Unlike typical unsupervised learning tasks, where categories are distinct,
AI-generated faces closely mimic real image distributions and share strong
similarities, causing performance drop in conventional strategies. In this
paper, we introduce the Dual-Path Guidance Network (DPGNet), to tackle two key
challenges: (1) bridging the domain gap between faces from different generation
models, and (2) utilizing unlabeled image samples. The method features two core
modules: text-guided cross-domain alignment, which uses learnable prompts to
unify visual and textual embeddings into a domain-invariant feature space, and
curriculum-driven pseudo label generation, which dynamically exploit more
informative unlabeled samples. To prevent catastrophic forgetting, we also
facilitate bridging between domains via cross-domain knowledge distillation.
Extensive experiments on \textbf{11 popular datasets}, show that DPGNet
outperforms SoTA approaches by \textbf{6.3\%}, highlighting its effectiveness
in leveraging unlabeled data to address the annotation challenges posed by the
increasing realism of deepfakes.

Result: 在SimplerEnv实验中，任务完成率比SpatialVLA提高了4%，比TraceVLA提高了19%。

Conclusion: 该方法在数据稀缺的实际应用中具有显著优势，且效果显著。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
predicting agent movements within virtual environments and real-world scenarios
based on visual observations and textual instructions. Although recent research
has focused on enhancing spatial and temporal understanding independently, this
paper presents a novel approach that integrates both aspects through visual
prompting. We introduce a method that projects visual traces of key points from
observations onto depth maps, enabling models to capture both spatial and
temporal information simultaneously. The experiments in SimplerEnv show that
the mean number of tasks successfully solved increased for 4% compared to
SpatialVLA and 19% compared to TraceVLA. Furthermore, we show that this
enhancement can be achieved with minimal training data, making it particularly
valuable for real-world applications where data collection is challenging. The

Abstract: Visual concept learning, also known as Text-to-image personalization, is the
process of teaching new concepts to a pretrained model. This has numerous
applications from product placement to entertainment and personalized design.
Here we show that many existing methods can be substantially augmented by
adding a personalization step that is (1) specific to the prompt and noise
seed, and (2) using two loss terms based on the self- and cross- attention,
capturing the identity of the personalized concept. Specifically, we leverage
PDM features -- previously designed to capture identity -- and show how they
can be used to improve personalized semantic similarity. We evaluate the
benefit that our method gains on top of six different personalization methods,
and several base text-to-image models (both UNet- and DiT-based). We find
significant improvements even over previous per-query personalization methods.

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法在模拟真实场景中取得了68.91的EBI（Q3），证明了其有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了视频异常检测在动态环境中的适用性。

Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) can play a key role in spotting unusual
activities in video footage. VAD is difficult to use in real-world settings due
to the dynamic nature of human actions, environmental variations, and domain
shifts. Traditional evaluation metrics often prove inadequate for such
scenarios, as they rely on static assumptions and fall short of identifying a
threshold that distinguishes normal from anomalous behavior in dynamic
settings. To address this, we introduce an active learning framework tailored
for VAD, designed for adapting to the ever-changing real-world conditions. Our
approach leverages active learning to continuously select the most informative
data points for labeling, thereby enhancing model adaptability. A critical
innovation is the incorporation of a human-in-the-loop mechanism, which enables
the identification of actual normal and anomalous instances from
pseudo-labeling results generated by AI. This collected data allows the
framework to define an adaptive threshold tailored to different environments,
ensuring that the system remains effective as the definition of 'normal' shifts
across various settings. Implemented within a lab-based framework that
simulates real-world conditions, our approach allows rigorous testing and
refinement of VAD algorithms with a new metric. Experimental results show that
our method achieves an EBI (Error Balance Index) of 68.91 for Q3 in real-world
simulated scenarios, demonstrating its practical effectiveness and
significantly enhancing the applicability of VAD in dynamic environments.

Method: 提出VLM-3D框架，结合低秩适应（LoRA）和联合语义几何损失设计，包括早期训练的语义损失和后期训练的3D IoU损失。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上，VLM-3D的感知精度提升了12.8%。

Conclusion: VLM-3D通过端到端设计和联合损失优化，显著提升了自动驾驶场景中的3D感知能力。

Abstract: Open-set perception in complex traffic environments poses a critical
challenge for autonomous driving systems, particularly in identifying
previously unseen object categories, which is vital for ensuring safety. Visual
Language Models (VLMs), with their rich world knowledge and strong semantic
reasoning capabilities, offer new possibilities for addressing this task.
However, existing approaches typically leverage VLMs to extract visual features
and couple them with traditional object detectors, resulting in multi-stage
error propagation that hinders perception accuracy. To overcome this
limitation, we propose VLM-3D, the first end-to-end framework that enables VLMs
to perform 3D geometric perception in autonomous driving scenarios. VLM-3D
incorporates Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to efficiently adapt VLMs to driving
tasks with minimal computational overhead, and introduces a joint
semantic-geometric loss design: token-level semantic loss is applied during
early training to ensure stable convergence, while 3D IoU loss is introduced in
later stages to refine the accuracy of 3D bounding box predictions. Evaluations
on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that the proposed joint semantic-geometric
loss in VLM-3D leads to a 12.8% improvement in perception accuracy, fully
validating the effectiveness and advancement of our method.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) highlight a strong connection
between intelligence and compression. Learned image compression, a fundamental
task in modern data compression, has made significant progress in recent years.
However, current models remain limited in scale, restricting their
representation capacity, and how scaling model size influences compression
performance remains unexplored. In this work, we present a pioneering study on
scaling up learned image compression models and revealing the performance
trends through scaling laws. Using the recent state-of-the-art HPCM model as
baseline, we scale model parameters from 68.5 millions to 1 billion and fit
power-law relations between test loss and key scaling variables, including
model size and optimal training compute. The results reveal a scaling trend,
enabling extrapolation to larger scale models. Experimental results demonstrate
that the scaled-up HPCM-1B model achieves state-of-the-art rate-distortion
performance. We hope this work inspires future exploration of large-scale
compression models and deeper investigations into the connection between
compression and intelligence.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable success on multimodal
tasks such as image-text retrieval and zero-shot classification, yet they can
exhibit demographic biases even when explicit protected attributes are absent
during training. In this work, we focus on automated glaucoma screening from
retinal fundus images, a critical application given that glaucoma is a leading
cause of irreversible blindness and disproportionately affects underserved
populations. Building on a reweighting-based contrastive learning framework, we
introduce an attribute-agnostic debiasing method that (i) infers proxy
subgroups via unsupervised clustering of image-image embeddings, (ii) computes
gradient-similarity weights between the CLIP-style multimodal loss and a
SimCLR-style image-pair contrastive loss, and (iii) applies these weights in a
joint, top-$k$ weighted objective to upweight underperforming clusters. This
label-free approach adaptively targets the hardest examples, thereby reducing
subgroup disparities. We evaluate our method on the Harvard FairVLMed glaucoma
subset, reporting Equalized Odds Distance (EOD), Equalized Subgroup AUC (ES
AUC), and Groupwise AUC to demonstrate equitable performance across inferred
demographic subgroups.

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving landscape of digital security, biometric
authentication systems, particularly facial recognition, have emerged as
integral components of various security protocols. However, the reliability of
these systems is compromised by sophisticated spoofing attacks, where imposters
gain unauthorized access by falsifying biometric traits. Current literature
reveals a concerning gap: existing liveness detection methodologies - designed
to counteract these breaches - fall short against advanced spoofing tactics
employing deepfakes and other artificial intelligence-driven manipulations.
This study introduces a robust solution through novel deep learning models
addressing the deficiencies in contemporary anti-spoofing techniques. By
innovatively integrating texture analysis and reflective properties associated
with genuine human traits, our models distinguish authentic presence from
replicas with remarkable precision. Extensive evaluations were conducted across
five diverse datasets, encompassing a wide range of attack vectors and
environmental conditions. Results demonstrate substantial advancement over
existing systems, with our best model (AttackNet V2.2) achieving 99.9% average
accuracy when trained on combined data. Moreover, our research unveils critical
insights into the behavioral patterns of impostor attacks, contributing to a
more nuanced understanding of their evolving nature. The implications are
profound: our models do not merely fortify the authentication processes but
also instill confidence in biometric systems across various sectors reliant on
secure access.

Conclusion: Turbo-VAED首次实现移动设备上实时720p视频VAE解码，适用于大多数视频VAE，训练成本低至95美元，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: There is a growing demand for deploying large generative AI models on mobile
devices. For recent popular video generative models, however, the Variational
AutoEncoder (VAE) represents one of the major computational bottlenecks. Both
large parameter sizes and mismatched kernels cause out-of-memory errors or
extremely slow inference on mobile devices. To address this, we propose a
low-cost solution that efficiently transfers widely used video VAEs to mobile
devices. (1) We analyze redundancy in existing VAE architectures and get
empirical design insights. By integrating 3D depthwise separable convolutions
into our model, we significantly reduce the number of parameters. (2) We
observe that the upsampling techniques in mainstream video VAEs are poorly
suited to mobile hardware and form the main bottleneck. In response, we propose
a decoupled 3D pixel shuffle scheme that slashes end-to-end delay. Building
upon these, we develop a universal mobile-oriented VAE decoder, Turbo-VAED. (3)
We propose an efficient VAE decoder training method. Since only the decoder is
used during deployment, we distill it to Turbo-VAED instead of retraining the
full VAE, enabling fast mobile adaptation with minimal performance loss. To our
knowledge, our method enables real-time 720p video VAE decoding on mobile
devices for the first time. This approach is widely applicable to most video
VAEs. When integrated into four representative models, with training cost as
low as $95, it accelerates original VAEs by up to 84.5x at 720p resolution on
GPUs, uses as low as 17.5% of original parameter count, and retains 96.9% of
the original reconstruction quality. Compared to mobile-optimized VAEs,
Turbo-VAED achieves a 2.9x speedup in FPS and better reconstruction quality on
the iPhone 16 Pro. The code and models will soon be available at
https://github.com/hustvl/Turbo-VAED.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了HumanOLAT数据集，首个公开的大规模多视角单光源（OLAT）全身人体捕捉数据集，用于解决数字人体渲染中的重光照和新视角合成问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有公开数据集缺乏高质量全身人体捕捉数据，限制了数字人体重光照和新视角渲染的研究进展。

Method: 提出HumanOLAT数据集，包含多视角OLAT捕捉的HDR RGB帧，涵盖多种光照条件（白光、环境光、颜色渐变等）。

Result: 评估表明，现有重光照和新视角合成方法仍面临复杂人体外观与光照交互建模的挑战。

Conclusion: HumanOLAT将促进未来研究，为通用和人体特定的重光照与渲染技术提供基准。

Abstract: Simultaneous relighting and novel-view rendering of digital human
representations is an important yet challenging task with numerous
applications. Progress in this area has been significantly limited due to the
lack of publicly available, high-quality datasets, especially for full-body
human captures. To address this critical gap, we introduce the HumanOLAT
dataset, the first publicly accessible large-scale dataset of multi-view
One-Light-at-a-Time (OLAT) captures of full-body humans. The dataset includes
HDR RGB frames under various illuminations, such as white light, environment
maps, color gradients and fine-grained OLAT illuminations. Our evaluations of
state-of-the-art relighting and novel-view synthesis methods underscore both
the dataset's value and the significant challenges still present in modeling
complex human-centric appearance and lighting interactions. We believe
HumanOLAT will significantly facilitate future research, enabling rigorous
benchmarking and advancements in both general and human-specific relighting and
rendering techniques.

### [73] [Argument Quality Annotation and Gender Bias Detection in Financial Communication through Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08262)
*Alaa Alhamzeh,Mays Al Rebdawi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究评估了GPT-4o、Llama 3.1和Gemma 2三种LLM在金融沟通中标注论据质量的能力，发现其一致性优于人类标注，但仍存在性别偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金融论据质量评估在文献中研究不足，影响投资决策和公众信任。

Method: 使用FinArgQuality数据集，评估LLM标注的稳定性和对抗性攻击下的性别偏见。

Result: LLM标注一致性高于人类，但存在性别偏见，温度设置影响标注稳定性。

Conclusion: 研究为未来开发更可靠、经济、无偏见的标注方法提供了建议。

Abstract: Financial arguments play a critical role in shaping investment decisions and
public trust in financial institutions. Nevertheless, assessing their quality
remains poorly studied in the literature. In this paper, we examine the
capabilities of three state-of-the-art LLMs GPT-4o, Llama 3.1, and Gemma 2 in
annotating argument quality within financial communications, using the
FinArgQuality dataset. Our contributions are twofold. First, we evaluate the
consistency of LLM-generated annotations across multiple runs and benchmark
them against human annotations. Second, we introduce an adversarial attack
designed to inject gender bias to analyse models responds and ensure model's
fairness and robustness. Both experiments are conducted across three
temperature settings to assess their influence on annotation stability and
alignment with human labels. Our findings reveal that LLM-based annotations
achieve higher inter-annotator agreement than human counterparts, though the
models still exhibit varying degrees of gender bias. We provide a multifaceted
analysis of these outcomes and offer practical recommendations to guide future
research toward more reliable, cost-effective, and bias-aware annotation
methodologies.

*Tarık Saraç,Selin Mergen,Mucahid Kutlu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新颖的‘委员会辩论’方法，利用多个大型语言模型（LLMs）模拟结构化学术讨论，用于检测推文是否包含科学主张、科学研究的引用或科学实体的提及。该方法在检测科学研究引用方面表现最佳，但在其他两项任务中排名较低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决科学网络话语检测任务（Task 4a）中的挑战，特别是如何有效识别推文中的科学内容。

Method: 探索了三种辩论方法：单辩论、团队辩论和委员会辩论，最终选择委员会辩论作为主要模型。

Result: 委员会辩论在检测科学研究引用方面排名第一，但在识别科学主张和科学实体提及方面表现较差（分别为第8和第9名）。

Conclusion: 委员会辩论方法在特定任务中表现出色，但在其他任务中仍需改进。

Abstract: In this paper, we present our work developed for the scientific web discourse
detection task (Task 4a) of CheckThat! 2025. We propose a novel council debate
method that simulates structured academic discussions among multiple large
language models (LLMs) to identify whether a given tweet contains (i) a
scientific claim, (ii) a reference to a scientific study, or (iii) mentions of
scientific entities. We explore three debating methods: i) single debate, where
two LLMs argue for opposing positions while a third acts as a judge; ii) team
debate, in which multiple models collaborate within each side of the debate;
and iii) council debate, where multiple expert models deliberate together to
reach a consensus, moderated by a chairperson model. We choose council debate
as our primary model as it outperforms others in the development test set.
Although our proposed method did not rank highly for identifying scientific
claims (8th out of 10) or mentions of scientific entities (9th out of 10), it
ranked first in detecting references to scientific studies.

TL;DR: 研究发现，大型语言模型在认知共情任务中表现优于人类，但在情感共情上表现较弱，显示出作为虚拟伴侣的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨语言模型在认知和情感共情方面的表现，以评估其作为虚拟伴侣的适用性。

Method: 使用标准化心理测试比较小型和大型语言模型与人类在认知和情感共情上的表现。

Result: 大型语言模型在认知共情上优于人类，但在情感共情上显著低于人类。

Conclusion: 语言模型在认知共情上的优势使其适合提供客观的情感支持，但情感共情的不足限制了其完全模拟人类互动的能力。

Abstract: Large language models have become increasingly common, used by millions of
people worldwide in both professional and personal contexts. As these models
continue to advance, they are frequently serving as virtual assistants and
companions. In human interactions, effective communication typically involves
two types of empathy: cognitive empathy (understanding others' thoughts and
emotions) and affective empathy (emotionally sharing others' feelings). In this
study, we investigated both cognitive and affective empathy across several
small (SLMs) and large (LLMs) language models using standardized psychological
tests. Our results revealed that LLMs consistently outperformed humans -
including psychology students - on cognitive empathy tasks. However, despite
their cognitive strengths, both small and large language models showed
significantly lower affective empathy compared to human participants. These
findings highlight rapid advancements in language models' ability to simulate
cognitive empathy, suggesting strong potential for providing effective virtual
companionship and personalized emotional support. Additionally, their high
cognitive yet lower affective empathy allows objective and consistent emotional
support without running the risk of emotional fatigue or bias.

TL;DR: 提出了一种实时新闻故事识别方法，结合文本表示、聚类和在线主题建模技术，用于将新闻文章动态分配到特定故事中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升新闻监控系统的效率，通过实时将新闻文章归类到特定故事中，优化阅读体验。

Method: 结合文本表示技术（如BERTopic、DBStream、TextClust）、聚类算法和在线主题建模方法，动态识别和分配新闻故事。

Result: 在斯洛文尼亚媒体数据集上验证，结果显示该方法能生成合理的故事分类结果。

Conclusion: 提出的实时故事识别方法有效，能够满足新闻监控系统的需求。

Abstract: To improve the reading experience, many news sites organize news into topical
collections, called stories. In this work, we present an approach for
implementing real-time story identification for a news monitoring system that
automatically collects news articles as they appear online and processes them
in various ways. Story identification aims to assign each news article to a
specific story that the article is covering. The process is similar to text
clustering and topic modeling, but requires that articles be grouped based on
particular events, places, and people, rather than general text similarity (as
in clustering) or general (predefined) topics (as in topic modeling). We
present an approach to story identification that is capable of functioning in
real time, assigning articles to stories as they are published online. In the
proposed approach, we combine text representation techniques, clustering
algorithms, and online topic modeling methods. We combine various text
representation methods to extract specific events and named entities necessary
for story identification, showing that a mixture of online topic-modeling
approaches such as BERTopic, DBStream, and TextClust can be adapted for story
discovery. We evaluate our approach on a news dataset from Slovene media
covering a period of 1 month. We show that our real-time approach produces
sensible results as judged by human evaluators.

Result: 关键词增强方法在机器和人类可解释性上均表现更优。

Conclusion: TT-XAI为临床决策支持提供了可扩展且可信赖的AI解决方案。

Abstract: Clinical language models often struggle to provide trustworthy predictions
and explanations when applied to lengthy, unstructured electronic health
records (EHRs). This work introduces TT-XAI, a lightweight and effective
framework that improves both classification performance and interpretability
through domain-aware keyword distillation and reasoning with large language
models (LLMs). First, we demonstrate that distilling raw discharge notes into
concise keyword representations significantly enhances BERT classifier
performance and improves local explanation fidelity via a focused variant of
LIME. Second, we generate chain-of-thought clinical explanations using
keyword-guided prompts to steer LLMs, producing more concise and clinically
relevant reasoning. We evaluate explanation quality using deletion-based
fidelity metrics, self-assessment via LLaMA-3 scoring, and a blinded human
study with domain experts. All evaluation modalities consistently favor the
keyword-augmented method, confirming that distillation enhances both machine
and human interpretability. TT-XAI offers a scalable pathway toward
trustworthy, auditable AI in clinical decision support.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体上仇恨言论的快速增加对社会产生了前所未有的影响，需要自动化的检测方法。现有黑盒模型缺乏透明性，因此提出一种透明且可解释的方法。

Method: 提出“Speech Concept Bottleneck Model”（SCBM），利用形容词作为可解释的瓶颈概念，结合LLMs将文本映射到形容词表示，再用轻量级分类器完成任务。

Result: 在五个多语言和多平台数据集上，SCBM平均macro-F1得分为0.69，优于文献中的最新结果。结合形容词表示和Transformer嵌入后性能提升1.8%。

Conclusion: 形容词概念表示是紧凑、可解释且有效的编码方法，适用于仇恨和反仇恨言论识别，并可推广到其他NLP任务。

Abstract: The rapid increase in hate speech on social media has exposed an
unprecedented impact on society, making automated methods for detecting such
content important. Unlike prior black-box models, we propose a novel
transparent method for automated hate and counter speech recognition, i.e.,
"Speech Concept Bottleneck Model" (SCBM), using adjectives as
human-interpretable bottleneck concepts. SCBM leverages large language models
(LLMs) to map input texts to an abstract adjective-based representation, which
is then sent to a light-weight classifier for downstream tasks. Across five
benchmark datasets spanning multiple languages and platforms (e.g., Twitter,
Reddit, YouTube), SCBM achieves an average macro-F1 score of 0.69 which
outperforms the most recently reported results from the literature on four out
of five datasets. Aside from high recognition accuracy, SCBM provides a high
level of both local and global interpretability. Furthermore, fusing our
adjective-based concept representation with transformer embeddings, leads to a
1.8% performance increase on average across all datasets, showing that the
proposed representation captures complementary information. Our results
demonstrate that adjective-based concept representations can serve as compact,
interpretable, and effective encodings for hate and counter speech recognition.
With adapted adjectives, our method can also be applied to other NLP tasks.

Motivation: 解决现有研究中缺乏系统性和严谨性评估基准的问题。

Method: 结合最终答案准确性和细粒度推理质量评估，比较八种持续学习算法，并分析强化学习与监督微调范式。

Result: 发现模型通用能力越强越抗遗忘，推理链退化较慢，算法效果依赖模型能力和任务顺序，KL约束在强化学习中关键。

Conclusion: MLLM-CTBench为持续指令调优提供了严谨标准和实用指导。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) rely on continual instruction tuning
to adapt to the evolving demands of real-world applications. However, progress
in this area is hindered by the lack of rigorous and systematic benchmarks. To
address this gap, we present MLLM-CTBench, a comprehensive evaluation benchmark
with three key contributions: (1) Multidimensional Evaluation: We combine final
answer accuracy with fine-grained CoT reasoning quality assessment, enabled by
a specially trained CoT evaluator; (2) Comprehensive Evaluation of Algorithms
and Training Paradigms: We benchmark eight continual learning algorithms across
four major categories and systematically compare reinforcement learning with
supervised fine-tuning paradigms; (3) Carefully Curated Tasks: We select and
organize 16 datasets from existing work, covering six challenging domains. Our
key findings include: (i) Models with stronger general capabilities exhibit
greater robustness to forgetting during continual learning; (ii) Reasoning
chains degrade more slowly than final answers, supporting the hierarchical
forgetting hypothesis; (iii) The effectiveness of continual learning algorithms
is highly dependent on both model capability and task order; (iv) In
reinforcement learning settings, incorporating KL-divergence constraints helps
maintain policy stability and plays a crucial role in mitigating forgetting.
MLLM-CTBench establishes a rigorous standard for continual instruction tuning
of MLLMs and offers practical guidance for algorithm design and evaluation.

Motivation: 研究旨在确定大型语言模型和视觉语言模型中与心理理论和数学推理任务因果相关的单元，以验证对比定位器的有效性。

Method: 使用对比刺激集定位高激活单元，并通过定向消融评估其因果作用，比较功能选择单元、低激活单元和随机选择单元对任务性能的影响。

Result: 低激活单元有时比高激活单元对性能影响更大，数学定位器衍生的单元对心理理论任务的损害更大。

Conclusion: 研究质疑对比定位器的因果相关性，建议使用更广泛的刺激集和更准确的任务特定单元捕捉方法。

Abstract: This work adapts a neuroscientific contrast localizer to pinpoint causally
relevant units for Theory of Mind (ToM) and mathematical reasoning tasks in
large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs). Across 11 LLMs
and 5 VLMs ranging in size from 3B to 90B parameters, we localize top-activated
units using contrastive stimulus sets and assess their causal role via targeted
ablations. We compare the effect of lesioning functionally selected units
against low-activation and randomly selected units on downstream accuracy
across established ToM and mathematical benchmarks. Contrary to expectations,
low-activation units sometimes produced larger performance drops than the
highly activated ones, and units derived from the mathematical localizer often
impaired ToM performance more than those from the ToM localizer. These findings
call into question the causal relevance of contrast-based localizers and
highlight the need for broader stimulus sets and more accurately capture
task-specific units.

Result: Method B将语法有效性提升至92.6%，任务性能平均提高33%，小模型优化效果显著。

Conclusion: MinionsLLM为资源受限场景提供了高效解决方案，并开源框架以促进研究。

Abstract: This paper presents MinionsLLM, a novel framework that integrates Large
Language Models (LLMs) with Behavior Trees (BTs) and Formal Grammars to enable
natural language control of multi-agent systems within arbitrary, user-defined
environments. MinionsLLM provides standardized interfaces for defining
environments, agents, and behavioral primitives, and introduces two synthetic
dataset generation methods (Method A and Method B) to fine-tune LLMs for
improved syntactic validity and semantic task relevance. We validate our
approach using Google's Gemma 3 model family at three parameter scales (1B, 4B,
and 12B) and demonstrate substantial gains: Method B increases syntactic
validity to 92.6% and achieves a mean task performance improvement of 33% over
baseline. Notably, our experiments show that smaller models benefit most from
fine-tuning, suggesting promising directions for deploying compact, locally
hosted LLMs in resource-constrained multi-agent control scenarios. The
framework and all resources are released open-source to support reproducibility

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）的幻觉问题严重影响其可靠性，但现有评估方法（如ROUGE）与人类判断不一致，导致性能估计误导。

Method: 通过全面的人类研究，对比ROUGE与人类对齐指标（如LLM-as-Judge）的表现，并分析简单启发式方法的有效性。

Result: ROUGE召回率高但精度极低，导致性能估计偏差高达45.9%；简单启发式方法可与复杂技术媲美。

Conclusion: 需采用语义感知的评估框架，以准确衡量幻觉检测方法的性能，确保LLM输出的可信度。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing,
yet their tendency to hallucinate poses serious challenges for reliable
deployment. Despite numerous hallucination detection methods, their evaluations
often rely on ROUGE, a metric based on lexical overlap that misaligns with
human judgments. Through comprehensive human studies, we demonstrate that while
ROUGE exhibits high recall, its extremely low precision leads to misleading
performance estimates. In fact, several established detection methods show
performance drops of up to 45.9\% when assessed using human-aligned metrics
like LLM-as-Judge. Moreover, our analysis reveals that simple heuristics based
on response length can rival complex detection techniques, exposing a
fundamental flaw in current evaluation practices. We argue that adopting
semantically aware and robust evaluation frameworks is essential to accurately
gauge the true performance of hallucination detection methods, ultimately
ensuring the trustworthiness of LLM outputs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在多个领域中被广泛用于回答问题，但其在宗教领域的可靠性和准确性尚未得到充分研究，尤其是在伊斯兰教法裁决中。

Method: 研究通过零样本和弃权实验，评估LLMs在阿拉伯语和英语中生成伊斯兰教法裁决的能力，并分析其在不同教派和语言中的表现。

Result: GPT-4o在准确性上表现最佳，而Gemini和Fanar在弃权行为上更优。所有模型在阿拉伯语中的表现均有所下降。

Conclusion: 研究表明，在宗教应用中需谨慎部署LLMs，并强调任务特定评估的重要性。

Abstract: Despite the increasing usage of Large Language Models (LLMs) in answering
questions in a variety of domains, their reliability and accuracy remain
unexamined for a plethora of domains including the religious domains. In this
paper, we introduce a novel benchmark FiqhQA focused on the LLM generated
Islamic rulings explicitly categorized by the four major Sunni schools of
thought, in both Arabic and English. Unlike prior work, which either overlooks
the distinctions between religious school of thought or fails to evaluate
abstention behavior, we assess LLMs not only on their accuracy but also on
their ability to recognize when not to answer. Our zero-shot and abstention
experiments reveal significant variation across LLMs, languages, and legal
schools of thought. While GPT-4o outperforms all other models in accuracy,
Gemini and Fanar demonstrate superior abstention behavior critical for
minimizing confident incorrect answers. Notably, all models exhibit a
performance drop in Arabic, highlighting the limitations in religious reasoning
for languages other than English. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first study to benchmark the efficacy of LLMs for fine-grained Islamic school
of thought specific ruling generation and to evaluate abstention for Islamic
jurisprudence queries. Our findings underscore the need for task-specific
evaluation and cautious deployment of LLMs in religious applications.

Motivation: 当前数学推理基准的准确率接近饱和，且受训练数据污染影响，需要动态、抗污染的评估框架。

Method: 从Putnam竞赛中选取问题，并通过程序化扰动生成变体问题，提出Teacher-Forced Accuracy（TFA）评估推理过程。

Result: 最强模型在原始问题上的准确率为41.9%，但在变体问题上下降19.6%，表明模型存在记忆问题。

Conclusion: Putnam-AXIOM为LLM的数学推理提供了动态、抗污染的评估框架。

Abstract: Current mathematical reasoning benchmarks for large language models (LLMs)
are approaching saturation, with some achieving > 90% accuracy, and are
increasingly compromised by training-set contamination. We introduce
Putnam-AXIOM, a benchmark of 522 university-level competition problems drawn
from the prestigious William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition, and
Putnam-AXIOM Variation, an unseen companion set of 100 functional variants
generated by programmatically perturbing variables and constants. The variation
protocol produces an unlimited stream of equally difficult, unseen instances --
yielding a contamination-resilient test bed. On the Original set, OpenAI's
o1-preview -- the strongest evaluated model -- scores 41.9%, but its accuracy
drops by 19.6% (46.8% relative decrease) on the paired Variations. The
remaining eighteen models show the same downward trend, ten of them with
non-overlapping 95% confidence intervals. These gaps suggest memorization and
highlight the necessity of dynamic benchmarks. We complement "boxed" accuracy
with Teacher-Forced Accuracy (TFA), a lightweight metric that directly scores
reasoning traces and automates natural language proof evaluations. Putnam-AXIOM
therefore provides a rigorous, contamination-resilient evaluation framework for
assessing advanced mathematical reasoning of LLMs. Data and evaluation code are
publicly available at https://github.com/brando90/putnam-axiom.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现成LLMs在教育中表现不佳的问题，如过早揭示答案、缺乏适应性及易受情绪操控。

Method: 收集真实学生与ChatGPT的对话，通过CoT提示增强数据，并设计针对性案例优化模型。

Result: 经CoDAE微调的模型在教学指导、推理支持和抗干扰方面表现更优。

Conclusion: CoDAE有效提升了LLMs作为教育工具的适用性和效果。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed as AI tutors due to
their scalability and potential for personalized instruction. However,
off-the-shelf LLMs often underperform in educational settings: they frequently
reveal answers too readily, fail to adapt their responses to student
uncertainty, and remain vulnerable to emotionally manipulative prompts. To
address these challenges, we introduce CoDAE, a framework that adapts LLMs for
educational use through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data augmentation. We collect
real-world dialogues between students and a ChatGPT-based tutor and enrich them
using CoT prompting to promote step-by-step reasoning and pedagogically aligned
guidance. Furthermore, we design targeted dialogue cases to explicitly mitigate
three key limitations: over-compliance, low response adaptivity, and threat
vulnerability. We fine-tune four open-source LLMs on different variants of the
augmented datasets and evaluate them in simulated educational scenarios using
both automatic metrics and LLM-as-a-judge assessments. Our results show that
models fine-tuned with CoDAE deliver more pedagogically appropriate guidance,
better support reasoning processes, and effectively resist premature answer
disclosure.

TL;DR: Mol-R1框架通过PRID和MoIA策略提升长链思维推理模型在分子生成任务中的性能和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长链思维推理模型在知识密集型领域（如分子发现）中能力有限和效率低下的问题。

Method: 结合PRID数据集蒸馏和MoIA训练策略（SFT与RPO迭代结合），优化R1类模型的推理性能。

Result: Mol-R1在文本分子生成任务中表现优于现有基线。

Conclusion: Mol-R1通过改进的数据集和训练策略，显著提升了分子生成任务的推理能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), especially Explicit Long Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning models like DeepSeek-R1 and QWQ, have demonstrated powerful reasoning
capabilities, achieving impressive performance in commonsense reasoning and
mathematical inference. Despite their effectiveness, Long-CoT reasoning models
are often criticized for their limited ability and low efficiency in
knowledge-intensive domains such as molecule discovery. Success in this field
requires a precise understanding of domain knowledge, including molecular
structures and chemical principles, which is challenging due to the inherent
complexity of molecular data and the scarcity of high-quality expert
annotations. To bridge this gap, we introduce Mol-R1, a novel framework
designed to improve explainability and reasoning performance of R1-like
Explicit Long-CoT reasoning LLMs in text-based molecule generation. Our
approach begins with a high-quality reasoning dataset curated through Prior
Regulation via In-context Distillation (PRID), a dedicated distillation
strategy to effectively generate paired reasoning traces guided by prior
regulations. Building upon this, we introduce MoIA, Molecular Iterative
Adaptation, a sophisticated training strategy that iteratively combines
Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) with Reinforced Policy Optimization (RPO),
tailored to boost the reasoning performance of R1-like reasoning models for
molecule discovery. Finally, we examine the performance of Mol-R1 in the
text-based molecule reasoning generation task, showing superior performance
against existing baselines.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了形态对齐的标记化方法是否提升语言模型性能，发现形态对齐对语法任务有适度正面影响，但标记化算法影响更大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决形态对齐标记化方法对语言模型性能的影响，特别是在复杂形态语言中。

Method: 选择多种语言（Telugu、Hindi、English），从标记化训练到下游任务全面评估，关注形态对齐和标记化质量。

Result: 形态对齐与语法任务性能呈适度正相关，但标记化算法（如BPE vs. Unigram）影响更大。Unigram标记化表现最优。

Conclusion: 形态对齐对性能有贡献，但标记化算法的选择更为关键。

Abstract: Prior work on language modeling showed conflicting findings about whether
morphologically aligned approaches to tokenization improve performance,
particularly for languages with complex morphology. To investigate this, we
select a typologically diverse set of languages: Telugu (agglutinative), Hindi
(primarily fusional with some agglutination), and English (fusional). We
conduct a comprehensive evaluation of language models -- starting from
tokenizer training and extending through the finetuning and downstream task
evaluation. To account for the consistent performance differences observed
across tokenizer variants, we focus on two key factors: morphological alignment
and tokenization quality. To assess morphological alignment of tokenizers in
Telugu, we create a dataset containing gold morpheme segmentations of 600
derivational and 7000 inflectional word forms.
  Our experiments reveal that better morphological alignment correlates
positively -- though moderately -- with performance in syntax-based tasks such
as Parts-of-Speech tagging, Named Entity Recognition and Dependency Parsing.
However, we also find that the tokenizer algorithm (Byte-pair Encoding vs.
Unigram) plays a more significant role in influencing downstream performance
than morphological alignment alone. Naive Unigram tokenizers outperform others
across most settings, though hybrid tokenizers that incorporate morphological
segmentation significantly improve performance within the BPE framework. In
contrast, intrinsic metrics like Corpus Token Count (CTC) and R\'enyi entropy
showed no correlation with downstream performance.

TL;DR: 本文提出两种轻量级DPO变体（Adaptive Margin-Sigmoid Loss和APO-hinge-zero），通过引入基于边界的优化目标和选择性更新机制，改善小型LLM在性能差距较大时的对齐问题。APO-hinge-zero在AlpacaEval和MT-Bench中表现优异。

Motivation: 小型LLM在性能差距较大时难以对齐人类偏好，需要轻量级解决方案。

Method: 提出两种DPO变体：Adaptive Margin-Sigmoid Loss和APO-hinge-zero，结合边界目标和选择性更新机制。

Result: APO-hinge-zero在AlpacaEval中胜率提升2.0点，长度控制胜率提升1.4点；在MT-Bench中表现优异，尤其在STEM和人文任务中。

Conclusion: 简单修改偏好目标可显著提升小型LLM的对齐效果，为资源受限场景提供实用解决方案。

Abstract: Small large language models (LLMs) often face difficulties in aligning output
to human preferences, particularly when operating under severe performance
gaps. In this work, we propose two lightweight DPO-based variants -- Adaptive
Margin-Sigmoid Loss and APO-hinge-zero -- to better address underperformance
scenarios by introducing margin-based objectives and selective update
mechanisms.
  Our APO-hinge-zero method, which combines hinge-induced hard-example mining
with the chosen-focused optimization of APO-zero, achieves strong results. In
AlpacaEval, APO-hinge-zero improves the win rate by +2.0 points and the
length-controlled win rate by +1.4 points compared to the APO-zero baseline. In
MT-Bench, our methods maintain competitive performance in diverse categories,
particularly excelling in STEM and Humanities tasks.
  These results demonstrate that simple modifications to preference-based
objectives can significantly enhance small LLM alignment under resource
constraints, offering a practical path toward more efficient deployment.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文通过物理学方法研究大型语言模型在推理过程中隐藏状态的变化，发现类似能量的量几乎恒定，并提出了一种控制方法（Jacobian steering），提高了语义质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型隐藏状态的变化规律，以提升模型的可解释性和可控性。

Method: 分析20个开源Transformer模型，结合隐藏状态变化率和模型确定性，提出“能量”概念，并开发Jacobian steering控制方法。

Result: 随机权重模型比预训练模型更严格地保持“能量”，训练使模型进入更快、更果断的机制。Jacobian steering提高了语义质量。

Conclusion: 通过物理学视角分析Transformer模型，为可解释性、异常检测和低风险控制提供了理论基础，有助于模型更符合人类意图。

Abstract: We take a physics-based approach to studying how the internal hidden states
of large language models change from token to token during inference. Across 20
open-source transformer models (135M-3B parameters), we find that a quantity
combining the rate of change in hidden states and the model's next-token
certainty, analogous to energy in physics, remains nearly constant.
Random-weight models conserve this "energy" more tightly than pre-trained ones,
while training shifts models into a faster, more decisive regime with greater
variability. Using this "log-Lagrangian" view, we derive a control method
called Jacobian steering, which perturbs hidden states in the minimal way
needed to favor a target token. This approach maintained near-constant energy
in two tested models and produced continuations rated higher in semantic
quality than the models' natural outputs. Viewing transformers through this
mechanics lens offers a principled basis for interpretability, anomaly
detection, and low-risk steering. This could help make powerful models more
predictable and aligned with human intent.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于少样本比较回归的可引导多元对齐模型，旨在捕捉多样化的用户偏好，超越传统的标量奖励方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的大语言模型（LLM）对齐方法（如RLHF）仅能反映平均用户偏好，无法满足多元化的需求。

Method: 采用少样本比较回归方法，结合上下文学习和细粒度属性，比较响应选项并做出对齐选择。

Result: 在Moral Integrity Corpus和HelpSteer2数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于多个基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为多元对齐提供了新思路，推动了伦理AI的发展。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are currently aligned using techniques such as
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). However, these methods use
scalar rewards that can only reflect user preferences on average. Pluralistic
alignment instead seeks to capture diverse user preferences across a set of
attributes, moving beyond just helpfulness and harmlessness. Toward this end,
we propose a steerable pluralistic model based on few-shot comparative
regression that can adapt to individual user preferences. Our approach
leverages in-context learning and reasoning, grounded in a set of fine-grained
attributes, to compare response options and make aligned choices. To evaluate
our algorithm, we also propose two new steerable pluralistic benchmarks by
adapting the Moral Integrity Corpus (MIC) and the HelpSteer2 datasets,
demonstrating the applicability of our approach to value-aligned
decision-making and reward modeling, respectively. Our few-shot comparative
regression approach is interpretable and compatible with different attributes
and LLMs, while outperforming multiple baseline and state-of-the-art methods.
Our work provides new insights and research directions in pluralistic
alignment, enabling a more fair and representative use of LLMs and advancing
the state-of-the-art in ethical AI.

Motivation: 开发一种能够在保持高质量压缩表示的同时，适用于多种下游任务的通用压缩方法。

Method: 使用预训练的编码器-解码器语言模型，通过去噪训练学习压缩表示，并对编码器进行小规模修改以优化压缩质量。

Result: 在2倍压缩下，DeCAL在问答、摘要和多向量检索任务中表现接近未压缩模型，8倍压缩时性能下降较小。

Conclusion: DeCAL在预计算密集表示场景中具有显著优势，未来可进一步扩展其适用性。

Abstract: This paper introduces DeCAL, a new method for tokenwise compression. DeCAL
uses an encoder-decoder language model pretrained with denoising to learn to
produce high-quality, general-purpose compressed representations by the
encoder. DeCAL applies small modifications to the encoder, with the emphasis on
maximizing compression quality, even at the expense of compute. We show that
DeCAL at 2x compression can match uncompressed on many downstream tasks, with
usually only minor dropoff in metrics up to 8x compression, among
question-answering, summarization, and multi-vector retrieval tasks. DeCAL
offers significant savings where pre-computed dense representations can be
utilized, and we believe the approach can be further developed to be more
broadly applicable.

Motivation: 抑郁症预测缺乏高质量数据集，阻碍了应用。

Method: 基于3,699篇自传体叙事训练DepressLLM，引入SToPS模块提升性能。

Result: AUC为0.789，高置信度样本达0.904；验证了在异质数据中的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 可解释AI有望实现抑郁症早期诊断，但需进一步改进模型和数据。

Abstract: Advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled a wide range of
applications. However, depression prediction is hindered by the lack of
large-scale, high-quality, and rigorously annotated datasets. This study
introduces DepressLLM, trained and evaluated on a novel corpus of 3,699
autobiographical narratives reflecting both happiness and distress. DepressLLM
provides interpretable depression predictions and, via its Score-guided Token
Probability Summation (SToPS) module, delivers both improved classification
performance and reliable confidence estimates, achieving an AUC of 0.789, which
rises to 0.904 on samples with confidence $\geq$ 0.95. To validate its
robustness to heterogeneous data, we evaluated DepressLLM on in-house datasets,
including an Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) corpus of daily stress and
mood recordings, and on public clinical interview data. Finally, a psychiatric
review of high-confidence misclassifications highlighted key model and data
limitations that suggest directions for future refinements. These findings
demonstrate that interpretable AI can enable earlier diagnosis of depression
and underscore the promise of medical AI in psychiatry.

Motivation: RAG系统在粤语等低资源语言中面临数据稀缺和语言变异性问题，需通过PEFT方法提升其性能。

Method: 评估了LoRA在RAG框架中的集成，比较了不同PEFT方法，并分析了合成数据生成、用户反馈和自适应参数分配等技术。

Result: 动态和集成LoRA方法显著减少了可训练参数，同时保持了检索和生成质量，但在保留语言细节和可扩展性上仍有局限。

Conclusion: PEFT增强的RAG系统在领域特定任务中具有潜力，未来需关注方言真实性、动态适应和可扩展性。

Abstract: This review examines recent advances in Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning
(PEFT), with a focus on Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), to optimize
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems like Qwen3, DeepSeek, and Kimi.
These systems face challenges in understanding and generating authentic
Cantonese colloquial expressions due to limited annotated data and linguistic
variability. The review evaluates the integration of LoRA within RAG
frameworks, benchmarks PEFT methods for retrieval and generation accuracy,
identify domain adaptation strategies under limited data, and compares
fine-tuning techniques aimed at improving semantic fidelity under data-scarce
conditions. A systematic analysis of recent studies employing diverse LoRA
variants, synthetic data generation, user feedback integration, and adaptive
parameter allocation was conducted to assess their impact on computational
efficiency, retrieval precision, linguistic authenticity, and scalability.
Findings reveal that dynamic and ensemble LoRA adaptations significantly reduce
trainable parameters without sacrificing retrieval accuracy and generation
quality in dialectal contexts. However, limitations remain in fully preserving
fine-grained linguistic nuances, especially for low-resource settings like
Cantonese. The integration of real-time user feedback and domain-specific data
remains underdeveloped, limiting model adaptability and personalization. While
selective parameter freezing and nonlinear adaptation methods offer better
trade-offs between efficiency and accuracy, their robustness at scale remains
an open challenge. This review highlights the promise of PEFT-enhanced RAG
systems for domain-specific language tasks and calls for future work targeting
dialectal authenticity, dynamic adaptation, and scalable fine-tuning pipelines.

Conclusion: 任务规模扩展（task scaling）是实现通用推理能力的关键途径，InternBootcamp为模型优化和评估提供了基础设施。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized artificial intelligence by
enabling complex reasoning capabilities. While recent advancements in
reinforcement learning (RL) have primarily focused on domain-specific reasoning
tasks (e.g., mathematics or code generation), real-world reasoning scenarios
often require models to handle diverse and complex environments that
narrow-domain benchmarks cannot fully capture. To address this gap, we present
InternBootcamp, an open-source framework comprising 1000+ domain-diverse task
environments specifically designed for LLM reasoning research. Our codebase
offers two key functionalities: (1) automated generation of unlimited
training/testing cases with configurable difficulty levels, and (2) integrated
verification modules for objective response evaluation. These features make
InternBootcamp fundamental infrastructure for RL-based model optimization,
synthetic data generation, and model evaluation. Although manually developing
such a framework with enormous task coverage is extremely cumbersome, we
accelerate the development procedure through an automated agent workflow
supplemented by manual validation protocols, which enables the task scope to
expand rapidly. % With these bootcamps, we further establish Bootcamp-EVAL, an
automatically generated benchmark for comprehensive performance assessment.
Evaluation reveals that frontier models still underperform in many reasoning
tasks, while training with InternBootcamp provides an effective way to
significantly improve performance, leading to our 32B model that achieves
state-of-the-art results on Bootcamp-EVAL and excels on other established
benchmarks. In particular, we validate that consistent performance gains come
from including more training tasks, namely \textbf{task scaling}, over two
orders of magnitude, offering a promising route towards capable reasoning
generalist.

Conclusion: IFRAgent通过显式和隐式意图流的结合，显著提升了移动代理与人类意图的对齐效果。

Abstract: As multimodal large language models advance rapidly, the automation of mobile
tasks has become increasingly feasible through the use of mobile-use agents
that mimic human interactions from graphical user interface. To further enhance
mobile-use agents, previous studies employ demonstration learning to improve
mobile-use agents from human demonstrations. However, these methods focus
solely on the explicit intention flows of humans (e.g., step sequences) while
neglecting implicit intention flows (e.g., personal preferences), which makes
it difficult to construct personalized mobile-use agents. In this work, to
evaluate the \textbf{I}ntention \textbf{A}lignment \textbf{R}ate between
mobile-use agents and humans, we first collect \textbf{MobileIAR}, a dataset
containing human-intent-aligned actions and ground-truth actions. This enables
a comprehensive assessment of the agents' understanding of human intent. Then
we propose \textbf{IFRAgent}, a framework built upon \textbf{I}ntention
\textbf{F}low \textbf{R}ecognition from human demonstrations. IFRAgent analyzes
explicit intention flows from human demonstrations to construct a query-level
vector library of standard operating procedures (SOP), and analyzes implicit
intention flows to build a user-level habit repository. IFRAgent then leverages
a SOP extractor combined with retrieval-augmented generation and a query
rewriter to generate personalized query and SOP from a raw ambiguous query,
enhancing the alignment between mobile-use agents and human intent.
Experimental results demonstrate that IFRAgent outperforms baselines by an
average of 6.79\% (32.06\% relative improvement) in human intention alignment
rate and improves step completion rates by an average of 5.30\% (26.34\%
relative improvement). The codes are available at

However, all models struggle in zero-shot and few-shot scenarios compared to

Abstract: Transforming unstructured text into structured data is a complex task,
requiring semantic understanding, reasoning, and structural comprehension.
While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer potential, they often struggle with
handling ambiguous or domain-specific data, maintaining table structure,
managing long inputs, and addressing numerical reasoning. This paper proposes
an efficient system for LLM-driven text-to-table generation that leverages
novel prompting techniques. Specifically, the system incorporates two key
strategies: breaking down the text-to-table task into manageable, guided
sub-tasks and refining the generated tables through iterative self-feedback. We
show that this custom task decomposition allows the model to address the
problem in a stepwise manner and improves the quality of the generated table.
Furthermore, we discuss the benefits and potential risks associated with
iterative self-feedback on the generated tables while highlighting the
trade-offs between enhanced performance and computational cost. Our methods
achieve strong results compared to baselines on two complex text-to-table
generation datasets available in the public domain.

Result: TopXGen显著提升了LLMs在微调和上下文学习中的翻译性能。

Conclusion: TopXGen为低资源语言翻译提供了有效的数据生成方法，提升了LLMs的翻译能力。

Abstract: LLMs have been shown to perform well in machine translation (MT) with the use
of in-context learning (ICL), rivaling supervised models when translating into
high-resource languages (HRLs). However, they lag behind when translating into
low-resource language (LRLs). Example selection via similarity search and
supervised fine-tuning help. However the improvements they give are limited by
the size, quality and diversity of existing parallel datasets. A common
technique in low-resource MT is synthetic parallel data creation, the most
frequent of which is backtranslation, whereby existing target-side texts are
automatically translated into the source language. However, this assumes the
existence of good quality and relevant target-side texts, which are not readily
available for many LRLs. In this paper, we present \textsc{TopXGen}, an
LLM-based approach for the generation of high quality and topic-diverse data in
multiple LRLs, which can then be backtranslated to produce useful and diverse
parallel texts for ICL and fine-tuning. Our intuition is that while LLMs
struggle to translate into LRLs, their ability to translate well into HRLs and
their multilinguality enable them to generate good quality, natural-sounding
target-side texts, which can be translated well into a high-resource source
language. We show that \textsc{TopXGen} boosts LLM translation performance
during fine-tuning and in-context learning. Code and outputs are available at

TL;DR: 研究评估了多语言ASR模型与针对荷兰老年人微调的模型在老年护理聊天机器人中的表现，发现通用模型表现更优，同时截断架构可平衡准确性与速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决老年人在临床环境中使用语音控制界面的ASR可靠性问题，尤其是针对少数群体的表现。

Method: 评估通用多语言ASR模型与针对荷兰老年人微调的模型在Welzijn.AI聊天机器人中的表现，同时考虑处理速度。

Result: 通用多语言模型表现优于微调模型，显示其泛化能力强；截断架构有助于平衡准确性与速度，但存在高WER问题。

Conclusion: 通用ASR模型在老年护理中表现良好，但需注意幻觉问题；截断架构是优化性能的有效方法。

Abstract: Voice-controlled interfaces can support older adults in clinical contexts,
with chatbots being a prime example, but reliable Automatic Speech Recognition
(ASR) for underrepresented groups remains a bottleneck. This study evaluates
state-of-the-art ASR models on language use of older Dutch adults, who
interacted with the Welzijn.AI chatbot designed for geriatric contexts. We
benchmark generic multilingual ASR models, and models fine-tuned for Dutch
spoken by older adults, while also considering processing speed. Our results
show that generic multilingual models outperform fine-tuned models, which
suggests recent ASR models can generalise well out of the box to realistic
datasets. Furthermore, our results suggest that truncating existing
architectures is helpful in balancing the accuracy-speed trade-off, though we
also identify some cases with high WER due to hallucinations.

TL;DR: 本文系统综述了并行文本生成方法，分类为基于自回归（AR）和非自回归（Non-AR）的方法，并分析了它们在速度、质量和效率上的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型语言模型（LLMs）主要依赖自回归生成，导致生成速度受限。为突破这一瓶颈，研究者开始探索并行文本生成技术，但缺乏全面分析。

Method: 将并行文本生成方法分为AR和非AR两类，详细分析每类核心技术的理论权衡（速度、质量、效率），并探讨其组合潜力。

Result: 综述了现有方法，评估了其性能，并指出了结合其他加速策略的可能性。

Conclusion: 总结了并行文本生成的最新进展、开放挑战及未来研究方向。

Abstract: As text generation has become a core capability of modern Large Language
Models (LLMs), it underpins a wide range of downstream applications. However,
most existing LLMs rely on autoregressive (AR) generation, producing one token
at a time based on previously generated context-resulting in limited generation
speed due to the inherently sequential nature of the process. To address this
challenge, an increasing number of researchers have begun exploring parallel
text generation-a broad class of techniques aimed at breaking the
token-by-token generation bottleneck and improving inference efficiency.
Despite growing interest, there remains a lack of comprehensive analysis on
what specific techniques constitute parallel text generation and how they
improve inference performance. To bridge this gap, we present a systematic
survey of parallel text generation methods. We categorize existing approaches
into AR-based and Non-AR-based paradigms, and provide a detailed examination of
the core techniques within each category. Following this taxonomy, we assess
their theoretical trade-offs in terms of speed, quality, and efficiency, and
examine their potential for combination and comparison with alternative
acceleration strategies. Finally, based on our findings, we highlight recent
advancements, identify open challenges, and outline promising directions for
future research in parallel text generation.

TL;DR: IROTE是一种新颖的上下文方法，通过生成和优化文本自我反思来稳定地激发LLMs的人类特质，解决了现有方法浅层和不稳定的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法只能让LLMs模仿浅层和不稳定的风格模式，无法精确和一致地体现人类特质。

Method: IROTE基于心理学理论，自动生成和优化包含自我感知经验的文本自我反思，通过最大化信息论目标来增强LLMs行为与目标特质之间的联系。

Result: 实验表明，IROTE生成的单一自我反思能在多种任务中稳定地诱导LLMs模仿目标特质，优于现有基线。

Conclusion: IROTE为稳定和可转移的特质激发提供了一种有效方法，适用于个性化LLMs和社会模拟等应用。

Abstract: Trained on various human-authored corpora, Large Language Models (LLMs) have
demonstrated a certain capability of reflecting specific human-like traits
(e.g., personality or values) by prompting, benefiting applications like
personalized LLMs and social simulations. However, existing methods suffer from
the superficial elicitation problem: LLMs can only be steered to mimic shallow
and unstable stylistic patterns, failing to embody the desired traits precisely
and consistently across diverse tasks like humans. To address this challenge,
we propose IROTE, a novel in-context method for stable and transferable trait
elicitation. Drawing on psychological theories suggesting that traits are
formed through identity-related reflection, our method automatically generates
and optimizes a textual self-reflection within prompts, which comprises
self-perceived experience, to stimulate LLMs' trait-driven behavior. The
optimization is performed by iteratively maximizing an information-theoretic
objective that enhances the connections between LLMs' behavior and the target
trait, while reducing noisy redundancy in reflection without any fine-tuning,
leading to evocative and compact trait reflection. Extensive experiments across
three human trait systems manifest that one single IROTE-generated
self-reflection can induce LLMs' stable impersonation of the target trait
across diverse downstream tasks beyond simple questionnaire answering,
consistently outperforming existing strong baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准LoRA在多源异构MLLG数据集中难以满足语义保真和多样通俗风格生成的需求。

Method: 提出Magical，采用共享矩阵A和多隔离矩阵B，结合语义不变约束和推荐引导切换机制。

Result: 在三个真实数据集上，Magical优于基于提示的方法、标准LoRA及其变体，并减少31.66%可训练参数。

Conclusion: Magical有效解决了MLLG任务中的语义保真和多样性生成问题，具有高效性和优越性能。

Abstract: Medical Lay Language Generation (MLLG) plays a vital role in improving the
accessibility of complex scientific content for broader audiences. Recent
literature to MLLG commonly employ parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods such
as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) using
paired expert-lay language datasets. However, LoRA struggles with the
challenges posed by multi-source heterogeneous MLLG datasets. Specifically,
through a series of exploratory experiments, we reveal that standard LoRA fail
to meet the requirement for semantic fidelity and diverse lay-style generation
in MLLG task. To address these limitations, we propose Magical, an asymmetric
LoRA architecture tailored for MLLG under heterogeneous data scenarios. Magical
employs a shared matrix $A$ for abstractive summarization, along with multiple
isolated matrices $B$ for diverse lay-style generation. To preserve semantic
fidelity during the lay language generation process, Magical introduces a
Semantic Invariance Constraint to mitigate semantic subspace shifts on matrix
$A$. Furthermore, to better adapt to diverse lay-style generation, Magical
incorporates the Recommendation-guided Switch, an externally interface to
prompt the LLM to switch between different matrices $B$. Experimental results
on three real-world lay language generation datasets demonstrate that Magical
consistently outperforms prompt-based methods, vanilla LoRA, and its recent
variants, while also reducing trainable parameters by 31.66%.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学文献问答对科学发现至关重要，但现有两阶段RAG-LLMs中的重排器潜力与局限尚未充分探索。

Method: 开发了SciRerankBench基准，包含三种Q-C-A对（NC、SSLI、CC），并在五种LLMs上评估了13种重排器。

Result: 系统评估揭示了不同重排器的优缺点，为未来研究提供了指导。

Conclusion: SciRerankBench是首个专注于RAG-LLMs重排器评估的基准，填补了研究空白。

Abstract: Scientific literature question answering is a pivotal step towards new
scientific discoveries. Recently, \textit{two-stage} retrieval-augmented
generated large language models (RAG-LLMs) have shown impressive advancements
in this domain. Such a two-stage framework, especially the second stage
(reranker), is particularly essential in the scientific domain, where subtle
differences in terminology may have a greatly negative impact on the final
factual-oriented or knowledge-intensive answers. Despite this significant
progress, the potential and limitations of these works remain unexplored. In
this work, we present a Scientific Rerank-oriented RAG Benchmark
(SciRerankBench), for evaluating rerankers within RAG-LLMs systems, spanning
five scientific subjects. To rigorously assess the reranker performance in
terms of noise resilience, relevance disambiguation, and factual consistency,
we develop three types of question-context-answer (Q-C-A) pairs, i.e., Noisy
Contexts (NC), Semantically Similar but Logically Irrelevant Contexts (SSLI),
and Counterfactual Contexts (CC). Through systematic evaluation of 13 widely
used rerankers on five families of LLMs, we provide detailed insights into
their relative strengths and limitations. To the best of our knowledge,
SciRerankBench is the first benchmark specifically developed to evaluate
rerankers within RAG-LLMs, which provides valuable observations and guidance
for their future development.

Method: DevNous直接集成到团队聊天环境中，识别非正式对话中的可操作意图，并管理核心管理任务的状态化多轮工作流。

Result: 在160个真实对话轮次的基准测试中，DevNous的精确匹配准确率为81.3%，多集F1得分为0.845。

Conclusion: DevNous验证了开发环境管理智能体的架构模式，并提供了首个稳健的基准数据集。

Abstract: The manual translation of unstructured team dialogue into the structured
artifacts required for Information Technology (IT) project governance is a
critical bottleneck in modern information systems management. We introduce
DevNous, a Large Language Model-based (LLM) multi-agent expert system, to
automate this unstructured-to-structured translation process. DevNous
integrates directly into team chat environments, identifying actionable intents
from informal dialogue and managing stateful, multi-turn workflows for core
administrative tasks like automated task formalization and progress summary
synthesis. To quantitatively evaluate the system, we introduce a new benchmark
of 160 realistic, interactive conversational turns. The dataset was manually
annotated with a multi-label ground truth and is publicly available. On this
benchmark, DevNous achieves an exact match turn accuracy of 81.3\% and a
multiset F1-Score of 0.845, providing strong evidence for its viability. The
primary contributions of this work are twofold: (1) a validated architectural
pattern for developing ambient administrative agents, and (2) the introduction
of the first robust empirical baseline and public benchmark dataset for this
challenging problem domain.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种隐私保护的RAG框架ARoG，通过关系中心抽象和结构导向抽象策略，解决匿名实体检索问题，同时保护隐私。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs存在幻觉和知识陈旧问题，RAG通过整合外部知识（如KGs）解决这些问题，但私有KGs的使用可能带来隐私风险。论文首次研究了隐私保护的RAG场景。

Method: 提出ARoG框架，包含关系中心抽象和结构导向抽象策略，将匿名实体转换为可检索信息，并优化问题与KG的匹配。

Result: 在三个数据集上的实验表明，ARoG具有强性能和隐私鲁棒性。

Conclusion: ARoG有效解决了隐私保护的RAG问题，同时提升了检索性能。

Abstract: LLMs often suffer from hallucinations and outdated or incomplete knowledge.
RAG is proposed to address these issues by integrating external knowledge like
that in KGs into LLMs. However, leveraging private KGs in RAG systems poses
significant privacy risks due to the black-box nature of LLMs and potential
insecure data transmission, especially when using third-party LLM APIs lacking
transparency and control. In this paper, we investigate the privacy-protected
RAG scenario for the first time, where entities in KGs are anonymous for LLMs,
thus preventing them from accessing entity semantics. Due to the loss of
semantics of entities, previous RAG systems cannot retrieve question-relevant
knowledge from KGs by matching questions with the meaningless identifiers of
anonymous entities. To realize an effective RAG system in this scenario, two
key challenges must be addressed: (1) How can anonymous entities be converted
into retrievable information. (2) How to retrieve question-relevant anonymous
entities. Hence, we propose a novel ARoG framework including relation-centric
abstraction and structure-oriented abstraction strategies. For challenge (1),
the first strategy abstracts entities into high-level concepts by dynamically
capturing the semantics of their adjacent relations. It supplements meaningful
semantics which can further support the retrieval process. For challenge (2),
the second strategy transforms unstructured natural language questions into
structured abstract concept paths. These paths can be more effectively aligned
with the abstracted concepts in KGs, thereby improving retrieval performance.
To guide LLMs to effectively retrieve knowledge from KGs, the two strategies
strictly protect privacy from being exposed to LLMs. Experiments on three
datasets demonstrate that ARoG achieves strong performance and
privacy-robustness.

TL;DR: 提出了一种自动化环境构建流程和可验证奖励机制，显著提升大语言模型的工具使用能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习框架在工具使用方面效率不足，缺乏稳定的训练环境和可验证的奖励机制。

Method: 设计了自动化环境构建流程（包括场景分解、文档生成等）和可验证奖励机制，结合标准强化学习算法进行训练。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了模型的工具使用能力，且不影响其通用能力。

Conclusion: 通过改进上下文理解和推理，模型在工具使用方面取得了显著进步。

Abstract: Effective tool use is essential for large language models (LLMs) to interact
meaningfully with their environment. However, progress is limited by the lack
of efficient reinforcement learning (RL) frameworks specifically designed for
tool use, due to challenges in constructing stable training environments and
designing verifiable reward mechanisms. To address this, we propose an
automated environment construction pipeline, incorporating scenario
decomposition, document generation, function integration, complexity scaling,
and localized deployment. This enables the creation of high-quality training
environments that provide detailed and measurable feedback without relying on
external tools. Additionally, we introduce a verifiable reward mechanism that
evaluates both the precision of tool use and the completeness of task
execution. When combined with trajectory data collected from the constructed
environments, this mechanism integrates seamlessly with standard RL algorithms
to facilitate feedback-driven model training. Experiments on LLMs of varying
scales demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances the models'
tool-use performance without degrading their general capabilities, regardless
of inference modes or training algorithms. Our analysis suggests that these
gains result from improved context understanding and reasoning, driven by
updates to the lower-layer MLP parameters in models.

TL;DR: 论文提出TiMoE方法，通过分时段预训练语言模型并因果路由，解决LLMs知识过时问题，减少未来信息泄漏。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型因固定训练数据导致知识过时和预测时可能依赖未来信息的问题。

Method: 预训练GPT风格专家模型，分时段处理2013-2024数据，通过TiMoE因果路由合并专家输出。

Result: TiMoE在8个NLP任务和TSQA基准上表现优异，减少未来知识错误达15%。

Conclusion: 分时段预训练与因果路由结合是保持LLMs时间有效性的简单有效方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are typically trained on fixed snapshots of the
web, which means that their knowledge becomes stale and their predictions risk
temporal leakage: relying on information that lies in the future relative to a
query. We tackle this problem by pre-training from scratch a set of GPT-style
experts on disjoint two-year slices of a 2013-2024 corpus and combining them
through TiMoE, a Time-aware Mixture of Language Experts. At inference time,
TiMoE masks all experts whose training window ends after the query timestamp
and merges the remaining log-probabilities in a shared space, guaranteeing
strict causal validity while retaining the breadth of multi-period knowledge.
We also release TSQA, a 10k-question benchmark whose alternatives are
explicitly labelled as past, future or irrelevant, allowing fine-grained
measurement of temporal hallucinations. Experiments on eight standard NLP tasks
plus TSQA show that a co-adapted TiMoE variant matches or exceeds the best
single-period expert and cuts future-knowledge errors by up to 15%. Our results
demonstrate that modular, time-segmented pre-training paired with causal
routing is a simple yet effective path toward LLMs that stay chronologically
grounded without sacrificing general performance much. We open source our code
at TiMoE (Github): https://github.com/epfml/TiMoE

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法难以全面评估LLMs的数学推理鲁棒性，因此需要一种新方法来测试其对非数学扰动的敏感性。

Method: 通过数学等价但语言和参数变化的问题变体，创建PutnamGAP数据集，评估多种LLMs的鲁棒性。

Result: 实验显示，18个商业和开源模型在变体问题上表现显著下降，如OpenAI的O3模型在核心变体上下降10.5个百分点。

Conclusion: 新评估方法有效揭示了LLMs的鲁棒性不足，为提升其数学推理能力提供了新见解。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a systematic framework beyond conventional method
to assess LLMs' mathematical-reasoning robustness by stress-testing them on
advanced math problems that are mathematically equivalent but with linguistic
and parametric variation. These transformations allow us to measure the
sensitivity of LLMs to non-mathematical perturbations, thereby enabling a more
accurate evaluation of their mathematical reasoning capabilities. Using this
new evaluation methodology, we created PutnamGAP, a new benchmark dataset with
multiple mathematically-equivalent variations of competition-level math
problems. With the new dataset, we evaluate multiple families of representative
LLMs and examine their robustness. Across 18 commercial and open-source models
we observe sharp performance degradation on the variants. OpenAI's flagship
reasoning model, O3, scores 49 % on the originals but drops by 4 percentage
points on surface variants, and by 10.5 percentage points on core-step-based
variants, while smaller models fare far worse. Overall, the results show that
the proposed new evaluation methodology is effective for deepening our
understanding of the robustness of LLMs and generating new insights for further
improving their mathematical reasoning capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在现实应用中广泛使用，但其编码和再现意识形态偏见的问题仍然存在，尤其是在政治和经济维度上。

Method: 基于政治罗盘测试（PCT），使用对比对提取和比较模型（如Mistral和DeepSeek）的隐藏层激活，并引入层间分析的激活提取流程。

Result: 研究发现解码器型LLM在各层中系统性地编码了表征偏见，可通过导向向量有效缓解。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了LLM中政治偏见的编码方式，并提供了一种超越表层干预的去偏见方法。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have enabled their
widespread use across diverse real-world applications. However, concerns remain
about their tendency to encode and reproduce ideological biases, particularly
along political and economic dimensions. In this paper, we propose a framework
for probing and mitigating such biases in decoder-based LLMs through analysis
of internal model representations. Grounded in the Political Compass Test
(PCT), our method uses contrastive pairs to extract and compare hidden layer
activations from models like Mistral and DeepSeek. We introduce a comprehensive
activation extraction pipeline capable of layer-wise analysis across multiple
ideological axes, revealing meaningful disparities linked to political framing.
Our results show that decoder LLMs systematically encode representational bias
across layers, which can be leveraged for effective steering vector-based
mitigation. This work provides new insights into how political bias is encoded
in LLMs and offers a principled approach to debiasing beyond surface-level
output interventions.

Motivation: 理解大型语言模型中的偏见和刻板印象对制定有效的缓解策略至关重要，但偏见行为往往难以隔离和分析。

Method: BiasGym包含BiasInject（通过微调注入偏见）和BiasScope（识别和修正偏见行为），支持系统性分析和针对性去偏见。

Conclusion: BiasGym为安全干预和可解释性研究提供了实用工具，支持未见过的偏见泛化分析。

Abstract: Understanding biases and stereotypes encoded in the weights of Large Language
Models (LLMs) is crucial for developing effective mitigation strategies. Biased
behaviour is often subtle and non-trivial to isolate, even when deliberately
elicited, making systematic analysis and debiasing particularly challenging. To
address this, we introduce BiasGym, a simple, cost-effective, and generalizable
framework for reliably injecting, analyzing, and mitigating conceptual
associations within LLMs. BiasGym consists of two components: BiasInject, which
injects specific biases into the model via token-based fine-tuning while
keeping the model frozen, and BiasScope, which leverages these injected signals
to identify and steer the components responsible for biased behavior. Our
method enables consistent bias elicitation for mechanistic analysis, supports
targeted debiasing without degrading performance on downstream tasks, and
generalizes to biases unseen during training. We demonstrate the effectiveness
of BiasGym in reducing real-world stereotypes (e.g., people from a country
being `reckless drivers') and in probing fictional associations (e.g., people
from a country having `blue skin'), showing its utility for both safety
interventions and interpretability research.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 放射学报告的质量评估依赖资深医生，成本高且可能不准确，需要自动化解决方案。

Method: Sqator通过分析初级和高级报告之间的修订文本跨度的重要性，自动生成质量评分。

Result: 在12,013份放射学报告上的实验显示，Sqator能生成与资深医生判断一致的评分。

Conclusion: Sqator是一种有效的自动化放射学报告质量评估工具，可减少人工依赖并提高准确性。

Abstract: Quality Assurance (QA) for radiology reports refers to judging whether the
junior reports (written by junior doctors) are qualified. The QA scores of one
junior report are given by the senior doctor(s) after reviewing the image and
junior report. This process requires intensive labor costs for senior doctors.
Additionally, the QA scores may be inaccurate for reasons like diagnosis bias,
the ability of senior doctors, and so on. To address this issue, we propose a
Span-level Quality Assurance EvaluaTOR (Sqator) to mark QA scores
automatically. Unlike the common document-level semantic comparison method, we
try to analyze the semantic difference by exploring more fine-grained text
spans. Unlike the common document-level semantic comparison method, we try to
analyze the semantic difference by exploring more fine-grained text spans.
Specifically, Sqator measures QA scores by measuring the importance of revised
spans between junior and senior reports, and outputs the final QA scores by
merging all revised span scores. We evaluate Sqator using a collection of
12,013 radiology reports. Experimental results show that Sqator can achieve
competitive QA scores. Moreover, the importance scores of revised spans can be
also consistent with the judgments of senior doctors.

Motivation: 随着LLMs在不同文化背景中的广泛应用，理解其内部机制如何导致文化（错误）表征变得至关重要。

Method: 提出Culturescope方法，采用修补技术提取文化知识，并引入文化扁平化分数衡量内在文化偏见。

Result: 实验显示LLMs的文化知识空间中存在西方主导偏见和文化扁平化，低资源文化因训练数据有限而偏见较少。

Conclusion: 研究为未来减轻文化偏见和提升LLMs文化理解奠定了基础。

Abstract: The growing deployment of large language models (LLMs) across diverse
cultural contexts necessitates a better understanding of how the
overgeneralization of less documented cultures within LLMs' representations
impacts their cultural understanding. Prior work only performs extrinsic
evaluation of LLMs' cultural competence, without accounting for how LLMs'
internal mechanisms lead to cultural (mis)representation. To bridge this gap,
we propose Culturescope, the first mechanistic interpretability-based method
that probes the internal representations of LLMs to elicit the underlying
cultural knowledge space. CultureScope utilizes a patching method to extract
the cultural knowledge. We introduce a cultural flattening score as a measure
of the intrinsic cultural biases. Additionally, we study how LLMs internalize
Western-dominance bias and cultural flattening, which allows us to trace how
cultural biases emerge within LLMs. Our experimental results reveal that LLMs
encode Western-dominance bias and cultural flattening in their cultural
knowledge space. We find that low-resource cultures are less susceptible to
cultural biases, likely due to their limited training resources. Our work
provides a foundation for future research on mitigating cultural biases and
enhancing LLMs' cultural understanding. Our codes and data used for experiments
are publicly available.

Conclusion: ASPD为高效LLM并行推理设定了新基准，适用于延迟敏感应用。

Abstract: The increasing scale and complexity of large language models (LLMs) pose
significant inference latency challenges, primarily due to their autoregressive
decoding paradigm characterized by the sequential nature of next-token
prediction. By re-examining the outputs of autoregressive models, we observed
that some segments exhibit parallelizable structures, which we term intrinsic
parallelism. Decoding each parallelizable branch simultaneously (i.e. parallel
decoding) can significantly improve the overall inference speed of LLMs. In
this paper, we propose an Adaptive Serial-Parallel Decoding (ASPD), which
addresses two core challenges: automated construction of parallelizable data
and efficient parallel decoding mechanism. More specifically, we introduce a
non-invasive pipeline that automatically extracts and validates parallelizable
structures from the responses of autoregressive models. To empower efficient
adaptive serial-parallel decoding, we implement a Hybrid Decoding Engine which
enables seamless transitions between serial and parallel decoding modes while
maintaining a reusable KV cache, maximizing computational efficiency. Extensive
evaluations across General Tasks, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, Mathematical
Reasoning, demonstrate that ASPD achieves unprecedented performance in both
effectiveness and efficiency. Notably, on Vicuna Bench, our method achieves up
to 3.19x speedup (1.85x on average) while maintaining response quality within
1% difference compared to autoregressive models, realizing significant
acceleration without compromising generation quality. Our framework sets a
groundbreaking benchmark for efficient LLM parallel inference, paving the way
for its deployment in latency-sensitive applications such as AI-powered
customer service bots and answer retrieval engines.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合弱监督学习和监督微调的可扩展训练流程，用于开发鲁棒的阿拉伯语自动语音识别（ASR）模型，解决了低资源语言的数据稀缺问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发准确的阿拉伯语ASR系统面临数据稀缺和方言多样性的挑战，需要一种高效的方法来克服这些限制。

Method: 采用两阶段训练流程：首先在15,000小时的弱标记语音数据上进行预训练，随后结合过滤后的弱标记数据和小规模高质量标注数据进行监督微调。

Result: 在多方言阿拉伯语ASR挑战中取得最佳成绩，证明了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 弱监督与微调结合的方法能有效解决低资源语言的ASR问题，尤其适用于方言丰富的语言。

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) plays a vital role in enabling natural
human-machine interaction across applications such as virtual assistants,
industrial automation, customer support, and real-time transcription. However,
developing accurate ASR systems for low-resource languages like Arabic remains
a significant challenge due to limited labeled data and the linguistic
complexity introduced by diverse dialects. In this work, we present a scalable
training pipeline that combines weakly supervised learning with supervised
fine-tuning to develop a robust Arabic ASR model. In the first stage, we
pretrain the model on 15,000 hours of weakly labeled speech covering both
Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and various Dialectal Arabic (DA) variants. In the
subsequent stage, we perform continual supervised fine-tuning using a mixture
of filtered weakly labeled data and a small, high-quality annotated dataset.
Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results, ranking first in the
multi-dialectal Arabic ASR challenge. These findings highlight the
effectiveness of weak supervision paired with fine-tuning in overcoming data
scarcity and delivering high-quality ASR for low-resource, dialect-rich
languages.

Conclusion: 不同模型和语言中，推理步骤对预测的贡献存在差异。

Abstract: Language models have demonstrated remarkable performance on complex
multi-step reasoning tasks. However, their evaluation has been predominantly
confined to high-resource languages such as English. In this paper, we
introduce a manually translated Bangla multi-step reasoning dataset derived
from the English Reveal dataset, featuring both binary and non-binary question
types. We conduct a controlled evaluation of English-centric and Bangla-centric
multilingual small language models on the original dataset and our translated
version to compare their ability to exploit relevant reasoning steps to produce
correct answers. Our results show that, in comparable settings, reasoning
context is beneficial for more challenging non-binary questions, but models
struggle to employ relevant Bangla reasoning steps effectively. We conclude by
exploring how reasoning steps contribute to models' predictions, highlighting
different trends across models and languages.

Result: 在多个数据集上验证，课程学习方法在相同最终预算下优于固定预算基线，提高了准确性和token效率。

Conclusion: 渐进约束是一种有效的归纳偏置，可训练高效的推理模型。

Abstract: Recent work on enhancing the reasoning abilities of large language models
(LLMs) has introduced explicit length control as a means of constraining
computational cost while preserving accuracy. However, existing approaches rely
on fixed-length training budgets, which do not take advantage of the natural
progression from exploration to compression during learning. In this work, we
propose a curriculum learning strategy for length-controlled reasoning using
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Our method starts with generous
token budgets and gradually tightens them over training, encouraging models to
first discover effective solution strategies and then distill them into more
concise reasoning traces. We augment GRPO with a reward function that balances
three signals: task correctness (via verifier feedback), length efficiency, and
formatting adherence (via structural tags). Experiments on GSM8K, MATH500,
SVAMP, College Math, and GSM+ demonstrate that curriculum-based training
consistently outperforms fixed-budget baselines at the same final budget,
achieving higher accuracy and significantly improved token efficiency. We
further ablate the impact of reward weighting and decay schedule design,
showing that progressive constraint serves as a powerful inductive bias for
training efficient reasoning models. Our code and checkpoints are released at:

TL;DR: LoDIT是一种通过利用特定token logits在生成过程中联合生成并忠实归因答案的方法，显著优于现有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型（LLMs）的幻觉问题，提升其可信度，特别是在生成答案时直接对齐token生成与归因生成。

Method: LoDIT通过两步实现：(1) 用特定token标识标记文档，并利用这些token的logits估计文档对答案的贡献；(2) 将这些贡献聚合为文档归因。

Result: 在Trust-Align基准测试中，LoDIT在多个指标上显著优于现有模型，且延迟低、鲁棒性强。

Conclusion: LoDIT是一种高效、鲁棒的方法，能够显著提升LLM生成答案的可信度和归因准确性。

Abstract: Despite their impressive performances, Large Language Models (LLMs) remain
prone to hallucination, which critically undermines their trustworthiness.
While most of the previous work focused on tackling answer and attribution
correctness, a recent line of work investigated faithfulness, with a focus on
leveraging internal model signals to reflect a model's actual decision-making
process while generating the answer. Nevertheless, these methods induce
additional latency and have shown limitations in directly aligning token
generation with attribution generation. In this paper, we introduce LoDIT, a
method that jointly generates and faithfully attributes answers in RAG by
leveraging specific token logits during generation. It consists of two steps:
(1) marking the documents with specific token identifiers and then leveraging
the logits of these tokens to estimate the contribution of each document to the
answer during generation, and (2) aggregating these contributions into document
attributions. Experiments on a trustworthiness-focused attributed
text-generation benchmark, Trust-Align, show that LoDIT significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art models on several metrics. Finally, an in-depth
analysis of LoDIT shows both its efficiency in terms of latency and its
robustness in different settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决KV缓存在长上下文任务中的内存占用和延迟问题，特别是累积注意力错误的修正。

Method: 引入RetroAttention技术，通过轻量级输出缓存修正过去的注意力输出，利用后续解码步骤的新KV条目。

Result: 在长生成基准测试中，RetroAttention显著优于现有KV压缩方法，有效KV暴露提升1.6倍，准确率提升21.9%。

Conclusion: RetroAttention打破了固定注意力输出范式，实现了对先前近似值的持续修正，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in long-context tasks
such as reasoning, code generation, and multi-turn dialogue. However, inference
over extended contexts is bottlenecked by the Key-Value (KV) cache, whose
memory footprint grows linearly with sequence length and dominates latency at
each decoding step. While recent KV cache compression methods identify and load
important tokens, they focus predominantly on input contexts and fail to
address the cumulative attention errors that arise during long decoding. In
this paper, we introduce RetroAttention, a novel KV cache update technique that
retrospectively revises past attention outputs using newly arrived KV entries
from subsequent decoding steps. By maintaining a lightweight output cache,
RetroAttention enables past queries to efficiently access more relevant
context, while incurring minimal latency overhead. This breaks the
fixed-attention-output paradigm and allows continual correction of prior
approximations. Extensive experiments on long-generation benchmarks show that
RetroAttention consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) KV compression
methods, increasing effective KV exposure by up to 1.6$\times$ and accuracy by
up to 21.9\%.

Abstract: This paper describes our participation in SemEval 2025 Task 8, focused on
Tabular Question Answering. We developed a zero-shot pipeline that leverages an
Large Language Model to generate functional code capable of extracting the
relevant information from tabular data based on an input question. Our approach
consists of a modular pipeline where the main code generator module is
supported by additional components that identify the most relevant columns and
analyze their data types to improve extraction accuracy. In the event that the
generated code fails, an iterative refinement process is triggered,
incorporating the error feedback into a new generation prompt to enhance
robustness. Our results show that zero-shot code generation is a valid approach
for Tabular QA, achieving rank 33 of 53 in the test phase despite the lack of
task-specific fine-tuning.

Abstract: The alignment of large language models (LLMs) aims to ensure their outputs
adhere to human values, ethical standards, and legal norms. Traditional
alignment methods often rely on resource-intensive fine-tuning (FT), which may
suffer from knowledge degradation and face challenges in scenarios where the
model accessibility or computational resources are constrained. In contrast,
training-free (TF) alignment techniques--leveraging in-context learning,
decoding-time adjustments, and post-generation corrections--offer a promising
alternative by enabling alignment without heavily retraining LLMs, making them
adaptable to both open-source and closed-source environments. This paper
presents the first systematic review of TF alignment methods, categorizing them
by stages of pre-decoding, in-decoding, and post-decoding. For each stage, we
provide a detailed examination from the viewpoint of LLMs and multimodal LLMs
(MLLMs), highlighting their mechanisms and limitations. Furthermore, we
identify key challenges and future directions, paving the way for more
inclusive and effective TF alignment techniques. By synthesizing and organizing
the rapidly growing body of research, this survey offers a guidance for
practitioners and advances the development of safer and more reliable LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM在心理治疗中具有潜力，但直接应用于患者场景存在伦理和安全问题，因此转向开发LLM作为监督者培训治疗师。

Method: 建立错误行为指南和纠正策略，构建人机对话反馈数据集，通过微调生成监督模型。

Result: 实验表明，基于MATE数据集微调的模型能根据临床指南提供高质量反馈。

Conclusion: 该方法在治疗师培训场景中显示出显著潜力。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) hold significant promise in
psychotherapy, their direct application in patient-facing scenarios raises
ethical and safety concerns. Therefore, this work shifts towards developing an
LLM as a supervisor to train real therapists. In addition to the privacy of
clinical therapist training data, a fundamental contradiction complicates the
training of therapeutic behaviors: clear feedback standards are necessary to
ensure a controlled training system, yet there is no absolute "gold standard"
for appropriate therapeutic behaviors in practice. In contrast, many common
therapeutic mistakes are universal and identifiable, making them effective
triggers for targeted feedback that can serve as clearer evidence. Motivated by
this, we create a novel therapist-training paradigm: (1) guidelines for
mistaken behaviors and targeted correction strategies are first established as
standards; (2) a human-in-the-loop dialogue-feedback dataset is then
constructed, where a mistake-prone agent intentionally makes standard mistakes
during interviews naturally, and a supervisor agent locates and identifies
mistakes and provides targeted feedback; (3) after fine-tuning on this dataset,
the final supervisor model is provided for real therapist training. The
detailed experimental results of automated, human and downstream assessments
demonstrate that models fine-tuned on our dataset MATE, can provide
high-quality feedback according to the clinical guideline, showing significant
potential for the therapist training scenario.

Abstract: Given the significant advances in Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) in
reasoning and visual understanding, mobile agents are rapidly emerging to meet
users' automation needs. However, existing evaluation benchmarks are
disconnected from the real world and fail to adequately address the diverse and
complex requirements of users. From our extensive collection of user

\textbf{MVISU-Bench}, a bilingual benchmark that includes 404 tasks across 137
mobile applications. Furthermore, we propose Aider, a plug-and-play module that
acts as a dynamic prompt prompter to mitigate risks and clarify user intent for
mobile agents. Our Aider is easy to integrate into several frameworks and has
successfully improved overall success rates by 19.55\% compared to the current
state-of-the-art (SOTA) on MVISU-Bench. Specifically, it achieves success rate
improvements of 53.52\% and 29.41\% for unethical and interactive instructions,
respectively. Through extensive experiments and analysis, we highlight the gap

Result: READER在批量任务中速度提升超40%，检索增强任务中达10倍加速。

Conclusion: READER为LLM推理提供高效、无需训练的解决方案，特别适合工业应用。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) generate tokens autoregressively, with each
token depending on the preceding context. This sequential nature makes the
inference process inherently difficult to accelerate, posing a significant
challenge for efficient deployment. In recent years, various methods have been
proposed to address this issue, with the most effective approaches often
involving the training of additional draft models. In this paper, we introduce
READER (Retrieval-Assisted Drafter for Efficient LLM Inference), a novel
lossless speculative decoding method that enhances model-based approaches by
leveraging self-repetitions in the text. Our algorithm expands the speculative
decoding tree using tokens obtained through statistical search. This work
focuses on large batch sizes (>= 8), an underexplored yet important area for
industrial applications. We also analyze the key-value (KV) cache size during
speculative decoding and propose an optimization to improve performance for
large batches. As a result, READER outperforms existing speculative decoding
methods. Notably, READER requires no additional training and can reuse
pre-trained speculator models, increasing the speedup by over 40\%. Our method
demonstrates particularly strong performance on search-based tasks, such as
retrieval-augmented generation, where we achieve more than 10x speedup.

Motivation: 传统奖励建模方法在主观任务（如角色扮演对话）中面临主观评价标准和不稳定奖励信号的挑战。

Method: 提出CPO，将奖励评估从样本级评分转向组间比较评分，并设计CharacterArena框架进行多轮角色扮演模拟和轨迹级比较评估。

Result: 实验结果表明，CPO有效减少奖励模糊性，显著提升对话质量。

Conclusion: CPO和CharacterArena为强化学习在主观任务中的应用提供了更稳健和公平的评估方法。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning Fine-Tuning (RLFT) has achieved notable success in
tasks with objectively verifiable answers (e.g., code generation, mathematical
reasoning), yet struggles with open-ended subjective tasks like role-playing
dialogue. Traditional reward modeling approaches, which rely on independent
sample-wise scoring, face dual challenges: subjective evaluation criteria and
unstable reward signals.Motivated by the insight that human evaluation
inherently combines explicit criteria with implicit comparative judgments, we
propose Comparative Policy Optimization (CPO). CPO redefines the reward
evaluation paradigm by shifting from sample-wise scoring to comparative
group-wise scoring.Building on the same principle, we introduce the
CharacterArena evaluation framework, which comprises two stages:(1)
Contextualized Multi-turn Role-playing Simulation, and (2) Trajectory-level
Comparative Evaluation. By operationalizing subjective scoring via objective
trajectory comparisons, CharacterArena minimizes contextual bias and enables
more robust and fair performance evaluation. Empirical results on
CharacterEval, CharacterBench, and CharacterArena confirm that CPO effectively
mitigates reward ambiguity and leads to substantial improvements in dialogue
quality.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在低资源语言上性能下降的问题，因训练数据以英语为中心。

Method: 融合所有中间层，采用全局和Transformer Softmax加权策略，映射到LLM嵌入空间。

Result: 在XNLI等任务中显著超越基线，低资源语言如Sinhala准确率提升至75.86%。

Conclusion: 该方法为多语言LLM提供了高效、可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in English, but their performance degrades
significantly on low-resource languages (LRLs) due to English-centric training.
While methods like LangBridge align LLMs with multilingual encoders such as the
Massively Multilingual Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer (mT5), they typically
use only the final encoder layer. We propose a novel architecture that fuses
all intermediate layers, enriching the linguistic information passed to the
LLM. Our approach features two strategies: (1) a Global Softmax weighting for
overall layer importance, and (2) a Transformer Softmax model that learns
token-specific weights. The fused representations are mapped into the LLM's
embedding space, enabling it to process multilingual inputs. The model is
trained only on English data, without using any parallel or multilingual data.
Evaluated on XNLI, IndicXNLI, Sinhala News Classification, and Amazon Reviews,
our Transformer Softmax model significantly outperforms the LangBridge
baseline. We observe strong performance gains in LRLs, improving Sinhala
classification accuracy from 71.66% to 75.86% and achieving clear improvements
across Indic languages such as Tamil, Bengali, and Malayalam. These specific
gains contribute to an overall boost in average XNLI accuracy from 70.36% to
71.50%. This approach offers a scalable, data-efficient path toward more
capable and equitable multilingual LLMs.

Conclusion: 通过领域适配和增强推理能力，CDCR模型可有效提升流程工业中事件日志的数据质量和关联性。

Abstract: Knowledge management (KM) is vital in the process industry for optimizing
operations, ensuring safety, and enabling continuous improvement through
effective use of operational data and past insights. A key challenge in this
domain is the fragmented nature of event logs in shift books, where related
records, e.g., entries documenting issues related to equipment or processes and
the corresponding solutions, may remain disconnected. This fragmentation
hinders the recommendation of previous solutions to the users. To address this
problem, we investigate record linking (RL) as link prediction, commonly
studied in graph-based machine learning, by framing it as a cross-document
coreference resolution (CDCR) task enhanced with natural language inference
(NLI) and semantic text similarity (STS) by shifting it into the causal
inference (CI). We adapt CDCR, traditionally applied in the news domain, into
an RL model to operate at the passage level, similar to NLI and STS, while
accommodating the process industry's specific text formats, which contain
unstructured text and structured record attributes. Our RL model outperformed
the best versions of NLI- and STS-driven baselines by 28% (11.43 points) and
27% (11.21 points), respectively. Our work demonstrates how domain adaptation
of the state-of-the-art CDCR models, enhanced with reasoning capabilities, can
be effectively tailored to the process industry, improving data quality and
connectivity in shift logs.

Conclusion: AutoCodeBench系列为多语言代码生成提供了有价值的资源，鼓励社区关注更具挑战性和实用性的任务。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
various domains, with code generation emerging as a key area of focus. While
numerous benchmarks have been proposed to evaluate their code generation
abilities, these benchmarks face several critical limitations. First, they
often rely on manual annotations, which are time-consuming and difficult to
scale across different programming languages and problem complexities. Second,
most existing benchmarks focus primarily on Python, while the few multilingual
benchmarks suffer from limited difficulty and uneven language distribution. To
address these challenges, we propose AutoCodeGen, an automated method for
generating high-difficulty multilingual code generation datasets without manual
annotations. AutoCodeGen ensures the correctness and completeness of test cases
by generating test inputs with LLMs and obtaining test outputs through a
multilingual sandbox, while achieving high data quality through reverse-order
problem generation and multiple filtering steps. Using this novel method, we
introduce AutoCodeBench, a large-scale code generation benchmark comprising
3,920 problems evenly distributed across 20 programming languages. It is
specifically designed to evaluate LLMs on challenging, diverse, and practical
multilingual tasks. We evaluate over 30 leading open-source and proprietary
LLMs on AutoCodeBench and its simplified version AutoCodeBench-Lite. The
results show that even the most advanced LLMs struggle with the complexity,
diversity, and multilingual nature of these tasks. Besides, we introduce
AutoCodeBench-Complete, specifically designed for base models to assess their
few-shot code generation capabilities. We hope the AutoCodeBench series will
serve as a valuable resource and inspire the community to focus on more
challenging and practical multilingual code generation scenarios.

*H. W. K. Aravinda,Rashad Sirajudeen,Samith Karunathilake,Nisansa de Silva,Surangika Ranathunga,Rishemjit Kaur*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 扩展Llama-3-8B以支持低资源语言Sinhala，通过增强分词器和持续预训练，创建首个支持Sinhala的开源解码器模型SinLlama，并在分类任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决开源大语言模型对低资源语言（如Sinhala）支持不足的问题。

Method: 增强Llama-3-8B的分词器以支持Sinhala词汇，并在10百万Sinhala语料库上进行持续预训练，创建SinLlama模型。

Result: SinLlama在三个文本分类任务中显著优于Llama-3-8B及其指令变体。

Conclusion: SinLlama是首个支持Sinhala的开源解码器模型，为低资源语言提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Low-resource languages such as Sinhala are often overlooked by open-source
Large Language Models (LLMs). In this research, we extend an existing
multilingual LLM (Llama-3-8B) to better serve Sinhala. We enhance the LLM
tokenizer with Sinhala specific vocabulary and perform continual pre-training
on a cleaned 10 million Sinhala corpus, resulting in the SinLlama model. This
is the very first decoder-based open-source LLM with explicit Sinhala support.
When SinLlama was instruction fine-tuned for three text classification tasks,
it outperformed base and instruct variants of Llama-3-8B by a significant
margin.

*Weixuan Wang,Dongge Han,Daniel Madrigal Diaz,Jin Xu,Victor Rühle,Saravan Rajmohan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: OdysseyBench是一个用于评估大型语言模型（LLM）代理在长期工作流程中表现的基准，填补了现有基准在捕捉长期上下文依赖和多交互协调方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注独立任务，无法反映现实场景中的长期依赖和复杂协调需求，因此需要新的评估工具。

Method: 提出OdysseyBench，包含两个部分：OdysseyBench+（300个真实用例任务）和OdysseyBench-Neo（302个合成复杂任务），并开发HomerAgents框架自动化生成基准。

Result: OdysseyBench能有效挑战现有LLM代理，提供比传统基准更准确的复杂场景评估。

Conclusion: OdysseyBench是推动LLM代理在现实生产力场景中发展的宝贵资源，已公开发布以促进相关研究。

Abstract: Autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) are increasingly
deployed in real-world applications requiring complex, long-horizon workflows.
However, existing benchmarks predominantly focus on atomic tasks that are
self-contained and independent, failing to capture the long-term contextual
dependencies and multi-interaction coordination required in realistic
scenarios. To address this gap, we introduce OdysseyBench, a comprehensive
benchmark for evaluating LLM agents on long-horizon workflows across diverse
office applications including Word, Excel, PDF, Email, and Calendar. Our
benchmark comprises two complementary splits: OdysseyBench+ with 300 tasks
derived from real-world use cases, and OdysseyBench-Neo with 302 newly
synthesized complex tasks. Each task requires agent to identify essential
information from long-horizon interaction histories and perform multi-step
reasoning across various applications. To enable scalable benchmark creation,
we propose HomerAgents, a multi-agent framework that automates the generation
of long-horizon workflow benchmarks through systematic environment exploration,
task generation, and dialogue synthesis. Our extensive evaluation demonstrates
that OdysseyBench effectively challenges state-of-the-art LLM agents, providing
more accurate assessment of their capabilities in complex, real-world contexts
compared to existing atomic task benchmarks. We believe that OdysseyBench will
serve as a valuable resource for advancing the development and evaluation of
LLM agents in real-world productivity scenarios. In addition, we release
OdysseyBench and HomerAgents to foster research along this line.

TL;DR: 论文提出LogicIFGen和LogicIFEval，前者是生成逻辑丰富指令的自动化框架，后者是基于复杂代码构建的包含426条指令的基准。实验显示当前LLMs在遵循逻辑复杂指令时表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型语言模型（LLMs）在逻辑丰富指令上的表现，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 提出LogicIFGen框架，从代码函数生成可验证的逻辑丰富指令，并构建LogicIFEval基准。

Result: 实验表明，当前最先进的LLMs在LogicIFEval上表现不佳，仅能正确遵循不到60%的指令。

Conclusion: LLMs在逻辑复杂指令的遵循能力上存在显著不足，需进一步改进。

Abstract: Instruction following has catalyzed the recent era of Large Language Models
(LLMs) and is the foundational skill underpinning more advanced capabilities
such as reasoning and agentic behaviors. As tasks grow more challenging, the
logic structures embedded in natural language instructions becomes increasingly
intricate. However, how well LLMs perform on such logic-rich instructions
remains under-explored. We propose LogicIFGen and LogicIFEval. LogicIFGen is a
scalable, automated framework for generating verifiable instructions from code
functions, which can naturally express rich logic such as conditionals,
nesting, recursion, and function calls. We further curate a collection of
complex code functions and use LogicIFGen to construct LogicIFEval, a benchmark
comprising 426 verifiable logic-rich instructions. Our experiments demonstrate
that current state-of-the-art LLMs still struggle to correctly follow the
instructions in LogicIFEval. Most LLMs can only follow fewer than 60% of the
instructions, revealing significant deficiencies in the instruction-following
ability. Code and Benchmark: https://github.com/mianzhang/LogicIF

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文揭示了扩散大语言模型（dLLMs）在解码过程中存在时间振荡现象，并提出两种利用时间一致性的方法：Temporal Self-Consistency Voting和Temporal Consistency Reinforcement，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前dLLMs的解码策略忽略了中间预测信息，导致正确结果可能在中间步骤被覆盖。论文旨在利用时间动态信息提升模型表现。

Method: 1) Temporal Self-Consistency Voting：一种无需训练的测试时解码策略，聚合多步预测选择最一致输出；2) Temporal Consistency Reinforcement：通过Temporal Semantic Entropy（TSE）作为奖励信号，鼓励稳定生成。

Result: 实验显示，仅使用负TSE奖励时，Countdown数据集上平均提升24.7%；结合准确性奖励后，GSM8K、MATH500、SVAMP和Countdown分别提升2.0%、4.3%、6.6%和25.3%。

Conclusion: 论文揭示了dLLMs中时间动态的潜力，并提供了两种简单有效的工具来利用这些动态信息。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) generate text through iterative
denoising, yet current decoding strategies discard rich intermediate
predictions in favor of the final output. Our work here reveals a critical
phenomenon, temporal oscillation, where correct answers often emerge in the
middle process, but are overwritten in later denoising steps. To address this
issue, we introduce two complementary methods that exploit temporal
consistency: 1) Temporal Self-Consistency Voting, a training-free, test-time
decoding strategy that aggregates predictions across denoising steps to select
the most consistent output; and 2) a post-training method termed Temporal
Consistency Reinforcement, which uses Temporal Semantic Entropy (TSE), a
measure of semantic stability across intermediate predictions, as a reward
signal to encourage stable generations. Empirical results across multiple
benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Using the negative
TSE reward alone, we observe a remarkable average improvement of 24.7% on the
Countdown dataset over an existing dLLM. Combined with the accuracy reward, we
achieve absolute gains of 2.0% on GSM8K, 4.3% on MATH500, 6.6% on SVAMP, and
25.3% on Countdown, respectively. Our findings underscore the untapped
potential of temporal dynamics in dLLMs and offer two simple yet effective
tools to harness them.

### [135] [Topos Theory for Generative AI and LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08293)
*Sridhar Mahadevan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于拓扑理论的新型分类生成AI架构（GAIAs），利用范畴论中的通用构造构建了新的LLM架构，并验证了其拓扑性质。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM研究多关注线性架构或专家混合模型，缺乏对范畴论中通用构造的探索。本文旨在利用拓扑理论构建更具表达力的LLM架构。

Method: 通过范畴论中的通用构造（如拉回、推出、指数对象等）设计新型LLM架构，并验证其拓扑性质（如完备性、存在子对象分类器等）。

Result: 证明了LLM范畴具有完备性，且构成一个拓扑（类似集合的范畴），为新型架构提供了理论基础。

Conclusion: 基于拓扑理论的LLM架构具有更强的表达能力和通用性，为未来生成AI设计提供了新方向。

Abstract: We propose the design of novel categorical generative AI architectures
(GAIAs) using topos theory, a type of category that is ``set-like": a topos has
all (co)limits, is Cartesian closed, and has a subobject classifier. Previous
theoretical results on the Transformer model have shown that it is a universal
sequence-to-sequence function approximator, and dense in the space of all
continuous functions with compact support on the Euclidean space of embeddings
of tokens. Building on this theoretical result, we explore novel architectures
for LLMs that exploit the property that the category of LLMs, viewed as
functions, forms a topos. Previous studies of large language models (LLMs) have
focused on daisy-chained linear architectures or mixture-of-experts. In this
paper, we use universal constructions in category theory to construct novel LLM
architectures based on new types of compositional structures. In particular,
these new compositional structures are derived from universal properties of LLM
categories, and include pullback, pushout, (co) equalizers, exponential
objects, and subobject classifiers. We theoretically validate these new
compositional structures by showing that the category of LLMs is (co)complete,
meaning that all diagrams have solutions in the form of (co)limits. Building on
this completeness result, we then show that the category of LLMs forms a topos,
a ``set-like" category, which requires showing the existence of exponential
objects as well as subobject classifiers. We use a functorial characterization
of backpropagation to define a potential implementation of an LLM topos
architecture.

### [136] [Topos Causal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08295)
*Sridhar Mahadevan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新型因果模型——拓扑因果模型（TCMs），利用拓扑范畴的关键性质（如完备性、子对象分类器和指数对象）解决因果推理中的复杂问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统因果模型在处理复杂因果图时存在局限性，TCMs通过拓扑范畴的数学工具提供更强大的建模能力。

Method: TCMs基于拓扑范畴的完备性、子对象分类器和指数对象，定义了局部因果机制并组合为全局函数。

Result: 证明了TCMs范畴的完备性，展示了如何通过极限和余极限解决任意因果图，并利用内部逻辑进行因果推理。

Conclusion: TCMs为因果推理提供了更灵活的数学框架，能够处理复杂因果关系和干预操作。

Abstract: We propose topos causal models (TCMs), a novel class of causal models that
exploit the key properties of a topos category: they are (co)complete, meaning
all (co)limits exist, they admit a subobject classifier, and allow exponential
objects. The main goal of this paper is to show that these properties are
central to many applications in causal inference. For example, subobject
classifiers allow a categorical formulation of causal intervention, which
creates sub-models. Limits and colimits allow causal diagrams of arbitrary
complexity to be ``solved", using a novel interpretation of causal
approximation. Exponential objects enable reasoning about equivalence classes
of operations on causal models, such as covered edge reversal and causal
homotopy. Analogous to structural causal models (SCMs), TCMs are defined by a
collection of functions, each defining a ``local autonomous" causal mechanism
that assemble to induce a unique global function from exogenous to endogenous
variables. Since the category of TCMs is (co)complete, which we prove in this
paper, every causal diagram has a ``solution" in the form of a (co)limit: this
implies that any arbitrary causal model can be ``approximated" by some global
function with respect to the morphisms going into or out of the diagram.
Natural transformations are crucial in measuring the quality of approximation.
In addition, we show that causal interventions are modeled by subobject
classifiers: any sub-model is defined by a monic arrow into its parent model.
Exponential objects permit reasoning about entire classes of causal
equivalences and interventions. Finally, as TCMs form a topos, they admit an
internal logic defined as a Mitchell-Benabou language with an associated
Kripke-Joyal semantics. We show how to reason about causal models in TCMs using
this internal logic.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出一种结合多目标算法和目标规划的方法，用于解决具有相似适应度景观的多目标问题实例。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中，多目标问题的解集评估复杂且计算成本高，而问题实例间可能存在相似适应度景观。

Method: 先用计算密集型多目标算法解决一个实例，再用目标规划和高效单目标算法解决其他实例。

Result: 在多目标车辆路径问题实例中，该方法能在短时间内获得良好结果。

Conclusion: 该方法结合多目标算法的效果和目标规划的高效性，适用于相似适应度景观的问题场景。

Abstract: Many real-world applications require decision-makers to assess the quality of
solutions while considering multiple conflicting objectives. Obtaining good
approximation sets for highly constrained many-objective problems is often a
difficult task even for modern multiobjective algorithms. In some cases,
multiple instances of the problem scenario present similarities in their
fitness landscapes. That is, there are recurring features in the fitness
landscapes when searching for solutions to different problem instances. We
propose a methodology to exploit this characteristic by solving one instance of
a given problem scenario using computationally expensive multiobjective
algorithms to obtain a good approximation set and then using Goal Programming
with efficient single-objective algorithms to solve other instances of the same
problem scenario. We use three goal-based objective functions and show that on
benchmark instances of the multiobjective vehicle routing problem with time
windows, the methodology is able to produce good results in short computation
time. The methodology allows to combine the effectiveness of state-of-the-art
multiobjective algorithms with the efficiency of goal programming to find good
compromise solutions in problem scenarios where instances have similar fitness
landscapes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 贝叶斯推断的广泛应用受到先验分布和似然函数设定复杂性的限制，需要专业统计知识。

Method: 提出LLM-BI框架，通过LLM从自然语言中自动生成先验分布和模型结构，并以贝叶斯线性回归为例进行实验验证。

Result: 实验表明LLM能成功从自然语言中生成先验分布（实验I）和完整模型结构（实验II）。

Conclusion: LLM在自动化贝叶斯建模中具有潜力，可能实现概率编程的自动化推断流程。

Abstract: A significant barrier to the widespread adoption of Bayesian inference is the
specification of prior distributions and likelihoods, which often requires
specialized statistical expertise. This paper investigates the feasibility of
using a Large Language Model (LLM) to automate this process. We introduce
LLM-BI (Large Language Model-driven Bayesian Inference), a conceptual pipeline
for automating Bayesian workflows. As a proof-of-concept, we present two
experiments focused on Bayesian linear regression. In Experiment I, we
demonstrate that an LLM can successfully elicit prior distributions from
natural language. In Experiment II, we show that an LLM can specify the entire
model structure, including both priors and the likelihood, from a single
high-level problem description. Our results validate the potential of LLMs to
automate key steps in Bayesian modeling, enabling the possibility of an
automated inference pipeline for probabilistic programming.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为FATA的新交互范式，通过引导LLMs主动生成多维补充问题，显著提升了回答质量和相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在用户信息不完整或模糊时回答不准确的问题。

Method: 采用FATA范式，通过提示词引导LLMs生成补充问题，整合用户反馈后生成回答。

Result: FATA在综合指标上优于基线提示40%，且稳定性更高。

Conclusion: FATA通过增强用户参与和问题完整性，显著提升了LLMs的交互效果。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to deliver accurate and
actionable answers when user-provided information is incomplete or
ill-specified. We propose a new interaction paradigm, First Ask Then Answer
(FATA), in which, through prompt words, LLMs are guided to proactively generate
multidimensional supplementary questions for users prior to response
generation. Subsequently, by integrating user-provided supplementary
information with the original query through sophisticated prompting techniques,
we achieve substantially improved response quality and relevance. In contrast
to existing clarification approaches -- such as the CLAM framework oriented to
ambiguity and the self-interrogation Self-Ask method -- FATA emphasizes
completeness (beyond mere disambiguation) and user participation (inviting
human input instead of relying solely on model-internal reasoning). It also
adopts a single-turn strategy: all clarifying questions are produced at once,
thereby reducing dialogue length and improving efficiency. Conceptually, FATA
uses the reasoning power of LLMs to scaffold user expression, enabling
non-expert users to formulate more comprehensive and contextually relevant
queries. To evaluate FATA, we constructed a multi-domain benchmark and compared
it with two controls: a baseline prompt (B-Prompt) and a context-enhanced
expert prompt (C-Prompt). Experimental results show that FATA outperforms
B-Prompt by approximately 40% in aggregate metrics and exhibits a coefficient
of variation 8% lower than C-Prompt, indicating superior stability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法无法区分模型是推理还是直接检索答案，且评估指标不一致，需要更系统的评估方式。

Method: 提出了一种构建基准的通用方法及评估协议，用于系统评估知识不完整情况下的KG-RAG方法。

Result: 实验表明当前KG-RAG方法在知识缺失时推理能力有限，依赖内部记忆，且泛化能力因设计而异。

Conclusion: 需要改进KG-RAG方法以提升其在知识缺失情况下的推理能力，并采用更严格的评估标准。

Abstract: Knowledge Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (KG-RAG) is an
increasingly explored approach for combining the reasoning capabilities of
large language models with the structured evidence of knowledge graphs.
However, current evaluation practices fall short: existing benchmarks often
include questions that can be directly answered using existing triples in KG,
making it unclear whether models perform reasoning or simply retrieve answers
directly. Moreover, inconsistent evaluation metrics and lenient answer matching
criteria further obscure meaningful comparisons. In this work, we introduce a
general method for constructing benchmarks, together with an evaluation
protocol, to systematically assess KG-RAG methods under knowledge
incompleteness. Our empirical results show that current KG-RAG methods have
limited reasoning ability under missing knowledge, often rely on internal
memorization, and exhibit varying degrees of generalization depending on their
design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 集换式卡牌游戏（CCG）因部分可观察性、长期决策和卡牌更新等特点，现有AI表现远不如人类玩家，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 使用低秩适应（LoRA）微调开放权重的LLM，基于标注的选牌日志数据集，快速适应游戏的不同扩展版本。

Result: 未经微调的小型LLM完全无法选牌，GPT-4o零样本表现43%；UrzaGPT微调后的小模型达到66.2%准确率。

Conclusion: 研究表明仅用LLM实现选牌AI是可行的，未来可开发高性能、通用且易于更新的选牌AI。

Abstract: Collectible card games (CCGs) are a difficult genre for AI due to their
partial observability, long-term decision-making, and evolving card sets. Due
to this, current AI models perform vastly worse than human players at CCG tasks
such as deckbuilding and gameplay. In this work, we introduce UrzaGPT, a
domain-adapted large language model that recommends real-time drafting
decisions in Magic: The Gathering. Starting from an open-weight LLM, we use
Low-Rank Adaptation fine-tuning on a dataset of annotated draft logs. With
this, we leverage the language modeling capabilities of LLM, and can quickly
adapt to different expansions of the game. We benchmark UrzaGPT in comparison
to zero-shot LLMs and the state-of-the-art domain-specific model. Untuned,
small LLMs like Llama-3-8B are completely unable to draft, but the larger
GPT-4o achieves a zero-shot performance of 43%. Using UrzaGPT to fine-tune
smaller models, we achieve an accuracy of 66.2% using only 10,000 steps.
Despite this not reaching the capability of domain-specific models, we show
that solely using LLMs to draft is possible and conclude that using LLMs can
enable performant, general, and update-friendly drafting AIs in the future.

TL;DR: 提出了一种改进的MCTS方法，通过双层结构和树折叠技术，显著降低了节点选择的时间复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MCTS在经典规划中节点选择的时间复杂度较高，尤其是搜索深度大时，影响了效率。

Method: 采用双层MCTS结构，结合预算控制的最优优先搜索和树折叠技术。

Result: 实现了节点选择的O(1)时间复杂度，性能显著提升。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了MCTS在经典规划中的效率瓶颈。

Abstract: We study an efficient implementation of Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB)-based
Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for classical planning. One weakness of MCTS is
that it spends a significant time deciding which node to expand next. While
selecting a node from an OPEN list with $N$ nodes has $O(1)$ runtime complexity
with traditional array-based priority-queues for dense integer keys, the
tree-based OPEN list used by MCTS requires $O(\log N)$, which roughly
corresponds to the search depth $d$. In classical planning, $d$ is arbitrarily
large (e.g., $2^k-1$ in $k$-disk Tower-of-Hanoi) and the runtime for node
selection is significant, unlike in game tree search, where the cost is
negligible compared to the node evaluation (rollouts) because $d$ is inherently
limited by the game (e.g., $d\leq 361$ in Go). To improve this bottleneck, we
propose a bilevel modification to MCTS that runs a best-first search from each
selected leaf node with an expansion budget proportional to $d$, which achieves
amortized $O(1)$ runtime for node selection, equivalent to the traditional
queue-based OPEN list. In addition, we introduce Tree Collapsing, an
enhancement that reduces action selection steps and further improves the
performance.

TL;DR: 提出一种避免完全枚举的方法，通过求解器仅计算生成最终约束所需的组合，显著提高编译效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在编译时展开循环并生成所有组合，效率低下，尤其是当归纳变量范围大且有选择性前提条件时。

Method: 使用求解器仅计算必要的组合，避免完全枚举，生成与传统方法相同的约束模型。

Result: 编译速度显著提升，尤其适用于归纳变量范围大且有选择性前提条件的问题。

Conclusion: 该方法高效地提升了高级用户模型到求解器就绪形式的转换效率。

Abstract: Constraint modelling languages like MiniZinc and Essence rely on unrolling
loops (in the form of quantified expressions and comprehensions) during
compilation. Standard approaches generate all combinations of induction
variables and use partial evaluation to discard those that simplify to identity
elements of associative-commutative operators (e.g. true for conjunction, 0 for
summation). This can be inefficient for problems where most combinations are
ultimately irrelevant. We present a method that avoids full enumeration by
using a solver to compute only the combinations required to generate the final
set of constraints. The resulting model is identical to that produced by
conventional flattening, but compilation can be significantly faster. This
improves the efficiency of translating high-level user models into solver-ready
form, particularly when induction variables range over large domains with
selective preconditions.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OverFill 是一种优化大型语言模型（LLM）推理的方法，通过分离预填充和解码阶段，显著提升效率与性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM 推理成本高，尤其是长序列解码阶段延迟显著。当前模型统一处理预填充和解码，未考虑其计算特性差异。

Method: OverFill 将预填充和解码阶段解耦：预填充使用完整模型并行处理输入，解码切换到剪枝模型顺序生成令牌。

Result: 3B-to-1B 配置比 1B 剪枝模型性能提升 83.2%，8B-to-3B 配置比 3B 剪枝模型提升 79.2%，且训练数据需求更低。

Conclusion: OverFill 在保持性能的同时显著降低推理成本和训练数据需求，为 LLM 部署提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel across diverse tasks but face significant
deployment challenges due to high inference costs. LLM inference comprises
prefill (compute-bound) and decode (memory-bound) stages, with decode
dominating latency particularly for long sequences. Current decoder-only models
handle both stages uniformly, despite their distinct computational profiles. We
propose OverFill, which decouples these stages to optimize accuracy-efficiency
tradeoffs. OverFill begins with a full model for prefill, processing system and
user inputs in parallel. It then switches to a dense pruned model, while
generating tokens sequentially. Leveraging more compute during prefill,
OverFill improves generation quality with minimal latency overhead. Our
3B-to-1B OverFill configuration outperforms 1B pruned models by 83.2%, while
the 8B-to-3B configuration improves over 3B pruned models by 79.2% on average
across standard benchmarks. OverFill matches the performance of same-sized
models trained from scratch, while using significantly less training data. Our
code is available at https://github.com/friendshipkim/overfill.

Motivation: TA-TSP扩展了经典TSP，引入了动态弧成本，适用于仓库操作等场景。需要高效算法解决实时路由问题。

Method: 结合多种构造启发式和多邻域局部搜索的GRASP方法。构造阶段使用MIP技术将TA-TSP转化为定制TSP实例，改进阶段应用2-Opt、Swap和Relocate操作。

Result: 在MESS 2024竞赛实例中平均最优性差距为0.77%和0.40%，在合成数据集上比Gurobi求解器优11.3%。

Conclusion: 该算法适合具有状态依赖旅行成本的实时路由应用，并在竞赛中表现优异。

Abstract: The Trigger Arc Traveling Salesman Problem (TA-TSP) extends the classical TSP
by introducing dynamic arc costs that change when specific \textit{trigger}
arcs are traversed, modeling scenarios such as warehouse operations with
compactable storage systems. This paper introduces a GRASP-based metaheuristic
that combines multiple construction heuristics with a multi-neighborhood local
search. The construction phase uses mixed-integer programming (MIP) techniques
to transform the TA-TSP into a sequence of tailored TSP instances, while the
improvement phase applies 2-Opt, Swap, and Relocate operators. Computational
experiments on MESS 2024 competition instances achieved average optimality gaps
of 0.77\% and 0.40\% relative to the best-known solutions within a 60-second
limit. On smaller, synthetically generated datasets, the method produced
solutions 11.3\% better than the Gurobi solver under the same time constraints.
The algorithm finished in the top three at MESS 2024, demonstrating its
suitability for real-time routing applications with state-dependent travel

### [146] [Beyond Ordinal Preferences: Why Alignment Needs Cardinal Human Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08486)
*Parker Whitfill,Stewy Slocum*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文指出基于序数比较的LLM对齐方法存在根本性限制，无法系统性恢复最优模型。提出通过基数反馈（如支付意愿）改进偏好微调，实验证明优于序数方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM对齐方法依赖序数偏好数据，但无法解决模型间的权衡问题，限制了性能提升。

Method: 提出收集基数反馈（25,000条支付意愿数据），并将其融入偏好微调中。

Result: 实验显示，基数反馈方法能优先处理高影响力改进，在Arena-Hard等基准上优于序数方法。

Conclusion: 基数反馈是优化LLM对齐的关键，解决了序数数据的局限性。

Abstract: Alignment techniques for LLMs rely on optimizing preference-based objectives
-- where these preferences are typically elicited as ordinal, binary choices
between responses. Recent work has focused on improving label quality or
mitigating particular biases, but we identify a more fundamental limitation:
these methods collect the wrong kind of data. We prove an impossibility result:
no algorithm relying solely on ordinal comparisons can systematically recover
the most preferred model. Intuitively, ordinal data lacks the information
needed to resolve tradeoffs -- e.g., fixing a factual error on one prompt
versus improving style on another. We show that selecting the optimal model
requires recovering preferences over \emph{models} (rather than just
responses), which can only be identified given cardinal feedback about response
quality. To address this, we collect and publicly release a dataset of 25,000
cardinal judgments using willingness-to-pay elicitations, a well-established
tool from experimental economics. Empirically, we find that incorporating
cardinal feedback into preference fine-tuning allows models to prioritize
high-impact improvements and outperform ordinal-only methods on downstream
benchmarks, such as Arena-Hard.

Method: 改进POMO方法，提出POMO+，通过更智能地利用初始节点来寻找解决方案。

Result: 在CVRPLIB数据集上验证，POMO+在多达100个客户的问题实例中表现更优，收敛更快。

Conclusion: POMO+为组合优化问题提供了更高效的解决方案，有望推动该领域的进一步研究。

Abstract: In recent years, reinforcement learning (RL) methods have emerged as a
promising approach for solving combinatorial problems. Among RL-based models,
POMO has demonstrated strong performance on a variety of tasks, including
variants of the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP). However, there is room for
improvement for these tasks. In this work, we improved POMO, creating a method
(\textbf{POMO+}) that leverages the initial nodes to find a solution in a more
informed way. We ran experiments on our new model and observed that our
solution converges faster and achieves better results. We validated our models
on the CVRPLIB dataset and noticed improvements in problem instances with up to
100 customers. We hope that our research in this project can lead to further
advancements in the field.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本体对齐在跨领域数据集成中至关重要，但高质量对应关系生成仍具挑战性。人工参与成本高，尤其在大型本体中。

Method: 利用LLM仅验证本体对齐系统中不确定的对应关系，评估其在OAEI任务中的表现，并与模拟Oracle对比。

Result: LLM在多个任务中表现良好，其性能与模拟Oracle的错误率相关。

Conclusion: LLM可作为领域专家的替代方案，验证不确定的对应关系，但需进一步优化。

Abstract: Ontology alignment plays a crucial role in integrating diverse data sources
across domains. There is a large plethora of systems that tackle the ontology
alignment problem, yet challenges persist in producing highly quality
correspondences among a set of input ontologies. Human-in-the-loop during the
alignment process is essential in applications requiring very accurate
mappings. User involvement is, however, expensive when dealing with large
ontologies. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of using Large Language
Models (LLM) as an alternative to the domain expert. The use of the LLM focuses
only on the validation of the subset of correspondences where an ontology
alignment system is very uncertain. We have conducted an extensive evaluation
over several matching tasks of the Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative
(OAEI), analysing the performance of several state-of-the-art LLMs using
different ontology-driven prompt templates. The LLM results are also compared
against simulated Oracles with variable error rates.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM基准多为静态任务，缺乏动态和多样化挑战，GVGAI-LLM旨在填补这一空白，推动语言模型在代理行为和上下文推理方面的研究。

Method: 基于General Video Game AI框架，使用游戏描述语言快速生成多样化游戏和关卡，通过ASCII字符表示游戏场景，定义可解释的评估指标（如有效步数比、步效率等）。

Result: 零样本评估显示LLMs在空间推理和基础规划上存在持续缺陷，结构化提示和空间接地技术仅带来部分改进。

Conclusion: GVGAI-LLM为语言模型能力研究提供了可复现的测试平台，但当前模型仍远未解决基准挑战。

Abstract: We introduce GVGAI-LLM, a video game benchmark for evaluating the reasoning
and problem-solving capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Built on the
General Video Game AI framework, it features a diverse collection of
arcade-style games designed to test a model's ability to handle tasks that
differ from most existing LLM benchmarks. The benchmark leverages a game
description language that enables rapid creation of new games and levels,
helping to prevent overfitting over time. Each game scene is represented by a
compact set of ASCII characters, allowing for efficient processing by language
models. GVGAI-LLM defines interpretable metrics, including the meaningful step
ratio, step efficiency, and overall score, to assess model behavior. Through
zero-shot evaluations across a broad set of games and levels with diverse
challenges and skill depth, we reveal persistent limitations of LLMs in spatial
reasoning and basic planning. Current models consistently exhibit spatial and
logical errors, motivating structured prompting and spatial grounding
techniques. While these interventions lead to partial improvements, the
benchmark remains very far from solved. GVGAI-LLM provides a reproducible
testbed for advancing research on language model capabilities, with a
particular emphasis on agentic behavior and contextual reasoning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SynLLM是一个模块化框架，利用20种开源LLM生成高质量合成医疗数据，通过结构化提示和全面评估确保数据质量和隐私保护。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗数据访问受限，合成数据是替代方案，但现有方法缺乏系统提示策略和全面评估框架。

Method: SynLLM采用四种提示类型（如示例驱动和规则约束）指导LLM生成数据，无需微调，并设计多维度评估管道。

Result: 在三个医疗数据集上测试显示，规则提示在隐私与质量间取得最佳平衡，LLM能生成临床合理且隐私保护的数据。

Conclusion: SynLLM证明LLM通过精心设计的提示和评估标准，可生成高质量合成医疗数据，推动医疗研究数据共享。

Abstract: Access to real-world medical data is often restricted due to privacy
regulations, posing a significant barrier to the advancement of healthcare
research. Synthetic data offers a promising alternative; however, generating
realistic, clinically valid, and privacy-conscious records remains a major
challenge. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new
opportunities for structured data generation; however, existing approaches
frequently lack systematic prompting strategies and comprehensive,
multi-dimensional evaluation frameworks.
  In this paper, we present SynLLM, a modular framework for generating
high-quality synthetic medical tabular data using 20 state-of-the-art
open-source LLMs, including LLaMA, Mistral, and GPT variants, guided by
structured prompts. We propose four distinct prompt types, ranging from
example-driven to rule-based constraints, that encode schema, metadata, and
domain knowledge to control generation without model fine-tuning. Our framework
features a comprehensive evaluation pipeline that rigorously assesses generated
data across statistical fidelity, clinical consistency, and privacy
preservation.
  We evaluate SynLLM across three public medical datasets, including Diabetes,
Cirrhosis, and Stroke, using 20 open-source LLMs. Our results show that prompt
engineering significantly impacts data quality and privacy risk, with
rule-based prompts achieving the best privacy-quality balance. SynLLM
establishes that, when guided by well-designed prompts and evaluated with
robust, multi-metric criteria, LLMs can generate synthetic medical data that is
both clinically plausible and privacy-aware, paving the way for safer and more
effective data sharing in healthcare research.

Motivation: 传统网格移动方法计算复杂度高且几何灵活性不足，现有监督学习方法在零样本泛化上表现不佳。

Method: 引入无监督网格适配和局部几何特征学习，开发了物理约束的M-Uniform损失函数。

Result: 网络在多种PDE和网格几何上表现出方程无关的泛化能力，优于现有方法，且无网格纠缠。

Conclusion: UGM2N在高效网格适配中展现出卓越的泛化能力和性能优势。

Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) form the mathematical foundation for
modeling physical systems in science and engineering, where numerical solutions
demand rigorous accuracy-efficiency tradeoffs. Mesh movement techniques address
this challenge by dynamically relocating mesh nodes to rapidly-varying regions,
enhancing both simulation accuracy and computational efficiency. However,
traditional approaches suffer from high computational complexity and geometric
inflexibility, limiting their applicability, and existing supervised
learning-based approaches face challenges in zero-shot generalization across
diverse PDEs and mesh topologies.In this paper, we present an Unsupervised and
Generalizable Mesh Movement Network (UGM2N). We first introduce unsupervised
mesh adaptation through localized geometric feature learning, eliminating the
dependency on pre-adapted meshes. We then develop a physics-constrained loss
function, M-Uniform loss, that enforces mesh equidistribution at the nodal
level.Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed network exhibits
equation-agnostic generalization and geometric independence in efficient mesh
adaptation. It demonstrates consistent superiority over existing methods,
including robust performance across diverse PDEs and mesh geometries,
scalability to multi-scale resolutions and guaranteed error reduction without
mesh tangling.

Motivation: 当前LLM在农业领域应用受限，缺乏领域专用模型、数据集和评估框架。

Method: 设计多代理数据引擎构建Agri-342K数据集，采用Tri-RAG（密集检索、稀疏检索和多跳知识图谱推理）框架。

Result: AgriGPT在领域适应和推理任务上显著优于通用LLM。

Conclusion: AgriGPT为农业领域提供了模块化、可扩展的LLM生态系统，并推广了科学和行业专用LLM的开发框架。

Abstract: Despite the rapid progress of Large Language Models (LLMs), their application
in agriculture remains limited due to the lack of domain-specific models,
curated datasets, and robust evaluation frameworks. To address these
challenges, we propose AgriGPT, a domain-specialized LLM ecosystem for
agricultural usage. At its core, we design a multi-agent scalable data engine
that systematically compiles credible data sources into Agri-342K, a
high-quality, standardized question-answer (QA) dataset. Trained on this
dataset, AgriGPT supports a broad range of agricultural stakeholders, from
practitioners to policy-makers. To enhance factual grounding, we employ
Tri-RAG, a three-channel Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework combining
dense retrieval, sparse retrieval, and multi-hop knowledge graph reasoning,
thereby improving the LLM's reasoning reliability. For comprehensive
evaluation, we introduce AgriBench-13K, a benchmark suite comprising 13 tasks
with varying types and complexities. Experiments demonstrate that AgriGPT
significantly outperforms general-purpose LLMs on both domain adaptation and
reasoning. Beyond the model itself, AgriGPT represents a modular and extensible
LLM ecosystem for agriculture, comprising structured data construction,
retrieval-enhanced generation, and domain-specific evaluation. This work
provides a generalizable framework for developing scientific and
industry-specialized LLMs. All models, datasets, and code will be released to
empower agricultural communities, especially in underserved regions, and to
promote open, impactful research.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种称为“diminution”的方法，通过选择Herbrand宇宙的子集来减少ASP中的基础程序规模，从而显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASP常因基础程序规模过大而遇到性能瓶颈，现有方法多依赖临时启发式策略，缺乏通用性。

Method: 引入diminution概念，定义其形式化属性，并通过特定编码利用现有ASP求解器评估候选子集。

Result: 在五个基准测试中，该方法平均减少70%的基础时间，基础文件大小减少85%。

Conclusion: diminution是一种通用且有效的方法，可显著缓解ASP中的基础瓶颈。

Abstract: Answer Set Programming (ASP) is often hindered by the grounding bottleneck:
large Herbrand universes generate ground programs so large that solving becomes
difficult. Many methods employ ad-hoc heuristics to improve grounding
performance, motivating the need for a more formal and generalizable strategy.
We introduce the notion of diminution, defined as a selected subset of the
Herbrand universe used to generate a reduced ground program before solving. We
give a formal definition of diminution, analyze its key properties, and study
the complexity of identifying it. We use a specific encoding that enables
off-the-shelf ASP solver to evaluate candidate subsets. Our approach integrates
seamlessly with existing grounders via domain predicates. In extensive
experiments on five benchmarks, applying diminutions selected by our strategy
yields significant performance improvements, reducing grounding time by up to
70% on average and decreasing the size of grounding files by up to 85%. These
results demonstrate that leveraging diminutions constitutes a robust and
general-purpose approach for alleviating the grounding bottleneck in ASP.

Result: 该框架能有效管理稀疏和多模态数据，在多样化医疗场景中表现稳健且可扩展。

Conclusion: 该方法支持医生在预算限制下逐步获取最有信息量的特征，提高诊断信心并优化资源利用。

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHR) have revolutionized healthcare by digitizing
patient data, improving accessibility, and streamlining clinical workflows.
However, extracting meaningful insights from these complex and multimodal
datasets remains a significant challenge for researchers. Traditional feature
selection methods often struggle with the inherent sparsity and heterogeneity
of EHR data, especially when accounting for patient-specific variations and
feature costs in clinical applications. To address these challenges, we propose
a novel personalized, online and cost-aware feature selection framework
tailored specifically for EHR datasets. The features are aquired in an online
fashion for individual patients, incorporating budgetary constraints and
feature variability costs. The framework is designed to effectively manage
sparse and multimodal data, ensuring robust and scalable performance in diverse
healthcare contexts. A primary application of our proposed method is to support
physicians' decision making in patient screening scenarios. By guiding
physicians toward incremental acquisition of the most informative features
within budget constraints, our approach aims to increase diagnostic confidence
while optimizing resource utilization.

Conclusion: 该研究展示了LLMs在增强培训环境中的反馈和自动评估方面的实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Accurate evaluation of procedural communication compliance is essential in
simulation-based training, particularly in safety-critical domains where
adherence to compliance checklists reflects operational competence. This paper
explores a lightweight, deployable approach using prompt-based inference with
open-source large language models (LLMs) that can run efficiently on
consumer-grade GPUs. We present Prompt-and-Check, a method that uses
context-rich prompts to evaluate whether each checklist item in a protocol has
been fulfilled, solely based on transcribed verbal exchanges. We perform a case
study in the maritime domain with participants performing an identical
simulation task, and experiment with models such as LLama 2 7B, LLaMA 3 8B and
Mistral 7B, running locally on an RTX 4070 GPU. For each checklist item, a
prompt incorporating relevant transcript excerpts is fed into the model, which
outputs a compliance judgment. We assess model outputs against expert-annotated
ground truth using classification accuracy and agreement scores. Our findings
demonstrate that prompting enables effective context-aware reasoning without
task-specific training. This study highlights the practical utility of LLMs in
augmenting debriefing, performance feedback, and automated assessment in
training environments.

Abstract: In this research, we propose an iterative learning hybrid optimization solver

integrates the proposed Node-Destroyer Model, a machine learning hybrid model
that utilized Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) such identifies and selects customer

metaheuristic optimization frameworks. This model leverages the structural
properties of the problem and solution that can be represented as a graph, to
guide strategic selections concerning node removal. The proposed approach
reduces operational complexity and scales down the search space involved in the
optimization process. The hybrid approach is applied specifically to the CVRP

The proposed hybrid mechanism is able to improve the performance of baseline
metaheuristic algorithms. Our approach not only enhances the solution quality
for standard CVRP benchmarks but also proves scalability on very large-scale
instances with up to 30,000 customer nodes. Experimental evaluations on
benchmark datasets show that the proposed hybrid mechanism is capable of
improving different baseline algorithms, achieving better quality of solutions

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型依赖链式推理（CoT），难以处理复杂多模态任务且输出冗长，需要更灵活的拓扑结构和高效推理方法。

Method: 提出STELAR-Vision框架，结合TopoAug合成数据管道、监督微调和强化学习，优化Qwen2VL模型。

Result: 在MATH-V和VLM-S2H上，准确率提升9.7%，优于Qwen2VL-72B-Instruct 7.3%；在OOD基准测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: STELAR-Vision通过拓扑感知推理和高效学习策略，显著提升了模型的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant strides in reasoning, yet
they often struggle with complex multimodal tasks and tend to generate overly
verbose outputs. A key limitation is their reliance on chain-of-thought (CoT)
reasoning, despite many tasks benefiting from alternative topologies like trees
or graphs. To address this, we introduce STELAR-Vision, a training framework
for topology-aware reasoning. At its core is TopoAug, a synthetic data pipeline
that enriches training with diverse topological structures. Using supervised
fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, we post-train Qwen2VL models with both
accuracy and efficiency in mind. Additionally, we propose Frugal Learning,
which reduces output length with minimal accuracy loss. On MATH-V and VLM-S2H,
STELAR-Vision improves accuracy by 9.7% over its base model and surpasses the
larger Qwen2VL-72B-Instruct by 7.3%. On five out-of-distribution benchmarks, it
outperforms Phi-4-Multimodal-Instruct by up to 28.4% and
LLaMA-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct by up to 13.2%, demonstrating strong
generalization. Compared to Chain-Only training, our approach achieves 4.3%
higher overall accuracy on in-distribution datasets and consistently
outperforms across all OOD benchmarks. We have released datasets, and code will
be available.

Motivation: 现有社会智能体多为场景定制，缺乏通用框架，限制了其在不同社会情境中的泛化能力和行为一致性。

Method: 基于社会认知理论，提出包含动机、行动规划和学习三个关键模块的系统化设计框架。

Result: 实验表明，该框架下的智能体在复杂条件下能重现真实人类行为模式，与基线相比偏离度降低75%，且各模块对行为生成的贡献显著。

Conclusion: 该理论驱动框架显著提升了社会智能体的行为真实性和一致性，为通用社会智能体设计提供了有效指导。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have demonstrated strong reasoning
and role-playing capabilities, opening new opportunities for agent-based social
simulations. However, most existing agents' implementations are
scenario-tailored, without a unified framework to guide the design. This lack
of a general social agent limits their ability to generalize across different
social contexts and to produce consistent, realistic behaviors. To address this
challenge, we propose a theory-informed framework that provides a systematic
design process for LLM-based social agents. Our framework is grounded in
principles from Social Cognition Theory and introduces three key modules:
motivation, action planning, and learning. These modules jointly enable agents
to reason about their goals, plan coherent actions, and adapt their behavior
over time, leading to more flexible and contextually appropriate responses.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our theory-driven agents reproduce
realistic human behavior patterns under complex conditions, achieving up to 75%
lower deviation from real-world behavioral data across multiple fidelity
metrics compared to classical generative baselines. Ablation studies further
show that removing motivation, planning, or learning modules increases errors
by 1.5 to 3.2 times, confirming their distinct and essential contributions to
generating realistic and coherent social behaviors.

Result: 框架通过整合多模态传感器处理、持久存储、时空推理和AR通信，实现了对用户经验的长期学习和适应。

Conclusion: 该工作为开发更智能的AR系统提供了方向，能够将用户交互历史与自适应任务辅助有效结合。

Abstract: Augmented Reality (AR) systems are increasingly integrating foundation
models, such as Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), to provide more
context-aware and adaptive user experiences. This integration has led to the
development of AR agents to support intelligent, goal-directed interactions in
real-world environments. While current AR agents effectively support immediate
tasks, they struggle with complex multi-step scenarios that require
understanding and leveraging user's long-term experiences and preferences. This
limitation stems from their inability to capture, retain, and reason over
historical user interactions in spatiotemporal contexts. To address these
challenges, we propose a conceptual framework for memory-augmented AR agents
that can provide personalized task assistance by learning from and adapting to
user-specific experiences over time. Our framework consists of four
interconnected modules: (1) Perception Module for multimodal sensor processing,

*Amir Mohammad Salehoof,Ali Ramezani,Yadollah Yaghoobzadeh,Majid Nili Ahmadabadi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于功能的知识编辑分类法，补充现有机制导向的综述，探讨不同知识类型的编辑效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于大型语言模型的知识可能过时或不准确，而重新训练成本高昂，知识编辑成为一种高效替代方案。现有综述多关注编辑机制，而忽略了知识的功能类型。

Method: 引入功能导向的分类法，结合知识类型（如事实、时间、概念、常识、社会知识）和编辑机制，全面分析编辑效果。

Result: 通过双轴分类法梳理了当前研究现状，总结了现有方法的优缺点，并提出了正式的问题定义和评估任务。

Conclusion: 论文指出了知识编辑领域的开放挑战和未来方向，强调了功能导向分类的重要性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) acquire vast knowledge from large text corpora,
but this information can become outdated or inaccurate. Since retraining is
computationally expensive, knowledge editing offers an efficient alternative --
modifying internal knowledge without full retraining. These methods aim to
update facts precisely while preserving the model's overall capabilities. While
existing surveys focus on the mechanism of editing (e.g., parameter changes vs.
external memory), they often overlook the function of the knowledge being
edited. This survey introduces a novel, complementary function-based taxonomy
to provide a more holistic view. We examine how different mechanisms apply to
various knowledge types -- factual, temporal, conceptual, commonsense, and
social -- highlighting how editing effectiveness depends on the nature of the
target knowledge. By organizing our review along these two axes, we map the
current landscape, outline the strengths and limitations of existing methods,
define the problem formally, survey evaluation tasks and datasets, and conclude
with open challenges and future directions.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GRainsaCK是一个可复用的软件资源，用于标准化和简化知识图谱链接预测中解释方法的评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 知识图谱通常不完整，现有链接预测方法缺乏可解释性，且缺乏标准化的评估协议和资源。

Method: 提出GRainsaCK，通过模块化设计实现从模型训练到解释评估的全流程标准化。

Result: GRainsaCK提供了可扩展的模块化功能和详细文档，支持解释方法的评估。

Conclusion: GRainsaCK填补了知识图谱解释方法评估的空白，并促进了其复用和扩展。

Abstract: Since Knowledge Graphs are often incomplete, link prediction methods are
adopted for predicting missing facts. Scalable embedding based solutions are
mostly adopted for this purpose, however, they lack comprehensibility, which
may be crucial in several domains. Explanation methods tackle this issue by
identifying supporting knowledge explaining the predicted facts. Regretfully,
evaluating/comparing quantitatively the resulting explanations is challenging
as there is no standard evaluation protocol and overall benchmarking resource.
We fill this important gap by proposing GRainsaCK, a reusable software resource
that fully streamlines all the tasks involved in benchmarking explanations,
i.e., from model training to evaluation of explanations along the same
evaluation protocol. Moreover, GRainsaCK furthers modularity/extensibility by
implementing the main components as functions that can be easily replaced.
Finally, fostering its reuse, we provide extensive documentation including a
tutorial.

TL;DR: E-Agent框架通过动态规划多模态工具和优化执行序列，显著提升多模态检索增强生成（mRAG）性能，减少冗余搜索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有mRAG方法存在检索策略僵化和视觉信息利用不足的问题，限制了其在实时场景中的应用。

Method: 提出E-Agent框架，包含动态规划的多模态工具协调器和任务执行器，并引入RemPlan基准评估系统规划能力。

Result: 实验显示E-Agent在准确率上优于现有方法13%，同时减少37%的冗余搜索。

Conclusion: E-Agent通过动态规划和优化执行序列，有效解决了mRAG的局限性，提升了实际应用性能。

Abstract: Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (mRAG) has emerged as a promising
solution to address the temporal limitations of Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) in real-world scenarios like news analysis and trending topics.
However, existing approaches often suffer from rigid retrieval strategies and
under-utilization of visual information. To bridge this gap, we propose
E-Agent, an agent framework featuring two key innovations: a mRAG planner
trained to dynamically orchestrate multimodal tools based on contextual
reasoning, and a task executor employing tool-aware execution sequencing to
implement optimized mRAG workflows. E-Agent adopts a one-time mRAG planning
strategy that enables efficient information retrieval while minimizing
redundant tool invocations. To rigorously assess the planning capabilities of
mRAG systems, we introduce the Real-World mRAG Planning (RemPlan) benchmark.
This novel benchmark contains both retrieval-dependent and
retrieval-independent question types, systematically annotated with essential
retrieval tools required for each instance. The benchmark's explicit mRAG
planning annotations and diverse question design enhance its practical
relevance by simulating real-world scenarios requiring dynamic mRAG decisions.
Experiments across RemPlan and three established benchmarks demonstrate
E-Agent's superiority: 13% accuracy gain over state-of-the-art mRAG methods
while reducing redundant searches by 37%.

TL;DR: MLLMs在情绪识别任务中表现优于人类个体，但人类集体智慧优于MLLMs集合预测。人机协作（增强智能）效果最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索AI（尤其是MLLMs）在情绪识别任务中的表现，并与人类专家对比，以评估其情感智能潜力。

Method: 使用RMET和MRMET测试MLLMs和人类参与者的情绪识别能力，并比较个体、集体及人机协作的表现。

Result: MLLMs在个体水平上优于人类，但人类集体智慧更强；人机协作效果最佳。

Conclusion: MLLMs在情绪识别中表现突出，但人类集体智慧和人机协作更具潜力，为情感智能AI的发展指明方向。

Abstract: The ability to discern subtle emotional cues is fundamental to human social
intelligence. As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly common, AI's
ability to recognize and respond to human emotions is crucial for effective
human-AI interactions. In particular, whether such systems can match or surpass
human experts remains to be seen. However, the emotional intelligence of AI,
particularly multimodal large language models (MLLMs), remains largely
unexplored. This study evaluates the emotion recognition abilities of MLLMs
using the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET) and its multiracial
counterpart (MRMET), and compares their performance against human participants.
Results show that, on average, MLLMs outperform humans in accurately
identifying emotions across both tests. This trend persists even when comparing
performance across low, medium, and expert-level performing groups. Yet when we
aggregate independent human decisions to simulate collective intelligence,
human groups significantly surpass the performance of aggregated MLLM
predictions, highlighting the wisdom of the crowd. Moreover, a collaborative
approach (augmented intelligence) that combines human and MLLM predictions
achieves greater accuracy than either humans or MLLMs alone. These results
suggest that while MLLMs exhibit strong emotion recognition at the individual
level, the collective intelligence of humans and the synergistic potential of
human-AI collaboration offer the most promising path toward effective emotional
AI. We discuss the implications of these findings for the development of
emotionally intelligent AI systems and future research directions.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种双代理混合框架，通过分离推理和代码生成任务，减少认知干扰，提升数学推理系统的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前单代理数学推理系统在集成推理和代码生成时存在认知负载干扰问题，导致性能下降。

Method: 采用双代理框架：推理代理负责问题分解，代码代理处理代码生成和执行。训练结合模仿学习和强化学习。

Result: 双代理设计显著减少了认知干扰，提升了推理和代码生成的协调稳定性。

Conclusion: 分离推理和代码生成任务的双代理框架能有效提升数学推理系统的性能。

Abstract: Current tool-integrated mathematical reasoning systems often adopt a
single-agent paradigm, where one large language model handles problem
reasoning, code generation, and code execution in an integrated workflow. While
this design eases coordination, we hypothesize that it imposes cognitive load
interference, as the agent must interleave long-horizon reasoning with precise
program synthesis. We validate this hypothesis through a controlled comparison
between a reasoning-only agent and a reasoning-plus-code agent, finding that
the latter produces significantly fewer correct reasoning paths despite having
tool-calling capabilities. To address this, we propose a dual-agent hybrid
framework: a Reasoning Agent performs stepwise problem decomposition, and a
Code Agent handles code generation and execution. Training combines imitation
learning and reinforcement learning: the Code Agent receives strong rewards for
matching intermediate ground-truth programs and weaker rewards for valid
execution, while the Reasoning Agent is optimized chiefly via final-answer
accuracy using advantage estimation to credit intermediate steps. This
decoupled role design reduces cognitive interference and promotes stable
reasoning-coding coordination.

Abstract: Recent R1-Zero-like research further demonstrates that reasoning extension
has given large language models (LLMs) unprecedented reasoning capabilities,
and Reinforcement Learning is the core technology to elicit its complex
reasoning. However, conducting RL experiments directly on hyperscale models
involves high computational costs and resource demands, posing significant
risks. We propose the Compass-Thinker-7B model, which aims to explore the
potential of Reinforcement Learning with less computational resources and
costs, and provides insights for further research into RL recipes for larger
models. Compass-Thinker-7B is trained from an open source model through a
specially designed Reinforcement Learning Pipeline. we curate a dataset of 30k
verifiable mathematics problems for the Reinforcement Learning Pipeline. By
configuring data and training settings with different difficulty distributions
for different stages, the potential of the model is gradually released and the
training efficiency is improved. Extensive evaluations show that
Compass-Thinker-7B possesses exceptional reasoning potential, and achieves
superior performance on mathematics compared to the same-sized RL
model.Especially in the challenging AIME2024 evaluation, Compass-Thinker-7B
achieves 40% accuracy.

Result: 实验表明，简单的上下文学习能显著减少隐式多模态威胁。

Conclusion: 亟需改进跨模态隐式推理能力以应对安全挑战。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models face growing safety challenges with multimodal
inputs. This paper introduces the concept of Implicit Reasoning Safety, a
vulnerability in LVLMs. Benign combined inputs trigger unsafe LVLM outputs due
to flawed or hidden reasoning. To showcase this, we developed Safe Semantics,
Unsafe Interpretations, the first dataset for this critical issue. Our
demonstrations show that even simple In-Context Learning with SSUI
significantly mitigates these implicit multimodal threats, underscoring the
urgent need to improve cross-modal implicit reasoning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究探讨了前景理论（PT）是否适用于大型语言模型（LLMs），以及表达不确定性的认知标记（如“可能”）是否影响其决策行为。通过三阶段实验，发现PT对LLMs的决策建模并不总是可靠。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 前景理论（PT）用于人类不确定性决策，但尚未明确是否适用于LLMs。同时，认知标记表达人类不确定性，但其对LLMs决策的影响未被充分研究。

Method: 设计基于经济问卷的三阶段实验，提出更通用的评估框架，引入认知标记的概率值以建模LLMs决策行为。

Result: 发现PT对LLMs决策建模的可靠性不一致，尤其在不确定性以多样化语言形式表达时。

Conclusion: 前景理论在LLMs决策建模中的应用存在局限性，认知标记的多样性影响其可靠性。

Abstract: Prospect Theory (PT) models human decision-making under uncertainty, while
epistemic markers (e.g., maybe) serve to express uncertainty in language.
However, it remains largely unexplored whether Prospect Theory applies to
contemporary Large Language Models and whether epistemic markers, which express
human uncertainty, affect their decision-making behaviour. To address these
research gaps, we design a three-stage experiment based on economic
questionnaires. We propose a more general and precise evaluation framework to
model LLMs' decision-making behaviour under PT, introducing uncertainty through
the empirical probability values associated with commonly used epistemic
markers in comparable contexts. We then incorporate epistemic markers into the
evaluation framework based on their corresponding probability values to examine
their influence on LLM decision-making behaviours. Our findings suggest that
modelling LLMs' decision-making with PT is not consistently reliable,
particularly when uncertainty is expressed in diverse linguistic forms. Our
code is released in https://github.com/HKUST-KnowComp/MarPT.

Conclusion: 结构化内在记忆方法能显著提升多代理LLM系统在结构化规划任务中的能力。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems built on Large Language Models (LLMs) show exceptional
promise for complex collaborative problem-solving, yet they face fundamental
challenges stemming from context window limitations that impair memory
consistency, role adherence, and procedural integrity. This paper introduces
Intrinsic Memory Agents, a novel framework that addresses these limitations
through structured agent-specific memories that evolve intrinsically with agent
outputs. Specifically, our method maintains role-aligned memory templates that
preserve specialized perspectives while focusing on task-relevant information.
We benchmark our approach on the PDDL dataset, comparing its performance to
existing state-of-the-art multi-agentic memory approaches and showing an
improvement of 38.6\% with the highest token efficiency. An additional
evaluation is performed on a complex data pipeline design task, we demonstrate
that our approach produces higher quality designs when comparing 5 metrics:
scalability, reliability, usability, cost-effectiveness and documentation with
additional qualitative evidence of the improvements. Our findings suggest that
addressing memory limitations through structured, intrinsic approaches can
improve the capabilities of multi-agent LLM systems on structured planning
tasks.

<details>

Motivation: 大型语言模型可能放大有害偏见，传统方法（如数据过滤或后处理）效果有限，需更直接、可解释的解决方案。

Method: 分两阶段：1) 训练线性探测器识别模型内部偏见的潜在表征；2) 计算引导向量，通过对比偏见与中性语句的激活模式，实时干预生成过程。

Result: 实验证明探测器能高精度识别偏见，引导向量能有效将偏见输出转向中性内容。

Conclusion: 该系统为构建更安全、可问责的语言模型提供了直接且可解释的方法。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become more integrated into societal systems,
the risk of them perpetuating and amplifying harmful biases becomes a critical
safety concern. Traditional methods for mitigating bias often rely on data
filtering or post-hoc output moderation, which treat the model as an opaque
black box. In this work, we introduce a complete, end-to-end system that uses
techniques from mechanistic interpretability to both identify and actively
mitigate bias directly within a model's internal workings. Our method involves
two primary stages. First, we train linear "probes" on the internal activations
of a model to detect the latent representations of various biases (e.g.,
gender, race, age). Our experiments on \texttt{gpt2-large} demonstrate that
these probes can identify biased content with near-perfect accuracy, revealing
that bias representations become most salient in the model's later layers.
Second, we leverage these findings to compute "steering vectors" by contrasting
the model's activation patterns for biased and neutral statements. By adding
these vectors during inference, we can actively steer the model's generative
process away from producing harmful, stereotypical, or biased content in
real-time. We demonstrate the efficacy of this activation steering technique,
showing that it successfully alters biased completions toward more neutral
alternatives. We present our work as a robust and reproducible system that
offers a more direct and interpretable approach to building safer and more
accountable LLMs.

Motivation: 提升乘客和司机的体验，并优化平台效率，尤其是在乘客提交请求前预测等待时间，帮助乘客更好地规划行程。

Method: 通过数据驱动的方法分析供需动态对等待时间的影响，并基于特征工程提出FiXGBoost模型。

Result: 在包含3000万条记录的共享乘车数据集上，FiXGBoost表现出色，具有高可解释性。

Conclusion: FiXGBoost为预请求等待时间预测提供了有效且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Passenger waiting time prediction plays a critical role in enhancing both
ridesharing user experience and platform efficiency. While most existing
research focuses on post-request waiting time prediction with knowing the
matched driver information, pre-request waiting time prediction (i.e., before
submitting a ride request and without matching a driver) is also important, as
it enables passengers to plan their trips more effectively and enhance the
experience of both passengers and drivers. However, it has not been fully
studied by existing works. In this paper, we take the first step toward
understanding the predictability and explainability of pre-request passenger
waiting time in ridesharing systems. Particularly, we conduct an in-depth
data-driven study to investigate the impact of demand&supply dynamics on
passenger waiting time. Based on this analysis and feature engineering, we
propose FiXGBoost, a novel feature interaction-based XGBoost model designed to
predict waiting time without knowing the assigned driver information. We
further perform an importance analysis to quantify the contribution of each
factor. Experiments on a large-scale real-world ridesharing dataset including
over 30 million trip records show that our FiXGBoost can achieve a good
performance for pre-request passenger waiting time prediction with high
explainability.

Conclusion: 该方法可扩展适用于全球部署的CVCM及其他铁路系统，提升运行可靠性。

Abstract: Track circuits are critical for railway operations, acting as the main
signalling sub-system to locate trains. Continuous Variable Current Modulation
(CVCM) is one such technology. Like any field-deployed, safety-critical asset,
it can fail, triggering cascading disruptions. Many failures originate as
subtle anomalies that evolve over time, often not visually apparent in
monitored signals. Conventional approaches, which rely on clear signal changes,
struggle to detect them early. Early identification of failure types is
essential to improve maintenance planning, minimising downtime and revenue
loss. Leveraging deep neural networks, we propose a predictive maintenance
framework that classifies anomalies well before they escalate into failures.
Validated on 10 CVCM failure cases across different installations, the method
is ISO-17359 compliant and outperforms conventional techniques, achieving
99.31% overall accuracy with detection within 1% of anomaly onset. Through
conformal prediction, we provide uncertainty estimates, reaching 99% confidence
with consistent coverage across classes. Given CVCMs global deployment, the
approach is scalable and adaptable to other track circuits and railway systems,
enhancing operational reliability.

Method: 提出SMA方法，通过半黑盒设置和零阶优化机制实现细粒度来源追踪，并引入跨模态归因技术。

Result: SMA能够有效区分生成内容的来源，首次实现了对图像检索痕迹的成员推断。

Conclusion: SMA为复杂生成系统中的数据来源审计提供了新视角。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and its Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (MRAG) significantly improve the knowledge coverage and contextual
understanding of Large Language Models (LLMs) by introducing external knowledge
sources. However, retrieval and multimodal fusion obscure content provenance,
rendering existing membership inference methods unable to reliably attribute
generated outputs to pre-training, external retrieval, or user input, thus
undermining privacy leakage accountability
  To address these challenges, we propose the first Source-aware Membership
Audit (SMA) that enables fine-grained source attribution of generated content
in a semi-black-box setting with retrieval control capabilities.To address the
environmental constraints of semi-black-box auditing, we further design an
attribution estimation mechanism based on zero-order optimization, which
robustly approximates the true influence of input tokens on the output through
large-scale perturbation sampling and ridge regression modeling. In addition,
SMA introduces a cross-modal attribution technique that projects image inputs
into textual descriptions via MLLMs, enabling token-level attribution in the
text modality, which for the first time facilitates membership inference on
image retrieval traces in MRAG systems. This work shifts the focus of
membership inference from 'whether the data has been memorized' to 'where the
content is sourced from', offering a novel perspective for auditing data
provenance in complex generative systems.

Conclusion: OpenCUA为CUA研究提供了开放基础，其工具、数据和模型已公开发布。

Abstract: Vision-language models have demonstrated impressive capabilities as
computer-use agents (CUAs) capable of automating diverse computer tasks. As
their commercial potential grows, critical details of the most capable CUA
systems remain closed. As these agents will increasingly mediate digital
interactions and execute consequential decisions on our behalf, the research
community needs access to open CUA frameworks to study their capabilities,
limitations, and risks. To bridge this gap, we propose OpenCUA, a comprehensive
open-source framework for scaling CUA data and foundation models. Our framework
consists of: (1) an annotation infrastructure that seamlessly captures human
computer-use demonstrations; (2) AgentNet, the first large-scale computer-use
task dataset spanning 3 operating systems and 200+ applications and websites;
(3) a scalable pipeline that transforms demonstrations into state-action pairs
with reflective long Chain-of-Thought reasoning that sustain robust performance
gains as data scales. Our end-to-end agent models demonstrate strong
performance across CUA benchmarks. In particular, OpenCUA-32B achieves an
average success rate of 34.8% on OSWorld-Verified, establishing a new
state-of-the-art (SOTA) among open-source models and surpassing OpenAI CUA
(GPT-4o). Further analysis confirms that our approach generalizes well across
domains and benefits significantly from increased test-time computation. We
release our annotation tool, datasets, code, and models to build open

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于LLM的代理在信息搜索中因搜索广度和推理深度的限制表现不佳，需要改进。

Method: 提出BrowseMaster框架，通过规划器制定搜索策略，执行器进行高效检索，实现广度和深度的平衡。

Result: 在英语和中文基准测试中，BrowseMaster表现优于基线模型，得分分别为30.0和46.5。

Conclusion: BrowseMaster在复杂信息搜索任务中表现出色，解决了现有代理的局限性。

Abstract: Effective information seeking in the vast and ever-growing digital landscape
requires balancing expansive search with strategic reasoning. Current large
language model (LLM)-based agents struggle to achieve this balance due to
limitations in search breadth and reasoning depth, where slow, serial querying
restricts coverage of relevant sources and noisy raw inputs disrupt the
continuity of multi-step reasoning. To address these challenges, we propose
BrowseMaster, a scalable framework built around a programmatically augmented
planner-executor agent pair. The planner formulates and adapts search
strategies based on task constraints, while the executor conducts efficient,
targeted retrieval to supply the planner with concise, relevant evidence. This
division of labor preserves coherent, long-horizon reasoning while sustaining
broad and systematic exploration, overcoming the trade-off that limits existing
agents. Extensive experiments on challenging English and Chinese benchmarks
show that BrowseMaster consistently outperforms open-source and proprietary
baselines, achieving scores of 30.0 on BrowseComp-en and 46.5 on BrowseComp-zh,
which demonstrates its strong capability in complex, reasoning-heavy
information-seeking tasks at scale.

TL;DR: Fier提出了一种细粒度高效的KV缓存检索方法，通过1位量化键估计每个令牌的重要性，显著提升长上下文LLM推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KV缓存读取延迟随上下文长度增加而显著上升，现有方法因稀疏分布的重要令牌而效率不足。

Method: Fier使用1位量化键动态评估令牌重要性，实现精确检索。

Result: 实验显示Fier仅需11%缓存预算即可匹配完整KV性能，解码延迟降低1.2至1.5倍。

Conclusion: Fier通过细粒度检索有效解决了长上下文中的KV缓存管理问题。

Abstract: The Key-Value (KV) cache reading latency increases significantly with context
lengths, hindering the efficiency of long-context LLM inference. To address
this, previous works propose retaining a small fraction of KV cache based on
token importance. For example, KV eviction uses static heuristics to retain
tokens, while KV retrieval dynamically selects query-relevant tokens for more
adaptive cache management. However, we observe that important tokens are often
sparsely distributed across the long context. This sparsity makes existing
page-level KV retrieval inaccurate, as each page may include irrelevant tokens
and miss critical ones. In this work, we propose Fier, a
\underline{Fi}ne-Grained and \underline{E}fficient KV cache
\underline{R}etrieval method. Fier uses 1-bit quantized keys to estimate the
importance of each token, resulting in efficient and precise retrieval.
Experiments show that Fier matches full KV performance using only 11\% of the
cache budget across various long-context tasks, reducing decoding latency by
1.2$\times$ to 1.5$\times$.

TL;DR: SRP是一个统一的预测建模框架，通过利用关系数据库中的一元依赖和复合依赖，结合检索机制和图传播，提升表格数据预测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 关系数据库（RDBs）虽然广泛应用，但其结构限制了深度学习方法的潜力。现有研究主要关注主键-外键关系的一元依赖，忽略了复合依赖的潜力。

Method: SRP框架通过特征合成（一元依赖）、信息检索（复合依赖）和图传播（相邻模式学习）来预测关系数据库中的数据。

Result: 在五个真实数据集上的实验证明了SRP的有效性及其在工业场景中的潜在适用性。

Conclusion: SRP通过全面捕捉一元和复合依赖，提升了关系数据库的预测能力，并提供了模型行为分析和实用指南。

Abstract: Relational databases (RDBs) have become the industry standard for storing
massive and heterogeneous data. However, despite the widespread use of RDBs
across various fields, the inherent structure of relational databases hinders
their ability to benefit from flourishing deep learning methods. Previous
research has primarily focused on exploiting the unary dependency among
multiple tables in a relational database using the primary key - foreign key
relationships, either joining multiple tables into a single table or
constructing a graph among them, which leaves the implicit composite relations
among different tables and a substantial potential of improvement for
predictive modeling unexplored. In this paper, we propose SRP, a unified
predictive modeling framework that synthesizes features using the unary
dependency, retrieves related information to capture the composite dependency,
and propagates messages across a constructed graph to learn adjacent patterns
for prediction on relation databases. By introducing a new retrieval mechanism
into RDB, SRP is designed to fully capture both the unary and the composite
dependencies within a relational database, thereby enhancing the receptive
field of tabular data prediction. In addition, we conduct a comprehensive
analysis on the components of SRP, offering a nuanced understanding of model
behaviors and practical guidelines for future applications. Extensive
experiments on five real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SRP
and its potential applicability in industrial scenarios. The code is released
at https://github.com/NingLi670/SRP.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了如何通过跨栈方法（算法、系统和硬件）提升ML系统效率，特别关注了RAG、向量搜索和推荐系统的优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代AI系统日益复杂且硬件环境快速变化，传统方法难以满足效率需求，需跨栈优化。

Method: 提出跨栈解决方案，包括RAG的算法（PipeRAG）、系统（RAGO）和硬件（Chameleon）优化；向量搜索的算法-硬件协同设计（FANNS、Falcon）；推荐系统的硬件（MicroRec）和系统（FleetRec）优化。

Result: 实现了RAG、向量搜索和推荐系统在效率上的显著提升。

Conclusion: 跨栈优化是提升复杂ML系统效率的有效途径，未来需进一步探索算法与硬件的协同设计。

Abstract: Today, two major trends are shaping the evolution of ML systems. First,
modern AI systems are becoming increasingly complex, often integrating
components beyond the model itself. A notable example is Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG), which incorporates not only multiple models but also vector
databases, leading to heterogeneity in both system components and underlying
hardware. Second, with the end of Moore's Law, achieving high system efficiency
is no longer feasible without accounting for the rapid evolution of the
hardware landscape.
  Building on the observations above, this thesis adopts a cross-stack approach
to improving ML system efficiency, presenting solutions that span algorithms,
systems, and hardware. First, it introduces several pioneering works about RAG
serving efficiency across the computing stack. PipeRAG focuses on
algorithm-level improvements, RAGO introduces system-level optimizations, and
Chameleon explores heterogeneous accelerator systems for RAG. Second, this
thesis investigates algorithm-hardware co-design for vector search.
Specifically, FANNS and Falcon optimize quantization-based and graph-based
vector search, the two most popular paradigms of retrieval algorithms. Third,
this thesis addresses the serving efficiency of recommender systems, another
example of vector-centric ML systems, where the memory-intensive lookup
operations on embedding vector tables often represent a major performance
bottleneck. MicroRec and FleetRec propose solutions at the hardware and system
levels, respectively, optimizing both data movement and computation to enhance
the efficiency of large-scale recommender models.

TL;DR: Tagore是一个基于GPU加速的图索引库，通过GNN-Descent算法和通用计算框架CFS，显著提升了高维向量近似最近邻搜索的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高维向量近似最近邻搜索（ANNS）中，基于图的索引方法虽然高效，但索引开销大且动态调整需求增加，亟需优化。

Method: 提出GNN-Descent算法加速k-NN图初始化，设计通用计算框架CFS支持多种剪枝策略，并开发异步GPU-CPU-磁盘索引框架处理大规模数据。

Result: 在7个真实数据集上，Tagore实现了1.32x-112.79x的加速，同时保持索引质量。

Conclusion: Tagore通过GPU加速和优化框架，显著降低了图索引的开销，适用于大规模高维数据ANNS任务。

Abstract: Approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) in high-dimensional vector spaces
has a wide range of real-world applications. Numerous methods have been
proposed to handle ANNS efficiently, while graph-based indexes have gained
prominence due to their high accuracy and efficiency. However, the indexing
overhead of graph-based indexes remains substantial. With exponential growth in
data volume and increasing demands for dynamic index adjustments, this overhead
continues to escalate, posing a critical challenge. In this paper, we introduce
Tagore, a fast library accelerated by GPUs for graph indexing, which has
powerful capabilities of constructing refinement-based graph indexes such as
NSG and Vamana. We first introduce GNN-Descent, a GPU-specific algorithm for
efficient k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) graph initialization. GNN-Descent speeds up
the similarity comparison by a two-phase descent procedure and enables highly
parallelized neighbor updates. Next, aiming to support various k-NN graph
pruning strategies, we formulate a universal computing procedure termed CFS and
devise two generalized GPU kernels for parallel processing complex dependencies
in neighbor relationships. For large-scale datasets exceeding GPU memory
capacity, we propose an asynchronous GPU-CPU-disk indexing framework with a
cluster-aware caching mechanism to minimize the I/O pressure on the disk.
Extensive experiments on 7 real-world datasets exhibit that Tagore achieves
1.32x-112.79x speedup while maintaining the index quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生态研究需要整合异构数据和知识，但数据类型、术语和文档的差异阻碍了互操作性和因果理解。

Method: 采用语义单元框架，将数据和知识建模为逻辑感知的语义单元（陈述单元和复合单元），并通过RDF、OWL和知识图实现。

Conclusion: 语义单元框架为生态知识综合、证据注释和跨领域集成提供了基础，支持可重复的工作流程和AI-ready研究。

Abstract: Ecological research increasingly relies on integrating heterogeneous datasets
and knowledge to explain and predict complex phenomena. Yet, differences in
data types, terminology, and documentation often hinder interoperability,
reuse, and causal understanding. We present the Semantic Units Framework, a
novel, domain-agnostic semantic modelling approach applied here to ecological
data and knowledge in compliance with the FAIR (Findable, Accessible,
Interoperable, Reusable) and CLEAR (Cognitively interoperable, semantically
Linked, contextually Explorable, easily Accessible, human-Readable and
-interpretable) Principles. The framework models data and knowledge as modular,
logic-aware semantic units: single propositions (statement units) or coherent
groups of propositions (compound units). Statement units can model
measurements, observations, or universal relationships, including causal ones,
and link to methods and evidence. Compound units group related statement units
into reusable, semantically coherent knowledge objects. Implemented using RDF,
OWL, and knowledge graphs, semantic units can be serialized as FAIR Digital
Objects with persistent identifiers, provenance, and semantic interoperability.
We show how universal statement units build ecological causal networks, which
can be composed into causal maps and perspective-specific subnetworks. These
support causal reasoning, confounder detection (back-door), effect
identification with unobserved confounders (front-door), application of
do-calculus, and alignment with Bayesian networks, structural equation models,
and structural causal models. By linking fine-grained empirical data to
high-level causal reasoning, the Semantic Units Framework provides a foundation
for ecological knowledge synthesis, evidence annotation, cross-domain
integration, reproducible workflows, and AI-ready ecological research.

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 论文提出E3-Rewrite框架，利用LLM生成高效且等价的SQL查询重写，解决了传统基于规则方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于规则的SQL查询重写方法泛化能力差且难以处理复杂查询，LLM虽能捕捉复杂策略但直接应用易产生次优或不等价结果。

Method: E3-Rewrite框架包含上下文构建模块和强化学习框架，通过瓶颈感知提示和多目标奖励函数（可执行性、等价性、效率）优化重写。

Result: 实验显示E3-Rewrite在多个SQL基准测试中，查询执行时间减少25.6%，成功重写率提高24.4%。

Conclusion: E3-Rewrite显著提升了SQL查询重写的性能和覆盖范围，尤其在复杂查询上表现优异。

Abstract: SQL query rewriting aims to reformulate a query into a more efficient form
while preserving equivalence. Most existing methods rely on predefined rewrite
rules. However, such rule-based approaches face fundamental limitations: (1)
fixed rule sets generalize poorly to novel query patterns and struggle with
complex queries; (2) a wide range of effective rewriting strategies cannot be
fully captured by declarative rules. To overcome these issues, we propose using
large language models (LLMs) to generate rewrites. LLMs can capture complex
strategies, such as evaluation reordering and CTE rewriting. Despite this
potential, directly applying LLMs often results in suboptimal or non-equivalent
rewrites due to a lack of execution awareness and semantic grounding. To
address these challenges, We present E3-Rewrite, an LLM-based SQL rewriting
framework that produces executable, equivalent, and efficient queries. It
integrates two core components: a context construction module and a
reinforcement learning framework. First, the context module leverages execution
plans and retrieved demonstrations to build bottleneck-aware prompts that guide
inference-time rewriting. Second, we design a reward function targeting
executability, equivalence, and efficiency, evaluated via syntax checks,
equivalence verification, and cost estimation. Third, to ensure stable
multi-objective learning, we adopt a staged curriculum that first emphasizes
executability and equivalence, then gradually incorporates efficiency.
Extensive experiments show that E3-Rewrite achieves up to a 25.6\% reduction in
query execution time compared to state-of-the-art methods across multiple SQL
benchmarks. Moreover, it delivers up to 24.4\% more successful rewrites,
expanding coverage to complex queries that previous systems failed to handle.

TL;DR: SharpXR是一种结构感知的双解码器U-Net，用于降噪低剂量儿科X射线，同时保留诊断相关特征，显著提升下游肺炎分类准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在资源匮乏地区，儿科X射线成像对早期诊断至关重要，但低剂量协议引入的噪声会掩盖关键解剖细节，传统降噪方法可能损害诊断准确性。

Method: SharpXR结合拉普拉斯引导的边缘保留解码器和可学习融合模块，自适应平衡噪声抑制与结构细节保留，并通过模拟Poisson-Gaussian噪声进行训练。

Result: SharpXR在所有评估指标上优于现有方法，并将肺炎分类准确率从88.8%提升至92.5%。

Conclusion: SharpXR在资源受限环境中具有高效性和诊断价值，适合儿科低剂量X射线降噪。

Abstract: Pediatric chest X-ray imaging is essential for early diagnosis, particularly
in low-resource settings where advanced imaging modalities are often
inaccessible. Low-dose protocols reduce radiation exposure in children but
introduce substantial noise that can obscure critical anatomical details.
Conventional denoising methods often degrade fine details, compromising
diagnostic accuracy. In this paper, we present SharpXR, a structure-aware
dual-decoder U-Net designed to denoise low-dose pediatric X-rays while
preserving diagnostically relevant features. SharpXR combines a
Laplacian-guided edge-preserving decoder with a learnable fusion module that
adaptively balances noise suppression and structural detail retention. To
address the scarcity of paired training data, we simulate realistic
Poisson-Gaussian noise on the Pediatric Pneumonia Chest X-ray dataset. SharpXR
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across all evaluation metrics while
maintaining computational efficiency suitable for resource-constrained
settings. SharpXR-denoised images improved downstream pneumonia classification
accuracy from 88.8% to 92.5%, underscoring its diagnostic value in low-resource
pediatric care.
