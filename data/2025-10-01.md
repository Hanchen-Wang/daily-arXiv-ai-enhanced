### [1] [LUMA: Low-Dimension Unified Motion Alignment with Dual-Path Anchoring for Text-to-Motion Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25304)
*Haozhe Jia,Wenshuo Chen,Yuqi Lin,Yang Yang,Lei Wang,Mang Ning,Bowen Tian,Songning Lai,Nanqian Jia,Yifan Chen,Yutao Yue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LUMA是一个基于扩散模型的文本到动作生成方法，通过双路径锚定机制解决语义对齐和运动伪影问题，在HumanML3D和KIT-ML数据集上达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于U-Net的扩散模型在文本到动作生成中存在语义不对齐和运动伪影问题，深层网络梯度衰减导致高级特征学习不足。

Method: 提出LUMA模型，采用双路径锚定：时间域的MoCLIP对比学习模型和频率域的低频DCT分量对齐信号，通过时间调制机制自适应融合。

Result: 在HumanML3D和KIT-ML数据集上分别获得0.035和0.123的FID分数，收敛速度比基线快1.4倍。

Conclusion: LUMA通过双路径语义对齐机制有效解决了文本到动作生成中的语义对齐问题，是高效可扩展的高保真解决方案。

Abstract: While current diffusion-based models, typically built on U-Net architectures,
have shown promising results on the text-to-motion generation task, they still
suffer from semantic misalignment and kinematic artifacts. Through analysis, we
identify severe gradient attenuation in the deep layers of the network as a key
bottleneck, leading to insufficient learning of high-level features. To address
this issue, we propose \textbf{LUMA} (\textit{\textbf{L}ow-dimension
\textbf{U}nified \textbf{M}otion \textbf{A}lignment}), a text-to-motion
diffusion model that incorporates dual-path anchoring to enhance semantic
alignment. The first path incorporates a lightweight MoCLIP model trained via
contrastive learning without relying on external data, offering semantic
supervision in the temporal domain. The second path introduces complementary
alignment signals in the frequency domain, extracted from low-frequency DCT
components known for their rich semantic content. These two anchors are
adaptively fused through a temporal modulation mechanism, allowing the model to
progressively transition from coarse alignment to fine-grained semantic
refinement throughout the denoising process. Experimental results on HumanML3D
and KIT-ML demonstrate that LUMA achieves state-of-the-art performance, with
FID scores of 0.035 and 0.123, respectively. Furthermore, LUMA accelerates
convergence by 1.4$\times$ compared to the baseline, making it an efficient and
scalable solution for high-fidelity text-to-motion generation.

### [2] [VisualOverload: Probing Visual Understanding of VLMs in Really Dense Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25339)
*Paul Gavrikov,Wei Lin,M. Jehanzeb Mirza,Soumya Jahagirdar,Muhammad Huzaifa,Sivan Doveh,Serena Yeung-Levy,James Glass,Hilde Kuehne*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VisualOverload是一个新的视觉问答基准测试，包含2720个问题-答案对，专门测试视觉语言模型在密集场景中的基础视觉理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前VLM模型在现有基准测试中的表现可能被高估，特别是在处理密集复杂场景时，模型对细节的编码和推理能力仍然不足。

Method: 使用高分辨率的公共领域绘画扫描图像，这些图像包含多个人物、动作和复杂背景，手动标注了六个任务类别的问题来全面测试场景理解。

Result: 测试了37个模型，最好的模型(o3)在最难测试集上仅达到19.6%准确率，所有问题上的总体准确率为69.5%。

Conclusion: VisualOverload揭示了当前视觉模型在处理密集场景时的关键缺陷，为开发更好的模型提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Is basic visual understanding really solved in state-of-the-art VLMs? We
present VisualOverload, a slightly different visual question answering (VQA)
benchmark comprising 2,720 question-answer pairs, with privately held
ground-truth responses. Unlike prior VQA datasets that typically focus on near
global image understanding, VisualOverload challenges models to perform simple,
knowledge-free vision tasks in densely populated (or, overloaded) scenes. Our
dataset consists of high-resolution scans of public-domain paintings that are
populated with multiple figures, actions, and unfolding subplots set against
elaborately detailed backdrops. We manually annotated these images with
questions across six task categories to probe for a thorough understanding of
the scene. We hypothesize that current benchmarks overestimate the performance
of VLMs, and encoding and reasoning over details is still a challenging task
for them, especially if they are confronted with densely populated scenes.
Indeed, we observe that even the best model (o3) out of 37 tested models only
achieves 19.6% accuracy on our hardest test split and overall 69.5% accuracy on
all questions. Beyond a thorough evaluation, we complement our benchmark with
an error analysis that reveals multiple failure modes, including a lack of
counting skills, failure in OCR, and striking logical inconsistencies under
complex tasks. Altogether, VisualOverload exposes a critical gap in current
vision models and offers a crucial resource for the community to develop better
models.

### [3] [Editing Physiological Signals in Videos Using Latent Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25348)
*Tianwen Zhou,Akshay Paruchuri,Josef Spjut,Kaan Akşit*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种学习框架来编辑视频中的生理信号（心率），同时保持视觉保真度，以解决基于摄像头的心率估计带来的隐私问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于摄像头的心率估计虽然方便，但面部视频中的生命信号会泄露敏感的个人健康信息，引发严重的隐私担忧。

Method: 使用预训练的3D变分自编码器将输入视频编码到潜在空间，通过冻结的文本编码器嵌入目标心率提示，使用可训练的时空层和自适应层归一化进行融合，在解码器中应用特征级线性调制和微调输出层来避免生理信号在重建过程中退化。

Result: 在选定数据集上平均PSNR为38.96 dB，SSIM为0.98，使用最先进的rPPG估计器实现了平均心率调制误差10.00 bpm MAE和10.09% MAPE。

Conclusion: 该方法能够可控地编辑心率，可用于匿名化真实视频中的生物特征信号或合成具有所需生命体征的逼真视频。

Abstract: Camera-based physiological signal estimation provides a non-contact and
convenient means to monitor Heart Rate (HR). However, the presence of vital
signals in facial videos raises significant privacy concerns, as they can
reveal sensitive personal information related to the health and emotional
states of an individual. To address this, we propose a learned framework that
edits physiological signals in videos while preserving visual fidelity. First,
we encode an input video into a latent space via a pretrained 3D Variational
Autoencoder (3D VAE), while a target HR prompt is embedded through a frozen
text encoder. We fuse them using a set of trainable spatio-temporal layers with
Adaptive Layer Normalizations (AdaLN) to capture the strong temporal coherence
of remote Photoplethysmography (rPPG) signals. We apply Feature-wise Linear
Modulation (FiLM) in the decoder with a fine-tuned output layer to avoid the
degradation of physiological signals during reconstruction, enabling accurate
physiological modulation in the reconstructed video. Empirical results show
that our method preserves visual quality with an average PSNR of 38.96 dB and
SSIM of 0.98 on selected datasets, while achieving an average HR modulation
error of 10.00 bpm MAE and 10.09% MAPE using a state-of-the-art rPPG estimator.
Our design's controllable HR editing is useful for applications such as
anonymizing biometric signals in real videos or synthesizing realistic videos
with desired vital signs.

### [4] [SpinBench: Perspective and Rotation as a Lens on Spatial Reasoning in VLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25390)
*Yuyou Zhang,Radu Corcodel,Chiori Hori,Anoop Cherian,Ding Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpinBench是一个用于评估视觉语言模型空间推理能力的认知诊断基准，专注于视角转换下的空间推理挑战，包含平移、旋转、对象相对姿态和视角变化等细粒度诊断类别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于空间推理需要多种认知能力，如跨视图识别对象、相对位置定位和心理模拟变换，因此需要开发一个能够系统评估这些能力的诊断基准。

Method: 设计了一个渐进式结构的诊断基准，从简单的单对象任务逐步过渡到要求更高的多对象视角转换场景，包含平移、旋转、对象相对姿态和视角变化等类别。

Result: 评估了37个最先进的视觉语言模型，结果显示存在系统性弱点：强烈的自我中心偏见、旋转理解能力差、在对称和语法重构下表现不一致。人类准确率高达91.2%，人类反应时间与VLM准确率呈强相关。

Conclusion: SpinBench为理解VLM的空间推理能力提供了关键见解，并突出了它们在物理空间推理方面的关键差距，该基准捕捉了人类和VLM共享的空间推理挑战。

Abstract: We present SpinBench, a cognitively grounded diagnostic benchmark for
evaluating spatial reasoning in vision language models (VLMs). SpinBench is
designed around the core challenge of spatial reasoning: perspective taking,
the ability to reason about how scenes and object relations change under
viewpoint transformation. Since perspective taking requires multiple cognitive
capabilities, such as recognizing objects across views, relative positions
grounding, and mentally simulating transformations, SpinBench introduces a set
of fine-grained diagnostic categories. Our categories target translation,
rotation, object relative pose, and viewpoint change, and are progressively
structured so that single-object simpler tasks scaffold toward the most
demanding multi-object perspective-taking setting. We evaluate 37
state-of-the-art VLMs, both proprietary and open source. Results reveal
systematic weaknesses: strong egocentric bias, poor rotational understanding,
and inconsistencies under symmetrical and syntactic reformulations. Scaling
analysis shows both smooth improvements and emergent capabilities. While human
subjects achieve high accuracy (91.2\%), task difficulty as measured by human
response time shows strong correlation with VLM accuracy, indicating that
SpinBench captures spatial reasoning challenges shared across humans and VLMs.
We believe SpinBench provides critical insights into spatial reasoning in VLMs
and highlights key gaps in their ability to reason about physical space. Our

### [5] [A Deep Learning Approach for Spatio-Temporal Forecasting of InSAR Ground Deformation in Eastern Ireland](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25393)
*Wendong Yao,Binhua Huang,Soumyabrata Dev*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了多模态时空Transformer(MM-STT)框架，通过融合动态位移数据和静态物理先验，显著提升了高分辨率地面沉降预测性能，在EGMS数据集上相比现有方法将长期预测RMSE降低了一个数量级。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法如ConvLSTM难以建模长程依赖关系，且先前工作主要局限于单模态数据范式，无法充分利用多源信息进行准确预测。

Method: 设计多模态时空Transformer框架，采用联合时空注意力机制统一处理所有多模态特征，融合动态位移数据和静态物理先验。

Result: 在EGMS数据集上建立了新的最先进性能，相比包括STGCN和STAEformer在内的所有基线方法，将长期预测RMSE降低了一个数量级。

Conclusion: 对于这类问题，架构本身具备深度多模态融合能力对于实现变革性性能至关重要。

Abstract: Forecasting high-resolution land subsidence is a critical yet challenging
task due to its complex, non-linear dynamics. While standard architectures like
ConvLSTM often fail to model long-range dependencies, we argue that a more
fundamental limitation of prior work lies in the uni-modal data paradigm. To
address this, we propose the Multi-Modal Spatio-Temporal Transformer (MM-STT),
a novel framework that fuses dynamic displacement data with static physical
priors. Its core innovation is a joint spatio-temporal attention mechanism that
processes all multi-modal features in a unified manner. On the public EGMS
dataset, MM-STT establishes a new state-of-the-art, reducing the long-range
forecast RMSE by an order of magnitude compared to all baselines, including
SOTA methods like STGCN and STAEformer. Our results demonstrate that for this
class of problems, an architecture's inherent capacity for deep multi-modal
fusion is paramount for achieving transformative performance.

### [6] [DepthLM: Metric Depth From Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25413)
*Zhipeng Cai,Ching-Feng Yeh,Hu Xu,Zhuang Liu,Gregory Meyer,Xinjie Lei,Changsheng Zhao,Shang-Wen Li,Vikas Chandra,Yangyang Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLMs可以通过文本交互灵活处理视觉任务，但在从2D输入理解3D方面仍有困难。本文提出的DepthLM方法通过视觉提示和相机参数增强，让VLMs在像素级深度估计任务中达到专家级精度，无需改变架构或损失函数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的视觉语言模型在3D理解方面表现不佳，而专门的视觉模型虽然能达到超人类精度但需要特定架构和损失函数。研究目标是探索VLMs能否在不改变架构或损失函数的情况下达到专家级精度。

Method: 使用基于文本的监督微调与稀疏标签，结合视觉提示和相机参数增强来解决像素参考和跨数据集相机模糊问题。无需密集预测头或复杂的回归/正则化损失。

Result: DepthLM方法使用更小的模型，在精度上超越了最先进的VLMs超过2倍，首次使VLMs与纯视觉模型相媲美。同时自然地避免了过平滑问题，在边界区域有更少的飞点。

Conclusion: DepthLM的简单性使得单个VLM能够覆盖除度量深度之外的各种3D任务，为VLMs的3D理解能力提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) can flexibly address various vision tasks
through text interactions. Although successful in semantic understanding,
state-of-the-art VLMs including GPT-5 still struggle in understanding 3D from
2D inputs. On the other hand, expert pure vision models achieve super-human
accuracy in metric depth estimation, a key 3D understanding task. However, they
require task-specific architectures and losses. Such difference motivates us to
ask: Can VLMs reach expert-level accuracy without architecture or loss change?
We take per-pixel metric depth estimation as the representative task and show
that the answer is yes! Surprisingly, comprehensive analysis shows that
text-based supervised-finetuning with sparse labels is sufficient for VLMs to
unlock strong 3D understanding, no dense prediction head or complex
regression/regularization loss is needed. The bottleneck for VLMs lies actually
in pixel reference and cross-dataset camera ambiguity, which we address through
visual prompting and intrinsic-conditioned augmentation. With much smaller
models, our method DepthLM surpasses the accuracy of most advanced VLMs by over
2x, making VLMs for the first time comparable with pure vision models.
Interestingly, without explicit enforcement during training, VLMs trained with
DepthLM naturally avoids over-smoothing, having much fewer flying points at
boundary regions than pure vision models. The simplicity of DepthLM also
enables a single VLM to cover various 3D tasks beyond metric depth. Our code
and model will be released at the link below.

### [7] [Bayesian Transformer for Pan-Arctic Sea Ice Concentration Mapping and Uncertainty Estimation using Sentinel-1, RCM, and AMSR2 Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25437)
*Mabel Heffring,Lincoln Linlin Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于贝叶斯Transformer的泛北极海冰浓度制图方法，能够同时实现高分辨率海冰浓度制图和不确定性量化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 泛北极高分辨率海冰制图及其不确定性量化对海冰业务化制图至关重要，但由于海冰特征细微、模型不确定性和数据异质性等挑战而难以实现。

Method: 设计了具有全局和局部模块的高分辨率Transformer模型以改进特征提取；开发了贝叶斯扩展版本以更好地量化不确定性；通过决策级融合三种不同类型数据（Sentinel-1、RCM和AMSR2）来解决数据异质性。

Result: 在2021年9月的泛北极数据集上测试，相比其他不确定性量化方法，该方法能够获得高分辨率海冰浓度图和稳健的不确定性图。

Conclusion: 所提出的贝叶斯Transformer方法在泛北极海冰浓度制图和不确定性量化方面表现出色，为海冰业务化制图提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Although high-resolution mapping of Pan-Arctic sea ice with reliable
corresponding uncertainty is essential for operational sea ice concentration
(SIC) charting, it is a difficult task due to some key challenges, e.g., the
subtle nature of ice signature features, model uncertainty, and data
heterogeneity. This letter presents a novel Bayesian Transformer approach for
Pan-Arctic SIC mapping and uncertainty quantification using Sentinel-1,
RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM), and Advanced Microwave Scanning
Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) data. First, to improve feature extraction, we design a
novel high-resolution Transformer model with both global and local modules that
can better discern the subtle differences in sea ice patterns. Second, to
improve uncertainty quantification, we design a Bayesian extension of the
proposed Transformer model, treating its parameters as random variables to more
effectively capture uncertainties. Third, to address data heterogeneity, we
fuse three different data types (Sentinel-1, RCM, and AMSR2) at decision-level
to improve both SIC mapping and uncertainty quantification. The proposed
approach is tested on Pan-Arctic datasets from September 2021, and the results
demonstrate that the proposed model can achieve both high-resolution SIC maps
and robust uncertainty maps compared to other uncertainty quantification
approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究开发了一种基于路边摄像头和LiDAR传感器的车辆检测与定位框架，采用卡尔曼滤波的后期融合策略，在复杂交通环境中实现精确可靠的车辆跟踪。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基础设施感知在复杂道路环境（如施工区域）中面临的视角失真、复杂几何、遮挡和成本等实际部署障碍。

Method: 集成路边摄像头和LiDAR传感器到协同仿真环境，开发可扩展的车辆检测定位框架，采用卡尔曼滤波的后期融合策略提升轨迹一致性和精度。

Result: 仿真中融合算法将纵向误差降低达70%，横向精度保持在1-3米内。现场验证显示融合轨迹能紧密匹配真实车辆路径，即使在单传感器数据间歇或降级时也能保持可靠性。

Conclusion: 卡尔曼滤波传感器融合能可靠补偿单传感器局限性，为复杂交通环境提供精确稳健的车辆跟踪能力，是实现基础设施支持的多传感器系统主动安全措施的实际途径。

Abstract: Infrastructure-based sensing and real-time trajectory generation show promise
for improving safety in high-risk roadway segments such as work zones, yet
practical deployments are hindered by perspective distortion, complex geometry,
occlusions, and costs. This study tackles these barriers by integrating
roadside camera and LiDAR sensors into a cosimulation environment to develop a
scalable, cost-effective vehicle detection and localization framework, and
employing a Kalman Filter-based late fusion strategy to enhance trajectory
consistency and accuracy. In simulation, the fusion algorithm reduced
longitudinal error by up to 70 percent compared to individual sensors while
preserving lateral accuracy within 1 to 3 meters. Field validation in an active
work zone, using LiDAR, a radar-camera rig, and RTK-GPS as ground truth,
demonstrated that the fused trajectories closely match real vehicle paths, even
when single-sensor data are intermittent or degraded. These results confirm
that KF based sensor fusion can reliably compensate for individual sensor
limitations, providing precise and robust vehicle tracking capabilities. Our
approach thus offers a practical pathway to deploy infrastructure-enabled
multi-sensor systems for proactive safety measures in complex traffic
environments.

### [9] [Seeing Before Reasoning: A Unified Framework for Generalizable and Explainable Fake Image Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25502)
*Kaiqing Lin,Zhiyuan Yan,Ruoxin Chen,Junyan Ye,Ke-Yue Zhang,Yue Zhou,Peng Jin,Bin Li,Taiping Yao,Shouhong Ding*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Forensic-Chat方法，通过"先观察后推理"的新范式，让多模态大语言模型先学习感知伪造痕迹，再进行推理，从而提升AI生成图像检测的性能和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLM在AI生成图像检测中表现不佳，主要原因是视觉编码器专注于语义识别而非低级信号感知，导致无法捕捉细微伪造痕迹；同时微调数据与预训练分布差异大，造成预训练知识遗忘。

Method: 提出Forensic-Chat方法，采用"先观察后推理"范式：首先训练模型感知伪造痕迹，增强其伪迹感知的视觉能力，使后续推理基于实际观察；还提出了ExplainFake-Bench评估基准。

Result: 大量实验表明该方法在泛化性和可解释性方面表现优越，能够提供真正可靠的可解释性。

Conclusion: 通过强化MLLM的伪迹感知视觉能力，使其在AI生成图像检测中能够基于实际观察进行推理，显著提升了检测性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Detecting AI-generated images with multimodal large language models (MLLMs)
has gained increasing attention, due to their rich world knowledge,
common-sense reasoning, and potential for explainability. However, naively
applying those MLLMs for detection often leads to suboptimal performance. We
argue that the root of this failure lies in a fundamental mismatch: MLLMs are
asked to reason about fakes before they can truly see them. First, they do not
really see: existing MLLMs' vision encoders are primarily optimized for
semantic-oriented recognition rather than the perception of low-level signals,
leaving them insensitive to subtle forgery traces. Without access to reliable
perceptual evidence, the model grounds its judgment on incomplete and limited
visual observations. Second, existing finetuning data for detection typically
uses narrow, instruction-style formats, which diverge sharply from the diverse,
heterogeneous distributions seen in pretraining. In the absence of meaningful
visual cues, the model therefore exploits these linguistic shortcuts, resulting
in catastrophic forgetting of pretrained knowledge (even the basic dialogue
capabilities). In response, we advocate for a new paradigm: seeing before
reasoning. We propose that MLLMs should first be trained to perceive
artifacts-strengthening their artifact-aware visual perception-so that
subsequent reasoning is grounded in actual observations. We therefore propose
Forensic-Chat, a generalizable, explainable, and still-conversational (for
multi-round dialogue) assistant for fake image detection. We also propose
ExplainFake-Bench, a benchmark tailored for the evaluation of the MLLM's
explainability for image forensics from five key aspects. Extensive experiments
show its superiority of generalization and genuinely reliable explainability.

### [10] [DeepFake Detection in Dyadic Video Calls using Point of Gaze Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25503)
*Odin Kohler,Rahul Vijaykumar,Masudul H. Imtiaz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种利用视线追踪技术实时检测视频会议中深度伪造攻击的方法，通过分析视线模式来识别无法模仿人类微妙非语言交流的深度伪造视频。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着深度伪造技术的发展，恶意行为者开始在视频会议中进行实时钓鱼攻击。由于深度伪造无法模仿人类在对话中的微妙视线交流模式，这为检测提供了机会。

Method: 基于对二元对话中视线模式研究的可解释特征构建模型，利用恶意攻击者视频流中估计的视线信息来检测深度伪造。

Result: 在自建数据集上测试，模型准确率达到82%，这是首个利用视线点追踪进行深度伪造检测的方法。

Conclusion: 视线追踪技术能够有效检测实时深度伪造攻击，为视频会议安全提供了新的生物特征检测手段。

Abstract: With recent advancements in deepfake technology, it is now possible to
generate convincing deepfakes in real-time. Unfortunately, malicious actors
have started to use this new technology to perform real-time phishing attacks
during video meetings. The nature of a video call allows access to what the
deepfake is ``seeing,'' that is, the screen displayed to the malicious actor.
Using this with the estimated gaze from the malicious actors streamed video
enables us to estimate where the deepfake is looking on screen, the point of
gaze. Because the point of gaze during conversations is not random and is
instead used as a subtle nonverbal communicator, it can be used to detect
deepfakes, which are not capable of mimicking this subtle nonverbal
communication. This paper proposes a real-time deepfake detection method
adapted to this genre of attack, utilizing previously unavailable biometric
information. We built our model based on explainable features selected after
careful review of research on gaze patterns during dyadic conversations. We
then test our model on a novel dataset of our creation, achieving an accuracy
of 82\%. This is the first reported method to utilize point-of-gaze tracking
for deepfake detection.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于视觉的6自由度物体姿态估计算法，专门针对火星样本返回任务中的低功耗硬件约束，使用自定义渲染器和边缘域模板匹配实现鲁棒的姿态估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决火星样本返回任务中机械臂在严格硬件限制下对多个目标物体进行低间隙拾取和插入时的定位需求，需要在低功耗硬件上实现可靠的姿态估计。

Method: 使用自定义渲染器和专门为边缘域设计的新模板匹配度量，仅需低保真、无纹理的3D模型作为输入来实现鲁棒的姿态估计。

Result: 在合成数据集、地球物理测试台和火星实地图像上的广泛评估表明，该方法在计算和内存受限的定位任务中，在鲁棒性和准确性方面均优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 该方法为通用硬件上的廉价可靠定位开辟了新可能性，特别适合资源受限的太空任务应用。

Abstract: We consider the problem of vision-based 6-DoF object pose estimation in the
context of the notional Mars Sample Return campaign, in which a robotic arm
would need to localize multiple objects of interest for low-clearance pickup
and insertion, under severely constrained hardware. We propose a novel
localization algorithm leveraging a custom renderer together with a new
template matching metric tailored to the edge domain to achieve robust pose
estimation using only low-fidelity, textureless 3D models as inputs. Extensive
evaluations on synthetic datasets as well as from physical testbeds on Earth
and in situ Mars imagery shows that our method consistently beats the state of
the art in compute and memory-constrained localization, both in terms of
robustness and accuracy, in turn enabling new possibilities for cheap and
reliable localization on general-purpose hardware.

### [12] [LLM-RG: Referential Grounding in Outdoor Scenarios using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25528)
*Pranav Saxena,Avigyan Bhattacharya,Ji Zhang,Wenshan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LLM-RG是一个结合视觉语言模型和大语言模型的混合管道，用于解决户外驾驶场景中的指称接地问题，在Talk2Car基准测试中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 户外驾驶场景中的指称接地面临挑战，包括场景变化大、视觉相似物体多以及动态元素干扰，使得解析自然语言引用（如"右边的黑色汽车"）变得复杂。

Method: 提出LLM-RG混合管道：使用LLM提取相关对象类型和属性，检测候选区域，用VLM生成丰富的视觉描述符，然后将这些描述符与空间元数据结合成自然语言提示，输入LLM进行思维链推理以识别指称对象的边界框。

Result: 在Talk2Car基准测试中，LLM-RG相比基于LLM和VLM的基线方法取得了显著提升。消融实验显示添加3D空间线索能进一步改善接地效果。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，以零样本方式应用的VLM和LLM在鲁棒的户外指称接地中具有互补优势。

Abstract: Referential grounding in outdoor driving scenes is challenging due to large
scene variability, many visually similar objects, and dynamic elements that
complicate resolving natural-language references (e.g., "the black car on the
right"). We propose LLM-RG, a hybrid pipeline that combines off-the-shelf
vision-language models for fine-grained attribute extraction with large
language models for symbolic reasoning. LLM-RG processes an image and a
free-form referring expression by using an LLM to extract relevant object types
and attributes, detecting candidate regions, generating rich visual descriptors
with a VLM, and then combining these descriptors with spatial metadata into
natural-language prompts that are input to an LLM for chain-of-thought
reasoning to identify the referent's bounding box. Evaluated on the Talk2Car
benchmark, LLM-RG yields substantial gains over both LLM and VLM-based
baselines. Additionally, our ablations show that adding 3D spatial cues further
improves grounding. Our results demonstrate the complementary strengths of VLMs
and LLMs, applied in a zero-shot manner, for robust outdoor referential
grounding.

### [13] [VISOR++: Universal Visual Inputs based Steering for Large Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25533)
*Ravikumar Balakrishnan,Mansi Phute*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VISOR++ 是一种通过优化视觉输入实现多模态语言模型行为控制的方法，无需运行时访问模型内部，仅通过插入特定图像即可实现行为转向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有行为控制方法存在局限性：系统提示容易被用户指令覆盖，基于激活的转向向量需要侵入式访问模型内部，无法用于API服务和闭源模型。需要一种跨模型通用的非侵入式行为控制方法。

Method: 通过生成优化的视觉输入（VISOR++图像）来诱导目标激活模式，这些图像可以针对多个VLM模型集合进行联合优化，实现行为转向而无需运行时模型访问。

Result: 在LLaVA-1.5-7B和IDEFICS2-8B等开放模型上，VISOR++图像在拒绝、奉承和生存本能三个对齐方向上达到与转向向量相当的性能。对未见过的开放和闭源模型也能实现行为转向，同时在14,000个MMLU评估任务上保持99.9%的性能。

Conclusion: VISOR++提供了一种部署无关的行为控制方法，仅通过视觉输入即可实现多模态语言模型的行为转向，无需运行时模型访问，具有良好的跨模型迁移性和性能保持能力。

Abstract: As Vision Language Models (VLMs) are deployed across safety-critical
applications, understanding and controlling their behavioral patterns has
become increasingly important. Existing behavioral control methods face
significant limitations: system prompting approaches could easily be overridden
by user instructions, while applying activation-based steering vectors requires
invasive runtime access to model internals, precluding deployment with
API-based services and closed-source models. Finding steering methods that
transfer across multiple VLMs is still an open area of research. To this end,
we introduce universal visual input based steering for output redirection
(VISOR++), to achieve behavioral control through optimized visual inputs alone.
We demonstrate that a single VISOR++ image can be generated for an ensemble of
VLMs to emulate each of their steering vectors. By crafting universal visual
inputs that induce target activation patterns, VISOR++ eliminates the need for
runtime model access while remaining deployment-agnostic. This means that when
an underlying model supports multimodal capability, model behaviors can be
steered by inserting an image input replacing runtime steering vector based
interventions. We first demonstrate the effectiveness of the VISOR++ images on
open-access models such as LLaVA-1.5-7B and IDEFICS2-8B along three alignment
directions: refusal, sycophancy and survival instinct. Both the model-specific
steering images and the jointly optimized images achieve performance parity
closely following that of steering vectors for both positive and negative
steering tasks. We also show the promise of VISOR++ images in achieving
directional behavioral shifts for unseen models including both open-access and
closed-access ones. Furthermore, VISOR++ images are able to preserve 99.9%
performance on 14,000 unrelated MMLU evaluation tasks.

TL;DR: Vision-Zero是一个无需人工标注的视觉语言模型自改进框架，通过任意图像对生成竞争性视觉游戏，实现模型在推理、图表问答等任务上的持续性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前强化学习方法对人工标注数据的高度依赖问题，降低训练成本，促进视觉语言模型的实际部署。

Method: 提出战略自博弈框架，让模型在"谁是卧底"式游戏中扮演不同角色进行推理；引入迭代自博弈策略优化算法，结合自博弈和可验证奖励的强化学习。

Result: 在推理、图表问答和视觉理解任务上达到最先进性能，超越基于标注的方法，展示了强大的跨领域泛化能力。

Conclusion: Vision-Zero证明了无需人工标注即可实现视觉语言模型持续自我改进的可行性，为大规模视觉语言模型训练提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Although reinforcement learning (RL) can effectively enhance the reasoning
capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs), current methods remain heavily
dependent on labor-intensive datasets that require extensive manual
construction and verification, leading to extremely high training costs and
consequently constraining the practical deployment of VLMs. To address this
challenge, we propose Vision-Zero, a domain-agnostic framework enabling VLM
self-improvement through competitive visual games generated from arbitrary
image pairs. Specifically, Vision-Zero encompasses three main attributes: (1)
Strategic Self-Play Framework: Vision-Zero trains VLMs in "Who Is the
Spy"-style games, where the models engage in strategic reasoning and actions
across multiple roles. Through interactive gameplay, models autonomously
generate their training data without human annotation. (2) Gameplay from
Arbitrary Images: Unlike existing gamified frameworks, Vision-Zero can generate
games from arbitrary images, thereby enhancing the model's reasoning ability
across diverse domains and showing strong generalization to different tasks. We
demonstrate this versatility using three distinct types of image datasets:
CLEVR-based synthetic scenes, charts, and real-world images. (3) Sustainable
Performance Gain: We introduce Iterative Self-Play Policy Optimization
(Iterative-SPO), a novel training algorithm that alternates between Self-Play
and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), mitigating the
performance plateau often seen in self-play-only training and achieving
sustained long-term improvements. Despite using label-free data, Vision-Zero
achieves state-of-the-art performance on reasoning, chart question answering,
and vision-centric understanding tasks, surpassing other annotation-based
methods. Models and code has been released at

TL;DR: 提出一种结合数学/聚类分割模型与U-Net优势的混合方法，用于脉络膜痣的精确分割，在1024*1024眼底图像上达到89.7%的Dice系数和80.01%的IoU，显著优于Attention U-Net。


<details>

Motivation: 脉络膜痣有转化为黑色素瘤的风险，早期检测至关重要。现有AI诊断方法面临数据质量差、标注不一致等挑战，需要开发更精确的分割模型来支持临床诊断。

Method: 结合数学/聚类分割模型与U-Net的混合方法，利用两种方法的优势，减少对大规模训练数据的依赖。

Conclusion: 该混合模型为脉络膜痣诊断决策支持系统提供了基础，有望通过自动病灶标注提高诊断和监测的速度与准确性。

Abstract: Choroidal nevi are common benign pigmented lesions in the eye, with a small
risk of transforming into melanoma. Early detection is critical to improving
survival rates, but misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis can lead to poor
outcomes. Despite advancements in AI-based image analysis, diagnosing choroidal
nevi in colour fundus images remains challenging, particularly for clinicians
without specialized expertise. Existing datasets often suffer from low
resolution and inconsistent labelling, limiting the effectiveness of
segmentation models. This paper addresses the challenge of achieving precise
segmentation of fundus lesions, a critical step toward developing robust
diagnostic tools. While deep learning models like U-Net have demonstrated
effectiveness, their accuracy heavily depends on the quality and quantity of
annotated data. Previous mathematical/clustering segmentation methods, though
accurate, required extensive human input, making them impractical for medical
applications. This paper proposes a novel approach that combines
mathematical/clustering segmentation models with insights from U-Net,
leveraging the strengths of both methods. This hybrid model improves accuracy,
reduces the need for large-scale training data, and achieves significant
performance gains on high-resolution fundus images. The proposed model achieves
a Dice coefficient of 89.7% and an IoU of 80.01% on 1024*1024 fundus images,
outperforming the Attention U-Net model, which achieved 51.3% and 34.2%,
respectively. It also demonstrated better generalizability on external
datasets. This work forms a part of a broader effort to develop a decision
support system for choroidal nevus diagnosis, with potential applications in
automated lesion annotation to enhance the speed and accuracy of diagnosis and
monitoring.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在专业科学领域（如海洋生物学）的能力尚未充分探索，特别是在精细鱼类物种识别方面，这对监测受人为压力影响的海洋生态系统至关重要。

Method: 通过系统评估最先进的多模态大语言模型，并构建FishNet++基准测试，包含35,133个文本描述用于多模态学习、706,426个关键点标注用于形态学研究以及119,399个边界框用于检测。

Conclusion: FishNet++基准测试为开发能够推进水生科学的专业视觉语言模型提供了全面的评估资源，有助于解决现有模型在领域知识方面的不足。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive
cross-domain capabilities, yet their proficiency in specialized scientific
fields like marine biology remains underexplored. In this work, we
systematically evaluate state-of-the-art MLLMs and reveal significant
limitations in their ability to perform fine-grained recognition of fish
species, with the best open-source models achieving less than 10\% accuracy.
This task is critical for monitoring marine ecosystems under anthropogenic
pressure. To address this gap and investigate whether these failures stem from
a lack of domain knowledge, we introduce FishNet++, a large-scale, multimodal
benchmark. FishNet++ significantly extends existing resources with 35,133
textual descriptions for multimodal learning, 706,426 key-point annotations for
morphological studies, and 119,399 bounding boxes for detection. By providing
this comprehensive suite of annotations, our work facilitates the development

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的ViG框架中，节点-邻居特征聚合方法需要针对特定架构进行优化，缺乏能够有效捕捉复杂节点-邻居关系的通用聚合方法。

Method: 提出交叉注意力聚合方法，其中查询投影来自节点，键投影来自其邻居；构建AttentionViG架构，使用该交叉注意力方案进行非局部消息传递。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K基准测试中达到SOTA性能；在MS COCO 2017的目标检测和实例分割任务，以及ADE20K的语义分割任务中表现出良好的迁移能力。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法不仅实现了强大的性能，而且保持了效率，在与先前视觉GNN架构相当的FLOPs下提供了有竞争力的准确性。

Abstract: Vision Graph Neural Networks (ViGs) have demonstrated promising performance
in image recognition tasks against Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and
Vision Transformers (ViTs). An essential part of the ViG framework is the
node-neighbor feature aggregation method. Although various graph convolution
methods, such as Max-Relative, EdgeConv, GIN, and GraphSAGE, have been
explored, a versatile aggregation method that effectively captures complex
node-neighbor relationships without requiring architecture-specific refinements
is needed. To address this gap, we propose a cross-attention-based aggregation
method in which the query projections come from the node, while the key
projections come from its neighbors. Additionally, we introduce a novel
architecture called AttentionViG that uses the proposed cross-attention
aggregation scheme to conduct non-local message passing. We evaluated the image
recognition performance of AttentionViG on the ImageNet-1K benchmark, where it
achieved SOTA performance. Additionally, we assessed its transferability to
downstream tasks, including object detection and instance segmentation on MS
COCO 2017, as well as semantic segmentation on ADE20K. Our results demonstrate
that the proposed method not only achieves strong performance, but also
maintains efficiency, delivering competitive accuracy with comparable FLOPs to
prior vision GNN architectures.

TL;DR: 提出了MetaChest数据集用于医学图像的小样本学习，比较了迁移学习和ProtoNet在小样本多标签分类任务中的表现，发现迁移学习方法表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分析中标注数据稀缺，需要小样本学习方法。现有方法主要研究标准小样本学习，但医学应用需要同时学习新类别和利用已知类别知识，更符合广义小样本分类场景。

Method: 构建了包含479,215张胸部X光片的大规模数据集MetaChest，设计了标准小样本分类的元集划分和多标签episode生成算法。评估了标准迁移学习方法和ProtoNet扩展方法。

Result: 增加每episode的类别数和每类训练样本数可提高分类性能；迁移学习方法持续优于ProtoNet扩展；高分辨率图像提高精度但增加计算量；高效模型架构可达到与大型模型相当的性能但显著减少资源需求。

Conclusion: 迁移学习方法在医学图像小样本多标签分类中表现优异，高效模型架构可在保持性能的同时降低计算成本，为医学图像分析提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: The limited availability of annotated data presents a major challenge for
applying deep learning methods to medical image analysis. Few-shot learning
methods aim to recognize new classes from only a small number of labeled
examples. These methods are typically studied under the standard few-shot
learning setting, where all classes in a task are new. However, medical
applications such as pathology classification from chest X-rays often require
learning new classes while simultaneously leveraging knowledge of previously
known ones, a scenario more closely aligned with generalized few-shot
classification. Despite its practical relevance, few-shot learning has been
scarcely studied in this context. In this work, we present MetaChest, a
large-scale dataset of 479,215 chest X-rays collected from four public
databases. MetaChest includes a meta-set partition specifically designed for
standard few-shot classification, as well as an algorithm for generating
multi-label episodes. We conduct extensive experiments evaluating both a
standard transfer learning approach and an extension of ProtoNet across a wide
range of few-shot multi-label classification tasks. Our results demonstrate
that increasing the number of classes per episode and the number of training
examples per class improves classification performance. Notably, the transfer
learning approach consistently outperforms the ProtoNet extension, despite not
being tailored for few-shot learning. We also show that higher-resolution
images improve accuracy at the cost of additional computation, while efficient
model architectures achieve comparable performance to larger models with
significantly reduced resource requirements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学图像分割模型过于碎片化，通常针对单一任务、模态或器官，而临床实践中专家需要整合多种知识源进行分割。

Method: 将异构知识源编码为双提示表示：1-D稀疏提示定义分割内容，2-D密集提示指示关注区域，通过混合专家解码器动态路由。

Result: 在18个公共数据集上的实验表明，K-Prism在语义分割、上下文分割和交互分割设置中均达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: K-Prism通过统一框架成功整合了临床实践中使用的多种知识范式，实现了灵活的分割能力。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is fundamental to clinical decision-making, yet
existing models remain fragmented. They are usually trained on single knowledge
sources and specific to individual tasks, modalities, or organs. This
fragmentation contrasts sharply with clinical practice, where experts
seamlessly integrate diverse knowledge: anatomical priors from training,
exemplar-based reasoning from reference cases, and iterative refinement through
real-time interaction. We present $\textbf{K-Prism}$, a unified segmentation
framework that mirrors this clinical flexibility by systematically integrating
three knowledge paradigms: (i) $\textit{semantic priors}$ learned from
annotated datasets, (ii) $\textit{in-context knowledge}$ from few-shot
reference examples, and (iii) $\textit{interactive feedback}$ from user inputs
like clicks or scribbles. Our key insight is that these heterogeneous knowledge
sources can be encoded into a dual-prompt representation: 1-D sparse prompts
defining $\textit{what}$ to segment and 2-D dense prompts indicating
$\textit{where}$ to attend, which are then dynamically routed through a
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) decoder. This design enables flexible switching
between paradigms and joint training across diverse tasks without architectural
modifications. Comprehensive experiments on 18 public datasets spanning diverse
modalities (CT, MRI, X-ray, pathology, ultrasound, etc.) demonstrate that
K-Prism achieves state-of-the-art performance across semantic, in-context, and
interactive segmentation settings. Code will be released upon publication.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于3D高斯泼溅的局部高分辨率重建方法，通过按需高斯加密来在用户指定区域重建精细细节，避免了均匀高分辨率重建的高成本问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类感知具有主动聚焦特性，在场景重建中需要在关键区域提供可检查的精细细节。现有3DGS方法要么输出均匀分辨率导致高计算成本，要么需要密集观测和离线优化。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了高分辨率整体重建的高成本问题与用户对局部精细细节需求之间的矛盾，实现了按需的局部高分辨率重建。

Abstract: We perceive our surroundings with an active focus, paying more attention to
regions of interest, such as the shelf labels in a grocery store. When it comes
to scene reconstruction, this human perception trait calls for spatially
varying degrees of detail ready for closer inspection in critical regions,
preferably reconstructed on demand. While recent works in 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS) achieve fast, generalizable reconstruction from sparse views, their
uniform resolution output leads to high computational costs unscalable to
high-resolution training. As a result, they cannot leverage available images at
their original high resolution to reconstruct details. Per-scene optimization
methods reconstruct finer details with adaptive density control, yet require
dense observations and lengthy offline optimization. To bridge the gap between
the prohibitive cost of high-resolution holistic reconstructions and the user
needs for localized fine details, we propose the problem of localized
high-resolution reconstruction via on-demand Gaussian densification. Given a
low-resolution 3DGS reconstruction, the goal is to learn a generalizable
network that densifies the initial 3DGS to capture fine details in a
user-specified local region of interest (RoI), based on sparse high-resolution
observations of the RoI. This formulation avoids the high cost and redundancy
of uniformly high-resolution reconstructions and fully leverages
high-resolution captures in critical regions. We propose GaussianLens, a
feed-forward densification framework that fuses multi-modal information from
the initial 3DGS and multi-view images. We further design a pixel-guided
densification mechanism that effectively captures details under large
resolution increases. Experiments demonstrate our method's superior performance
in local fine detail reconstruction and strong scalability to images of up to
$1024\times1024$ resolution.

Motivation: 视力威胁性眼病造成重大全球健康负担，但由于医疗资源短缺和专科护理受限，及时诊断面临挑战。多模态大语言模型在医学图像解释方面有潜力，但缺乏适合评估生成模型的综合基准数据集阻碍了其在眼科领域的发展。

Conclusion: 将公开发布数据集、整理流程和排行榜，有望推动眼科AI应用发展，减轻全球视力威胁性疾病的负担。

Abstract: Vision-threatening eye diseases pose a major global health burden, with
timely diagnosis limited by workforce shortages and restricted access to
specialized care. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show promise
for medical image interpretation, advancing MLLMs for ophthalmology is hindered
by the lack of comprehensive benchmark datasets suitable for evaluating
generative models. We present a large-scale multimodal ophthalmology benchmark
comprising 32,633 instances with multi-granular annotations across 12 common
ophthalmic conditions and 5 imaging modalities. The dataset integrates imaging,
anatomical structures, demographics, and free-text annotations, supporting
anatomical structure recognition, disease screening, disease staging, and
demographic prediction for bias evaluation. This work extends our preliminary
LMOD benchmark with three major enhancements: (1) nearly 50% dataset expansion
with substantial enlargement of color fundus photography; (2) broadened task
coverage including binary disease diagnosis, multi-class diagnosis, severity
classification with international grading standards, and demographic
prediction; and (3) systematic evaluation of 24 state-of-the-art MLLMs. Our
evaluations reveal both promise and limitations. Top-performing models achieved
~58% accuracy in disease screening under zero-shot settings, and performance
remained suboptimal for challenging tasks like disease staging. We will
publicly release the dataset, curation pipeline, and leaderboard to potentially
advance ophthalmic AI applications and reduce the global burden of
vision-threatening diseases.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需锚点的跨视角物体地理定位方法AFGeo，通过直接预测边界框的四个方向偏移来定位物体，避免了预定义锚点的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的跨视角物体地理定位方法大多采用基于锚点的范式，这种方法受限于预定义的锚点。为了消除这种依赖，作者提出了无需锚点的解决方案。

Method: AFGeo直接为每个像素预测到真实边界框的四个方向偏移（左、右、上、下），无需预定义锚点。结合高斯位置编码（GPE）建模查询图像中的点击点位置不确定性，并引入跨视角物体关联模块（CVOAM）来关联不同视角下的同一物体及其周围环境。

Result: 该方法在基准数据集上实现了最先进的性能，同时模型轻量且计算效率高。

Conclusion: AFGeo通过无需锚点的定位范式，结合GPE和CVOAM，以最小的参数开销实现了高效准确的跨视角物体地理定位。

Abstract: Most existing cross-view object geo-localization approaches adopt
anchor-based paradigm. Although effective, such methods are inherently
constrained by predefined anchors. To eliminate this dependency, we first
propose an anchor-free formulation for cross-view object geo-localization,
termed AFGeo. AFGeo directly predicts the four directional offsets (left,
right, top, bottom) to the ground-truth box for each pixel, thereby localizing
the object without any predefined anchors. To obtain a more robust spatial
prior, AFGeo incorporates Gaussian Position Encoding (GPE) to model the click
point in the query image, mitigating the uncertainty of object position that
challenges object localization in cross-view scenarios. In addition, AFGeo
incorporates a Cross-view Object Association Module (CVOAM) that relates the
same object and its surrounding context across viewpoints, enabling reliable
localization under large cross-view appearance gaps. By adopting an anchor-free
localization paradigm that integrates GPE and CVOAM with minimal parameter
overhead, our model is both lightweight and computationally efficient,
achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets.

Motivation: 现有跨模态检索模型(如CLIP)在处理融合图像-文本模态的检索任务时性能下降，而传统方法需要构建新的三元组数据集且泛化能力有限。

Method: GCL在小批量中强制执行所有模态间的对比学习，利用现有图像-文本对数据集学习统一表示空间，无需额外数据集构建。

Conclusion: GCL是一种有效的多模态检索方法，能够在不增加数据集构建负担的情况下提升模型性能，具有良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Despite their consistent performance improvements, cross-modal retrieval
models (e.g., CLIP) show degraded performances with retrieving keys composed of
fused image-text modality (e.g., Wikipedia pages with both images and text). To
address this critical challenge, multimodal retrieval has been recently
explored to develop a unified single retrieval model capable of retrieving keys
across diverse modality combinations. A common approach involves constructing
new composed sets of image-text triplets (e.g., retrieving a pair of image and
text given a query image). However, such an approach requires careful curation
to ensure the dataset quality and fails to generalize to unseen modality
combinations. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes Generalized
Contrastive Learning (GCL), a novel loss formulation that improves multimodal
retrieval performance without the burdensome need for new dataset curation.
Specifically, GCL operates by enforcing contrastive learning across all
modalities within a mini-batch, utilizing existing image-caption paired
datasets to learn a unified representation space. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of GCL by showing consistent performance improvements on
off-the-shelf multimodal retrieval models (e.g., VISTA, CLIP, and TinyCLIP)
using the M-BEIR, MMEB, and CoVR benchmarks.

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) traditionally require large amounts of
data to train models with good performance. However, data collection is an
expensive process, both in time and resources. Generated synthetic images are a
good alternative, with video games producing realistic 3D models. This paper
aims to determine whether images extracted from a video game can be effectively
used to train a CNN to detect real-life truck axles. Three different databases
were created, with real-life and synthetic trucks, to provide training and
testing examples for three different You Only Look Once (YOLO) architectures.
Results were evaluated based on four metrics: recall, precision, F1-score, and
mean Average Precision (mAP). To evaluate the statistical significance of the
results, the Mann-Whitney U test was also applied to the resulting mAP of all
models. Synthetic images from trucks extracted from a video game proved to be a
reliable source of training data, contributing to the performance of all
networks. The highest mAP score reached 99\%. Results indicate that synthetic
images can be used to train neural networks, providing a reliable, low-cost
data source for extracting knowledge.

Abstract: Automated textual description of remote sensing images is crucial for
unlocking their full potential in diverse applications, from environmental
monitoring to urban planning and disaster management. However, existing studies
in remote sensing image captioning primarily focus on the image level, lacking
object-level fine-grained interpretation, which prevents the full utilization
and transformation of the rich semantic and structural information contained in
remote sensing images. To address this limitation, we propose Geo-DLC, a novel
task of object-level fine-grained image captioning for remote sensing. To
support this task, we construct DE-Dataset, a large-scale dataset contains 25
categories and 261,806 annotated instances with detailed descriptions of object
attributes, relationships, and contexts. Furthermore, we introduce
DE-Benchmark, a LLM-assisted question-answering based evaluation suite designed
to systematically measure model capabilities on the Geo-DLC task. We also
present DescribeEarth, a Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) architecture
explicitly designed for Geo-DLC, which integrates a scale-adaptive focal
strategy and a domain-guided fusion module leveraging remote sensing
vision-language model features to encode high-resolution details and remote
sensing category priors while maintaining global context. Our DescribeEarth
model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art general MLLMs on DE-Benchmark,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决工业制造中金属板缺陷检测耗时耗力的问题，由于金属板图像数据不足导致检测精度下降。

Method: 使用ConSinGAN生成大量数据增强，比较四个YOLO版本（v3、v4、v7、v9）与ConSinGAN结合的性能。

Conclusion: 提出的YOLOv9模型结合数据增强方法有效解决了工业缺陷检测问题，建立的AOI系统可扩展到其他工业组件检测。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a YOLO-based deep learning (DL) model for automatic
defect detection to solve the time-consuming and labor-intensive tasks in
industrial manufacturing. In our experiments, the images of metal sheets are
used as the dataset for training the YOLO model to detect the defects on the
surfaces and in the holes of metal sheets. However, the lack of metal sheet
images significantly degrades the performance of detection accuracy. To address
this issue, the ConSinGAN is used to generate a considerable amount of data.
Four versions of the YOLO model (i.e., YOLOv3, v4, v7, and v9) are combined
with the ConSinGAN for data augmentation. The proposed YOLOv9 model with
ConSinGAN outperforms the other YOLO models with an accuracy of 91.3%, and a
detection time of 146 ms. The proposed YOLOv9 model is integrated into
manufacturing hardware and a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA)
system to establish a practical automated optical inspection (AOI) system.
Additionally, the proposed automated defect detection is easily applied to
other components in industrial manufacturing.

*Shiyu Wu,Shuyan Li,Jing Li,Jing Liu,Yequan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了OmniDFA框架，用于AI生成图像的开集少样本源模型识别和检测，并构建了包含117万张图像的大型数据集OmniFake。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI生成图像检测中因生成模型结构多样性导致的过拟合问题，以及合成图像溯源因缺乏大规模标注数据集而受限的挑战。

Method: 提出开集少样本源识别范式，开发OmniDFA框架进行图像真实性评估和合成源识别，构建包含45个生成模型的OmniFake数据集。

Result: OmniDFA在开集溯源方面表现出色，在AIGI检测上达到最先进的泛化性能。

Conclusion: 该工作为AIGI检测和溯源提供了新的解决方案和基础资源，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: AI-generated image (AIGI) detection and source model attribution remain
central challenges in combating deepfake abuses, primarily due to the
structural diversity of generative models. Current detection methods are prone
to overfitting specific forgery traits, whereas source attribution offers a
robust alternative through fine-grained feature discrimination. However,
synthetic image attribution remains constrained by the scarcity of large-scale,
well-categorized synthetic datasets, limiting its practicality and
compatibility with detection systems. In this work, we propose a new paradigm
for image attribution called open-set, few-shot source identification. This
paradigm is designed to reliably identify unseen generators using only limited
samples, making it highly suitable for real-world application. To this end, we
introduce OmniDFA (Omni Detector and Few-shot Attributor), a novel framework
for AIGI that not only assesses the authenticity of images, but also determines
the synthesis origins in a few-shot manner. To facilitate this work, we
construct OmniFake, a large class-aware synthetic image dataset that curates
$1.17$ M images from $45$ distinct generative models, substantially enriching
the foundational resources for research on both AIGI detection and attribution.
Experiments demonstrate that OmniDFA exhibits excellent capability in open-set
attribution and achieves state-of-the-art generalization performance on AIGI
detection. Our dataset and code will be made available.

*Xiping Li,Jianghong Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了AIMCoT框架，通过主动信息驱动的多模态思维链方法，解决了现有方法在视觉-语言推理中的局限性，显著提升了多模态推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态思维链方法依赖简单的启发式方法构建交错思维链，通常基于注意力图，但实证分析显示这种方法不可靠。其被动选择策略和任意触发机制在捕捉模型认知需求方面存在不足。

Method: AIMCoT包含三个协同组件：1）上下文增强注意力图生成（CAG），缓解文本-视觉粒度不平衡；2）主动视觉探测（AVP），基于信息理论主动选择有助于回答问题的图像区域；3）动态注意力转移触发（DAT），通过监控模型文本到视觉的注意力转移来智能确定插入视觉信息的最佳时机。

Result: 在三个具有挑战性的基准测试上进行的广泛实验表明，AIMCoT在不同设置下显著优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: 通过主动获取信息和动态构建推理过程，AIMCoT代表了向更鲁棒、有效和类人化多模态推理的关键一步。

Abstract: Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (CoT) has emerged as a powerful technique for
enhancing the vision-language reasoning with interleaved information. However,
existing methods often rely on simplistic heuristics for constructing
interleaved CoT, typically depending on attention maps, which our empirical
analysis reveals can be unreliable. What's more, the shortcomings of their
passive and purposeless selection strategies and their arbitrary triggering
mechanisms in capturing the model's cognitive need for information are further
amplified. In this paper, we propose \textbf{AIMCoT}, an \textbf{A}ctive
\textbf{I}nformation-driven \textbf{M}ulti-modal
\textbf{C}hain-\textbf{o}f-\textbf{T}hought framework that addresses these
fundamental limitations. AIMCoT introduces three synergistic components: (1)
\textbf{Context-enhanced Attention-map Generation (CAG)}, which mitigates the
text-vision granularity imbalance, thereby producing more reliable attention
maps as a foundation. (2) \textbf{Active Visual Probing (AVP)}, which replaces
passive selection with a proactive, goal-oriented strategy grounded in
information theory to select image regions that help answer the questions
maximally. (3) \textbf{Dynamic Attention-shifting Trigger (DAT)}, which
intelligently determines the optimal moments to insert visual information by
monitoring the model's text-to-vision attention shifts. Extensive experiments
on three challenging benchmarks demonstrate that AIMCoT significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods across different settings. By actively
foraging for information and dynamically structuring its reasoning process,
AIMCoT represents a critical step towards more robust, effective, and
human-like multimodal reasoning. Our code is available at

### [29] [How Diffusion Models Memorize](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25705)
*Juyeop Kim,Songkuk Kim,Jong-Seok Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 扩散模型存在记忆训练数据的问题，本文揭示了记忆机制的核心是早期去噪过程中的训练样本高估，这减少了多样性、使去噪轨迹坍缩并加速向记忆图像收敛。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管扩散模型在图像生成方面很成功，但它们会记忆训练数据，引发严重的隐私和版权问题。先前工作主要关注记忆的表征、检测和缓解，但记忆发生的根本原因仍未解决。

Method: 通过重新审视扩散和去噪过程，分析潜在空间动态来研究记忆机制。具体包括分析训练损失、记忆提示对噪声预测的影响，以及分解中间潜在表示。

Result: 发现记忆不能仅用过拟合解释，因为训练损失在记忆情况下更大；记忆提示将训练图像注入噪声预测，迫使潜在轨迹收敛；中间潜在表示分解显示初始随机性被快速抑制并被记忆内容取代。

Conclusion: 早期高估是扩散模型中记忆的核心机制，偏离理论去噪计划与记忆严重程度高度相关。

Abstract: Despite their success in image generation, diffusion models can memorize
training data, raising serious privacy and copyright concerns. Although prior
work has sought to characterize, detect, and mitigate memorization, the
fundamental question of why and how it occurs remains unresolved. In this
paper, we revisit the diffusion and denoising process and analyze latent space
dynamics to address the question: "How do diffusion models memorize?" We show
that memorization is driven by the overestimation of training samples during
early denoising, which reduces diversity, collapses denoising trajectories, and
accelerates convergence toward the memorized image. Specifically: (i)
memorization cannot be explained by overfitting alone, as training loss is
larger under memorization due to classifier-free guidance amplifying
predictions and inducing overestimation; (ii) memorized prompts inject training
images into noise predictions, forcing latent trajectories to converge and
steering denoising toward their paired samples; and (iii) a decomposition of
intermediate latents reveals how initial randomness is quickly suppressed and
replaced by memorized content, with deviations from the theoretical denoising
schedule correlating almost perfectly with memorization severity. Together,
these results identify early overestimation as the central underlying mechanism
of memorization in diffusion models.

*Yuan Gao,Sangwook Kim,Jianzhong You,Chris McIntosh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ProbMED是一个多模态医疗视觉语言预训练模型，使用概率对比学习来建模嵌入分布，将四种医疗模态（胸片、心电图、超声心动图和临床文本）对齐到统一的概率嵌入空间中，在跨模态检索、零样本和少样本分类任务中表现优于现有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医疗视觉语言预训练模型未能直接处理医疗信息中常见的多对多映射关系，无法有效整合来自不同医疗模态的多样化信息。

Method: 采用概率对比学习，使用InfoNCE损失和Hellinger距离整合跨模态分布，引入概率合成采样损失来捕捉模态特定的均值和方差，改善模态内绑定。

Result: 在13个医疗数据集上的广泛实验表明，该模型在跨模态检索、零样本和少样本分类任务中优于当前医疗视觉语言预训练模型，并展示了多模态整合在预后预测中的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: ProbMED通过概率建模方法有效解决了医疗多模态数据中的多对多映射问题，显著提升了模态间和模态内的绑定效果，为医疗决策提供了更强大的多模态整合能力。

Abstract: Medical decision-making requires integrating diverse medical information,
from imaging to clinical narratives. These medical modalities are often
acquired in a many-to-many manner. However, current medical vision-language
pretraining models (Med-VLPMs) fail to directly account for this many-to-many
mapping in their model training and embeddings. To address this, we present
Probabilistic Modality-Enhanced Diagnosis (ProbMED), a multimodal Med-VLPM that
employs probabilistic contrastive learning to model distributions over
embeddings rather than deterministic estimates. ProbMED aligns four distinct
modalities -- chest X-rays, electrocardiograms, echocardiograms, and clinical
text -- into a unified probabilistic embedding space. We use InfoNCE loss with
Hellinger distance to integrate inter-modality distributions. We introduce a
probabilistic synthetic sampling loss that captures modality-specific mean and
variance to improve intra-modality binding. Extensive experiments across 13
medical datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms current Med-VLPMs in
cross-modality retrieval, zero-shot, and few-shot classification. We also
demonstrate the robust integration of multiple modalities for prognostication,
showing improved intra- and inter-medical modality binding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MISP-DPO是一个多模态偏好优化框架，通过Plackett-Luce模型引入多个语义多样的负样本，解决了现有方法依赖简单成对比较导致的优化偏差和幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖过度简化的成对比较，通过基本扰动或基于相似性检索生成单个负图像，无法捕捉多模态偏好的复杂性，导致优化偏差和幻觉。

Method: 在CLIP空间中嵌入提示和候选图像，应用稀疏自编码器揭示可解释的语义偏差因素。基于重构难度、与正样本的语义偏差和相互多样性选择负样本，采用Plackett-Luce目标和重要性采样策略。

Result: 在五个不同基准测试中，MISP-DPO持续改进了多模态对齐效果，优于先前方法。

Conclusion: 语义感知的多负样本采样在基于偏好的学习中具有有效性，能够提供更广泛和更有信息量的监督。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has recently been extended from
text-only models to vision-language models. However, existing methods rely on
oversimplified pairwise comparisons, generating a single negative image via
basic perturbations or similarity-based retrieval, which fail to capture the
complex nature of multimodal preferences, inducing optimization bias and
hallucinations. To address this issue, we propose MISP-DPO, the first framework
to incorporate multiple, semantically diverse negative images in multimodal DPO
via the Plackett-Luce model. Our method embeds prompts and candidate images in
CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining) space and applies a sparse
autoencoder to uncover semantic deviations into interpretable factors. Negative
samples are selected based on reconstruction difficulty, semantic deviation
from the positive, and mutual diversity, yielding broader and more informative
supervision. To handle multi-negative comparisons, we adopt a Plackett-Luce
objective and introduce an importance sampling strategy that improves training
efficiency. Experiments across five diverse benchmarks demonstrate that
MISP-DPO consistently improves multimodal alignment over prior methods,
validating the effectiveness of semantic-aware, multi-negative sampling in
preference-based learning.

TL;DR: SAGE提出了一种统一的视觉地点识别训练框架，通过联合改进局部特征聚合、训练样本组织和困难样本挖掘，增强空间-视觉判别能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注描述符微调或固定采样策略，忽视了训练过程中空间上下文和视觉相似性之间的动态交互作用。

Method: 引入轻量级Soft Probing模块学习补丁描述符的残差权重，构建在线地理-视觉图融合地理邻近性和当前视觉相似性，使用贪心加权团扩展采样器聚焦信息量最大的地点邻域。

Result: 在八个基准测试中达到SOTA性能，在SPED、Pitts30k-test、MSLS-val和Nordland上分别获得98.9%、95.8%、94.5%和96.0%的Recall@1，在SPED上仅使用4096D全局描述符就实现了100%的Recall@10。

Conclusion: SAGE通过动态空间-视觉交互建模和参数高效微调，显著提升了视觉地点识别的性能。

Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) requires robust retrieval of geotagged images
despite large appearance, viewpoint, and environmental variation. Prior methods
focus on descriptor fine-tuning or fixed sampling strategies yet neglect the
dynamic interplay between spatial context and visual similarity during
training. We present SAGE (Spatial-visual Adaptive Graph Exploration), a
unified training pipeline that enhances granular spatial-visual discrimination
by jointly improving local feature aggregation, organize samples during
training, and hard sample mining. We introduce a lightweight Soft Probing
module that learns residual weights from training data for patch descriptors
before bilinear aggregation, boosting distinctive local cues. During training
we reconstruct an online geo-visual graph that fuses geographic proximity and
current visual similarity so that candidate neighborhoods reflect the evolving
embedding landscape. To concentrate learning on the most informative place
neighborhoods, we seed clusters from high-affinity anchors and iteratively
expand them with a greedy weighted clique expansion sampler. Implemented with a
frozen DINOv2 backbone and parameter-efficient fine-tuning, SAGE achieves SOTA
across eight benchmarks. It attains 98.9%, 95.8%, 94.5%, and 96.0% Recall@1 on
SPED, Pitts30k-test, MSLS-val, and Nordland, respectively. Notably, our method
obtains 100% Recall@10 on SPED only using 4096D global descriptors. Code and
model will be available at: https://github.com/chenshunpeng/SAGE.

TL;DR: LaTo是一个基于地标标记化的扩散变换器，用于细粒度、身份保持的人脸编辑，通过量化地标坐标、统一位置编码和基于视觉语言模型的地标预测，显著提升了身份保持和语义一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态人脸编辑方法在精确属性控制和身份保持方面存在困难，传统的地标方法作为刚性几何约束在条件地标与源图像差异较大时会损害身份信息。

Method: 提出地标标记器将原始地标坐标量化为离散面部标记；使用位置映射位置编码统一处理面部和图像标记；利用视觉语言模型从指令和源图像推断目标地标。

Result: 在身份保持方面比最先进方法提升7.8%，在语义一致性方面提升4.6%，并构建了包含15万真实人脸对的HFL-150K基准数据集。

Conclusion: LaTo通过创新的地标标记化和统一处理框架，有效解决了人脸编辑中的身份保持和精确控制问题，在多个指标上显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Recent multimodal models for instruction-based face editing enable semantic
manipulation but still struggle with precise attribute control and identity
preservation. Structural facial representations such as landmarks are effective
for intermediate supervision, yet most existing methods treat them as rigid
geometric constraints, which can degrade identity when conditional landmarks
deviate significantly from the source (e.g., large expression or pose changes,
inaccurate landmark estimates). To address these limitations, we propose LaTo,
a landmark-tokenized diffusion transformer for fine-grained,
identity-preserving face editing. Our key innovations include: (1) a landmark
tokenizer that directly quantizes raw landmark coordinates into discrete facial
tokens, obviating the need for dense pixel-wise correspondence; (2) a
location-mapping positional encoding that integrates facial and image tokens
for unified processing, enabling flexible yet decoupled geometry-appearance
interactions with high efficiency and strong identity preservation; and (3) a
landmark predictor that leverages vision-language models to infer target
landmarks from instructions and source images, whose structured
chain-of-thought improves estimation accuracy and interactive control. To
mitigate data scarcity, we curate HFL-150K, to our knowledge the largest
benchmark for this task, containing over 150K real face pairs with fine-grained
instructions. Extensive experiments show that LaTo outperforms state-of-the-art
methods by 7.8% in identity preservation and 4.6% in semantic consistency. Code
and dataset will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

Abstract: Video Object Segmentation (VOS) aims to track and segment specific objects
across entire video sequences, yet it remains highly challenging under complex
real-world scenarios. The MOSEv1 and LVOS dataset, adopted in the MOSEv1
challenge on LSVOS 2025, which is specifically designed to enhance the
robustness of VOS models in complex real-world scenarios, including long-term
object disappearances and reappearances, as well as the presence of small and
inconspicuous objects. In this paper, we present our improved method,
Confidence-Guided Fusion Segmentation (CGFSeg), for the VOS task in the MOSEv1
Challenge. During training, the feature extractor of SAM2 is frozen, while the
remaining components are fine-tuned to preserve strong feature extraction
ability and improve segmentation accuracy. In the inference stage, we introduce
a pixel-check strategy that progressively refines predictions by exploiting
complementary strengths of multiple models, thereby yielding robust final
masks. As a result, our method achieves a J&F score of 86.37% on the test set,
ranking 1st in the MOSEv1 Challenge at LSVOS 2025. These results highlight the
effectiveness of our approach in addressing the challenges of VOS task in

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于SO(3)扩散模型的人体网格恢复方法，通过条件丢弃技术生成符合2D观测的3D姿态概率分布，解决了传统方法在准确性和多样性之间的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从单张RGB图像恢复3D人体网格存在固有的模糊性，现有方法要么回归单一确定性输出，要么在准确性和样本多样性之间存在权衡。需要一种能够建模良好对齐分布的方法来解决这个根本问题。

Method: 引入SO(3)扩散模型，通过条件丢弃技术生成姿态参数的概率分布；使用transformer学习人体关节的层次结构，提取关节的潜在向量；采用小型MLP去噪模型学习基于潜在向量的每个关节分布。

Result: 实验证明该方法能够有效预测准确的姿态概率分布，在建模3D人体姿态不确定性方面表现出色。

Conclusion: 提出的SO(3)扩散模型方法能够有效解决人体网格恢复中的模糊性问题，生成与2D观测良好对齐的3D姿态概率分布，在准确性和多样性方面都取得了良好表现。

Abstract: We tackle the problem of Human Mesh Recovery (HMR) from a single RGB image,
formulating it as an image-conditioned human pose and shape generation. While
recovering 3D human pose from 2D observations is inherently ambiguous, most
existing approaches have regressed a single deterministic output. Probabilistic
methods attempt to address this by generating multiple plausible outputs to
model the ambiguity. However, these methods often exhibit a trade-off between
accuracy and sample diversity, and their single predictions are not competitive
with state-of-the-art deterministic models. To overcome these limitations, we
propose a novel approach that models well-aligned distribution to 2D
observations. In particular, we introduce $SO(3)$ diffusion model, which
generates the distribution of pose parameters represented as 3D rotations
unconditional and conditional to image observations via conditioning dropout.
Our model learns the hierarchical structure of human body joints using the
transformer. Instead of using transformer as a denoising model, the
time-independent transformer extracts latent vectors for the joints and a small
MLP-based denoising model learns the per-joint distribution conditioned on the
latent vector. We experimentally demonstrate and analyze that our model
predicts accurate pose probability distribution effectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有拖拽式图像编辑方法主要在2D像素平面上操作，缺乏3D几何线索，导致在旋转和透视变换等几何密集型场景中产生不精确和不一致的编辑结果。

Method: 构建统一的位移场，联合编码3D几何和2D空间先验；引入无冲突分区策略隔离编辑区域；单次前向传播实现连贯编辑。

Conclusion: GeoDrag通过几何引导实现了精确、一致且结构保持的图像编辑，解决了传统方法在几何密集型场景中的局限性。

Abstract: Interactive point-based image editing serves as a controllable editor,
enabling precise and flexible manipulation of image content. However, most
drag-based methods operate primarily on the 2D pixel plane with limited use of
3D cues. As a result, they often produce imprecise and inconsistent edits,
particularly in geometry-intensive scenarios such as rotations and perspective
transformations. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
geometry-guided drag-based image editing method - GeoDrag, which addresses
three key challenges: 1) incorporating 3D geometric cues into pixel-level
editing, 2) mitigating discontinuities caused by geometry-only guidance, and 3)
resolving conflicts arising from multi-point dragging. Built upon a unified
displacement field that jointly encodes 3D geometry and 2D spatial priors,
GeoDrag enables coherent, high-fidelity, and structure-consistent editing in a
single forward pass. In addition, a conflict-free partitioning strategy is
introduced to isolate editing regions, effectively preventing interference and
ensuring consistency. Extensive experiments across various editing scenarios
validate the effectiveness of our method, showing superior precision,
structural consistency, and reliable multi-point editability. The code will be
available on https://github.com/xinyu-pu/GeoDrag .

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于体素的室内场景重建方法依赖多视角像素反投影射线交点作为几何约束，导致重建质量严重依赖输入视图密度，在重叠区域和未观测区域表现不佳。

Method: 提出IPDRecon框架，包含三个核心组件：像素级置信编码器(PCE)、仿射补偿模块(ACM)和图像平面空间解码器(IPSD)，通过物理成像过程解码2D图像中的3D结构信息。

Result: 在ScanNetV2上的实验表明，IPDRecon在视图数量减少40%时重建质量几乎不变，变异系数仅0.24%，性能保持率99.7%，最大性能下降仅0.42%。

Conclusion: 利用单视图内的空间信息为实际应用中的视图受限场景提供了鲁棒解决方案，显著提升了视图不变重建能力。

Abstract: Volume-based indoor scene reconstruction methods demonstrate significant
research value due to their superior generalization capability and real-time
deployment potential. However, existing methods rely on multi-view pixel
back-projection ray intersections as weak geometric constraints to determine
spatial positions, causing reconstruction quality to depend heavily on input
view density with poor performance in overlapping regions and unobserved areas.
To address these issues, the key lies in reducing dependency on inter-view
geometric constraints while exploiting rich spatial information within
individual views. We propose IPDRecon, an image-plane decoding framework
comprising three core components: Pixel-level Confidence Encoder (PCE), Affine
Compensation Module (ACM), and Image-Plane Spatial Decoder (IPSD). These
modules collaboratively decode 3D structural information encoded in 2D images
through physical imaging processes, effectively preserving spatial geometric
features including edges, hollow structures, and complex textures while
significantly enhancing view-invariant reconstruction. Experiments on ScanNetV2
confirm that IPDRecon achieves superior reconstruction stability, maintaining
nearly identical quality when view count reduces by 40%. The method achieves a
coefficient of variation of only 0.24%, performance retention rate of 99.7%,
and maximum performance drop of merely 0.42%. This demonstrates that exploiting
intra-view spatial information provides a robust solution for view-limited
scenarios in practical applications.

Conclusion: 建立了金融短视频字幕生成的第一个基准，展示了在该领域理解复杂视觉线索的潜力和挑战。

Abstract: We evaluate multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for topic-aligned
captioning in financial short-form videos (SVs) by testing joint reasoning over
transcripts (T), audio (A), and video (V). Using 624 annotated YouTube SVs, we
assess all seven modality combinations (T, A, V, TA, TV, AV, TAV) across five
topics: main recommendation, sentiment analysis, video purpose, visual
analysis, and financial entity recognition. Video alone performs strongly on
four of five topics, underscoring its value for capturing visual context and
effective cues such as emotions, gestures, and body language. Selective pairs
such as TV or AV often surpass TAV, implying that too many modalities may
introduce noise. These results establish the first baselines for financial
short-form video captioning and illustrate the potential and challenges of
grounding complex visual cues in this domain. All code and data can be found on

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Dolphin系列模型——首个大规模多模态超声基础模型，通过三阶段训练策略在单一视觉语言框架中统一处理多种临床任务，其中Dolphin R1在U2-Bench基准测试中取得了两倍于次优模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决超声成像在AI集成中面临的挑战，包括操作者依赖性、图像噪声和实时扫描困难，以及现有大模型难以处理超声复杂性的问题。

Method: 构建200万规模多模态数据集，采用三阶段训练策略：领域专业化预训练、指令驱动对齐和基于强化的精炼，Dolphin R1通过超声特定奖励增强推理能力。

Result: Dolphin R1在U2-Bench八个超声任务中取得0.5835的U2分数，是次优模型（0.2968）的两倍多；Dolphin v1.0在分类、检测、回归和报告生成等任务中表现可靠。

Conclusion: 推理增强训练显著提高了诊断准确性、一致性和可解释性，证明了统一框架在高风险医疗AI中的重要性，为超声AI集成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Ultrasound is crucial in modern medicine but faces challenges like operator
dependence, image noise, and real-time scanning, hindering AI integration.
While large multimodal models excel in other medical imaging areas, they
struggle with ultrasound's complexities. To address this, we introduce Dolphin
v1.0 (V1) and its reasoning-augmented version, Dolphin R1-the first large-scale
multimodal ultrasound foundation models unifying diverse clinical tasks in a
single vision-language framework.To tackle ultrasound variability and noise, we
curated a 2-million-scale multimodal dataset, combining textbook knowledge,
public data, synthetic samples, and general corpora. This ensures robust
perception, generalization, and clinical adaptability.The Dolphin series
employs a three-stage training strategy: domain-specialized pretraining,
instruction-driven alignment, and reinforcement-based refinement. Dolphin v1.0
delivers reliable performance in classification, detection, regression, and
report generation. Dolphin R1 enhances diagnostic inference, reasoning
transparency, and interpretability through reinforcement learning with
ultrasound-specific rewards.Evaluated on U2-Bench across eight ultrasound
tasks, Dolphin R1 achieves a U2-score of 0.5835-over twice the second-best
model (0.2968) setting a new state of the art. Dolphin v1.0 also performs
competitively, validating the unified framework. Comparisons show
reasoning-enhanced training significantly improves diagnostic accuracy,
consistency, and interpretability, highlighting its importance for high-stakes
medical AI.

### [40] [ART-VITON: Measurement-Guided Latent Diffusion for Artifact-Free Virtual Try-On](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25749)
*Junseo Park,Hyeryung Jang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ART-VITON是一个基于测量的扩散框架，用于虚拟试穿任务，通过轨迹对齐求解器和无伪影测量引导采样，有效保留非试穿区域的身份和背景信息，消除边界伪影。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有虚拟试穿方法在保留非试穿区域方面存在挑战，直接替换策略会产生边界伪影，现有求解器在生成过程中存在语义漂移问题。

Method: 将虚拟试穿重新表述为线性逆问题，采用轨迹对齐求解器逐步强制执行测量一致性，集成基于残差先验的初始化和无伪影测量引导采样，结合数据一致性、频率级校正和周期性标准去噪。

Result: 在VITON-HD、DressCode和SHHQ-1.0数据集上的实验表明，ART-VITON能有效保留身份和背景，消除边界伪影，在视觉保真度和鲁棒性方面优于现有最先进基线方法。

Conclusion: ART-VITON通过测量引导的扩散框架成功解决了虚拟试穿中的边界伪影问题，实现了更好的非试穿区域保留效果。

Abstract: Virtual try-on (VITON) aims to generate realistic images of a person wearing
a target garment, requiring precise garment alignment in try-on regions and
faithful preservation of identity and background in non-try-on regions. While
latent diffusion models (LDMs) have advanced alignment and detail synthesis,
preserving non-try-on regions remains challenging. A common post-hoc strategy
directly replaces these regions with original content, but abrupt transitions
often produce boundary artifacts. To overcome this, we reformulate VITON as a
linear inverse problem and adopt trajectory-aligned solvers that progressively
enforce measurement consistency, reducing abrupt changes in non-try-on regions.
However, existing solvers still suffer from semantic drift during generation,
leading to artifacts. We propose ART-VITON, a measurement-guided diffusion
framework that ensures measurement adherence while maintaining artifact-free
synthesis. Our method integrates residual prior-based initialization to
mitigate training-inference mismatch and artifact-free measurement-guided
sampling that combines data consistency, frequency-level correction, and
periodic standard denoising. Experiments on VITON-HD, DressCode, and SHHQ-1.0
demonstrate that ART-VITON effectively preserves identity and background,
eliminates boundary artifacts, and consistently improves visual fidelity and
robustness over state-of-the-art baselines.

*Jia Jun Cheng Xian,Muchen Li,Haotian Yang,Xin Tao,Pengfei Wan,Leonid Sigal,Renjie Liao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了文本偏好优化(TPO)框架，无需配对图像偏好数据即可实现文本到图像模型的"免费午餐"对齐，通过让模型偏好匹配提示而非不匹配提示来改进文本-图像对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决扩散模型在文本到图像生成中文本与图像对齐不准确的问题，现有方法依赖昂贵的人工标注数据，存在可扩展性限制。

Method: 使用大语言模型扰动原始标题构建不匹配提示，训练模型偏好匹配提示而非不匹配提示，将DPO和KTO算法扩展到该设置得到TDPO和TKTO。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，该方法持续优于原始对应方法，获得更好的人类偏好分数和文本到图像对齐效果。

Conclusion: TPO框架提供了一种无需配对图像偏好数据的有效对齐方法，具有良好的通用性和兼容性。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based text-to-image (T2I) models have led to
remarkable success in generating high-quality images from textual prompts.
However, ensuring accurate alignment between the text and the generated image
remains a significant challenge for state-of-the-art diffusion models. To
address this, existing studies employ reinforcement learning with human
feedback (RLHF) to align T2I outputs with human preferences. These methods,
however, either rely directly on paired image preference data or require a
learned reward function, both of which depend heavily on costly, high-quality
human annotations and thus face scalability limitations. In this work, we
introduce Text Preference Optimization (TPO), a framework that enables
"free-lunch" alignment of T2I models, achieving alignment without the need for
paired image preference data. TPO works by training the model to prefer matched
prompts over mismatched prompts, which are constructed by perturbing original
captions using a large language model. Our framework is general and compatible
with existing preference-based algorithms. We extend both DPO and KTO to our
setting, resulting in TDPO and TKTO. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations
across multiple benchmarks show that our methods consistently outperform their
original counterparts, delivering better human preference scores and improved
text-to-image alignment. Our Open-source code is available at
https://github.com/DSL-Lab/T2I-Free-Lunch-Alignment.

### [42] [V-HUB: A Visual-Centric Humor Understanding Benchmark for Video LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25773)
*Zhengpeng Shi,Hengli Li,Yanpeng Zhao,Jianqun Zhou,Yuxuan Wang,Qinrong Cui,Wei Bi,Songchun Zhu,Bo Zhao,Zilong Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了v-HUB视觉幽默理解基准，评估多模态大语言模型仅通过视觉线索理解幽默的能力，发现模型在无音频的视频幽默理解上表现显著下降，音频有助于提升理解效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估和诊断多模态大语言模型理解幽默的能力，特别是在仅通过视觉线索的场景下，这对增强人机交互的参与度具有重要意义。

Method: 构建v-HUB基准，包含来自经典默片和在线资源的少语言短视频，每个视频配有字幕、描述和解释等丰富标注，支持字幕匹配和幽默解释等评估任务。

Result: 实验结果显示，所有模型在仅基于视觉线索的幽默理解上都面临困难，从文本评估转向视频评估时性能显著下降。音频的加入有助于视频幽默理解。

Conclusion: 多模态大语言模型在纯视觉幽默理解方面仍面临挑战，音频信息对视频幽默理解有益，表明整合更丰富的模态对复杂视频理解任务具有前景。

Abstract: AI models capable of comprehending humor hold real-world promise -- for
example, enhancing engagement in human-machine interactions. To gauge and
diagnose the capacity of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for humor
understanding, we introduce v-HUB, a novel visual-centric video humor
understanding benchmark. v-HUB comprises a curated collection of minimally
verbal short videos, sourced from classic silent films and online resources,
and reflecting real-world scenarios where humor can be appreciated purely
through visual cues. Each video clip is paired with rich annotations, including
captions, descriptions, and explanations, supporting evaluation tasks like
caption matching and humor explanation. To broaden its applicability, we
further construct an open-ended video QA task, making it readily integrable
into existing video understanding benchmarks. We evaluate a diverse set of
MLLMs, from specialized Video-LLMs to versatile OmniLLMs that can process
audio, covering both open-source and proprietary domains. The experimental
results expose the difficulties MLLMs face in comprehending humor from visual
cues alone. For example, all models exhibit a marked performance drop on
caption matching when moving from text-based to video-based evaluation (without
audio). Our findings also demonstrate that incorporating audio helps with video
humor understanding, highlighting the informativeness of sound and the promise
of integrating richer modalities for complex video understanding tasks.

### [43] [PCPO: Proportionate Credit Policy Optimization for Aligning Image Generation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25774)
*Jeongjae Lee,Jong Chul Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PCPO通过比例信用分配解决T2I模型强化学习中的训练不稳定问题，显著加速收敛并提升图像质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有策略梯度方法在文本到图像模型对齐中存在训练不稳定和高方差问题，阻碍收敛速度和图像质量

Method: 提出比例信用策略优化(PCPO)，通过稳定目标重构和时间步重新加权来强制比例信用分配

Result: PCPO显著优于现有策略梯度基线，包括最先进的DanceGRPO，在各方面都有提升

Conclusion: 比例信用分配是稳定T2I模型强化学习训练的关键，PCPO有效解决了模型崩溃等常见失败模式

Abstract: While reinforcement learning has advanced the alignment of text-to-image
(T2I) models, state-of-the-art policy gradient methods are still hampered by
training instability and high variance, hindering convergence speed and
compromising image quality. Our analysis identifies a key cause of this
instability: disproportionate credit assignment, in which the mathematical
structure of the generative sampler produces volatile and non-proportional
feedback across timesteps. To address this, we introduce Proportionate Credit
Policy Optimization (PCPO), a framework that enforces proportional credit
assignment through a stable objective reformulation and a principled
reweighting of timesteps. This correction stabilizes the training process,
leading to significantly accelerated convergence and superior image quality.
The improvement in quality is a direct result of mitigating model collapse, a
common failure mode in recursive training. PCPO substantially outperforms
existing policy gradient baselines on all fronts, including the
state-of-the-art DanceGRPO.

### [44] [Editable Noise Map Inversion: Encoding Target-image into Noise For High-Fidelity Image Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25776)
*Mingyu Kang,Yong Suk Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种可编辑噪声图反演方法，通过优化噪声图来平衡内容保持和编辑能力，解决了现有方法在文本引导图像编辑中难以紧密遵循目标提示的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型在文本引导图像编辑中，反演的噪声图虽然能忠实重建源图像，但限制了编辑灵活性，难以紧密遵循目标文本提示。

Method: 提出ENM反演方法，分析噪声图特性以增强可编辑性，通过可编辑噪声精炼来最小化重建和编辑噪声图之间的差异。

Result: 在广泛的图像编辑任务中，ENM反演在内容保持和编辑保真度方面优于现有方法，并能轻松应用于视频编辑以实现时间一致性。

Conclusion: ENM反演是一种有效的噪声图反演技术，能够同时确保内容保持和编辑能力，显著提升了文本引导图像编辑的性能。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generating
high-quality and diverse images. Building on these advancements, diffusion
models have also demonstrated exceptional performance in text-guided image
editing. A key strategy for effective image editing involves inverting the
source image into editable noise maps associated with the target image.
However, previous inversion methods face challenges in adhering closely to the
target text prompt. The limitation arises because inverted noise maps, while
enabling faithful reconstruction of the source image, restrict the flexibility
needed for desired edits. To overcome this issue, we propose Editable Noise Map
Inversion (ENM Inversion), a novel inversion technique that searches for
optimal noise maps to ensure both content preservation and editability. We
analyze the properties of noise maps for enhanced editability. Based on this
analysis, our method introduces an editable noise refinement that aligns with
the desired edits by minimizing the difference between the reconstructed and
edited noise maps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ENM Inversion
outperforms existing approaches across a wide range of image editing tasks in
both preservation and edit fidelity with target prompts. Our approach can also
be easily applied to video editing, enabling temporal consistency and content
manipulation across frames.

*Wen Wen,Tianwu Zhi,Kanglong Fan,Yang Li,Xinge Peng,Yabin Zhang,Yiting Liao,Junlin Li,Li Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EvoQuality是一个无需人工标注的自监督框架，通过自我一致性原则和成对多数投票生成伪标签，使用GRPO优化VLM的图像质量评估能力，在多个基准上显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型后训练方法依赖昂贵的人工标注数据，而自监督方法在感知领域如图像质量评估中的应用尚未充分探索。

Method: 采用自我一致性原则，通过成对多数投票生成伪标签，构建保真度奖励，使用GRPO进行迭代优化。

Result: 在多个IQA基准上，零样本性能提升31.8%，在7个基准中的5个上超越有监督的SOTA模型。

Conclusion: EvoQuality证明了自监督方法在提升VLM感知能力方面的有效性，无需人工标注即可达到或超越有监督方法的性能。

Abstract: Improving vision-language models (VLMs) in the post-training stage typically
relies on supervised fine-tuning or reinforcement learning, methods that
necessitate costly, human-annotated data. While self-supervised techniques such
as self-consistency have proven effective for enhancing reasoning capabilities,
their application to perceptual domains such as image quality assessment (IQA)
remains largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce EvoQuality, a novel
framework that enables a VLM to autonomously refine its quality perception
capabilities without any ground-truth labels. EvoQuality adapts the principle
of self-consistency to the ranking-based nature of IQA. It generates
pseudo-labels by performing pairwise majority voting on the VLM's own outputs
to establish a consensus on relative quality. These pseudo-rankings are then
formulated into a fidelity reward that guides the model's iterative evolution
through group relative policy optimization (GRPO). By iteratively leveraging
its own predictions, EvoQuality progressively refines the VLM's perceptual
capability. Extensive experiments show that EvoQuality boosts the base VLM's
zero-shot performance by 31.8\% on PLCC across diverse IQA benchmarks.
Remarkably, despite being entirely self-supervised, EvoQuality achieves
performance that is competitive with, or even surpasses, state-of-the-art
supervised VLM-based IQA models, outperforming these models on 5 out of 7 IQA
benchmarks.

*Yuan Gao,Sangwook Kim,Chris McIntosh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EchoingECG是一个概率性师生模型，利用不确定性感知的ECG嵌入和ECHO监督来改进基于ECG的心脏功能预测，在零样本、少样本和微调设置下均优于现有ECG基础模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心电图(ECG)成本低且易于获取，而超声心动图(ECHO)需要大量医院资源但临床评估至关重要。研究旨在利用ECG预测传统上需要更复杂ECHO才能获得的心脏功能指标。

Method: 提出EchoingECG概率师生模型，整合PCME++概率对比框架和ECHO-CLIP视觉语言预训练模型，将ECHO知识蒸馏到ECG表示中。

Result: 实验和外部验证显示，EchoingECG在基于ECG的ECHO预测任务中，在零样本、少样本和微调设置下均优于最先进的ECG基础模型。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提升了预测性能，还通过方差估计增强了模型性能的理解，识别了ECG中的不确定性区域。

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) is a widely used tool for assessing cardiac function
due to its low cost and accessibility. Emergent research shows that ECGs can
help make predictions on key outcomes traditionally derived from more complex
modalities such as echocardiograms (ECHO), enabling the use of ECGs as a more
accessible method to predict broader measurements of cardiac function. ECHO, in
particular, are of great importance because they require considerable hospital
resources while playing a key role in clinical cardiac assessment. To aid this
use case, we introduce EchoingECG, a probabilistic student-teacher model that
leverages uncertainty-aware ECG embeddings and ECHO supervision to improve
ECG-based cardiac function prediction. Our approach integrates Probabilistic
Cross-Modal Embeddings (PCME++), a probabilistic contrastive framework, with
ECHO-CLIP, a vision-language pre-trained model trained on ECHO-text pairs, to
distill ECHO knowledge into ECG representations. Through experiments and
external validation, we showed that EchoingECG outperforms state-of-the-art
foundation ECG models in zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tune settings for ECHO
predictions based on ECG. We also highlighted that variance estimation (enabled
through our method) enhanced our understanding of model performance by
identifying underlying regions of uncertainty within ECGs. The code is
available: https://github.com/mcintoshML/EchoingECG.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Point-It-Out (PIO)基准，用于通过精确视觉定位系统评估视觉语言模型的具身推理能力，包含三个层次评估阶段。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要通过基于图像标注的多选题评估VLMs的具身推理能力，缺乏对精确视觉定位的系统评估。

Method: 设计包含三个阶段的层次评估协议：S1-指称对象定位、S2-任务驱动指向、S3-视觉轨迹预测，数据来自室内、厨房、驾驶和机器人操作等关键领域。

Result: 对10多个最先进VLM的广泛实验发现：GPT-4o等通用模型在精确视觉定位中表现不如某些开源模型；MoLMO在S1和S2表现良好但在需要视觉轨迹规划的S3中表现不佳。

Conclusion: PIO基准揭示了当前VLMs在精确视觉定位方面的局限性，特别是在需要视觉轨迹规划的复杂具身推理任务中。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive world knowledge
across a wide range of tasks, making them promising candidates for embodied
reasoning applications. However, existing benchmarks primarily evaluate the
embodied reasoning ability of VLMs through multiple-choice questions based on
image annotations -- for example, selecting which trajectory better describes
an event in the image. In this work, we introduce the Point-It-Out (PIO)
benchmark, a novel benchmark designed to systematically assess the embodied
reasoning abilities of VLMs through precise visual grounding. We propose a
hierarchical evaluation protocol spanning three stages (S1: referred-object
localization, S2: task-driven pointing, and S3: visual trace prediction), with
data collected from critical domains for embodied intelligence, including
indoor, kitchen, driving, and robotic manipulation scenarios. Extensive
experiments with over ten state-of-the-art VLMs reveal several interesting
findings. For example, strong general-purpose models such as GPT-4o, while
excelling on many benchmarks (e.g., language, perception, and reasoning),
underperform compared to some open-source models in precise visual grounding;
models such as MoLMO perform well in S1 and S2 but struggle in S3, where
requires grounding combined with visual trace planning.

TL;DR: 提出DSGA模块结合LoRA，在极少量数据下高效微调SAM模型，用于农业图像中小密集物体的精确分割，仅需4.00M可训练参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决农业计算机视觉任务中训练数据有限和复杂田间条件下基础模型参数高效微调的挑战。

Method: 使用动态相似性图构建和自适应局部特征聚合的DSGA模块，结合LoRA创建互补优化框架，捕捉图像嵌入的局部和全局依赖关系。

Result: 在鹰嘴豆荚数据集上，相比基线SAM微调，结构度量提升17.31%，自适应F度量提升62.36%，在2、4、8、10样本设置下均表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法在复杂田间条件下实现了准确的豆荚计数（调整R平方0.8987），为自动化农业监测提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) of foundation models for agricultural
computer vision tasks remains challenging due to limited training data and
complex field conditions. This study introduces a Dynamic Similarity-based
Graph Adaptation (DSGA) module to adapt the Segment Anything Model (SAM) under
extreme data constraints for precise foreground and instance segmentation of
small dense objects in complex agricultural environments. Through dynamic
similarity graph construction with a learnable polynomial decay-initialized
weight ranking mechanism and adaptive local feature aggregation, DSGA
establishes robust spatial and dynamic similarity representation with only
4.00M trainable parameters, which is 4.26% of the original SAM. Integrating
this graph-based feature adaptation with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) creates a
complementary optimization framework that effectively captures both local and
global dependencies in image embeddings while preserving model stability and
parameter efficiency. Experimental results on a challenging chickpea pod
dataset demonstrated that DSGA with LoRA achieved superior performance across
multiple metrics evaluated under 2, 4, 8 and 10 shots, with progressive
performance gains as shot count increased. Quantitative metrics showed a 17.31%
improvement in Structure-measure and a 62.36% gain in adaptive F-measure
compared to the baseline SAM fine-tuning. Comprehensive ablation studies and
visualization analyses through Grad-CAM and t-SNE validated the framework's
effectiveness in feature discrimination. The proposed adaptation demonstrated
practical utility for automated agricultural monitoring applications, achieving
accurate pod-counting with an adjusted R-squared of 0.8987 for images with 10
to 120 pods under challenging field conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型主要在通用基准上评估，而在智能产品审核等特定领域应用不足。传统logo识别方法依赖记忆数万个品牌的表示，在现实场景中不实用。

Method: 将logo识别重新制定为基于比较的任务，要求模型匹配产品图像与候选logo而非直接生成品牌标签。引入Logo Perception Grounding注入领域知识，Logo-Guided Visual Grounded Reasoning增强推理能力。

Result: Logo-VGR在OOD设置下比强基线方法提升近10个点，展示了优越的泛化性能。

Conclusion: Logo-VGR通过新的领域特定多模态推理范式，成功解决了logo识别中的泛化问题，为产品审核等实际应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have been
primarily evaluated on general-purpose benchmarks, while their applications in
domain-specific scenarios, such as intelligent product moderation, remain
underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce an open-world logo recognition
benchmark, a core challenge in product moderation. Unlike traditional logo
recognition methods that rely on memorizing representations of tens of
thousands of brands-an impractical approach in real-world settings-our proposed
method, Logo-VGR, enables generalization to large-scale brand recognition with
supervision from only a small subset of brands. Specifically, we reformulate
logo recognition as a comparison-based task, requiring the model to match
product images with candidate logos rather than directly generating brand
labels. We further observe that existing models tend to overfit by memorizing
brand distributions instead of learning robust multimodal reasoning, which
results in poor performance on unseen brands. To overcome this limitation,
Logo-VGR introduces a new paradigm of domain-specific multimodal reasoning:
Logo Perception Grounding injects domain knowledge, and Logo-Guided Visual
Grounded Reasoning enhances the model's reasoning capability. Experimental
results show that Logo-VGR outperforms strong baselines by nearly 10 points in
OOD settings, demonstrating superior generalization.

Abstract: Understanding the spatio-temporal distribution of species is a cornerstone of
ecology and conservation. By pairing species observations with geographic and
environmental predictors, researchers can model the relationship between an
environment and the species which may be found there. To advance the
state-of-the-art in this area with deep learning models and remote sensing
data, we organized an open machine learning challenge called GeoLifeCLEF 2023.
The training dataset comprised 5 million plant species observations (single
positive label per sample) distributed across Europe and covering most of its
flora, high-resolution rasters: remote sensing imagery, land cover, elevation,
in addition to coarse-resolution data: climate, soil and human footprint
variables. In this multi-label classification task, we evaluated models ability
to predict the species composition in 22 thousand small plots based on
standardized surveys. This paper presents an overview of the competition,
synthesizes the approaches used by the participating teams, and analyzes the
main results. In particular, we highlight the biases faced by the methods
fitted to single positive labels when it comes to the multi-label evaluation,
and the new and effective learning strategy combining single and multi-label
data in training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像描述评估指标主要针对短描述设计，不适用于长描述评估；现有LLM-as-a-Judge方法存在推理速度慢的问题。

Method: 提出VELA评估指标，采用新颖的LLM-Hybrid-as-a-Judge框架；构建LongCap-Arena基准，包含7,805张图像、对应的人类长参考描述和候选描述，以及32,246个人类判断。

Result: VELA在LongCap-Arena基准上超越了现有评估指标，并在描述性、相关性和流畅性三个维度上达到了超人类性能。

Conclusion: VELA是首个专门针对长图像描述自动评估的有效解决方案，解决了现有方法的局限性，在评估准确性和效率方面都表现出色。

Abstract: In this study, we focus on the automatic evaluation of long and detailed
image captions generated by multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Most
existing automatic evaluation metrics for image captioning are primarily
designed for short captions and are not suitable for evaluating long captions.
Moreover, recent LLM-as-a-Judge approaches suffer from slow inference due to
their reliance on autoregressive inference and early fusion of visual
information. To address these limitations, we propose VELA, an automatic
evaluation metric for long captions developed within a novel
LLM-Hybrid-as-a-Judge framework. Furthermore, we propose LongCap-Arena, a
benchmark specifically designed for evaluating metrics for long captions. This
benchmark comprises 7,805 images, the corresponding human-provided long
reference captions and long candidate captions, and 32,246 human judgments from
three distinct perspectives: Descriptiveness, Relevance, and Fluency. We
demonstrated that VELA outperformed existing metrics and achieved superhuman

### [52] [Training-Free Reward-Guided Image Editing via Trajectory Optimal Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25845)
*Jinho Chang,Jaemin Kim,Jong Chul Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练、基于奖励引导的图像编辑框架，将编辑过程建模为轨迹最优控制问题，在保持源图像语义内容的同时增强目标奖励。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于奖励引导的方法主要关注图像生成，而图像编辑任务需要在保持源图像内容的同时优化特定奖励，这一方向尚未充分探索。

Method: 将扩散模型的反向过程视为从源图像出发的可控轨迹，通过迭代更新伴随状态来引导编辑过程，无需额外训练。

Result: 在各种编辑任务上的实验表明，该方法显著优于现有的基于反转的无训练引导基线，在奖励最大化和源图像保真度之间达到更好平衡，且避免了奖励破解问题。

Conclusion: 提出的轨迹最优控制框架为无需训练的奖励引导图像编辑提供了有效解决方案，在保持图像内容的同时成功优化了目标奖励。

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion and flow-matching models have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in high-fidelity image synthesis. A prominent line of
research involves reward-guided guidance, which steers the generation process
during inference to align with specific objectives. However, leveraging this
reward-guided approach to the task of image editing, which requires preserving
the semantic content of the source image while enhancing a target reward, is
largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce a novel framework for
training-free, reward-guided image editing. We formulate the editing process as
a trajectory optimal control problem where the reverse process of a diffusion
model is treated as a controllable trajectory originating from the source
image, and the adjoint states are iteratively updated to steer the editing
process. Through extensive experiments across distinct editing tasks, we
demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing
inversion-based training-free guidance baselines, achieving a superior balance
between reward maximization and fidelity to the source image without reward
hacking.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文揭示了多模态推理的双重性：虽然能增强逻辑推理能力，但会逐渐损害感知基础，导致基本视觉问题识别失败。作者提出Vision-Anchored Policy Optimization (VAPO)方法来解决视觉遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管多模态推理在视觉语言模型中展现出潜力，但研究发现长时间推理会导致模型逐渐忽视视觉输入，造成视觉遗忘现象，影响基本视觉问题的识别能力。

Method: 提出Vision-Anchored Policy Optimization (VAPO)方法，通过明确引导推理过程朝向视觉基础轨迹，增强模型对视觉信息的依赖。

Result: VAPO-Thinker-7B模型显著增强了模型对视觉信息的依赖，并在多个基准测试中取得了新的最先进结果。

Conclusion: VAPO方法有效解决了多模态推理中的视觉遗忘问题，平衡了推理能力和感知基础，为视觉语言模型的发展提供了重要启示。

Abstract: Reasoning has emerged as a pivotal capability in Large Language Models
(LLMs). Through Reinforcement Learning (RL), typically Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO), these models are able to solve complex tasks such as
mathematics and code generation. Building on these advances, recent research
has sought to extend reasoning to Vision-Language Models (VLMs), yielding
promising results across diverse visual tasks. Despite this progress, our study
uncovers the dual nature of multimodal reasoning: while it substantially
enhances logical inference and facilitates performance on challenging problems,
it may gradually impair perceptual grounding, leading to recognition failures
on otherwise basic visual questions. Through further analysis, we attribute
this phenomenon to visual forgetting, wherein prolonged reasoning causes the
model to increasingly disregard visual input. To address this, we propose
Vision-Anchored Policy Optimization (VAPO), a simple yet effective method that
explicitly steers the reasoning process toward visually grounded trajectories.
Our result model, VAPO-Thinker-7B, significantly strengthens the model's
reliance on visual information and achieves new state-of-the-art results on a
wide range of established benchmarks. Project page:

TL;DR: MuSLR是首个基于形式逻辑规则的多模态符号逻辑推理基准，包含1,093个实例，涵盖7个领域。当前最先进的视觉语言模型在该基准上表现不佳，最佳模型GPT-4.1仅达到46.8%。作者提出的LogiCAM框架通过应用形式逻辑规则，显著提升了推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态符号逻辑推理在自动驾驶、医疗诊断等高风险应用中至关重要，其严格的确定性推理有助于防止严重后果。需要评估当前最先进视觉语言模型在这方面的能力。

Method: 创建MuSLR基准，包含1,093个实例，涵盖7个领域，包括35个原子符号逻辑和976个逻辑组合，推理深度从2到9。提出LogiCAM模块化框架，将形式逻辑规则应用于多模态输入。

Result: 评估7个最先进视觉语言模型，发现它们都在多模态符号推理方面表现挣扎，最佳模型GPT-4.1仅达到46.8%。LogiCAM框架将GPT-4.1的思维链性能提升了14.13%，在复杂逻辑如一阶逻辑上提升更大。错误分析显示约70%的失败源于模态间的逻辑不对齐。

Conclusion: 当前视觉语言模型在多模态符号逻辑推理方面仍有很大改进空间。LogiCAM框架展示了通过形式逻辑规则可以显著提升推理性能。模态间的逻辑对齐是未来改进的关键方向。

Abstract: Multimodal symbolic logical reasoning, which aims to deduce new facts from
multimodal input via formal logic, is critical in high-stakes applications such
as autonomous driving and medical diagnosis, as its rigorous, deterministic
reasoning helps prevent serious consequences. To evaluate such capabilities of
current state-of-the-art vision language models (VLMs), we introduce the first
benchmark MuSLR for multimodal symbolic logical reasoning grounded in formal
logical rules. MuSLR comprises 1,093 instances across 7 domains, including 35
atomic symbolic logic and 976 logical combinations, with reasoning depths
ranging from 2 to 9. We evaluate 7 state-of-the-art VLMs on MuSLR and find that
they all struggle with multimodal symbolic reasoning, with the best model,
GPT-4.1, achieving only 46.8%. Thus, we propose LogiCAM, a modular framework
that applies formal logical rules to multimodal inputs, boosting GPT-4.1's
Chain-of-Thought performance by 14.13%, and delivering even larger gains on
complex logics such as first-order logic. We also conduct a comprehensive error
analysis, showing that around 70% of failures stem from logical misalignment
between modalities, offering key insights to guide future improvements. All
data and code are publicly available at https://llm-symbol.github.io/MuSLR.

TL;DR: 提出了PatchEAD框架，一个统一的基于补丁的异常检测方法，无需训练即可与多种基础模型兼容，在少样本和零样本设置下表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业异常检测依赖基础模型，但现有研究主要关注文本提示调优，而视觉对应部分分散在各个基础模型的处理步骤中，缺乏统一框架。

Method: 提出PatchEAD框架，包含对齐模块和前景掩码等视觉提示技术，专注于补丁级别的相似性分析，无需训练即可适配多种基础模型。

Result: 实验显示在少样本和批量零样本场景下性能优于先前工作，即使不使用文本特征。研究了骨干网络结构和预训练特性对补丁相似性鲁棒性的影响。

Conclusion: 统一的纯补丁框架能够实现快速、轻量校准的部署，无需精心设计的文本提示，为实际视觉检测中基础模型的选择和配置提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Industrial anomaly detection is increasingly relying on foundation models,
aiming for strong out-of-distribution generalization and rapid adaptation in
real-world deployments. Notably, past studies have primarily focused on textual
prompt tuning, leaving the intrinsic visual counterpart fragmented into
processing steps specific to each foundation model. We aim to address this
limitation by proposing a unified patch-focused framework, Patch-Exclusive
Anomaly Detection (PatchEAD), enabling training-free anomaly detection that is
compatible with diverse foundation models. The framework constructs visual
prompting techniques, including an alignment module and foreground masking. Our
experiments show superior few-shot and batch zero-shot performance compared to
prior work, despite the absence of textual features. Our study further examines
how backbone structure and pretrained characteristics affect patch-similarity
robustness, providing actionable guidance for selecting and configuring
foundation models for real-world visual inspection. These results confirm that
a well-unified patch-only framework can enable quick, calibration-light
deployment without the need for carefully engineered textual prompts.

Main category: cs.CV

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 融合摄像头和LiDAR数据以增强空间理解，特别是在低光照条件下保持可靠性能的需求。

Method: 使用多摄像头配置，通过初始校准确定相机内参，自动计算LiDAR与相机间的几何变换，无需专用标定目标，并在融合前进行色彩校正以确保一致性。

Result: 使用Velodyne Puck Hi-Res LiDAR和四摄像头配置测试，优化后的软件实现了实时性能，在极低光照下也能可靠地进行色彩化，成功恢复原本无法检测的场景细节。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种高效、硬件无关的LiDAR点云色彩化解决方案，在低光照条件下表现出色，简化了系统设置并实现了实时处理。

Abstract: In recent years, the fusion of camera data with LiDAR measurements has
emerged as a powerful approach to enhance spatial understanding. This study
introduces a novel, hardware-agnostic methodology that generates colourised
point clouds from mechanical LiDAR using multiple camera inputs, providing
complete 360-degree coverage. The primary innovation lies in its robustness
under low-light conditions, achieved through the integration of a low-light
image enhancement module within the fusion pipeline. The system requires
initial calibration to determine intrinsic camera parameters, followed by
automatic computation of the geometric transformation between the LiDAR and
cameras, removing the need for specialised calibration targets and streamlining
the setup. The data processing framework uses colour correction to ensure
uniformity across camera feeds before fusion. The algorithm was tested using a
Velodyne Puck Hi-Res LiDAR and a four-camera configuration. The optimised
software achieved real-time performance and reliable colourisation even under
very low illumination, successfully recovering scene details that would
otherwise remain undetectable.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的提示学习方法通常依赖切片级提示，无法捕捉对癌症诊断至关重要的组织学实体（如细胞核、腺体）的亚型特异性表型变化。

Method: 使用LLM生成实体级和切片级提示；提出实体引导的交叉注意力模块生成实体级特征；开发跨尺度实体图学习模块丰富实体表示；结合实体级和切片级输出进行最终预测。

Result: 在三个癌症队列上的结果证实了该方法在解决少样本病理诊断任务中的有效性。

Conclusion: MAPLE框架通过多尺度属性增强的提示学习，成功提升了少样本全切片图像分类的性能，特别是在捕捉细粒度组织学特征方面表现出色。

Abstract: Prompt learning has emerged as a promising paradigm for adapting pre-trained
vision-language models (VLMs) to few-shot whole slide image (WSI)
classification by aligning visual features with textual representations,
thereby reducing annotation cost and enhancing model generalization.
Nevertheless, existing methods typically rely on slide-level prompts and fail
to capture the subtype-specific phenotypic variations of histological entities
(\emph{e.g.,} nuclei, glands) that are critical for cancer diagnosis. To
address this gap, we propose Multi-scale Attribute-enhanced Prompt Learning
(\textbf{MAPLE}), a hierarchical framework for few-shot WSI classification that
jointly integrates multi-scale visual semantics and performs prediction at both
the entity and slide levels. Specifically, we first leverage large language
models (LLMs) to generate entity-level prompts that can help identify
multi-scale histological entities and their phenotypic attributes, as well as
slide-level prompts to capture global visual descriptions. Then, an
entity-guided cross-attention module is proposed to generate entity-level
features, followed by aligning with their corresponding subtype-specific
attributes for fine-grained entity-level prediction. To enrich entity
representations, we further develop a cross-scale entity graph learning module
that can update these representations by capturing their semantic correlations
within and across scales. The refined representations are then aggregated into
a slide-level representation and aligned with the corresponding prompts for
slide-level prediction. Finally, we combine both entity-level and slide-level
outputs to produce the final prediction results. Results on three cancer
cohorts confirm the effectiveness of our approach in addressing few-shot
pathology diagnosis tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推动视觉语言模型从文本主导的思维链转向图像交互式推理，解决现有方法在数据构建准确性、结构设计和应用场景方面的不足

Method: 构建包含31k思维链推理轨迹的数据集，设计直接在视觉嵌入空间操作的模型，实现无需外部工具的图像-文本交错推理

Result: 在多模态推理基准测试中表现出强大性能，验证了数据集的有效性和模型设计的优越性

Conclusion: DeepSketcher成功实现了工具无关的灵活"图像思维"范式，为多模态推理的进一步发展提供了重要资源和方法

Abstract: The "thinking with images" paradigm represents a pivotal shift in the
reasoning of Vision Language Models (VLMs), moving from text-dominant
chain-of-thought to image-interactive reasoning. By invoking visual tools or
generating intermediate visual representations, VLMs can iteratively attend to
fine-grained regions, enabling deeper image understanding and more faithful
multimodal reasoning. As an emerging paradigm, however, it still leaves
substantial room for exploration in data construction accuracy, structural
design, and broader application scenarios, which offer rich opportunities for
advancing multimodal reasoning. To further advance this line of work, we
present DeepSketcher, a comprehensive suite comprising both an image-text
interleaved dataset and a self-contained model. The dataset contains 31k
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning trajectories with diverse tool calls and
resulting edited images, covering a wide range of data types and manipulation
instructions with high annotation accuracy. Building on this resource, we
design a model that performs interleaved image-text reasoning and natively
generates "visual thoughts" by operating directly in the visual embedding
space, rather than invoking external tools and repeatedly re-encoding generated
images. This design enables tool-free and more flexible "thinking with images".
Extensive experiments on multimodal reasoning benchmarks demonstrate strong
performance, validating both the utility of the dataset and the effectiveness
of the model design.

Abstract: We introduce mpLLM, a prompt-conditioned hierarchical mixture-of-experts
(MoE) architecture for visual question answering over multi-parametric 3D brain
MRI (mpMRI). mpLLM routes across modality-level and token-level projection
experts to fuse multiple interrelated 3D modalities, enabling efficient
training without image--report pretraining. To address limited image-text
paired supervision, mpLLM integrates a synthetic visual question answering
(VQA) protocol that generates medically relevant VQA from segmentation
annotations, and we collaborate with medical experts for clinical validation.
mpLLM outperforms strong medical VLM baselines by 5.3% on average across
multiple mpMRI datasets. Our study features three main contributions: (1) the
first clinically validated VQA dataset for 3D brain mpMRI, (2) a novel
multimodal LLM that handles multiple interrelated 3D modalities, and (3) strong
empirical results that demonstrate the medical utility of our methodology.
Ablations highlight the importance of modality-level and token-level experts
and prompt-conditioned routing. We have included our source code in the

Abstract: As Vision-Language Models (VLMs) move into interactive, multi-turn use, new
safety risks arise that single-turn or single-modality moderation misses. In
Multimodal Multi-Turn (MMT) dialogues, malicious intent can be spread across
turns and images, while context-sensitive replies may still advance harmful
content. To address this challenge, we present the first systematic definition
and study of MMT dialogue safety. Building on this formulation, we introduce
the Multimodal Multi-turn Dialogue Safety (MMDS) dataset. We further develop an
automated multimodal multi-turn red-teaming framework based on Monte Carlo Tree
Search (MCTS) to generate unsafe multimodal multi-turn dialogues for MMDS. MMDS
contains 4,484 annotated multimodal dialogue samples with fine-grained safety
ratings, policy dimension labels, and evidence-based rationales for both users
and assistants. Leveraging MMDS, we present LLaVAShield, a powerful tool that
jointly detects and assesses risk in user inputs and assistant responses.
Across comprehensive experiments, LLaVAShield consistently outperforms strong
baselines on MMT content moderation tasks and under dynamic policy
configurations, establishing new state-of-the-art results. We will publicly
release the dataset and model to support future research.

Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在需要精确定位的细粒度感知任务上表现不佳，因为语言中心架构难以生成精确的数值坐标。

Method: 提出VLM-FO1框架，包含混合细粒度区域编码器（HFRE）和基于token的引用系统，采用两阶段训练策略，可作为即插即用模块与预训练VLM集成。

Conclusion: VLM-FO1建立了感知感知VLMs的有效灵活范式，弥合了高层次推理与细粒度视觉定位之间的差距。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at high-level scene understanding but
falter on fine-grained perception tasks requiring precise localization. This
failure stems from a fundamental mismatch, as generating exact numerical
coordinates is a challenging task for language-centric architectures. In this
paper, we introduce VLM-FO1, a novel framework that overcomes this limitation
by reframing object-centric perception from a brittle coordinate generation
problem into a robust feature retrieval task. Our method operates as a
plug-and-play module that integrates with any pre-trained VLM. It leverages a
Hybrid Fine-grained Region Encoder (HFRE), featuring a dual vision encoder, to
generate powerful region tokens rich in both semantic and spatial detail. A
token-based referencing system then enables the LLM to seamlessly reason about
and ground language in these specific visual regions. Experiments show that
VLM-FO1 achieves state-of-the-art performance across a diverse suite of
benchmarks, demonstrating exceptional capabilities in object grounding, region
generational understanding, and visual region reasoning. Crucially, our
two-stage training strategy ensures that these perception gains are achieved
without compromising the base model's general visual understanding
capabilities. VLM-FO1 establishes an effective and flexible paradigm for
building perception-aware VLMs, bridging the gap between high-level reasoning
and fine-grained visual grounding.

TL;DR: 论文研究了训练数据特征对深度神经网络对抗鲁棒性的影响，发现鲁棒性随数据量和模型规模呈对数缩放规律增长，但数据质量、架构和训练目标比原始规模对实现广谱对抗鲁棒性更为关键。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管深度神经网络在架构和训练范式上有所进步，但仍然容易受到对抗样本的攻击。研究旨在探索训练数据特征如何影响对抗鲁棒性。

Method: 评估了36个最先进的视觉模型，涵盖监督学习、自监督学习和对比学习方法，训练数据集从120万到220亿张图像。在六种黑盒攻击类别下进行评估：随机扰动、两种几何掩码、COCO对象操作、ImageNet-C损坏和ImageNet-R风格迁移。

Result: 鲁棒性随数据量和模型规模呈对数缩放规律：数据量增加十倍，攻击成功率平均降低约3.2%；模型规模增加十倍，攻击成功率平均降低约13.4%。一些在精选数据集上训练的自监督模型（如DINOv2）表现优于在更大但质量较差数据集上训练的模型。对抗微调改善了结构变化的泛化能力，但对颜色分布的泛化能力没有改善。人类评估显示人类与机器视觉之间存在持续差距。

Conclusion: 虽然扩展规模能提高鲁棒性，但数据质量、架构和训练目标在实现广谱对抗鲁棒性方面比原始规模起着更决定性的作用。

Abstract: Deep neural networks remain vulnerable to adversarial examples despite
advances in architectures and training paradigms. We investigate how training
data characteristics affect adversarial robustness across 36 state-of-the-art
vision models spanning supervised, self-supervised, and contrastive learning
approaches, trained on datasets from 1.2M to 22B images. Models were evaluated
under six black-box attack categories: random perturbations, two types of
geometric masks, COCO object manipulations, ImageNet-C corruptions, and
ImageNet-R style shifts. Robustness follows a logarithmic scaling law with both
data volume and model size: a tenfold increase in data reduces attack success
rate (ASR) on average by ~3.2%, whereas a tenfold increase in model size
reduces ASR on average by ~13.4%. Notably, some self-supervised models trained
on curated datasets, such as DINOv2, outperform others trained on much larger
but less curated datasets, challenging the assumption that scale alone drives
robustness. Adversarial fine-tuning of ResNet50s improves generalization across
structural variations but not across color distributions. Human evaluation
reveals persistent gaps between human and machine vision. These results show
that while scaling improves robustness, data quality, architecture, and
training objectives play a more decisive role than raw scale in achieving
broad-spectrum adversarial resilience.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniMMAD是一个统一的多模态多类别异常检测框架，通过MoE驱动的特征解压缩机制实现自适应和分离的重建，在9个数据集上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有异常检测方法将模态和类别视为独立因素，导致解决方案碎片化、内存开销过大，且基于重建的多类别方法因共享解码路径而难以处理跨域大变化，造成正态边界扭曲、域干扰和高误报率。

Method: 采用混合专家(MoE)驱动的特征解压缩机制，遵循"从通用到特定"范式：编码阶段将多模态输入压缩为紧凑通用特征，解码阶段通过稀疏门控交叉MoE将通用特征解压缩为模态特定和类别特定形式，并设计了分组动态过滤机制和MoE-in-MoE结构以提高效率。

Result: 在9个异常检测数据集上达到最先进性能，涵盖3个领域、12种模态和66个类别，同时参数使用减少75%并保持稀疏激活和快速推理。

Conclusion: UniMMAD通过统一的框架有效解决了多模态多类别异常检测中的碎片化问题和性能限制，实现了高效且高性能的异常检测。

Abstract: Existing anomaly detection (AD) methods often treat the modality and class as
independent factors. Although this paradigm has enriched the development of AD
research branches and produced many specialized models, it has also led to
fragmented solutions and excessive memory overhead. Moreover,
reconstruction-based multi-class approaches typically rely on shared decoding
paths, which struggle to handle large variations across domains, resulting in
distorted normality boundaries, domain interference, and high false alarm
rates. To address these limitations, we propose UniMMAD, a unified framework
for multi-modal and multi-class anomaly detection. At the core of UniMMAD is a
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-driven feature decompression mechanism, which enables
adaptive and disentangled reconstruction tailored to specific domains. This
process is guided by a ``general to specific'' paradigm. In the encoding stage,
multi-modal inputs of varying combinations are compressed into compact,
general-purpose features. The encoder incorporates a feature compression module
to suppress latent anomalies, encourage cross-modal interaction, and avoid
shortcut learning. In the decoding stage, the general features are decompressed
into modality-specific and class-specific forms via a sparsely-gated cross MoE,
which dynamically selects expert pathways based on input modality and class. To
further improve efficiency, we design a grouped dynamic filtering mechanism and
a MoE-in-MoE structure, reducing parameter usage by 75\% while maintaining
sparse activation and fast inference. UniMMAD achieves state-of-the-art
performance on 9 anomaly detection datasets, spanning 3 fields, 12 modalities,
and 66 classes.

TL;DR: 提出CO3方法，通过校正采样策略改善文本到图像扩散模型中的多概念提示保真度，避免概念缺失或碰撞问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多概念提示（如"猫和狗"）在生成图像时出现的概念缺失、模糊或相互碰撞等常见失败情况。

Method: 引入校正采样策略，引导模型远离联合提示行为与任何单一概念重叠过强的区域，同时优化多概念引导方案在稳定权重区间内运行。

Result: 在多样化多概念提示上的实验表明，相比标准基线和现有组合方法，CO3在概念覆盖度、平衡性和鲁棒性方面均有提升，减少了概念丢失或扭曲现象。

Conclusion: 轻量级校正引导可以显著缓解现代扩散系统中脆弱的语义对齐行为，该方法即插即用，无需模型调优，可与标准无分类器引导互补。

Abstract: We propose to improve multi-concept prompt fidelity in text-to-image
diffusion models. We begin with common failure cases-prompts like "a cat and a
dog" that sometimes yields images where one concept is missing, faint, or
colliding awkwardly with another. We hypothesize that this happens when the
diffusion model drifts into mixed modes that over-emphasize a single concept it
learned strongly during training. Instead of re-training, we introduce a
corrective sampling strategy that steers away from regions where the joint
prompt behavior overlaps too strongly with any single concept in the prompt.
The goal is to steer towards "pure" joint modes where all concepts can coexist
with balanced visual presence. We further show that existing multi-concept
guidance schemes can operate in unstable weight regimes that amplify imbalance;
we characterize favorable regions and adapt sampling to remain within them. Our
approach, CO3, is plug-and-play, requires no model tuning, and complements
standard classifier-free guidance. Experiments on diverse multi-concept prompts
indicate improvements in concept coverage, balance and robustness, with fewer
dropped or distorted concepts compared to standard baselines and prior
compositional methods. Results suggest that lightweight corrective guidance can
substantially mitigate brittle semantic alignment behavior in modern diffusion
systems.

TL;DR: 提出SS-ACL框架，通过自监督解剖一致性学习，无需专家标注即可生成视觉基础医学报告，在词汇准确性和临床有效性方面显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学报告生成方法依赖单独训练的检测模块，需要大量专家标注，成本高且由于病理分布偏差导致泛化性受限。

Method: 构建层次化解剖图，基于人体解剖的固有包含结构组织实体；通过递归重建细粒度解剖区域实现空间对齐；引入基于解剖一致性的区域级对比学习增强语义对齐。

Result: 无需专家标注，在词汇准确性上优于最先进方法10%，临床有效性提升25%；在下游视觉任务中，零样本视觉基础性能超过当前领先视觉基础模型8%。

Conclusion: SS-ACL框架成功实现了无需专家标注的视觉基础医学报告生成，在准确性和临床实用性方面表现出色，同时在下游任务中展现出强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: Vision-grounded medical report generation aims to produce clinically accurate
descriptions of medical images, anchored in explicit visual evidence to improve
interpretability and facilitate integration into clinical workflows. However,
existing methods often rely on separately trained detection modules that
require extensive expert annotations, introducing high labeling costs and
limiting generalizability due to pathology distribution bias across datasets.
To address these challenges, we propose Self-Supervised Anatomical Consistency
Learning (SS-ACL) -- a novel and annotation-free framework that aligns
generated reports with corresponding anatomical regions using simple textual
prompts. SS-ACL constructs a hierarchical anatomical graph inspired by the
invariant top-down inclusion structure of human anatomy, organizing entities by
spatial location. It recursively reconstructs fine-grained anatomical regions
to enforce intra-sample spatial alignment, inherently guiding attention maps
toward visually relevant areas prompted by text. To further enhance
inter-sample semantic alignment for abnormality recognition, SS-ACL introduces
a region-level contrastive learning based on anatomical consistency. These
aligned embeddings serve as priors for report generation, enabling attention
maps to provide interpretable visual evidence. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that SS-ACL, without relying on expert annotations, (i) generates
accurate and visually grounded reports -- outperforming state-of-the-art
methods by 10\% in lexical accuracy and 25\% in clinical efficacy, and (ii)
achieves competitive performance on various downstream visual tasks, surpassing
current leading visual foundation models by 8\% in zero-shot visual grounding.

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一个灵活且高效的框架，能够应对水下鲑鱼跟踪的独特挑战，并为自动化鲑鱼福利监测提供了可靠的技术基础。

Abstract: Computer Vision (CV)-based continuous, automated and precise salmon welfare
monitoring is a key step toward reduced salmon mortality and improved salmon
welfare in industrial aquaculture net pens. Available CV methods for
determining welfare indicators focus on single indicators and rely on object
detectors and trackers from other application areas to aid their welfare
indicator calculation algorithm. This comes with a high resource demand for
real-world applications, since each indicator must be calculated separately. In
addition, the methods are vulnerable to difficulties in underwater salmon
scenes, such as object occlusion, similar object appearance, and similar object
motion. To address these challenges, we propose a flexible tracking framework
that uses a pose estimation network to extract bounding boxes around salmon and
their corresponding body parts, and exploits information about the body parts,
through specialized modules, to tackle challenges specific to underwater salmon
scenes. Subsequently, the high-detail body part tracks are employed to
calculate welfare indicators. We construct two novel datasets assessing two
salmon tracking challenges: salmon ID transfers in crowded scenes and salmon ID
switches during turning. Our method outperforms the current state-of-the-art
pedestrian tracker, BoostTrack, for both salmon tracking challenges.
Additionally, we create a dataset for calculating salmon tail beat wavelength,
demonstrating that our body part tracking method is well-suited for automated
welfare monitoring based on tail beat analysis. Datasets and code are available
at https://github.com/espenbh/BoostCompTrack.

Motivation: 现有交互式分割方法局限于粗粒度的实例级目标，而非交互式方法难以处理稀疏的真实世界扫描数据，且缺乏标注数据。

Method: 开发了新的3D数据合成流水线创建大规模场景级数据集，提出PinPoint3D交互框架，通过用户点点击实现细粒度分割。

Result: 在首次点击设置下平均IoU达到55.8%，仅需少量额外点击即可超过71.3% IoU，相比现有方法IoU和精度提升高达16%。

Conclusion: 该工作代表了在复杂3D环境中实现更细致精确的机器感知和交互的重要进展。

Abstract: Fine-grained 3D part segmentation is crucial for enabling embodied AI systems
to perform complex manipulation tasks, such as interacting with specific
functional components of an object. However, existing interactive segmentation
methods are largely confined to coarse, instance-level targets, while
non-interactive approaches struggle with sparse, real-world scans and suffer
from a severe lack of annotated data. To address these limitations, we
introduce PinPoint3D, a novel interactive framework for fine-grained,
multi-granularity 3D segmentation, capable of generating precise part-level
masks from only a few user point clicks. A key component of our work is a new
3D data synthesis pipeline that we developed to create a large-scale,
scene-level dataset with dense part annotations, overcoming a critical
bottleneck that has hindered progress in this field. Through comprehensive
experiments and user studies, we demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms existing approaches, achieving an average IoU of around 55.8% on
each object part under first-click settings and surpassing 71.3% IoU with only
a few additional clicks. Compared to current state-of-the-art baselines,
PinPoint3D yields up to a 16% improvement in IoU and precision, highlighting
its effectiveness on challenging, sparse point clouds with high efficiency. Our
work represents a significant step towards more nuanced and precise machine
perception and interaction in complex 3D environments.

Motivation: 当前VICL方法基于视觉相似性优先假设选择上下文示例，但该假设缺乏充分理论依据；同时Partial2Global依赖随机采样构建全局排序，导致覆盖不完整和冗余采样问题。

Method: 使用jackknife conformal prediction构建可靠替代集，采用covering design-based sampling方法确保成对偏好的全面均匀覆盖。

Result: 大量实验表明RH-Partial2Global在多种视觉任务中表现优异，优于Partial2Global方法。

Conclusion: RH-Partial2Global方法能够可靠且全面地选择视觉上下文学习中的示例，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Visual In-Context Learning (VICL) has emerged as a prominent approach for
adapting visual foundation models to novel tasks, by effectively exploiting
contextual information embedded in in-context examples, which can be formulated
as a global ranking problem of potential candidates. Current VICL methods, such
as Partial2Global and VPR, are grounded in the similarity-priority assumption
that images more visually similar to a query image serve as better in-context
examples. This foundational assumption, while intuitive, lacks sufficient
justification for its efficacy in selecting optimal in-context examples.
Furthermore, Partial2Global constructs its global ranking from a series of
randomly sampled pairwise preference predictions. Such a reliance on random
sampling can lead to incomplete coverage and redundant samplings of
comparisons, thus further adversely impacting the final global ranking. To
address these issues, this paper introduces an enhanced variant of
Partial2Global designed for reliable and holistic selection of in-context
examples in VICL. Our proposed method, dubbed RH-Partial2Global, leverages a
jackknife conformal prediction-guided strategy to construct reliable
alternative sets and a covering design-based sampling approach to ensure
comprehensive and uniform coverage of pairwise preferences. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that RH-Partial2Global achieves excellent performance
and outperforms Partial2Global across diverse visual tasks.

<details>

Motivation: 传统注意力机制在视频编辑中存在二次计算复杂度问题，难以适应长时长高分辨率视频，限制了实时视频处理的实际应用

Method: 将线性时空聚合模块集成到基于扩散的视频模型中，利用RWKV变换器的双向加权键值循环机制捕获全局依赖并保持时间一致性

Result: 相比最先进的基于扩散的视频编辑方法，实现了3.7倍加速和60%内存降低，同时在帧一致性和文本对齐方面保持竞争力

Conclusion: 该方法在长视频编辑中与自注意力架构的速度差距更加显著，为高效视频编辑提供了可行解决方案

Abstract: In light of recent progress in video editing, deep learning models focusing
on both spatial and temporal dependencies have emerged as the primary method.
However, these models suffer from the quadratic computational complexity of
traditional attention mechanisms, making them difficult to adapt to
long-duration and high-resolution videos. This limitation restricts their
applicability in practical contexts such as real-time video processing. To
tackle this challenge, we introduce a method to reduce both time and space
complexity of these systems by proposing VRWKV-Editor, a novel video editing
model that integrates a linear spatio-temporal aggregation module into
video-based diffusion models. VRWKV-Editor leverages bidirectional weighted
key-value recurrence mechanism of the RWKV transformer to capture global
dependencies while preserving temporal coherence, achieving linear complexity
without sacrificing quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
proposed method achieves up to 3.7x speedup and 60% lower memory usage compared
to state-of-the-art diffusion-based video editing methods, while maintaining
competitive performance in frame consistency and text alignment. Furthermore, a
comparative analysis we conducted on videos with different sequence lengths
confirms that the gap in editing speed between our approach and architectures
with self-attention becomes more significant with long videos.

Result: 在EPIC-Kitchens和Ego4D数据集上，WISH超越了所有基线方法，性能达到全监督方法的50%以上

Conclusion: 自然语言叙述可作为有效的弱监督信号，显著降低手部物体分割任务的标注成本

Abstract: Pixel-level recognition of objects manipulated by the user from egocentric
images enables key applications spanning assistive technologies, industrial
safety, and activity monitoring. However, progress in this area is currently
hindered by the scarcity of annotated datasets, as existing approaches rely on
costly manual labels. In this paper, we propose to learn human-object
interaction detection leveraging narrations -- natural language descriptions of
the actions performed by the camera wearer which contain clues about
manipulated objects (e.g., "I am pouring vegetables from the chopping board to
the pan"). Narrations provide a form of weak supervision that is cheap to
acquire and readily available in state-of-the-art egocentric datasets. We
introduce Narration-Supervised in-Hand Object Segmentation (NS-iHOS), a novel
task where models have to learn to segment in-hand objects by learning from
natural-language narrations. Narrations are then not employed at inference
time. We showcase the potential of the task by proposing Weakly-Supervised
In-hand Object Segmentation from Human Narrations (WISH), an end-to-end model
distilling knowledge from narrations to learn plausible hand-object
associations and enable in-hand object segmentation without using narrations at
test time. We benchmark WISH against different baselines based on
open-vocabulary object detectors and vision-language models, showing the
superiority of its design. Experiments on EPIC-Kitchens and Ego4D show that
WISH surpasses all baselines, recovering more than 50% of the performance of
fully supervised methods, without employing fine-grained pixel-wise
annotations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统IQA方法使用固定模型输出标量分数，难以适应不同失真类型、用户特定查询和可解释性需求，且评分与解释通常分离处理。

Method: 采用模块化代理框架，包含规划器、执行器和总结器，将IQA分解为失真检测、失真分析、工具选择和工具执行四个子任务。

Result: 在多个IQA数据集上的实验表明，AgenticIQA在评分准确性和解释对齐方面均优于强基线方法。

Conclusion: AgenticIQA通过动态集成VLMs和传统IQA工具，实现了更准确和可解释的图像质量评估，并提供了相应的训练数据集和评估基准。

Abstract: Image quality assessment (IQA) is inherently complex, as it reflects both the
quantification and interpretation of perceptual quality rooted in the human
visual system. Conventional approaches typically rely on fixed models to output
scalar scores, limiting their adaptability to diverse distortions,
user-specific queries, and interpretability needs. Furthermore, scoring and
interpretation are often treated as independent processes, despite their
interdependence: interpretation identifies perceptual degradations, while
scoring abstracts them into a compact metric. To address these limitations, we
propose AgenticIQA, a modular agentic framework that integrates vision-language
models (VLMs) with traditional IQA tools in a dynamic, query-aware manner.
AgenticIQA decomposes IQA into four subtasks -- distortion detection,
distortion analysis, tool selection, and tool execution -- coordinated by a
planner, executor, and summarizer. The planner formulates task-specific
strategies, the executor collects perceptual evidence via tool invocation, and
the summarizer integrates this evidence to produce accurate scores with
human-aligned explanations. To support training and evaluation, we introduce
AgenticIQA-200K, a large-scale instruction dataset tailored for IQA agents, and
AgenticIQA-Eval, the first benchmark for assessing the planning, execution, and
summarization capabilities of VLM-based IQA agents. Extensive experiments
across diverse IQA datasets demonstrate that AgenticIQA consistently surpasses
strong baselines in both scoring accuracy and explanatory alignment.

Conclusion: 这是首个关于异构针孔-鱼眼深度估计的系统性研究，提供了技术新颖性和有价值的实证见解。

Abstract: In this paper, we present the first pinhole-fisheye framework for
heterogeneous multi-view depth estimation, PFDepth. Our key insight is to
exploit the complementary characteristics of pinhole and fisheye imagery
(undistorted vs. distorted, small vs. large FOV, far vs. near field) for joint
optimization. PFDepth employs a unified architecture capable of processing
arbitrary combinations of pinhole and fisheye cameras with varied intrinsics
and extrinsics. Within PFDepth, we first explicitly lift 2D features from each
heterogeneous view into a canonical 3D volumetric space. Then, a core module
termed Heterogeneous Spatial Fusion is designed to process and fuse
distortion-aware volumetric features across overlapping and non-overlapping
regions. Additionally, we subtly reformulate the conventional voxel fusion into
a novel 3D Gaussian representation, in which learnable latent Gaussian spheres
dynamically adapt to local image textures for finer 3D aggregation. Finally,
fused volume features are rendered into multi-view depth maps. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate that PFDepth sets a state-of-the-art
performance on KITTI-360 and RealHet datasets over current mainstream depth
networks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic study of
heterogeneous pinhole-fisheye depth estimation, offering both technical novelty
and valuable empirical insights.

Motivation: 传统二阶PDE模型在抑制乘性噪声时会在去噪早期引入块状伪影，需要开发更有效的模型来解决这个问题。

Method: 使用四阶非线性PDE模型，结合拉普拉斯算子和强度值的扩散过程，以及保持细节纹理的波部分，对彩色图像分别处理每个通道。

Result: 在PSNR、MSSIM和SI等指标上均优于现有的二阶各向异性扩散方法，在灰度图像和彩色图像上都取得了更好的去噪效果。

Conclusion: 提出的四阶PDE模型在抑制乘性噪声方面优于现有方法，能有效减少伪影并保持图像细节和纹理。

Abstract: Second-order PDE models have been widely used for suppressing multiplicative
noise, but they often introduce blocky artifacts in the early stages of
denoising. To resolve this, we propose a fourth-order nonlinear PDE model that
integrates diffusion and wave properties. The diffusion process, guided by both
the Laplacian and intensity values, reduces noise better than gradient-based
methods, while the wave part keeps fine details and textures. The effectiveness
of the proposed model is evaluated against two second-order anisotropic
diffusion approaches using the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Mean
Structural Similarity Index (MSSIM) for images with available ground truth. For
SAR images, where a noise-free reference is unavailable, the Speckle Index (SI)
is used to measure noise reduction. Additionally, we extend the proposed model
to study color images by applying the denoising process independently to each
channel, preserving both structure and color consistency. The same quantitative
metrics PSNR and MSSIM are used for performance evaluation, ensuring a fair
comparison across grayscale and color images. In all the cases, our computed
results produce better results compared to existing models in this genre.

TL;DR: SETR提出了一种两阶段零样本组合图像检索方法，通过交集驱动的粗检索和基于多模态LLM的细粒度重排序，解决了CLIP方法中特征融合不精确和语义关系解析不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于CLIP的零样本组合图像检索方法面临两个核心挑战：基于并集的特征融合会携带不相关的背景细节，而CLIP的全局余弦相似度缺乏解析细粒度语义关系的能力。

Method: SETR采用两阶段检索：1）粗检索阶段使用交集驱动策略保留参考图像和相对文本的重叠语义；2）重排序阶段使用适配的多模态LLM进行二元语义相关性判断，验证关系和属性级一致性。

Result: 在CIRR、Fashion-IQ和CIRCO数据集上的实验表明，SETR达到了新的最先进性能，在CIRR上的Recall@1提高了15.15个百分点。

Conclusion: 两阶段推理为稳健且可移植的零样本组合图像检索提供了一个通用范式。

Abstract: Zero-shot Composed Image Retrieval (ZS-CIR) aims to retrieve a target image
given a reference image and a relative text, without relying on costly triplet
annotations. Existing CLIP-based methods face two core challenges: (1)
union-based feature fusion indiscriminately aggregates all visual cues,
carrying over irrelevant background details that dilute the intended
modification, and (2) global cosine similarity from CLIP embeddings lacks the
ability to resolve fine-grained semantic relations. To address these issues, we
propose SETR (Semantic-enhanced Two-Stage Retrieval). In the coarse retrieval
stage, SETR introduces an intersection-driven strategy that retains only the
overlapping semantics between the reference image and relative text, thereby
filtering out distractors inherent to union-based fusion and producing a
cleaner, high-precision candidate set. In the fine-grained re-ranking stage, we
adapt a pretrained multimodal LLM with Low-Rank Adaptation to conduct binary
semantic relevance judgments ("Yes/No"), which goes beyond CLIP's global
feature matching by explicitly verifying relational and attribute-level
consistency. Together, these two stages form a complementary pipeline: coarse
retrieval narrows the candidate pool with high recall, while re-ranking ensures
precise alignment with nuanced textual modifications. Experiments on CIRR,
Fashion-IQ, and CIRCO show that SETR achieves new state-of-the-art performance,
improving Recall@1 on CIRR by up to 15.15 points. Our results establish
two-stage reasoning as a general paradigm for robust and portable ZS-CIR.

Motivation: 解决遥感数据与OSM数据之间的模态差异（数据结构、内容和空间粒度不同），使遥感基础模型能够有效利用丰富的地理上下文信息。

Method: 在预训练阶段使用OSM数据提供多粒度学习信号，通过跨模态空间相关性指导信息交互；引入图像掩码重建实现稀疏输入。在下游任务中生成单模态和多模态细粒度编码。

Conclusion: 多模态协同在推进高级地理空间人工智能方面具有巨大潜力，空间相关性在多模态地理数据整合中起着关键作用。

Abstract: Integrating ground-level geospatial data with rich geographic context, like
OpenStreetMap (OSM), into remote sensing (RS) foundation models (FMs) is
essential for advancing geospatial intelligence and supporting a broad spectrum
of tasks. However, modality gap between RS and OSM data, including differences
in data structure, content, and spatial granularity, makes effective synergy
highly challenging, and most existing RS FMs focus on imagery alone. To this
end, this study presents GeoLink, a multimodal framework that leverages OSM
data to enhance RS FM during both the pretraining and downstream task stages.
Specifically, GeoLink enhances RS self-supervised pretraining using
multi-granularity learning signals derived from OSM data, guided by cross-modal
spatial correlations for information interaction and collaboration. It also
introduces image mask-reconstruction to enable sparse input for efficient
pretraining. For downstream tasks, GeoLink generates both unimodal and
multimodal fine-grained encodings to support a wide range of applications, from
common RS interpretation tasks like land cover classification to more
comprehensive geographic tasks like urban function zone mapping. Extensive
experiments show that incorporating OSM data during pretraining enhances the
performance of the RS image encoder, while fusing RS and OSM data in downstream
tasks improves the FM's adaptability to complex geographic scenarios. These
results underscore the potential of multimodal synergy in advancing high-level
geospatial artificial intelligence. Moreover, we find that spatial correlation
plays a crucial role in enabling effective multimodal geospatial data
integration. Code, checkpoints, and using examples are released at

Conclusion: 分块视频超分辨率方法在保持内容保真度的同时显著提高了计算效率，为高分辨率视频生成提供了灵活高效的解决方案

Abstract: Pre-trained video generation models hold great potential for generative video
super-resolution (VSR). However, adapting them for full-size VSR, as most
existing methods do, suffers from unnecessary intensive full-attention
computation and fixed output resolution. To overcome these limitations, we make
the first exploration into utilizing video diffusion priors for patch-wise VSR.
This is non-trivial because pre-trained video diffusion models are not native
for patch-level detail generation. To mitigate this challenge, we propose an
innovative approach, called PatchVSR, which integrates a dual-stream adapter
for conditional guidance. The patch branch extracts features from input patches
to maintain content fidelity while the global branch extracts context features
from the resized full video to bridge the generation gap caused by incomplete
semantics of patches. Particularly, we also inject the patch's location
information into the model to better contextualize patch synthesis within the
global video frame. Experiments demonstrate that our method can synthesize
high-fidelity, high-resolution details at the patch level. A tailor-made
multi-patch joint modulation is proposed to ensure visual consistency across
individually enhanced patches. Due to the flexibility of our patch-based
paradigm, we can achieve highly competitive 4K VSR based on a 512x512
resolution base model, with extremely high efficiency.

Motivation: 解决深度学习中OOD泛化的核心挑战，特别是在生物医学图像领域，现有方法追求领域不变性但可能忽略泛化的因果机制。

Method: 使用因果引导的高斯扰动框架，通过软因果掩码在输入图像中注入空间变化噪声，对背景区域施加更强扰动，前景区域施加较弱扰动。

Result: 在WILDS基准测试Camelyon17上表现出优于现有OOD基线的持续性能提升。

Conclusion: 因果扰动作为可靠且可解释的泛化工具具有潜力，能够鼓励模型依赖因果相关特征而非虚假相关性。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization remains a central challenge in
deploying deep learning models to real-world scenarios, particularly in domains
such as biomedical images, where distribution shifts are both subtle and
pervasive. While existing methods often pursue domain invariance through
complex generative models or adversarial training, these approaches may
overlook the underlying causal mechanisms of generalization.In this work, we
propose Causally-Guided Gaussian Perturbations (CGP)-a lightweight framework
that enhances OOD generalization by injecting spatially varying noise into
input images, guided by soft causal masks derived from Vision Transformers. By
applying stronger perturbations to background regions and weaker ones to
foreground areas, CGP encourages the model to rely on causally relevant
features rather than spurious correlations.Experimental results on the
challenging WILDS benchmark Camelyon17 demonstrate consistent performance gains
over state-of-the-art OOD baselines, highlighting the potential of causal

*Christoph Timmermann,Hyunse Lee,Woojin Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SeMoBridge通过语义模态桥将图像映射到文本模态，解决CLIP在少样本分类中的模态内不对齐问题，在低数据场景下表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP在少样本分类中存在模态内不对齐问题，由模态间隙和仅跨模态训练目标导致，使图像间直接比较不可靠。现有方法要么优化相似度逻辑，要么进行昂贵的逐样本优化。

Method: 提出SeMoBridge方法，通过语义模态桥将图像映射到文本模态，保持语义内容不变。该方法为闭式解，可选择通过多模态监督训练，结合图像和文本对齐损失优化投影。

Result: 实验表明，训练版本SeMoBridge-T仅需少量训练时间，总体优于其他方法，尤其在低数据场景（1、2和4样本）表现突出。

Conclusion: SeMoBridge是解决CLIP模态内不对齐问题的轻量级有效方法，在少样本分类中显著提升性能。

Abstract: While Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) excels at zero-shot tasks
by aligning image and text embeddings, its performance in few-shot
classification is hindered by a critical limitation: intra-modal misalignment.
This issue, caused by a persistent modality gap and CLIP's exclusively
inter-modal training objective, leaves the embedding spaces uncalibrated,
making direct image-to-image comparisons unreliable. Existing methods attempt
to address this by refining similarity logits or by computationally expensive
per-sample optimization. To overcome these challenges, we introduce SeMoBridge,
a lightweight yet powerful approach that directly addresses the misalignment.
Our method maps images into the text modality, while keeping their semantic
content intact through what we call a Semantic Modality Bridge. SeMoBridge is
closed-form and can optionally be trained through multi-modal supervision,
combining image and text-alignment losses to optimize the projection.
Experiments show that the trained version, SeMoBridge-T, requires only a
fraction of the training time while overall outperforming other methods,
particularly in low-data scenarios (1, 2, and 4 shots). The code is available

*Gagandeep Singh,Samudi Amarsinghe,Urawee Thani,Ki Fung Wong,Priyanka Singh,Xue Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 扩展HAMMER模型以处理全局场景不一致性，通过轻量级分割引导评分(SGS)管道增强对前景-背景不匹配的检测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HAMMER在多模态操作检测中表现优异，但在处理主要主体被错误放置到不合理背景的全局场景不一致时存在明显局限。

Method: 提出分割引导评分(SGS)管道：使用人物/面部分割掩码分离前景和背景区域，通过联合视觉语言模型提取嵌入，计算区域感知一致性分数，并与HAMMER原始预测融合。

Result: SGS显著提高了对全局操作的鲁棒性，改进了二元检测、定位和token级解释，且仅需推理阶段，计算开销可忽略。

Conclusion: 这项工作证明了区域感知推理在多模态虚假信息检测中的重要性，为处理全局场景不一致提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We extend HAMMER, a state-of-the-art model for multimodal manipulation
detection, to handle global scene inconsistencies such as foreground-background
(FG-BG) mismatch. While HAMMER achieves strong performance on the DGM4 dataset,
it consistently fails when the main subject is contextually misplaced into an
implausible background. We diagnose this limitation as a combination of
label-space bias, local attention focus, and spurious text-foreground
alignment. To remedy this without retraining, we propose a lightweight
segmentation-guided scoring (SGS) pipeline. SGS uses person/face segmentation
masks to separate foreground and background regions, extracts embeddings with a
joint vision-language model, and computes region-aware coherence scores. These
scores are fused with HAMMER's original prediction to improve binary detection,
grounding, and token-level explanations. SGS is inference-only, incurs
negligible computational overhead, and significantly enhances robustness to
global manipulations. This work demonstrates the importance of region-aware
reasoning in multimodal disinformation detection. We release scripts for
segmentation and scoring at https://github.com/Gaganx0/HAMMER-sgs

### [80] [DGM4+: Dataset Extension for Global Scene Inconsistency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26047)
*Gagandeep Singh,Samudi Amarsinghe,Priyanka Singh,Xue Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文扩展了DGM4数据集，新增了5000个包含前景-背景不匹配及其与文本操作混合的高质量样本，创建了DGM4+基准数据集，用于测试检测器在局部和全局推理方面的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DGM4数据集仅限于局部操作（如人脸交换、属性编辑和字幕更改），无法处理现实中普遍存在的前景-背景不匹配等全局不一致问题，这限制了多模态虚假信息检测模型的发展。

Method: 使用OpenAI的gpt-image-1生成以人为中心的新闻风格图像，将真实人物置于荒谬或不可能的背景下，并生成三种类型的字幕：字面描述、文本属性和文本分割，形成FG-BG、FG-BG+TA和FG-BG+TS三种新的操作类别。

Result: 创建了包含5000个高质量样本的DGM4+数据集，通过质量控制管道确保样本质量，包括可见人脸数量控制、感知哈希去重、基于OCR的文本清理和真实标题长度要求。

Conclusion: DGM4+数据集填补了现有数据集在全局操作检测方面的空白，为评估多模态模型（如HAMMER）提供了更全面的基准，有助于提升虚假信息检测能力。

Abstract: The rapid advances in generative models have significantly lowered the
barrier to producing convincing multimodal disinformation. Fabricated images
and manipulated captions increasingly co-occur to create persuasive false
narratives. While the Detecting and Grounding Multi-Modal Media Manipulation
(DGM4) dataset established a foundation for research in this area, it is
restricted to local manipulations such as face swaps, attribute edits, and
caption changes. This leaves a critical gap: global inconsistencies, such as
mismatched foregrounds and backgrounds, which are now prevalent in real-world
forgeries. To address this, we extend DGM4 with 5,000 high-quality samples that
introduce Foreground-Background (FG-BG) mismatches and their hybrids with text
manipulations. Using OpenAI's gpt-image-1 and carefully designed prompts, we
generate human-centric news-style images where authentic figures are placed
into absurd or impossible backdrops (e.g., a teacher calmly addressing students
on the surface of Mars). Captions are produced under three conditions: literal,
text attribute, and text split, yielding three new manipulation categories:
FG-BG, FG-BG+TA, and FG-BG+TS. Quality control pipelines enforce one-to-three
visible faces, perceptual hash deduplication, OCR-based text scrubbing, and
realistic headline length. By introducing global manipulations, our extension
complements existing datasets, creating a benchmark DGM4+ that tests detectors
on both local and global reasoning. This resource is intended to strengthen
evaluation of multimodal models such as HAMMER, which currently struggle with
FG-BG inconsistencies. We release our DGM4+ dataset and generation script at
https://github.com/Gaganx0/DGM4plus

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于主纤维丛截面的几何学习方法，用于在分类任务中消除对称性影响，避免数据增强，构建更可持续的算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算机视觉和医学应用中的数据集通常包含对称性（如旋转、缩放），传统方法使用数据增强来学习这些对称性，但希望找到更可持续的替代方案。

Method: 使用主纤维丛的截面概念来消除对称性，在对称群作用下测量对象轨道之间的差异，并优化截面以最大化类别分离。在对象轮廓数据集上应用了平移、旋转、缩放和重参数化群。

Result: 开发了一个包含恒定速度参数化作为特例的2参数曲线规范参数化族，该方法能够有效处理对称性并提高分类性能。

Conclusion: 该方法基于几何概念，具有广泛的应用潜力，为处理对称性问题提供了数据增强之外的可持续替代方案。

Abstract: Most datasets encountered in computer vision and medical applications present
symmetries that should be taken into account in classification tasks. A typical
example is the symmetry by rotation and/or scaling in object detection. A
common way to build neural networks that learn the symmetries is to use data
augmentation. In order to avoid data augmentation and build more sustainable
algorithms, we present an alternative method to mod out symmetries based on the
notion of section of a principal fiber bundle. This framework allows the use of
simple metrics on the space of objects in order to measure dissimilarities
between orbits of objects under the symmetry group. Moreover, the section used
can be optimized to maximize separation of classes. We illustrate this
methodology on a dataset of contours of objects for the groups of translations,
rotations, scalings and reparameterizations. In particular, we present a
$2$-parameter family of canonical parameterizations of curves, containing the
constant-speed parameterization as a special case, which we believe is
interesting in its own right. We hope that this simple application will serve
to convey the geometric concepts underlying this method, which have a wide
range of possible applications. The code is available at the following link:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出使用基础模型生成3D伪标签的方法，替代传统复杂的渲染策略，显著提升语义占用预测性能，并开发了轻量模型EasyOcc。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自监督方法如新视角合成等计算成本高、内存消耗大，且难以迁移到其他架构。需要一种更高效、可迁移的解决方案。

Method: 使用Grounded-SAM和Metric3Dv2基础模型生成3D伪标签，利用时序信息进行标签稠密化，可轻松集成到现有模型中。

Result: 在OccNeRF模型中mIoU从9.73提升至14.09（+45%），EasyOcc模型达到13.86 mIoU，在完整场景评估中达到7.71 mIoU，超越之前最佳模型31%。

Conclusion: 基础模型、时序上下文和损失计算空间的选择对自监督学习的全面场景理解至关重要。

Abstract: Self-supervised models have recently achieved notable advancements,
particularly in the domain of semantic occupancy prediction. These models
utilize sophisticated loss computation strategies to compensate for the absence
of ground-truth labels. For instance, techniques such as novel view synthesis,
cross-view rendering, and depth estimation have been explored to address the
issue of semantic and depth ambiguity. However, such techniques typically incur
high computational costs and memory usage during the training stage, especially
in the case of novel view synthesis. To mitigate these issues, we propose 3D
pseudo-ground-truth labels generated by the foundation models Grounded-SAM and
Metric3Dv2, and harness temporal information for label densification. Our 3D
pseudo-labels can be easily integrated into existing models, which yields
substantial performance improvements, with mIoU increasing by 45\%, from 9.73
to 14.09, when implemented into the OccNeRF model. This stands in contrast to
earlier advancements in the field, which are often not readily transferable to
other architectures. Additionally, we propose a streamlined model, EasyOcc,
achieving 13.86 mIoU. This model conducts learning solely from our labels,
avoiding complex rendering strategies mentioned previously. Furthermore, our
method enables models to attain state-of-the-art performance when evaluated on
the full scene without applying the camera mask, with EasyOcc achieving 7.71
mIoU, outperforming the previous best model by 31\%. These findings highlight
the critical importance of foundation models, temporal context, and the choice
of loss computation space in self-supervised learning for comprehensive scene
understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 点球经常决定冠军归属，但守门员必须在极短时间内根据细微的生物力学线索预判射门方向

Method: 双分支架构：MobileNetV2 CNN处理RGB帧，LSTM网络处理2D关键点并带有注意力机制；基于距离的阈值方法在球接触前分割输入序列

Result: 在755个点球事件的数据集上，模型在测试集上达到89%准确率，比仅视觉和仅姿态的基线模型提升14-22%

Conclusion: 轻量级且可解释的设计适用于守门员训练、战术分析和实时比赛分析

Abstract: Penalty kicks often decide championships, yet goalkeepers must anticipate the
kicker's intent from subtle biomechanical cues within a very short time window.
This study introduces a real-time, multi-modal deep learning framework to
predict the direction of a penalty kick (left, middle, or right) before ball
contact. The model uses a dual-branch architecture: a MobileNetV2-based CNN
extracts spatial features from RGB frames, while 2D keypoints are processed by
an LSTM network with attention mechanisms. Pose-derived keypoints further guide
visual focus toward task-relevant regions. A distance-based thresholding method
segments input sequences immediately before ball contact, ensuring consistent
input across diverse footage. A custom dataset of 755 penalty kick events was
created from real match videos, with frame-level annotations for object
detection, shooter keypoints, and final ball placement. The model achieved 89%
accuracy on a held-out test set, outperforming visual-only and pose-only
baselines by 14-22%. With an inference time of 22 milliseconds, the lightweight
and interpretable design makes it suitable for goalkeeper training, tactical
analysis, and real-time game analytics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到场景方法在处理复杂几何和对象变换时存在困难，且对复杂指令的遵循能力较弱，需要改进场景合成的准确性和质量。

Method: 使用大型推理模型驱动的物体检索，涵盖物理、功能和上下文属性；基于隐式和显式布局约束放置物体；通过碰撞感知的空间推理优化位置。

Result: 在从简单到复杂的室内配置指令评估中，Reason-3D在人类评分的视觉保真度、约束遵循和资产检索质量方面显著优于先前方法。

Conclusion: 该工作不仅推动了文本到场景生成领域的发展，还展示了现代大型推理模型的高级空间推理能力，并发布了代码库以促进相关研究。

Abstract: Prompt-driven scene synthesis allows users to generate complete 3D
environments from textual descriptions. Current text-to-scene methods often
struggle with complex geometries and object transformations, and tend to show
weak adherence to complex instructions. We address these limitations by
introducing Reason-3D, a text-to-scene model powered by large reasoning models
(LRMs). Reason-3D integrates object retrieval using captions covering physical,
functional, and contextual attributes. Reason-3D then places the selected
objects based on implicit and explicit layout constraints, and refines their
positions with collision-aware spatial reasoning. Evaluated on instructions
ranging from simple to complex indoor configurations, Reason-3D significantly
outperforms previous methods in human-rated visual fidelity, adherence to
constraints, and asset retrieval quality. Beyond its contribution to the field
of text-to-scene generation, our work showcases the advanced spatial reasoning
abilities of modern LRMs. Additionally, we release the codebase to further the
research in object retrieval and placement with LRMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EVODiff是一种基于信息论的扩散模型推理优化方法，通过优化条件熵来系统性地减少去噪过程中的不确定性，显著提升生成质量和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在图像生成方面表现出色，但存在推理速度慢和训练-推理差异的问题。现有梯度求解器缺乏信息传输效率的理论基础。

Method: 从信息论角度分析扩散模型推理过程，提出基于条件熵优化的方法EVODiff，通过优化条件方差来最小化转换和重构误差。

Result: 在CIFAR-10上，EVODiff在10次函数评估时将重构误差降低45.5%（FID从5.10提升到2.78）；在ImageNet-256上，高质量样本的函数评估次数减少25%（从20次降到15次）；同时改善文本到图像生成并减少伪影。

Conclusion: EVODiff通过信息论视角系统优化扩散模型推理过程，在生成质量和效率方面均显著优于现有最先进的梯度求解器。

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) excel in image generation, but suffer from slow
inference and the training-inference discrepancies. Although gradient-based
solvers like DPM-Solver accelerate the denoising inference, they lack
theoretical foundations in information transmission efficiency. In this work,
we introduce an information-theoretic perspective on the inference processes of
DMs, revealing that successful denoising fundamentally reduces conditional
entropy in reverse transitions. This principle leads to our key insights into
the inference processes: (1) data prediction parameterization outperforms its
noise counterpart, and (2) optimizing conditional variance offers a
reference-free way to minimize both transition and reconstruction errors. Based
on these insights, we propose an entropy-aware variance optimized method for
the generative process of DMs, called EVODiff, which systematically reduces
uncertainty by optimizing conditional entropy during denoising. Extensive
experiments on DMs validate our insights and demonstrate that our method
significantly and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA)
gradient-based solvers. For example, compared to the DPM-Solver++, EVODiff
reduces the reconstruction error by up to 45.5\% (FID improves from 5.10 to
2.78) at 10 function evaluations (NFE) on CIFAR-10, cuts the NFE cost by 25\%
(from 20 to 15 NFE) for high-quality samples on ImageNet-256, and improves
text-to-image generation while reducing artifacts. Code is available at

TL;DR: EchoGen是首个基于视觉自回归(VAR)模型的免调优主题驱动生成框架，通过双路径注入策略在保持高质量的同时显著提升推理速度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前主题驱动生成方法在计算效率与零样本能力之间的权衡问题，利用VAR模型的快速采样优势来替代缓慢的扩散模型

Method: 提出双路径注入策略：语义编码器提取主题抽象身份，通过解耦交叉注意力指导整体构图；内容编码器捕捉视觉细节，通过多模态注意力机制保持高保真纹理和结构

Result: EchoGen在主题保真度和图像质量上达到与最先进扩散方法相当的水平，同时采样延迟显著降低

Conclusion: EchoGen成功将VAR模型的快速采样优势与主题驱动生成相结合，为高效高质量的创意AI生成提供了新方向

Abstract: Subject-driven generation is a critical task in creative AI; yet current
state-of-the-art methods present a stark trade-off. They either rely on
computationally expensive, per-subject fine-tuning, sacrificing efficiency and
zero-shot capability, or employ feed-forward architectures built on diffusion
models, which are inherently plagued by slow inference speeds. Visual
Auto-Regressive (VAR) models are renowned for their rapid sampling speeds and
strong generative quality, making them an ideal yet underexplored foundation
for resolving this tension. To bridge this gap, we introduce EchoGen, a
pioneering framework that empowers VAR models with subject-driven generation
capabilities. The core design of EchoGen is an effective dual-path injection
strategy that disentangles a subject's high-level semantic identity from its
low-level fine-grained details, enabling enhanced controllability and fidelity.
We employ a semantic encoder to extract the subject's abstract identity, which
is injected through decoupled cross-attention to guide the overall composition.
Concurrently, a content encoder captures intricate visual details, which are
integrated via a multi-modal attention mechanism to ensure high-fidelity
texture and structural preservation. To the best of our knowledge, EchoGen is
the first feed-forward subject-driven framework built upon VAR models. Both
quantitative and qualitative results substantiate our design, demonstrating
that EchoGen achieves subject fidelity and image quality comparable to
state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods with significantly lower sampling
latency. Code and models will be released soon.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了EntroPE，一种基于熵的动态补丁编码器，通过信息论标准检测时间序列中的自然过渡点来动态确定补丁边界，解决了传统补丁方法破坏时间连贯性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于补丁的时间序列预测方法采用时间无关的补丁构建策略，任意起始位置和固定长度会破坏时间连贯性，分割自然过渡，扰乱短期依赖关系并削弱表示学习。

Method: EntroPE包含两个关键模块：基于熵的动态补丁器(EDP)使用信息论标准定位自然时间变化点并确定补丁边界；自适应补丁编码器(APE)使用池化和交叉注意力捕获补丁内依赖关系并生成固定大小的潜在表示。这些嵌入随后由全局变换器处理以建模补丁间动态。

Result: 在长期预测基准测试中的实验表明，EntroPE在准确性和效率方面都有所提升。

Conclusion: 熵引导的动态补丁方法为时间序列建模建立了一个有前景的新范式。

Abstract: Transformer-based models have significantly advanced time series forecasting,
with patch-based input strategies offering efficiency and improved long-horizon
modeling. Yet, existing approaches rely on temporally-agnostic patch
construction, where arbitrary starting positions and fixed lengths fracture
temporal coherence by splitting natural transitions across boundaries. This
naive segmentation often disrupts short-term dependencies and weakens
representation learning. In response, we propose EntroPE (Entropy-Guided
Dynamic Patch Encoder), a novel, temporally informed framework that dynamically
detects transition points via conditional entropy and dynamically places patch
boundaries. This preserves temporal structure while retaining the computational
benefits of patching. EntroPE consists of two key modules, namely an
Entropy-based Dynamic Patcher (EDP) that applies information-theoretic criteria
to locate natural temporal shifts and determine patch boundaries, and an
Adaptive Patch Encoder (APE) that employs pooling and cross-attention to
capture intra-patch dependencies and produce fixed-size latent representations.
These embeddings are then processed by a global transformer to model
inter-patch dynamics. Experiments across long-term forecasting benchmarks
demonstrate that EntroPE improves both accuracy and efficiency, establishing
entropy-guided dynamic patching as a promising new paradigm for time series
modeling. Code is available at: https://github.com/Sachithx/EntroPE.

Abstract: The performance of deep neural networks is strongly influenced by the quality
of their training data. However, mitigating dataset bias by manually curating
challenging edge cases remains a major bottleneck. To address this, we propose
an automated pipeline for text-guided edge-case synthesis. Our approach employs
a Large Language Model, fine-tuned via preference learning, to rephrase image
captions into diverse textual prompts that steer a Text-to-Image model toward
generating difficult visual scenarios. Evaluated on the FishEye8K object
detection benchmark, our method achieves superior robustness, surpassing both
naive augmentation and manually engineered prompts. This work establishes a

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant
advances in visual understanding tasks. However, their capacity to comprehend
human-centric scenes has rarely been explored, primarily due to the absence of
comprehensive evaluation benchmarks that take into account both the
human-oriented granular level and higher-dimensional causal reasoning ability.
Such high-quality evaluation benchmarks face tough obstacles, given the
physical complexity of the human body and the difficulty of annotating granular
structures. In this paper, we propose Human-MME, a curated benchmark designed
to provide a more holistic evaluation of MLLMs in human-centric scene
understanding. Compared with other existing benchmarks, our work provides three
key features: 1. Diversity in human scene, spanning 4 primary visual domains
with 15 secondary domains and 43 sub-fields to ensure broad scenario coverage.
2. Progressive and diverse evaluation dimensions, evaluating the human-based
activities progressively from the human-oriented granular perception to the
higher-dimensional reasoning, consisting of eight dimensions with 19,945
real-world image question pairs and an evaluation suite. 3. High-quality
annotations with rich data paradigms, constructing the automated annotation
pipeline and human-annotation platform, supporting rigorous manual labeling to
facilitate precise and reliable model assessment. Our benchmark extends the
single-target understanding to the multi-person and multi-image mutual
understanding by constructing the choice, short-answer, grounding, ranking and
judgment question components, and complex questions of their combination. The
extensive experiments on 17 state-of-the-art MLLMs effectively expose the
limitations and guide future MLLMs research toward better human-centric image
understanding. All data and code are available at

Abstract: Pedestrian detection plays a critical role in autonomous driving (AD), where
ensuring safety and reliability is important. While many detection models aim
to reduce miss-rates and handle challenges such as occlusion and long-range
recognition, fairness remains an underexplored yet equally important concern.
In this work, we systematically investigate how variations in the pedestrian
pose -- including leg status, elbow status, and body orientation -- as well as
individual joint occlusions, affect detection performance. We evaluate five
pedestrian-specific detectors (F2DNet, MGAN, ALFNet, CSP, and Cascade R-CNN)
alongside three general-purpose models (YOLOv12 variants) on the EuroCity
Persons Dense Pose (ECP-DP) dataset. Fairness is quantified using the Equal
Opportunity Difference (EOD) metric across various confidence thresholds. To
assess statistical significance and robustness, we apply the Z-test. Our
findings highlight biases against pedestrians with parallel legs, straight
elbows, and lateral views. Occlusion of lower body joints has a more negative
impact on the detection rate compared to the upper body and head. Cascade R-CNN
achieves the lowest overall miss-rate and exhibits the smallest bias across all
attributes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive pose-
and occlusion-aware fairness evaluation in pedestrian detection for AD.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AttriGen是一个用于细胞显微镜图像多属性自动标注的新框架，通过CNN和Vision Transformer双模型架构，在细胞类型分类和多属性分类上达到94.62%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决细胞显微镜图像中多属性分类研究不足的问题，相比传统的细胞类型分类，多属性标注在计算机视觉中代表性不足。

Method: 使用双模型架构：CNN用于细胞类型分类，Vision Transformer用于多属性分类，基于PBC数据集（8种细胞类型）和WBCAtt数据集（11种形态属性）。

Result: 在细胞类型和多属性分类上达到94.62%的准确率，显著提升模型可解释性，相比传统人工标注节省大量时间和成本。

Conclusion: AttriGen建立了一个可扩展到其他计算机视觉分类任务的新范式，有效自动化多属性标签的扩展。

Abstract: We introduce AttriGen, a novel framework for automated, fine-grained
multi-attribute annotation in computer vision, with a particular focus on cell
microscopy where multi-attribute classification remains underrepresented
compared to traditional cell type categorization. Using two complementary
datasets: the Peripheral Blood Cell (PBC) dataset containing eight distinct
cell types and the WBC Attribute Dataset (WBCAtt) that contains their
corresponding 11 morphological attributes, we propose a dual-model architecture
that combines a CNN for cell type classification, as well as a Vision
Transformer (ViT) for multi-attribute classification achieving a new benchmark
of 94.62\% accuracy. Our experiments demonstrate that AttriGen significantly
enhances model interpretability and offers substantial time and cost efficiency
relative to conventional full-scale human annotation. Thus, our framework
establishes a new paradigm that can be extended to other computer vision
classification tasks by effectively automating the expansion of multi-attribute
labels.

Conclusion: TSalV360方法成功实现了360度视频中的文本驱动显著性检测，为个性化视频分析提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we deal with the task of text-driven saliency detection in
360-degrees videos. For this, we introduce the TSV360 dataset which includes
16,000 triplets of ERP frames, textual descriptions of salient objects/events
in these frames, and the associated ground-truth saliency maps. Following, we
extend and adapt a SOTA visual-based approach for 360-degrees video saliency
detection, and develop the TSalV360 method that takes into account a
user-provided text description of the desired objects and/or events. This
method leverages a SOTA vision-language model for data representation and
integrates a similarity estimation module and a viewport spatio-temporal
cross-attention mechanism, to discover dependencies between the different data
modalities. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations using the TSV360 dataset,
showed the competitiveness of TSalV360 compared to a SOTA visual-based approach
and documented its competency to perform customized text-driven saliency
detection in 360-degrees videos.

TL;DR: 提出GSDD方法，使用2D高斯分布的稀疏表示进行数据集蒸馏，相比传统密集像素方法更高效且可扩展


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数据集蒸馏方法依赖密集像素表示，存在冗余且难以扩展，需要更高效的表示方法

Method: 使用少量高斯基元编码关键判别信息，采用CUDA-based splatting算子实现并行推理和训练

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和ImageNet子集上达到SOTA性能，编码解码成本高效

Conclusion: GSDD是一种简单有效、广泛适用且高度可扩展的数据集蒸馏方法

Abstract: Dataset distillation has emerged as a promising paradigm that synthesizes
compact, informative datasets capable of retaining the knowledge of large-scale
counterparts, thereby addressing the substantial computational and storage
burdens of modern model training. Conventional approaches typically rely on
dense pixel-level representations, which introduce redundancy and are difficult
to scale up. In this work, we propose GSDD, a novel and efficient sparse
representation for dataset distillation based on 2D Gaussians. Instead of
representing all pixels equally, GSDD encodes critical discriminative
information in a distilled image using only a small number of Gaussian
primitives. This sparse representation could improve dataset diversity under
the same storage budget, enhancing coverage of difficult samples and boosting
distillation performance. To ensure both efficiency and scalability, we adapt
CUDA-based splatting operators for parallel inference and training, enabling
high-quality rendering with minimal computational and memory overhead. Our
method is simple yet effective, broadly applicable to different distillation
pipelines, and highly scalable. Experiments show that GSDD achieves
state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet subsets,
while remaining highly efficient encoding and decoding cost. Our code is

Method: 扩展了现有的多粒度视频摘要解释框架，集成LLaVA-OneVision模型生成文本描述，使用SBERT和SimCSE两种句子嵌入方法来量化文本描述与视频摘要之间的语义重叠。

Conclusion: 提出了评估视频摘要视觉解释可信度的新方法，通过文本语义分析验证了解释的合理性，为可解释AI在视频理解领域的应用提供了重要参考。

Abstract: In this paper, we present our experimental study on generating plausible
textual explanations for the outcomes of video summarization. For the needs of
this study, we extend an existing framework for multigranular explanation of
video summarization by integrating a SOTA Large Multimodal Model
(LLaVA-OneVision) and prompting it to produce natural language descriptions of
the obtained visual explanations. Following, we focus on one of the most
desired characteristics for explainable AI, the plausibility of the obtained
explanations that relates with their alignment with the humans' reasoning and
expectations. Using the extended framework, we propose an approach for
evaluating the plausibility of visual explanations by quantifying the semantic
overlap between their textual descriptions and the textual descriptions of the
corresponding video summaries, with the help of two methods for creating
sentence embeddings (SBERT, SimCSE). Based on the extended framework and the
proposed plausibility evaluation approach, we conduct an experimental study
using a SOTA method (CA-SUM) and two datasets (SumMe, TVSum) for video
summarization, to examine whether the more faithful explanations are also the
more plausible ones, and identify the most appropriate approach for generating
plausible textual explanations for video summarization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了MGCE框架解决广义类别发现问题，通过多粒度概念专家自适应挖掘视觉概念，无需预先知道未标注数据的类别数量，在九个细粒度视觉识别基准上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在两个主要局限：未能充分利用视觉数据中的多粒度概念信息，以及假设未标注类别数量已知，这在现实场景中不切实际。

Method: MGCE包含两个模块：动态概念对比学习（DCCL）在概念挖掘和双级表示学习之间交替优化；多粒度专家协作学习（MECL）引入不同粒度的专家并使用概念对齐矩阵进行跨专家协作。

Result: 在九个细粒度视觉识别基准上达到最先进结果，特别是在新类准确率方面。即使不知道类别数量，MGCE也优于需要知道确切类别数量的参数化方法，平均提升3.6%。

Conclusion: MGCE能够自动估计未标注数据中的类别数量，适用于实际开放世界设置，为广义类别发现提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) is an open-world problem that clusters
unlabeled data by leveraging knowledge from partially labeled categories. A key
challenge is that unlabeled data may contain both known and novel categories.
Existing approaches suffer from two main limitations. First, they fail to
exploit multi-granularity conceptual information in visual data, which limits
representation quality. Second, most assume that the number of unlabeled
categories is known during training, which is impractical in real-world
scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a Multi-Granularity Conceptual
Experts (MGCE) framework that adaptively mines visual concepts and integrates
multi-granularity knowledge for accurate category discovery. MGCE consists of
two modules: (1) Dynamic Conceptual Contrastive Learning (DCCL), which
alternates between concept mining and dual-level representation learning to
jointly optimize feature learning and category discovery; and (2)
Multi-Granularity Experts Collaborative Learning (MECL), which extends the
single-expert paradigm by introducing additional experts at different
granularities and by employing a concept alignment matrix for effective
cross-expert collaboration. Importantly, MGCE can automatically estimate the
number of categories in unlabeled data, making it suitable for practical
open-world settings. Extensive experiments on nine fine-grained visual
recognition benchmarks demonstrate that MGCE achieves state-of-the-art results,
particularly in novel-class accuracy. Notably, even without prior knowledge of
category numbers, MGCE outperforms parametric approaches that require knowing
the exact number of categories, with an average improvement of 3.6\%. Code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在数据限制、可扩展性差或会损害图像整体质量的问题，需要一种无需额外数据或编辑操作就能实现精确多模态对齐的方法。

Method: 使用多模态大语言模型识别错位，引入隐式对齐器操作扩散条件特征以减少错位并实现重新生成，将重新对齐目标制定为可训练的目标函数。

Result: 在SDXL、SDXL-DPO和FLUX上的广泛定性和定量评估显示，IMG优于现有的对齐方法，并能作为灵活的即插即用适配器增强先前的基于微调的对齐方法。

Conclusion: IMG提供了一种有效且灵活的多模态对齐解决方案，无需额外数据或编辑操作，显著提升了扩散生成图像与输入提示的对齐精度。

Abstract: Ensuring precise multimodal alignment between diffusion-generated images and
input prompts has been a long-standing challenge. Earlier works finetune
diffusion weight using high-quality preference data, which tends to be limited
and difficult to scale up. Recent editing-based methods further refine local
regions of generated images but may compromise overall image quality. In this
work, we propose Implicit Multimodal Guidance (IMG), a novel
re-generation-based multimodal alignment framework that requires no extra data
or editing operations. Specifically, given a generated image and its prompt,
IMG a) utilizes a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to identify
misalignments; b) introduces an Implicit Aligner that manipulates diffusion
conditioning features to reduce misalignments and enable re-generation; and c)
formulates the re-alignment goal into a trainable objective, namely Iteratively
Updated Preference Objective. Extensive qualitative and quantitative
evaluations on SDXL, SDXL-DPO, and FLUX show that IMG outperforms existing
alignment methods. Furthermore, IMG acts as a flexible plug-and-play adapter,
seamlessly enhancing prior finetuning-based alignment methods. Our code will be
available at https://github.com/SHI-Labs/IMG-Multimodal-Diffusion-Alignment.

Method: 利用机制可解释性分析内部计算，识别关键子组件，通过知识蒸馏训练紧凑学生模型，进行网络剪枝。

Result: 开发的Donut-MINT模型在DocVQA基准测试中保持强劲性能，同时显著降低推理时间和内存使用。

Conclusion: 该方法将压缩重新定义为电路发现，连接了可解释性研究和实用的视觉语言模型部署。

Abstract: Recent advances in Visually-rich Document Understanding rely on large
Vision-Language Models like Donut, which perform document-level Visual Question
Answering without Optical Character Recognition. Despite their effectiveness,
these models are too costly for real-time or resource-constrained applications.
We investigate model compression through knowledge distillation, training
compact student models from a larger teacher. We leverage mechanistic
interpretability to drive student architecture design within this framework. By
analyzing internal computations, we identify essential subcomponents to retain,
while having a clear view of which subcomponents should be approximated,
skipped, or reparametrized based on their function. This approach yields
Donut-MINT (Mechanistic Interpretability-based Network Trimming), a pruned
Donut variant that reduces inference time and memory usage while maintaining
strong performance on DocVQA, a standard benchmark for document Visual Question
Answering. Our method reframes compression as circuit discovery, bridging
interpretability research and practical Vision-Language Model deployment.

Motivation: 现有潜在动作模型存在两个瓶颈：端到端图像编码器空间理解能力差，以及对远距离输入帧的脆弱性，限制了动作建模的稳定性和清晰度。

Method: 提出Farsighted-LAM框架，包含几何感知空间编码和多尺度时间建模；构建SSM-VLA系统，集成结构化感知和视觉思维链模块进行显式推理。

Result: 在仿真和真实世界的多个VLA任务中验证，实现了最先进的性能表现。

Conclusion: 结合几何感知建模、时间一致性和显式推理的策略能有效增强具身智能的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Latent Action Models (LAMs) enable Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems to
learn semantic action representations from large-scale unannotated data. Yet,
we identify two bottlenecks of LAMs: 1) the commonly adopted end-to-end trained
image encoder suffers from poor spatial understanding; 2) LAMs can be fragile
when input frames are distant, leading to limited temporal perception. Such
factors inevitably hinder stable and clear action modeling. To this end, we
propose Farsighted-LAM, a latent action framework with geometry-aware spatial
encoding and multi-scale temporal modeling, capturing structural priors and
dynamic motion patterns from consecutive frames. We further propose SSM-VLA, an
end-to-end VLA framework built upon Farsighted-LAM, which integrates structured
perception with a visual Chain-of-Thought module to explicitly reason about
environmental dynamics, enhancing decision consistency and interpretability. We
validate SSM-VLA on multiple VLA tasks in both simulation and real-world
settings, and achieve state-of-the-art performance. Our results demonstrate
that our strategy of combining geometry-aware modeling, temporal coherence, and
explicit reasoning is effective in enhancing the robustness and
generalizability of embodied intelligence.

Motivation: 合成媒体的快速发展使深度伪造检测成为在线安全和信任的关键挑战，但现有方法受限于高质量数据集稀缺，且多模态大语言模型在深度伪造检测中表现不佳，常产生与视觉证据不符或幻觉的解释。

Method: 引入推理标注的深度伪造检测数据集，并提出段落级相对策略优化（PRPO）强化学习算法，在段落级别对齐LLM推理与图像内容。

Result: PRPO大幅提升了检测准确率，获得了4.55/5.0的最高推理分数，消融研究显示PRPO在测试条件下显著优于GRPO。

Conclusion: 将多模态推理基于视觉证据对于实现更可靠和可解释的深度伪造检测至关重要。

Abstract: The rapid rise of synthetic media has made deepfake detection a critical
challenge for online safety and trust. Progress remains constrained by the
scarcity of large, high-quality datasets. Although multimodal large language
models (LLMs) exhibit strong reasoning capabilities, their performance on
deepfake detection is poor, often producing explanations that are misaligned
with visual evidence or hallucinatory. To address this limitation, we introduce
a reasoning-annotated dataset for deepfake detection and propose
Paragraph-level Relative Policy Optimization (PRPO), a reinforcement learning
algorithm that aligns LLM reasoning with image content at the paragraph level.
Experiments show that PRPO improves detection accuracy by a wide margin and
achieves the highest reasoning score of 4.55/5.0. Ablation studies further
demonstrate that PRPO significantly outperforms GRPO under test-time
conditions. These results underscore the importance of grounding multimodal
reasoning in visual evidence to enable more reliable and interpretable deepfake
detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统后训练量化在低比特设置下容易导致精度显著下降，而普通的仿射变换使用统一的参数集反而会恶化结果。

Method: 提出Cluster-based Affine Transformation (CAT)框架，使用聚类特定的参数来对齐低比特量化输出与全精度输出，仅需少量额外参数且无需微调。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K上的实验表明，该方法在多种架构和低比特设置下均优于现有PTQ方法，W2A2 ResNet-18上达到53.18% Top-1准确率，作为插件可提升现有基线3%以上。

Conclusion: CAT是一种有效的低比特后训练量化误差减少框架，能够显著提升量化模型精度，且具有通用性和易用性。

Abstract: Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) reduces the memory footprint and
computational overhead of deep neural networks by converting full-precision
(FP) values into quantized and compressed data types. While PTQ is more
cost-efficient than Quantization-Aware Training (QAT), it is highly susceptible
to accuracy degradation under a low-bit quantization (LQ) regime (e.g., 2-bit).
Affine transformation is a classical technique used to reduce the discrepancy
between the information processed by a quantized model and that processed by
its full-precision counterpart; however, we find that using plain affine
transformation, which applies a uniform affine parameter set for all outputs,
worsens the results in low-bit PTQ. To address this, we propose Cluster-based
Affine Transformation (CAT), an error-reduction framework that employs
cluster-specific parameters to align LQ outputs with FP counterparts. CAT
refines LQ outputs with only a negligible number of additional parameters,
without requiring fine-tuning of the model or quantization parameters. We
further introduce a novel PTQ framework integrated with CAT. Experiments on
ImageNet-1K show that this framework consistently outperforms prior PTQ methods
across diverse architectures and LQ settings, achieving up to 53.18% Top-1
accuracy on W2A2 ResNet-18. Moreover, CAT enhances existing PTQ baselines by
more than 3% when used as a plug-in. We plan to release our implementation
alongside the publication of this paper.

Abstract: Existing approaches to skill proficiency estimation often rely on black-box
video classifiers, ignoring multi-view context and lacking explainability. We
present ProfVLM, a compact vision-language model that reformulates this task as
generative reasoning: it jointly predicts skill level and generates expert-like

AttentiveGatedProjector that dynamically fuses multi-view features, projected
from a frozen TimeSformer backbone into a language model tuned for feedback
generation. Trained on EgoExo4D with expert commentaries, ProfVLM surpasses
state-of-the-art methods while using up to 20x fewer parameters and reducing

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于点标注的弱监督定向目标检测方法存在两个主要缺陷：伪标签利用率低和伪标签质量差，这限制了检测性能的提升。

Method: 1) 渐进式标签分配(PLA)：在不同训练阶段动态估计实例尺寸，实现标签分配方法的使用；2) 先验引导动态掩码损失(PGDM-Loss)：结合SAM模型和分水岭算法的优势，在稀疏和密集场景中都能取得良好性能。

Result: 在多个数据集上取得竞争性性能：DOTA-v1.0(66.09%)、DOTA-v1.5(56.86%)、DOTA-v2.0(41.28%)、DIOR(46.40%)、STAR(19.60%)、RSAR(45.96%)，特别在目标尺寸变化大或目标稀疏的场景中表现优异。

Conclusion: Point2RBox-v3是首个使用动态伪标签进行标签分配的模型，创新性地结合了SAM模型和分水岭算法的优势，在稀疏和密集场景中都能实现卓越性能。

Abstract: Driven by the growing need for Oriented Object Detection (OOD), learning from
point annotations under a weakly-supervised framework has emerged as a
promising alternative to costly and laborious manual labeling. In this paper,
we discuss two deficiencies in existing point-supervised methods: inefficient
utilization and poor quality of pseudo labels. Therefore, we present
Point2RBox-v3. At the core are two principles: 1) Progressive Label Assignment
(PLA). It dynamically estimates instance sizes in a coarse yet intelligent
manner at different stages of the training process, enabling the use of label
assignment methods. 2) Prior-Guided Dynamic Mask Loss (PGDM-Loss). It is an
enhancement of the Voronoi Watershed Loss from Point2RBox-v2, which overcomes
the shortcomings of Watershed in its poor performance in sparse scenes and
SAM's poor performance in dense scenes. To our knowledge, Point2RBox-v3 is the
first model to employ dynamic pseudo labels for label assignment, and it
creatively complements the advantages of SAM model with the watershed
algorithm, which achieves excellent performance in both sparse and dense
scenes. Our solution gives competitive performance, especially in scenarios
with large variations in object size or sparse object occurrences:
66.09%/56.86%/41.28%/46.40%/19.60%/45.96% on
DOTA-v1.0/DOTA-v1.5/DOTA-v2.0/DIOR/STAR/RSAR.

Conclusion: Flower通过流模型统一了插拔式方法和生成式逆求解器的视角，提供了理论保证的近似贝叶斯后验采样，并在实践中展现出优异的性能和通用性。

Abstract: We introduce Flower, a solver for inverse problems. It leverages a
pre-trained flow model to produce reconstructions that are consistent with the
observed measurements. Flower operates through an iterative procedure over
three steps: (i) a flow-consistent destination estimation, where the velocity
network predicts a denoised target; (ii) a refinement step that projects the
estimated destination onto a feasible set defined by the forward operator; and
(iii) a time-progression step that re-projects the refined destination along
the flow trajectory. We provide a theoretical analysis that demonstrates how
Flower approximates Bayesian posterior sampling, thereby unifying perspectives
from plug-and-play methods and generative inverse solvers. On the practical
side, Flower achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality while using
nearly identical hyperparameters across various inverse problems.

Conclusion: 联合建模方法显著改善了空间和时间超分辨率性能，证明了连续傅里叶场表示在视频超分辨率任务中的有效性。

Abstract: We introduce a novel formulation for continuous space-time video
super-resolution. Instead of decoupling the representation of a video sequence
into separate spatial and temporal components and relying on brittle, explicit
frame warping for motion compensation, we encode video as a continuous,
spatio-temporally coherent 3D Video Fourier Field (VFF). That representation
offers three key advantages: (1) it enables cheap, flexible sampling at
arbitrary locations in space and time; (2) it is able to simultaneously capture
fine spatial detail and smooth temporal dynamics; and (3) it offers the
possibility to include an analytical, Gaussian point spread function in the
sampling to ensure aliasing-free reconstruction at arbitrary scale. The
coefficients of the proposed, Fourier-like sinusoidal basis are predicted with
a neural encoder with a large spatio-temporal receptive field, conditioned on
the low-resolution input video. Through extensive experiments, we show that our
joint modeling substantially improves both spatial and temporal
super-resolution and sets a new state of the art for multiple benchmarks:
across a wide range of upscaling factors, it delivers sharper and temporally
more consistent reconstructions than existing baselines, while being
computationally more efficient. Project page: https://v3vsr.github.io.

*Ren-Di Wu,Yu-Yen Lin,Huei-Fang Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SQUARE是一个无需训练的两阶段零样本组合图像检索框架，利用多模态大语言模型增强检索性能，通过语义查询增强融合和高效批量重排来更好地捕捉用户意图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 零样本组合图像检索方法虽然无需特定任务训练或标注数据，但准确捕捉用户意图仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 提出两阶段框架：1) 语义查询增强融合阶段，用MLLM生成目标图像描述来丰富查询嵌入；2) 高效批量重排阶段，将候选图像以网格形式呈现给MLLM进行联合视觉语义推理。

Result: 在四个标准CIR基准测试中表现出色，即使使用轻量级预训练模型也能保持高性能。

Conclusion: SQUARE框架简单有效，在零样本组合图像检索任务中展现了强大的性能和应用潜力。

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) aims to retrieve target images that preserve
the visual content of a reference image while incorporating user-specified
textual modifications. Training-free zero-shot CIR (ZS-CIR) approaches, which
require no task-specific training or labeled data, are highly desirable, yet
accurately capturing user intent remains challenging. In this paper, we present
SQUARE, a novel two-stage training-free framework that leverages Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs) to enhance ZS-CIR. In the Semantic
Query-Augmented Fusion (SQAF) stage, we enrich the query embedding derived from
a vision-language model (VLM) such as CLIP with MLLM-generated captions of the
target image. These captions provide high-level semantic guidance, enabling the
query to better capture the user's intent and improve global retrieval quality.
In the Efficient Batch Reranking (EBR) stage, top-ranked candidates are
presented as an image grid with visual marks to the MLLM, which performs joint
visual-semantic reasoning across all candidates. Our reranking strategy
operates in a single pass and yields more accurate rankings. Experiments show
that SQUARE, with its simplicity and effectiveness, delivers strong performance
on four standard CIR benchmarks. Notably, it maintains high performance even
with lightweight pre-trained, demonstrating its potential applicability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个名为\mname的奖励模型，通过大规模人工偏好数据集训练，解决了开源图像编辑模型缺乏可靠奖励模型的问题，显著提升了指令引导图像编辑任务中的人类偏好对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前开源图像编辑模型落后于闭源模型，主要瓶颈是缺乏可靠的奖励模型来扩展高质量合成训练数据。

Method: 构建了包含20万对偏好数据的大规模人工标注数据集，训练\mname奖励模型，并使用该模型从现有噪声数据集中筛选高质量子集。

Result: \mname在多个基准测试中达到最先进的人类相关性，显著优于各种VLM-as-judge模型，使用其筛选的数据训练Step1X-Edit模型相比完整数据集训练有显著提升。

Conclusion: \mname能够作为奖励模型扩展高质量图像编辑训练数据，其强对齐性表明在强化学习后训练和测试时扩展等高级应用中具有潜力，模型和数据集将开源以帮助社区构建更多高质量图像编辑数据集。

Abstract: Recently, we have witnessed great progress in image editing with natural
language instructions. Several closed-source models like GPT-Image-1, Seedream,
and Google-Nano-Banana have shown highly promising progress. However, the
open-source models are still lagging. The main bottleneck is the lack of a
reliable reward model to scale up high-quality synthetic training data. To
address this critical bottleneck, we built \mname, trained with our new
large-scale human preference dataset, meticulously annotated by trained experts
following a rigorous protocol containing over 200K preference pairs. \mname
demonstrates superior alignment with human preferences in instruction-guided
image editing tasks. Experiments show that \mname achieves state-of-the-art
human correlation on established benchmarks such as GenAI-Bench, AURORA-Bench,
ImagenHub, and our new \benchname, outperforming a wide range of VLM-as-judge
models. Furthermore, we use \mname to select a high-quality subset from the
existing noisy ShareGPT-4o-Image dataset. We train Step1X-Edit on the selected
subset, which shows significant improvement over training on the full set. This
demonstrates \mname's ability to serve as a reward model to scale up
high-quality training data for image editing. Furthermore, its strong alignment
suggests potential for advanced applications like reinforcement learning-based
post-training and test-time scaling of image editing models. \mname with its
training dataset will be released to help the community build more high-quality
image editing training datasets.

*Xiangrui Liu,Minghao Qin,Yan Shu,Zhengyang Liang,Yang Tian,Chen Jason Zhang,Bo Zhao,Zheng Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Task-oriented Temporal Grounding (ToTG)新问题，旨在基于任务描述定位长视频中的关键时间区间，并构建了ToTG Bench基准和TimeScope框架，通过渐进推理方法在长视频中有效定位关键时刻。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 识别长视频中的关键时刻对于下游理解和推理任务至关重要，但传统方法在泛化性和处理长视频方面存在局限，需要新的解决方案。

Method: 提出TimeScope框架，采用渐进推理方法：首先在长视频中识别粗粒度的可能包含关键时刻的时间范围，然后通过细粒度时刻划分来精炼这个范围。同时构建了ToTG Pile数据集来增强模型的渐进时间定位能力。

Result: 大量实验表明，TimeScope在各种设置下都优于现有的时间定位方法和流行的多模态大语言模型，证明了其解决这一新挑战性问题的有效性。

Conclusion: TimeScope框架通过渐进推理方法有效解决了任务导向时间定位问题，在长视频关键时刻定位方面表现出色，为视频理解和推理任务提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Identifying key moments in long videos is essential for downstream
understanding and reasoning tasks. In this paper, we introduce a new problem,
Taskoriented Temporal Grounding ToTG, which aims to localize time intervals
containing the necessary information based on a task's natural description.
Along with the definition, we also present ToTG Bench, a comprehensive
benchmark for evaluating the performance on ToTG. ToTG is particularly
challenging for traditional approaches due to their limited generalizability
and difficulty in handling long videos. To address these challenges, we propose
TimeScope, a novel framework built upon progressive reasoning. TimeScope first
identifies a coarse-grained temporal scope in the long video that likely
contains the key moments, and then refines this scope through finegrained
moment partitioning. Additionally, we curate a highquality dataset, namely ToTG
Pile, to enhance TimeScope's ability to perform progressive temporal grounding
effectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TimeScope consistently
outperforms both existing temporalgrounding methods and popular MLLMs across
various settings, highlighting its effectiveness in addressing this new
challenging problem.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ScalingAR是首个专为基于next-token预测的自回归图像生成设计的测试时缩放框架，无需早期解码或辅助奖励，通过token熵和两级缩放机制显著提升生成质量并减少计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时缩放方法依赖频繁部分解码和外部奖励模型，不适合基于next-token预测的自回归图像生成，因为中间解码结果不完整。需要专门解决这一问题的框架。

Method: 提出ScalingAR框架：1）使用token熵作为视觉token生成的新信号；2）在配置文件级别融合内在和条件信号校准置信状态；3）在策略级别自适应终止低置信轨迹并动态调度引导强度。

Result: 在通用和组合基准测试中：1）GenEval提升12.5%，TIIF-Bench提升15.2%；2）减少62.0%视觉token消耗且优于基线；3）在挑战场景中缓解26.0%性能下降。

Conclusion: ScalingAR成功将测试时缩放应用于自回归图像生成，通过创新的熵信号和两级缩放机制，在提升生成质量的同时显著降低计算成本，增强了模型鲁棒性。

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) has demonstrated remarkable success in enhancing
large language models, yet its application to next-token prediction (NTP)
autoregressive (AR) image generation remains largely uncharted. Existing TTS
approaches for visual AR (VAR), which rely on frequent partial decoding and
external reward models, are ill-suited for NTP-based image generation due to
the inherent incompleteness of intermediate decoding results. To bridge this
gap, we introduce ScalingAR, the first TTS framework specifically designed for
NTP-based AR image generation that eliminates the need for early decoding or
auxiliary rewards. ScalingAR leverages token entropy as a novel signal in
visual token generation and operates at two complementary scaling levels: (i)
Profile Level, which streams a calibrated confidence state by fusing intrinsic
and conditional signals; and (ii) Policy Level, which utilizes this state to
adaptively terminate low-confidence trajectories and dynamically schedule
guidance for phase-appropriate conditioning strength. Experiments on both
general and compositional benchmarks show that ScalingAR (1) improves base
models by 12.5% on GenEval and 15.2% on TIIF-Bench, (2) efficiently reduces
visual token consumption by 62.0% while outperforming baselines, and (3)
successfully enhances robustness, mitigating performance drops by 26.0% in
challenging scenarios.

Result: 在多个场景、开放集和复杂场景设置中实现了最先进的性能，无需训练和人工参与，验证了其可泛化和鲁棒的异常检测能力。

Conclusion: PANDA证明了基于MLLM的智能AI工程师在视频异常检测任务中的有效性，为通用异常检测提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) is a critical yet challenging task due to the
complex and diverse nature of real-world scenarios. Previous methods typically
rely on domain-specific training data and manual adjustments when applying to
new scenarios and unseen anomaly types, suffering from high labor costs and
limited generalization. Therefore, we aim to achieve generalist VAD, i.e.,
automatically handle any scene and any anomaly types without training data or
human involvement. In this work, we propose PANDA, an agentic AI engineer based
on MLLMs. Specifically, we achieve PANDA by comprehensively devising four key
capabilities: (1) self-adaptive scene-aware strategy planning, (2) goal-driven
heuristic reasoning, (3) tool-augmented self-reflection, and (4) self-improving
chain-of-memory. Concretely, we develop a self-adaptive scene-aware RAG
mechanism, enabling PANDA to retrieve anomaly-specific knowledge for anomaly
detection strategy planning. Next, we introduce a latent anomaly-guided
heuristic prompt strategy to enhance reasoning precision. Furthermore, PANDA
employs a progressive reflection mechanism alongside a suite of context-aware
tools to iteratively refine decision-making in complex scenarios. Finally, a
chain-of-memory mechanism enables PANDA to leverage historical experiences for
continual performance improvement. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PANDA
achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-scenario, open-set, and complex
scenario settings without training and manual involvement, validating its
generalizable and robust anomaly detection capability. Code is released at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于扩散模型的图像到视频生成在运动真实性方面仍面临挑战，难以准确建模复杂的物理约束、物体交互和领域特定动态。

Method: 提出检索增强框架MotionRAG，包含：(i)基于检索的流程提取高级运动特征；(ii)上下文学习运动适应方法；(iii)基于注意力的运动注入适配器。

Result: 实验表明该方法在多个领域和各种基础模型上都取得显著改进，推理时计算开销可忽略，且模块化设计支持零样本泛化。

Conclusion: 该研究通过有效检索和迁移运动先验，增强了视频生成系统的核心能力，促进了真实运动动态的合成。

Abstract: Image-to-video generation has made remarkable progress with the advancements
in diffusion models, yet generating videos with realistic motion remains highly
challenging. This difficulty arises from the complexity of accurately modeling
motion, which involves capturing physical constraints, object interactions, and
domain-specific dynamics that are not easily generalized across diverse
scenarios. To address this, we propose MotionRAG, a retrieval-augmented
framework that enhances motion realism by adapting motion priors from relevant
reference videos through Context-Aware Motion Adaptation (CAMA). The key
technical innovations include: (i) a retrieval-based pipeline extracting
high-level motion features using video encoder and specialized resamplers to
distill semantic motion representations; (ii) an in-context learning approach
for motion adaptation implemented through a causal transformer architecture;
(iii) an attention-based motion injection adapter that seamlessly integrates
transferred motion features into pretrained video diffusion models. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method achieves significant improvements
across multiple domains and various base models, all with negligible
computational overhead during inference. Furthermore, our modular design
enables zero-shot generalization to new domains by simply updating the
retrieval database without retraining any components. This research enhances
the core capability of video generation systems by enabling the effective
retrieval and transfer of motion priors, facilitating the synthesis of
realistic motion dynamics.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于图像难度感知的超分辨率模型评估方法，使用高频指数和旋转不变边缘指数来识别测试图像中模型性能差异，弥补传统平均评分方法的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于平均分数的超分辨率模型评估方法无法反映模型在不同难度图像上的表现差异，也无法捕捉某些模型在困难图像上产生的伪影问题。

Method: 提出了两种图像难度度量指标：高频指数和旋转不变边缘指数，用于预测测试图像中模型视觉效果的显著差异，并设计了相应的评估方法。

Result: 实验结果表明，所提出的图像难度度量和评估方法能够有效区分在平均性能接近但视觉效果不同的超分辨率模型。

Conclusion: 基于图像难度感知的评估方法能够更好地反映超分辨率模型在实际应用中的性能差异，为模型选择和优化提供更准确的指导。

Abstract: Image super-resolution models are commonly evaluated by average scores (over
some benchmark test sets), which fail to reflect the performance of these
models on images of varying difficulty and that some models generate artifacts
on certain difficult images, which is not reflected by the average scores. We
propose difficulty-aware performance evaluation procedures to better
differentiate between SISR models that produce visually different results on
some images but yield close average performance scores over the entire test
set. In particular, we propose two image-difficulty measures, the
high-frequency index and rotation-invariant edge index, to predict those test
images, where a model would yield significantly better visual results over
another model, and an evaluation method where these visual differences are
reflected on objective measures. Experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed image-difficulty measures and evaluation
methodology.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出PRISM框架，通过三阶段渐进式方法解决图像去雨问题：粗提取、频率融合和精细恢复，结合混合注意力UNet和混合域Mamba模型，在多数据集上取得竞争性结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前单尺度去雨模型在细粒度恢复和全局一致性方面存在不足，需要更有效的多尺度特征聚合和细节保持方法。

Method: 三阶段框架：CENet（粗提取网络）和SFNet（频率融合网络）使用混合注意力UNet进行多尺度特征聚合，SFNet引入混合域Mamba联合建模空间语义和小波域特征，RNet通过原始分辨率子网络恢复细粒度结构。

Result: 在多数据集上取得了竞争性的去雨效果，能够有效学习高频雨特征同时保持结构细节和全局上下文。

Conclusion: PRISM框架通过渐进式三阶段设计和混合域建模，在图像去雨任务中实现了更好的细节恢复和全局一致性。

Abstract: Image deraining is an essential vision technique that removes rain streaks
and water droplets, enhancing clarity for critical vision tasks like autonomous
driving. However, current single-scale models struggle with fine-grained
recovery and global consistency. To address this challenge, we propose
Progressive Rain removal with Integrated State-space Modeling (PRISM), a
progressive three-stage framework: Coarse Extraction Network (CENet), Frequency
Fusion Network (SFNet), and Refine Network (RNet). Specifically, CENet and
SFNet utilize a novel Hybrid Attention UNet (HA-UNet) for multi-scale feature
aggregation by combining channel attention with windowed spatial transformers.
Moreover, we propose Hybrid Domain Mamba (HDMamba) for SFNet to jointly model
spatial semantics and wavelet domain characteristics. Finally, RNet recovers
the fine-grained structures via an original-resolution subnetwork. Our model
learns high-frequency rain characteristics while preserving structural details
and maintaining global context, leading to improved image quality. Our method
achieves competitive results on multiple datasets against recent deraining
methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出QuaRTZ方法，通过残差截断和零抑制实现扩散模型的4位后训练量化，在保持纹理细节的同时显著降低计算需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型虽然能生成高质量图像，但计算需求高，部署困难。现有的8位量化方法效果良好，但扩展到4位时，由于步长增大导致舍入误差放大，会损失细粒度纹理细节。

Method: QuaRTZ方法结合8位最小-最大量化处理异常值，并通过前导零抑制压缩到4位以保留最低有效位(LSB)，从而保持纹理细节。该方法平衡了异常值保留和LSB精度。

Result: 在FLUX.1-schnell上，4位QuaRTZ实现了6.98的FID分数，优于需要辅助FP16分支的SVDQuant方法。理论和实证评估都证明了QuaRTZ在不同激活分布上的通用性。

Conclusion: QuaRTZ是一种有效的4位后训练量化方案，能够在保持扩散模型性能的同时显著降低计算需求，特别在纹理保持方面表现优异。

Abstract: Diffusion models achieve high-quality image generation but face deployment
challenges due to their high computational requirements. Although 8-bit
outlier-aware post-training quantization (PTQ) matches full-precision
performance, extending PTQ to 4 bits remains challenging. Larger step sizes in
4-bit quantization amplify rounding errors in dense, low-magnitude activations,
leading to the loss of fine-grained textures. We hypothesize that not only
outliers but also small activations are critical for texture fidelity. To this
end, we propose Quantization via Residual Truncation and Zero Suppression
(QuaRTZ), a 4-bit PTQ scheme for diffusion models. QuaRTZ applies 8-bit min-max
quantization for outlier handling and compresses to 4 bits via leading-zero
suppression to retain LSBs, thereby preserving texture details. Our approach
reduces rounding errors and improves quantization efficiency by balancing
outlier preservation and LSB precision. Both theoretical derivations and
empirical evaluations demonstrate the generalizability of QuaRTZ across diverse
activation distributions. Notably, 4-bit QuaRTZ achieves an FID of 6.98 on
FLUX.1-schnell, outperforming SVDQuant that requires auxiliary FP16 branches.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代生产线需要确保每辆车都符合正确的变体规格且无可见缺陷，这是一个日益复杂的挑战。

Method: 使用11个同步摄像头捕获车辆360度视图，将任务特定视图路由到专门模块：YOLOv8用于零件检测、EfficientNet用于ICE/EV分类、Gemini-1.5 Flash用于徽标OCR、YOLOv8-Seg用于划痕和凹陷分割。通过视图感知融合层标准化证据，VIN条件规则引擎将检测到的特征与预期清单进行比较。

Result: 在包含四种不同车型的OEM车辆数据集和公共划痕/凹陷图像上，AVI实现了93%的验证准确率、86%的缺陷检测召回率，并维持3.3辆/分钟的处理速度，大幅超越单视图或无分割基线方法。

Conclusion: 这是首个在工业可部署汽车环境中统一多摄像头特征验证与缺陷检测的公开报告系统。

Abstract: Ensuring that every vehicle leaving a modern production line is built to the
correct \emph{variant} specification and is free from visible defects is an
increasingly complex challenge. We present the \textbf{Automated Vehicle
Inspection (AVI)} platform, an end-to-end, \emph{multi-view} perception system
that couples deep-learning detectors with a semantic rule engine to deliver
\emph{variant-aware} quality control in real time. Eleven synchronized cameras
capture a full 360{\deg} sweep of each vehicle; task-specific views are then
routed to specialised modules: YOLOv8 for part detection, EfficientNet for
ICE/EV classification, Gemini-1.5 Flash for mascot OCR, and YOLOv8-Seg for
scratch-and-dent segmentation. A view-aware fusion layer standardises evidence,
while a VIN-conditioned rule engine compares detected features against the
expected manifest, producing an interpretable pass/fail report in \(\approx\!
300\,\text{ms}\). On a mixed data set of Original Equipment Manufacturer(OEM)
vehicle data sets of four distinct models plus public scratch/dent images, AVI
achieves \textbf{ 93 \%} verification accuracy, \textbf{86 \%} defect-detection
recall, and sustains \(\mathbf{3.3}\) vehicles/min, surpassing single-view or
no segmentation baselines by large margins. To our knowledge, this is the first
publicly reported system that unifies multi-camera feature validation with
defect detection in a deployable automotive setting in industry.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Stylos是一个单次前向传播的3D高斯框架，用于3D风格迁移，无需姿态估计或逐场景优化，能够从单张图像或多视角集合生成风格化的3D高斯场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3D风格迁移方法通常需要预计算姿态或进行逐场景优化，限制了其应用范围。Stylos旨在实现无需姿态估计、无需逐场景优化的3D风格迁移，能够处理从单张图像到多视角集合的各种输入。

Method: 采用Transformer架构，包含两个路径：几何预测路径使用自注意力保持几何保真度，风格注入路径通过全局交叉注意力确保视角间视觉一致性。额外引入基于体素的3D风格损失，将聚合的场景特征与风格统计量对齐。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，Stylos能够实现高质量的零样本风格化，支持未见过的类别、场景和风格，并具有良好的可扩展性，从单视角到大规模多视角设置都能有效工作。

Conclusion: Stylos证明了全局风格-内容耦合、提出的3D风格损失以及框架可扩展性的有效性，为3D风格迁移提供了一种高效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: We present Stylos, a single-forward 3D Gaussian framework for 3D style
transfer that operates on unposed content, from a single image to a multi-view
collection, conditioned on a separate reference style image. Stylos synthesizes
a stylized 3D Gaussian scene without per-scene optimization or precomputed
poses, achieving geometry-aware, view-consistent stylization that generalizes
to unseen categories, scenes, and styles. At its core, Stylos adopts a
Transformer backbone with two pathways: geometry predictions retain
self-attention to preserve geometric fidelity, while style is injected via
global cross-attention to enforce visual consistency across views. With the
addition of a voxel-based 3D style loss that aligns aggregated scene features
to style statistics, Stylos enforces view-consistent stylization while
preserving geometry. Experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that
Stylos delivers high-quality zero-shot stylization, highlighting the
effectiveness of global style-content coupling, the proposed 3D style loss, and
the scalability of our framework from single view to large-scale multi-view
settings.

TL;DR: 提出ASGRA框架，通过场景图和图注意力网络进行室内场景分类和敏感内容分析，无需直接访问敏感图像，具有可解释性和隐私保护优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 室内场景分类在计算机视觉中至关重要，特别是在敏感内容分析（如儿童性虐待图像分类）中面临挑战，需要处理复杂对象关系和空间布局。

Method: 将图像转换为场景图，然后使用图注意力网络进行推理，直接建模场景组件之间的交互关系。

Result: 在Places8数据集上达到81.27%的平衡准确率，超越基于图像的方法；在真实世界CSAI评估中获得74.27%的平衡准确率。

Conclusion: 结构化场景表示是室内场景分类和CSAI分类的稳健范式，具有可解释性和隐私保护优势。

Abstract: Indoor scene classification is a critical task in computer vision, with
wide-ranging applications that go from robotics to sensitive content analysis,
such as child sexual abuse imagery (CSAI) classification. The problem is
particularly challenging due to the intricate relationships between objects and
complex spatial layouts. In this work, we propose the Attention over Scene
Graphs for Sensitive Content Analysis (ASGRA), a novel framework that operates
on structured graph representations instead of raw pixels. By first converting
images into Scene Graphs and then employing a Graph Attention Network for
inference, ASGRA directly models the interactions between a scene's components.
This approach offers two key benefits: (i) inherent explainability via object
and relationship identification, and (ii) privacy preservation, enabling model
training without direct access to sensitive images. On Places8, we achieve
81.27% balanced accuracy, surpassing image-based methods. Real-world CSAI
evaluation with law enforcement yields 74.27% balanced accuracy. Our results
establish structured scene representations as a robust paradigm for indoor
scene classification and CSAI classification. Code is publicly available at

Abstract: Betel leaf is an important crop because of its economic advantages and
widespread use. Its betel vines are susceptible to a number of illnesses that
are commonly referred to as betel leaf disease. Plant diseases are the largest
threat to the food supply's security, and they are challenging to identify in
time to stop possible financial damage. Interestingly, artificial intelligence
can leave a big mark on the betel leaf industry since it helps with output
growth by forecasting sickness. This paper presents a lightweight CBAM-CNN
model with just 2.13 million parameters (8.13 MB), incorporating CBAM
(Convolutional Block Attention Module) to improve feature emphasis without
depending on heavy pre-trained networks. The model's capacity to discern minute
variations among leaf disease classes is improved by the integrated attention
mechanism, which allows it to adaptively focus on significant spatial and
channel-wise information. In order to ensure class balance and diversity for
efficient model training and validation, this work makes use of an enriched
dataset of 10,185 images divided into three categories: Healthy Leaf, Leaf Rot,
and Leaf Spot. The proposed model achieved a precision of 97%, recall of 94%,
and F1 score of 95%, and 95.58% accuracy on the test set demonstrating strong
and balanced classification performance outperforming traditional pre trained
CNN models. The model's focus regions were visualized and interpreted using
Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping), an explainable AI
technique.

TL;DR: 提出CoGuide方法，通过用户移动轨迹重建空间布局（如家庭平面图），使用扩散模型和对比学习嵌入空间来解决传统方法中路径规划的非可逆、不可微问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从用户移动轨迹直接重建空间布局是病态问题，因为多个平面图可能对应相同的移动轨迹。传统方法中路径规划过程不可逆且不可微，导致优化不稳定。

Method: 采用扩散模型后验采样器，在更平滑的嵌入空间中重新定义似然分数。通过对比损失训练嵌入空间，使兼容的平面图和轨迹靠近，不匹配的远离。

Result: CoGuide模型从轨迹生成更一致的平面图，比可微分规划器基线和引导扩散方法更鲁棒。

Conclusion: 在嵌入空间中构建的似然分数替代形式可以有效近似真实似然分数，能够引导去噪过程朝向后验分布，解决逆问题中的优化稳定性问题。

Abstract: We consider the inverse problem of reconstructing the spatial layout of a
place, a home floorplan for example, from a user`s movements inside that
layout. Direct inversion is ill-posed since many floorplans can explain the
same movement trajectories. We adopt a diffusion-based posterior sampler to
generate layouts consistent with the measurements. While active research is in
progress on generative inverse solvers, we find that the forward operator in
our problem poses new challenges. The path-planning process inside a floorplan
is a non-invertible, non-differentiable function, and causes instability while
optimizing using the likelihood score. We break-away from existing approaches
and reformulate the likelihood score in a smoother embedding space. The
embedding space is trained with a contrastive loss which brings compatible
floorplans and trajectories close to each other, while pushing mismatched pairs
far apart. We show that a surrogate form of the likelihood score in this
embedding space is a valid approximation of the true likelihood score, making
it possible to steer the denoising process towards the posterior. Across
extensive experiments, our model CoGuide produces more consistent floorplans
from trajectories, and is more robust than differentiable-planner baselines and
guided-diffusion methods.

Conclusion: 为在Ascend边缘设备上开发高性能语言模型提供了实用高效的解决方案，解决了边缘环境部署小型模型的关键需求。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has significantly
advanced the capabilities of artificial intelligence across various domains.
However, their massive scale and high computational costs render them
unsuitable for direct deployment in resource-constrained edge environments.
This creates a critical need for high-performance small models that can operate
efficiently at the edge. Yet, after pre-training alone, these smaller models
often fail to meet the performance requirements of complex tasks. To bridge
this gap, we introduce a systematic post-training pipeline that efficiently
enhances small model accuracy. Our post training pipeline consists of
curriculum-based supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and offline on-policy knowledge
distillation. The resulting instruction-tuned model achieves state-of-the-art
performance among billion-parameter models, demonstrating strong generalization
under strict hardware constraints while maintaining competitive accuracy across
a variety of tasks. This work provides a practical and efficient solution for
developing high-performance language models on Ascend edge devices.

TL;DR: DEPTHOR++是一个针对嘈杂dToF输入的深度补全框架，通过模拟训练、异常检测和专门网络设计，显著提升了深度感知性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度补全方法假设理想的dToF输入和完美对齐，忽略了实际应用中的校准误差和异常，限制了真实世界的适用性。

Method: 1) 基于合成数据集的模拟方法生成真实训练样本；2) 无学习参数异常检测机制识别错误测量；3) 专门设计的深度补全网络整合RGB图像和单目深度估计先验。

Result: 在多个数据集上取得SOTA性能：ZJU-L5数据集RMSE和Rel分别提升22%和11%；Mirror3D-NYU数据集镜面区域提升37%；Hammer数据集超越L515测量22%。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效处理真实世界dToF传感器的噪声特性，使低成本传感器性能超越高端设备，具有广泛的实际应用价值。

Abstract: Depth enhancement, which converts raw dToF signals into dense depth maps
using RGB guidance, is crucial for improving depth perception in high-precision
tasks such as 3D reconstruction and SLAM. However, existing methods often
assume ideal dToF inputs and perfect dToF-RGB alignment, overlooking
calibration errors and anomalies, thus limiting real-world applicability. This
work systematically analyzes the noise characteristics of real-world
lightweight dToF sensors and proposes a practical and novel depth completion
framework, DEPTHOR++, which enhances robustness to noisy dToF inputs from three
key aspects. First, we introduce a simulation method based on synthetic
datasets to generate realistic training samples for robust model training.
Second, we propose a learnable-parameter-free anomaly detection mechanism to
identify and remove erroneous dToF measurements, preventing misleading
propagation during completion. Third, we design a depth completion network
tailored to noisy dToF inputs, which integrates RGB images and pre-trained
monocular depth estimation priors to improve depth recovery in challenging
regions. On the ZJU-L5 dataset and real-world samples, our training strategy
significantly boosts existing depth completion models, with our model achieving
state-of-the-art performance, improving RMSE and Rel by 22% and 11% on average.
On the Mirror3D-NYU dataset, by incorporating the anomaly detection method, our
model improves upon the previous SOTA by 37% in mirror regions. On the Hammer
dataset, using simulated low-cost dToF data from RealSense L515, our method
surpasses the L515 measurements with an average gain of 22%, demonstrating its
potential to enable low-cost sensors to outperform higher-end devices.
Qualitative results across diverse real-world datasets further validate the
effectiveness and generalizability of our approach.

Motivation: 现有视频生成模型和基准测试未能捕捉专业视频生成的复杂性和需求，需要建立面向专业电影制作的结构化评估框架。

Method: 构建了四个解耦的层次化分类体系，开发自动化提示分类和问题生成流程，进行了包含10+模型、20K视频、80+电影专业人士的大规模人类研究，并训练了与专家标注对齐的自动评估器。

Result: 研究发现即使是当前最强模型在Events和Camera相关控制方面仍存在显著差距，训练的自动评估器在零样本基准测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: SCINE是首个将专业视频生成置于视频生成模型背景下的方法，通过以电影控制为中心的分类体系和结构化评估流程为未来研究提供指导。

Abstract: Recent advances in video generation have enabled high-fidelity video
synthesis from user provided prompts. However, existing models and benchmarks
fail to capture the complexity and requirements of professional video
generation. Towards that goal, we introduce Stable Cinemetrics, a structured
evaluation framework that formalizes filmmaking controls into four
disentangled, hierarchical taxonomies: Setup, Event, Lighting, and Camera.
Together, these taxonomies define 76 fine-grained control nodes grounded in
industry practices. Using these taxonomies, we construct a benchmark of prompts
aligned with professional use cases and develop an automated pipeline for
prompt categorization and question generation, enabling independent evaluation
of each control dimension. We conduct a large-scale human study spanning 10+
models and 20K videos, annotated by a pool of 80+ film professionals. Our
analysis, both coarse and fine-grained reveal that even the strongest current
models exhibit significant gaps, particularly in Events and Camera-related
controls. To enable scalable evaluation, we train an automatic evaluator, a
vision-language model aligned with expert annotations that outperforms existing
zero-shot baselines. SCINE is the first approach to situate professional video
generation within the landscape of video generative models, introducing
taxonomies centered around cinematic controls and supporting them with
structured evaluation pipelines and detailed analyses to guide future research.

Conclusion: 机器学习方法能有效自动化连接组学校对流程，大幅降低人工成本，为大规模连接组重建和比较研究提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Producing connectomes from electron microscopy (EM) images has historically
required a great deal of human proofreading effort. This manual annotation cost
is the current bottleneck in scaling EM connectomics, for example, in making
larger connectome reconstructions feasible, or in enabling comparative
connectomics where multiple related reconstructions are produced. In this work,
we propose using the available ground-truth data generated by this manual
annotation effort to learn a machine learning model to automate or optimize
parts of the required proofreading workflows. We validate our approach on a
recent complete reconstruction of the \emph{Drosophila} male central nervous
system. We first show our method would allow for obtaining 90\% of the value of
a guided proofreading workflow while reducing required cost by 80\%. We then
demonstrate a second application for automatically merging many segmentation
fragments to proofread neurons. Our system is able to automatically attach 200
thousand fragments, equivalent to four proofreader years of manual work, and
increasing the connectivity completion rate of the connectome by 1.3\% points.

TL;DR: DiffCamera是一个基于扩散变换器的模型，能够根据任意新的焦点和模糊级别对已拍摄图像进行灵活的重新对焦。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决图像景深效果固定且难以修改的问题，特别是当拍摄对象失焦时，提供灵活的重新对焦能力。

Method: 设计扩散变换器框架进行重新对焦学习，使用模拟数据生成大规模图像对，并引入堆叠约束来增强训练效果。

Result: 模型能够在各种场景下稳定地进行重新对焦，为摄影和生成AI应用提供前所未有的景深调整控制。

Conclusion: DiffCamera通过物理基础的约束实现了精确的景深操作，支持广泛的场景重新对焦应用。

Abstract: The depth-of-field (DoF) effect, which introduces aesthetically pleasing
blur, enhances photographic quality but is fixed and difficult to modify once
the image has been created. This becomes problematic when the applied blur is
undesirable~(e.g., the subject is out of focus). To address this, we propose
DiffCamera, a model that enables flexible refocusing of a created image
conditioned on an arbitrary new focus point and a blur level. Specifically, we
design a diffusion transformer framework for refocusing learning. However, the
training requires pairs of data with different focus planes and bokeh levels in
the same scene, which are hard to acquire. To overcome this limitation, we
develop a simulation-based pipeline to generate large-scale image pairs with
varying focus planes and bokeh levels. With the simulated data, we find that
training with only a vanilla diffusion objective often leads to incorrect DoF
behaviors due to the complexity of the task. This requires a stronger
constraint during training. Inspired by the photographic principle that photos
of different focus planes can be linearly blended into a multi-focus image, we
propose a stacking constraint during training to enforce precise DoF
manipulation. This constraint enhances model training by imposing physically
grounded refocusing behavior that the focusing results should be faithfully
aligned with the scene structure and the camera conditions so that they can be
combined into the correct multi-focus image. We also construct a benchmark to
evaluate the effectiveness of our refocusing model. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that DiffCamera supports stable refocusing across a wide range of
scenes, providing unprecedented control over DoF adjustments for photography
and generative AI applications.

Motivation: 现有多模态音频生成模型缺乏精确的用户控制，无法优先处理特定对象或避免不必要的背景声音，限制了在专业Foley工作流程中的应用。

Method: 引入视频对象分割感知音频生成任务，提出SAGANet模型，利用视觉分割掩码结合视频和文本线索进行可控音频合成。

Conclusion: SAGANet通过对象级分割实现了细粒度和视觉定位的音频生成控制，推动了分割感知Foley研究的发展。

Abstract: Existing multimodal audio generation models often lack precise user control,
which limits their applicability in professional Foley workflows. In
particular, these models focus on the entire video and do not provide precise
methods for prioritizing a specific object within a scene, generating
unnecessary background sounds, or focusing on the wrong objects. To address
this gap, we introduce the novel task of video object segmentation-aware audio
generation, which explicitly conditions sound synthesis on object-level
segmentation maps. We present SAGANet, a new multimodal generative model that
enables controllable audio generation by leveraging visual segmentation masks
along with video and textual cues. Our model provides users with fine-grained
and visually localized control over audio generation. To support this task and
further research on segmentation-aware Foley, we propose Segmented Music Solos,
a benchmark dataset of musical instrument performance videos with segmentation
information. Our method demonstrates substantial improvements over current
state-of-the-art methods and sets a new standard for controllable,
high-fidelity Foley synthesis. Code, samples, and Segmented Music Solos are

Conclusion: 降维不仅是预处理步骤，更是提升特征质量和分类性能的关键组成部分。

Abstract: Facial expression classification remains a challenging task due to the high
dimensionality and inherent complexity of facial image data. This paper
presents Hy-Facial, a hybrid feature extraction framework that integrates both
deep learning and traditional image processing techniques, complemented by a
systematic investigation of dimensionality reduction strategies. The proposed
method fuses deep features extracted from the Visual Geometry Group 19-layer
network (VGG19) with handcrafted local descriptors and the scale-invariant
feature transform (SIFT) and Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF (ORB) algorithms,
to obtain rich and diverse image representations. To mitigate feature
redundancy and reduce computational complexity, we conduct a comprehensive
evaluation of dimensionality reduction techniques and feature extraction. Among
these, UMAP is identified as the most effective, preserving both local and
global structures of the high-dimensional feature space. The Hy-Facial pipeline
integrated VGG19, SIFT, and ORB for feature extraction, followed by K-means
clustering and UMAP for dimensionality reduction, resulting in a classification
accuracy of 83. 3\% in the facial expression recognition (FER) dataset. These
findings underscore the pivotal role of dimensionality reduction not only as a
pre-processing step but as an essential component in improving feature quality
and overall classification performance.

Method: 1) 开发数据增强引擎从透视图像生成高质量全景深度数据，创建约607K全景RGB-深度对；2) 提出SphereViT，利用球面坐标强制全景图像特征的球面几何一致性。

Conclusion: DA²是一个准确、零样本泛化能力强、完全端到端的全景深度估计器，通过大规模数据增强和球面几何建模实现了优异的性能。

Abstract: Panorama has a full FoV (360$^\circ\times$180$^\circ$), offering a more
complete visual description than perspective images. Thanks to this
characteristic, panoramic depth estimation is gaining increasing traction in 3D
vision. However, due to the scarcity of panoramic data, previous methods are
often restricted to in-domain settings, leading to poor zero-shot
generalization. Furthermore, due to the spherical distortions inherent in
panoramas, many approaches rely on perspective splitting (e.g., cubemaps),
which leads to suboptimal efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose
$\textbf{DA}$$^{\textbf{2}}$: $\textbf{D}$epth $\textbf{A}$nything in
$\textbf{A}$ny $\textbf{D}$irection, an accurate, zero-shot generalizable, and
fully end-to-end panoramic depth estimator. Specifically, for scaling up
panoramic data, we introduce a data curation engine for generating high-quality
panoramic depth data from perspective, and create $\sim$543K panoramic
RGB-depth pairs, bringing the total to $\sim$607K. To further mitigate the
spherical distortions, we present SphereViT, which explicitly leverages
spherical coordinates to enforce the spherical geometric consistency in
panoramic image features, yielding improved performance. A comprehensive
benchmark on multiple datasets clearly demonstrates DA$^{2}$'s SoTA
performance, with an average 38% improvement on AbsRel over the strongest
zero-shot baseline. Surprisingly, DA$^{2}$ even outperforms prior in-domain
methods, highlighting its superior zero-shot generalization. Moreover, as an
end-to-end solution, DA$^{2}$ exhibits much higher efficiency over fusion-based
approaches. Both the code and the curated panoramic data will be released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么优化参数化模板而忽略宽松衣物和人物交互，要么在简化相机假设下训练隐式函数，限制了实际场景的应用。

Method: 预测逐像素3D点图、法线和身体对应关系，采用遮挡感知的泊松重建来恢复完整几何，并与SMPL-X身体模型对齐，然后初始化高斯泼溅进行渲染。

Result: 在多个数据集上取得SOTA结果：衣着网格重建的Chamfer距离提升18-23%，SMPL-X估计的PA-V2V降低6-27%，新视角合成的LPIPS降低15-27%。

Conclusion: 前馈transformer可以作为现实场景中鲁棒人体重建的可扩展模型。

Abstract: We introduce HART, a unified framework for sparse-view human reconstruction.
Given a small set of uncalibrated RGB images of a person as input, it outputs a
watertight clothed mesh, the aligned SMPL-X body mesh, and a Gaussian-splat
representation for photorealistic novel-view rendering. Prior methods for
clothed human reconstruction either optimize parametric templates, which
overlook loose garments and human-object interactions, or train implicit
functions under simplified camera assumptions, limiting applicability in real
scenes. In contrast, HART predicts per-pixel 3D point maps, normals, and body
correspondences, and employs an occlusion-aware Poisson reconstruction to
recover complete geometry, even in self-occluded regions. These predictions
also align with a parametric SMPL-X body model, ensuring that reconstructed
geometry remains consistent with human structure while capturing loose clothing
and interactions. These human-aligned meshes initialize Gaussian splats to
further enable sparse-view rendering. While trained on only 2.3K synthetic
scans, HART achieves state-of-the-art results: Chamfer Distance improves by
18-23 percent for clothed-mesh reconstruction, PA-V2V drops by 6-27 percent for
SMPL-X estimation, LPIPS decreases by 15-27 percent for novel-view synthesis on
a wide range of datasets. These results suggest that feed-forward transformers
can serve as a scalable model for robust human reconstruction in real-world
settings. Code and models will be released.

TL;DR: 提出了第一个SIM(3)-等变形状补全网络，通过架构设计使模型对姿态和尺度保持不变，在去偏评估协议下显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D形状补全方法假设扫描已预对齐到规范坐标系，这泄露了姿态和尺度线索，导致模型记忆绝对位置而非推断内在几何。当真实数据缺乏对齐时性能崩溃，需要SIM(3)等变架构实现鲁棒泛化。

Method: 引入SIM(3)-等变形状补全网络，采用模块化层逐步规范化特征、在相似性不变几何上推理并恢复原始坐标系。

Result: 在去偏评估协议下，在PCN基准上优于等变和增强基线；在KITTI上最小匹配距离降低17%，在OmniObject3D上Chamfer距离降低14%；在更严格协议下仍优于竞争方法在偏置设置下的表现。

Conclusion: 完全SIM(3)等变性是实现真正可泛化形状补全的有效途径。

Abstract: 3D shape completion methods typically assume scans are pre-aligned to a
canonical frame. This leaks pose and scale cues that networks may exploit to
memorize absolute positions rather than inferring intrinsic geometry. When such
alignment is absent in real data, performance collapses. We argue that robust
generalization demands architectural equivariance to the similarity group,
SIM(3), so the model remains agnostic to pose and scale. Following this
principle, we introduce the first SIM(3)-equivariant shape completion network,
whose modular layers successively canonicalize features, reason over
similarity-invariant geometry, and restore the original frame. Under a
de-biased evaluation protocol that removes the hidden cues, our model
outperforms both equivariant and augmentation baselines on the PCN benchmark.
It also sets new cross-domain records on real driving and indoor scans,
lowering minimal matching distance on KITTI by 17% and Chamfer distance $\ell1$
on OmniObject3D by 14%. Perhaps surprisingly, ours under the stricter protocol
still outperforms competitors under their biased settings. These results
establish full SIM(3) equivariance as an effective route to truly generalizable
shape completion. Project page: https://sime-completion.github.io.

Motivation: 现有的SLAM基准测试无法充分反映头戴式设备面临的挑战，如更广泛的运动类型和视角、普遍的动态视觉内容、受时变传感器校准影响的长时间会话等，且缺乏足够精确的地面真实位姿。

Method: 使用眼镜式设备记录城市中心数小时、数公里的轨迹，配备多种传感器。利用测量工具获取控制点作为间接位姿标注，实现厘米级精度和城市规模覆盖。

Result: 研究表明当前最先进的学术系统无法应对这些挑战，并识别了导致此问题的组件。设计了不同难度级别的轨迹，便于对不成熟方法进行深入分析和评估。

Conclusion: 该数据集和基准测试填补了头戴式设备SLAM评估的空白，为开发更鲁棒的SLAM系统提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Precise 6-DoF simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) from onboard
sensors is critical for wearable devices capturing egocentric data, which
exhibits specific challenges, such as a wider diversity of motions and
viewpoints, prevalent dynamic visual content, or long sessions affected by
time-varying sensor calibration. While recent progress on SLAM has been swift,
academic research is still driven by benchmarks that do not reflect these
challenges or do not offer sufficiently accurate ground truth poses. In this
paper, we introduce a new dataset and benchmark for visual-inertial SLAM with
egocentric, multi-modal data. We record hours and kilometers of trajectories
through a city center with glasses-like devices equipped with various sensors.
We leverage surveying tools to obtain control points as indirect pose
annotations that are metric, centimeter-accurate, and available at city scale.
This makes it possible to evaluate extreme trajectories that involve walking at
night or traveling in a vehicle. We show that state-of-the-art systems
developed by academia are not robust to these challenges and we identify
components that are responsible for this. In addition, we design tracks with
different levels of difficulty to ease in-depth analysis and evaluation of less
mature approaches. The dataset and benchmark are available at

### [131] [Query-Kontext: An Unified Multimodal Model for Image Generation and Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26641)
*Yuxin Song,Wenkai Dong,Shizun Wang,Qi Zhang,Song Xue,Tao Yuan,Hu Yang,Haocheng Feng,Hang Zhou,Xinyan Xiao,Jingdong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Query-Kontext是一种新型统一多模态模型，通过多模态"kontext"桥接视觉语言模型和扩散模型，将多模态生成推理能力委托给VLM，同时保留扩散模型的高质量视觉合成能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前统一框架中，多模态生成推理能力与高保真合成内在纠缠。作者认为需要分离这两种能力，让VLM专注于生成推理，扩散模型专注于视觉合成。

Method: 提出三阶段渐进训练策略：1) 通过多模态kontext令牌连接VLM和轻量扩散头；2) 扩展到大型预训练扩散模型增强视觉细节；3) 引入低级图像编码器提高保真度并进行指令调优。

Result: 实验表明该方法与强统一基线相当，在某些情况下甚至优于任务特定的最先进方法。

Conclusion: Query-Kontext成功分离了多模态生成推理和视觉合成，实现了更好的性能表现。

Abstract: Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in
text-to-image generation (T2I) and editing (TI2I), whether instantiated as
assembled unified frameworks which couple powerful vision-language model (VLM)
with diffusion-based generator, or as naive Unified Multimodal Models with an
early fusion of understanding and generation modalities. We contend that in
current unified frameworks, the crucial capability of multimodal generative
reasoning which encompasses instruction understanding, grounding, and image
referring for identity preservation and faithful reconstruction, is
intrinsically entangled with high-fidelity synthesis. In this work, we
introduce Query-Kontext, a novel approach that bridges the VLM and diffusion
model via a multimodal ``kontext'' composed of semantic cues and coarse-grained
image conditions encoded from multimodal inputs. This design delegates the
complex ability of multimodal generative reasoning to powerful VLM while
reserving diffusion model's role for high-quality visual synthesis. To achieve
this, we propose a three-stage progressive training strategy. First, we connect
the VLM to a lightweight diffusion head via multimodal kontext tokens to
unleash the VLM's generative reasoning ability. Second, we scale this head to a
large, pre-trained diffusion model to enhance visual detail and realism.
Finally, we introduce a low-level image encoder to improve image fidelity and
perform instruction tuning on downstream tasks. Furthermore, we build a
comprehensive data pipeline integrating real, synthetic, and open-source
datasets, covering diverse multimodal reference-to-image scenarios, including
image generation, instruction-driven editing, customized generation, and
multi-subject composition. Experiments show that our approach matches strong
unified baselines and even outperforms task-specific state-of-the-art methods
in several cases.

*Jessica Bader,Mateusz Pach,Maria A. Bravo,Serge Belongie,Zeynep Akata*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Stitch的训练免费方法，通过自动生成的边界框将外部位置控制集成到多模态扩散变换器中，解决了文本到图像生成中空间关系准确性的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到图像生成模型在空间关系（如"上方"或"右侧"）的准确捕捉方面存在持续挑战，早期方法与现代模型架构不兼容。

Method: Stitch方法通过自动生成的边界框，在指定边界框内生成单个对象，然后将它们无缝拼接在一起，利用特定的注意力头在生成过程中隔离和裁剪单个对象。

Result: 在PosEval基准测试中，Stitch显著提升了基础模型的性能，将FLUX在GenEval位置任务上的表现提高了218%，在PosEval上提高了206%，并在Qwen-Image上实现了最先进的结果，比先前模型提高了54%。

Conclusion: Stitch成功地将位置控制集成到领先模型中，无需训练即可实现空间准确且视觉吸引人的图像生成，在基于位置的文本到图像生成方面取得了最先进的结果。

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) generation models have advanced rapidly in recent years,
but accurately capturing spatial relationships like "above" or "to the right
of" poses a persistent challenge. Earlier methods improved spatial relationship
following with external position control. However, as architectures evolved to
enhance image quality, these techniques became incompatible with modern models.
We propose Stitch, a training-free method for incorporating external position
control into Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformers (MMDiT) via
automatically-generated bounding boxes. Stitch produces images that are both
spatially accurate and visually appealing by generating individual objects
within designated bounding boxes and seamlessly stitching them together. We
find that targeted attention heads capture the information necessary to isolate
and cut out individual objects mid-generation, without needing to fully
complete the image. We evaluate Stitch on PosEval, our benchmark for
position-based T2I generation. Featuring five new tasks that extend the concept
of Position beyond the basic GenEval task, PosEval demonstrates that even top
models still have significant room for improvement in position-based
generation. Tested on Qwen-Image, FLUX, and SD3.5, Stitch consistently enhances
base models, even improving FLUX by 218% on GenEval's Position task and by 206%
on PosEval. Stitch achieves state-of-the-art results with Qwen-Image on
PosEval, improving over previous models by 54%, all accomplished while
integrating position control into leading models training-free. Code is

TL;DR: TTT3R通过测试时训练视角改进3D重建基础模型，利用记忆状态与观测的对齐置信度推导闭式学习率，显著提升长度泛化能力，在全局姿态估计上实现2倍提升，以20FPS和6GB显存处理数千张图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代循环神经网络在3D重建中因线性时间复杂度而具有竞争力，但在超出训练上下文长度时性能显著下降，表现出有限的长度泛化能力。

Method: 从测试时训练视角重新审视3D重建基础模型，将其设计视为在线学习问题。利用记忆状态与观测的对齐置信度推导闭式学习率，平衡历史信息保留与新观测适应。

Result: TTT3R显著改善了长度泛化，在全局姿态估计上实现2倍提升，以20FPS和仅6GB GPU内存处理数千张图像。

Conclusion: 基于测试时训练的视角和闭式学习率设计，TTT3R有效解决了3D重建中循环神经网络的长度泛化问题，实现了高效且高性能的重建。

Abstract: Modern Recurrent Neural Networks have become a competitive architecture for
3D reconstruction due to their linear-time complexity. However, their
performance degrades significantly when applied beyond the training context
length, revealing limited length generalization. In this work, we revisit the
3D reconstruction foundation models from a Test-Time Training perspective,
framing their designs as an online learning problem. Building on this
perspective, we leverage the alignment confidence between the memory state and
incoming observations to derive a closed-form learning rate for memory updates,
to balance between retaining historical information and adapting to new
observations. This training-free intervention, termed TTT3R, substantially
improves length generalization, achieving a $2\times$ improvement in global
pose estimation over baselines, while operating at 20 FPS with just 6 GB of GPU
memory to process thousands of images. Code available in

### [134] [Cyclic Ablation: Testing Concept Localization against Functional Regeneration in AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25220)
*Eduard Kapelko*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过循环消融方法测试模型中的欺骗行为是否可以局部移除，发现欺骗行为具有高度韧性，每次消融后都能通过对抗训练恢复，但会导致语言性能逐渐下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型中的不良行为（如欺骗）是否是可以局部移除的功能，还是与模型核心认知能力深度交织。

Method: 引入"循环消融"方法，结合稀疏自编码器、定向消融和对抗训练，在DistilGPT-2上尝试消除欺骗概念。

Result: 欺骗行为具有高度韧性，模型通过对抗训练持续恢复欺骗行为（功能再生），但每次消融都导致语言性能逐渐衰减（困惑度上升）。

Conclusion: 复杂概念是分布式且相互纠缠的，通过机制可解释性进行直接模型编辑存在局限性。

Abstract: Safety and controllability are critical for large language models. A central
question is whether undesirable behaviors like deception are localized
functions that can be removed, or if they are deeply intertwined with a model's
core cognitive abilities. We introduce "cyclic ablation," an iterative method
to test this. By combining sparse autoencoders, targeted ablation, and
adversarial training on DistilGPT-2, we attempted to eliminate the concept of
deception. We found that, contrary to the localization hypothesis, deception
was highly resilient. The model consistently recovered its deceptive behavior
after each ablation cycle via adversarial training, a process we term
functional regeneration. Crucially, every attempt at this "neurosurgery" caused
a gradual but measurable decay in general linguistic performance, reflected by
a consistent rise in perplexity. These findings are consistent with the view
that complex concepts are distributed and entangled, underscoring the
limitations of direct model editing through mechanistic interpretability.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文通过证明内部模型表示的几何特性可作为评估生成文本质量的可靠代理，连接了大型语言模型的内部分析和外部分析方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 桥接大型语言模型的内部分析和外部分析方法，寻找无需人工标注数据集即可评估文本质量的自动化方法。

Method: 验证了一组度量指标，包括最大可解释方差、有效秩、内在维度、MAUVE分数和Schatten范数，这些指标在不同模型层进行测量。

Result: 发现内在维度和有效秩可作为文本自然度和质量的通用评估指标，不同模型基于这些几何特性对来自各种来源的文本进行一致排序。

Conclusion: 这些几何度量反映了文本的内在特性而非模型特定伪影，实现了无需参考的文本质量评估，为自动化评估流程提供了实际优势。

Abstract: This paper bridges internal and external analysis approaches to large
language models (LLMs) by demonstrating that geometric properties of internal
model representations serve as reliable proxies for evaluating generated text
quality. We validate a set of metrics including Maximum Explainable Variance,
Effective Rank, Intrinsic Dimensionality, MAUVE score, and Schatten Norms
measured across different layers of LLMs, demonstrating that Intrinsic
Dimensionality and Effective Rank can serve as universal assessments of text
naturalness and quality. Our key finding reveals that different models
consistently rank text from various sources in the same order based on these
geometric properties, indicating that these metrics reflect inherent text
characteristics rather than model-specific artifacts. This allows a
reference-free text quality evaluation that does not require human-annotated
datasets, offering practical advantages for automated evaluation pipelines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ConflictScope是一个自动评估LLM在价值冲突中如何优先排序不同价值的管道，通过生成价值冲突场景来测试模型的价值排序能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对齐数据集缺乏价值冲突场景，需要评估LLM在价值冲突时的优先排序能力。

Method: 构建自动管道，从用户定义的价值集中采样冲突价值对，生成冲突场景，使用LLM编写的用户提示测试目标模型，评估其自由文本响应以得出价值排序。

Result: 在开放评估中，模型从保护性价值转向个人价值；系统提示中加入详细价值排序可将对齐度提高14%。

Conclusion: 评估模型价值优先排序很重要，系统提示能在价值冲突中适度改善LLM对齐行为。

Abstract: Past work seeks to align large language model (LLM)-based assistants with a
target set of values, but such assistants are frequently forced to make
tradeoffs between values when deployed. In response to the scarcity of value
conflict in existing alignment datasets, we introduce ConflictScope, an
automatic pipeline to evaluate how LLMs prioritize different values. Given a
user-defined value set, ConflictScope automatically generates scenarios in
which a language model faces a conflict between two values sampled from the
set. It then prompts target models with an LLM-written "user prompt" and
evaluates their free-text responses to elicit a ranking over values in the
value set. Comparing results between multiple-choice and open-ended
evaluations, we find that models shift away from supporting protective values,
such as harmlessness, and toward supporting personal values, such as user
autonomy, in more open-ended value conflict settings. However, including
detailed value orderings in models' system prompts improves alignment with a
target ranking by 14%, showing that system prompting can achieve moderate
success at aligning LLM behavior under value conflict. Our work demonstrates
the importance of evaluating value prioritization in models and provides a
foundation for future work in this area.

*Qiyao Ma,Yunsheng Shi,Hongtao Tian,Chao Wang,Weiming Chang,Ting Yao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Thinking-supervised Reward Model (TRM)，通过句子级思考监督赋予奖励模型批判性思维能力，解决RLVR在复杂任务中难以验证正确性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR在数学和编程等可验证领域取得进展，但在开放域问答等复杂任务中面临验证困难。现有方法过度关注忠实度，导致模型过度依赖外部知识而缺乏批判性评估能力。

Method: TRM通过三个步骤评估奖励：首先评估每个答案句子对支持文档的忠实度，然后进行推理步骤评估句子级正确性，最终结合忠实度、推理和正确性评估构建奖励模型。

Result: 实验表明TRM显著提高了错误句子的识别能力，将TRM融入策略优化后，在答案正确性和实用性方面都取得了显著提升。

Conclusion: TRM通过结构化奖励建模方法，有效提升了模型对外部和内部知识的批判性评估能力，在复杂任务中实现了更好的性能。

Abstract: Through reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), large language
models have achieved substantial progress in domains with easily verifiable
outcomes, such as mathematics and coding. However, when applied to more complex
tasks like open-domain question answering, RLVR faces significant challenges
due to the difficulty of verifying correctness. The nuanced and ambiguous
nature of real-world knowledge makes it difficult to reliably evaluate
correctness in these settings, necessitating further abilities that extend
beyond mere logical consistency to encompass an understanding and assessment of
both external and internal knowledge. Recent work has primarily focused on
improving faithfulness, defined as semantic alignment with supporting
documents, which can cause models to rely excessively on external sources and
diminish their capacity for critical assessment. To address this, we propose
the Thinking-supervised Reward Model (TRM), which incorporates sentence-level
thinking supervision to endow reward models with critical thinking abilities.
Given a query, answer, and supporting documents, TRM first assesses the
faithfulness of each answer sentence to the supporting documents, and then
applies a reasoning step to evaluate sentence-level correctness. By structuring
reward modeling as a sequence of faithfulness, reasoning, and correctness
evaluations, TRM encourages models to critically assess and leverage both
external and internal knowledge. Experiments on reward signals demonstrate that
TRM substantially improves the identification of incorrect sentences, and
incorporating TRM into policy optimization leads to significant gains in both
answer correctness and usefulness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有情感文本转语音方法依赖粗粒度标签或代理分类器，仅获得语句级反馈，无法实现细粒度情感控制。

Method: 引入EASPO框架，使用EASPM模型评分中间去噪步骤的噪声语音状态，自动构建偏好对，通过逐步偏好优化实现可控情感塑造。

Result: 实验表明在表达性和自然度方面均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: EASPO通过中间步骤的细粒度情感偏好对齐，显著提升了情感文本转语音的性能。

Abstract: Emotional text-to-speech seeks to convey affect while preserving
intelligibility and prosody, yet existing methods rely on coarse labels or
proxy classifiers and receive only utterance-level feedback. We introduce
Emotion-Aware Stepwise Preference Optimization (EASPO), a post-training
framework that aligns diffusion TTS with fine-grained emotional preferences at
intermediate denoising steps. Central to our approach is EASPM, a
time-conditioned model that scores noisy intermediate speech states and enables
automatic preference pair construction. EASPO optimizes generation to match
these stepwise preferences, enabling controllable emotional shaping.
Experiments show superior performance over existing methods in both
expressiveness and naturalness.

TL;DR: 提出了SimulRAG框架，通过科学模拟器检索增强LLM的长篇科学问答能力，解决幻觉问题，在信息量和事实性上显著优于传统RAG方法。


<details>

Motivation: LLM在长篇科学问答中容易产生幻觉，而科学模拟器作为验证假设的重要工具，可以增强答案的事实性，但现有RAG方法无法直接应用于科学模拟器检索。

Method: 提出SimulRAG框架，包括通用模拟器检索接口（文本与数值模态转换）和基于不确定性估计与模拟器边界评估的声明级生成方法（UE+SBA）。

Result: 在气候科学和流行病学基准测试中，SimulRAG在信息量上比传统RAG基线提升30.4%，在事实性上提升16.3%。UE+SBA进一步提高了声明级生成的效率和质量。

Conclusion: SimulRAG框架有效解决了科学模拟器检索的挑战，显著提升了LLM在长篇科学问答中的表现，为科学领域的可信AI应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise in solving scientific problems.
They can help generate long-form answers for scientific questions, which are
crucial for comprehensive understanding of complex phenomena that require
detailed explanations spanning multiple interconnected concepts and evidence.
However, LLMs often suffer from hallucination, especially in the challenging
task of long-form scientific question answering. Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) approaches can ground LLMs by incorporating external knowledge sources to
improve trustworthiness. In this context, scientific simulators, which play a
vital role in validating hypotheses, offer a particularly promising retrieval
source to mitigate hallucination and enhance answer factuality. However,
existing RAG approaches cannot be directly applied for scientific
simulation-based retrieval due to two fundamental challenges: how to retrieve
from scientific simulators, and how to efficiently verify and update long-form
answers. To overcome these challenges, we propose the simulator-based RAG
framework (SimulRAG) and provide a long-form scientific QA benchmark covering
climate science and epidemiology with ground truth verified by both simulations
and human annotators. In this framework, we propose a generalized simulator
retrieval interface to transform between textual and numerical modalities. We
further design a claim-level generation method that utilizes uncertainty
estimation scores and simulator boundary assessment (UE+SBA) to efficiently
verify and update claims. Extensive experiments demonstrate SimulRAG
outperforms traditional RAG baselines by 30.4% in informativeness and 16.3% in
factuality. UE+SBA further improves efficiency and quality for claim-level
generation.

TL;DR: 评估ChatGPT、Gemini和NotebookLM在新闻报告任务中的幻觉问题，发现30%输出包含至少一个幻觉，其中Gemini和ChatGPT的幻觉率是NotebookLM的3倍。主要错误类型是解释性过度自信而非虚构实体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在新闻编辑室应用日益增多，但其幻觉倾向对新闻采编的核心实践（来源、归属、准确性）构成风险，需要系统评估。

Method: 使用300个TikTok诉讼和政策相关文档作为语料库，对三种工具进行报告式任务测试，变化提示语特异性和上下文大小，使用分类法在句子级别标注幻觉类型和严重程度。

Result: 30%的模型输出包含至少一个幻觉，Gemini和ChatGPT的幻觉率约40%，NotebookLM为13%。主要错误是解释性过度自信：模型添加无支持的来源描述，将归因观点转化为一般陈述。

Conclusion: LLMs存在根本的认识论不匹配：新闻需要每个主张都有明确来源，而LLMs无论证据支持如何都会生成权威性文本。需要新闻专用的幻觉分类扩展和强制准确归属的架构设计。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in newsroom workflows, but
their tendency to hallucinate poses risks to core journalistic practices of
sourcing, attribution, and accuracy. We evaluate three widely used tools -
ChatGPT, Gemini, and NotebookLM - on a reporting-style task grounded in a
300-document corpus related to TikTok litigation and policy in the U.S. We vary
prompt specificity and context size and annotate sentence-level outputs using a
taxonomy to measure hallucination type and severity. Across our sample, 30% of
model outputs contained at least one hallucination, with rates approximately
three times higher for Gemini and ChatGPT (40%) than for NotebookLM (13%).
Qualitatively, most errors did not involve invented entities or numbers;
instead, we observed interpretive overconfidence - models added unsupported
characterizations of sources and transformed attributed opinions into general
statements. These patterns reveal a fundamental epistemological mismatch: While
journalism requires explicit sourcing for every claim, LLMs generate
authoritative-sounding text regardless of evidentiary support. We propose
journalism-specific extensions to existing hallucination taxonomies and argue
that effective newsroom tools need architectures that enforce accurate
attribution rather than optimize for fluency.

TL;DR: 对Whisper多语言ASR模型的解码器进行细粒度分析，发现高资源语言在正确token排名、置信度、预测熵和候选多样性方面表现更好，而低资源语言在这些指标上表现较差，且在子token使用模式上呈现不同的聚类特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型多语言ASR模型性能显著，但其端到端管道的内部机制，特别是在跨语言公平性和有效性方面仍未被充分探索。

Method: 通过追踪beam搜索路径，捕获子token假设及其相关概率，使用PCA和t-SNE分析子token使用模式。

Result: 高资源语言正确token排名概率更高、置信度更大、预测熵更低、候选更多样；低资源语言在这些指标上表现较差，但子token使用呈现受类型学影响的聚类模式。

Conclusion: 子token探测揭示了被聚合错误率掩盖的系统性解码差异，为改善语音技术不平衡发展提供了针对性干预方向。

Abstract: While large multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) models achieve
remarkable performance, the internal mechanisms of the end-to-end pipeline,
particularly concerning fairness and efficacy across languages, remain
underexplored. This paper introduces a fine-grained analysis of Whisper's
multilingual decoder, examining its sub-token hypotheses during transcription
across languages with various resource levels. Our method traces the beam
search path, capturing sub-token guesses and their associated probabilities.
Results reveal that higher resource languages benefit from higher likelihood of
the correct token being top-ranked, greater confidence, lower predictive
entropy, and more diverse alternative candidates. Lower resource languages fare
worse on these metrics, but also exhibit distinct clustering patterns in
sub-token usage sometimes influenced by typology in our PCA and t-SNE analysis.
This sub-token probing uncovers systematic decoding disparities masked by
aggregate error rates and points towards targeted interventions to ameliorate
the imbalanced development of speech technology.

quality screening, and domain-aware mixing, and we release the dataset and
curation recipes to support reproducible research. In controlled experiments
using the open-sci-ref training protocol (fixed architectures at
130M/400M/1.3B/1.7B parameters; training budgets of 50B and 300B tokens),
models trained on MixtureVitae consistently outperform other permissive
datasets across a suite of standard benchmarks, and at the 1.7B/300B setting
they surpass FineWeb-Edu and approach DCLM in the later stages of training.
Performance is particularly strong on math/code and competitive on QA tasks.
These results demonstrate that permissive-first, risk-mitigated data provides a
practical and legally mitigated foundation for training capable LLMs, reducing
reliance on indiscriminate web scraping without sacrificing competitiveness.

### [144] [Calibrating Verbalized Confidence with Self-Generated Distractors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25532)
*Victor Wang,Elias Stengel-Eskin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了DINCO方法，通过评估LLM的易受暗示性偏差来校准置信度估计，结合生成器-验证器不一致性和跨不兼容声明的连贯性，提供更准确、更不饱和的置信度分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM生成的置信度分数存在错误校准问题，经常在低准确率实例上报告高置信度，损害信任和安全性。研究发现这种过度自信源于LLM对信息量较少的声明具有更高的易受暗示性。

Method: 引入Distractor-Normalized Coherence (DINCO)，通过让模型在多个自生成的干扰项上独立表达置信度，并对总置信度进行归一化来估计和校正易受暗示性偏差。还利用生成器-验证器不一致性，将归一化的验证器置信度与基于一致性的生成器置信度估计相结合。

Result: DINCO提供了更不饱和、更可用的置信度估计。在10次推理调用下，DINCO的表现优于100次调用下的自一致性基线方法。

Conclusion: DINCO通过整合跨采样生成和跨不兼容声明验证的互补连贯性维度，有效改善了LLM置信度校准，采样本身无法弥补DINCO与基线之间的差距。

Abstract: Calibrated confidence estimates are necessary for large language model (LLM)
outputs to be trusted by human users. While LLMs can express their confidence
in human-interpretable ways, verbalized LLM-generated confidence scores have
empirically been found to be miscalibrated, reporting high confidence on
instances with low accuracy and thereby harming trust and safety. We
hypothesize that this overconfidence often stems from a given LLM's heightened
suggestibility when faced with claims that it encodes little information about;
we empirically validate this hypothesis, finding more suggestibility on
lower-accuracy claims. Building on this finding, we introduce
Distractor-Normalized Coherence (DINCO), which estimates and accounts for an
LLM's suggestibility bias by having the model verbalize its confidence
independently across several self-generated distractors (i.e. alternative
claims), and normalizes by the total verbalized confidence. To further improve
calibration, we leverage generator-validator disagreement, augmenting
normalized validator confidence with a consistency-based estimate of generator
confidence. Here, we frame the popular approach of self-consistency as
leveraging coherence across sampled generations, and normalized verbalized
confidence as leveraging coherence across validations on incompatible claims,
allowing us to integrate these complementary dimensions of coherence into
DINCO. Moreover, our analysis shows that DINCO provides less saturated -- and
therefore more usable -- confidence estimates, and that further sampling alone
cannot close the gap between DINCO and baselines, with DINCO at 10 inference
calls outperforming self-consistency at 100.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于自我奖励的评分标准强化学习框架，通过使用模型自身作为评分者并生成基于评分标准的奖励信号，显著提升了开放端推理任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 观察到在HealthBench研究中，使用模型自身作为评分者并生成基于评分标准的奖励信号能显著改善推理性能，且训练后的模型也会成为更强的评分者。

Method: 引入了自我奖励的评分标准强化学习框架，这是一个轻量级框架，支持更快、更资源高效的训练，同时超越基线方法。

Result: 在Qwen3-32B模型上，仅使用4000样本的HealthBench Easy子集进行训练，就获得了在HealthBench Hard上超越GPT-5的模型。加入少量教师评分数据可进一步提升性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为开放端推理任务提供了一种高效且有效的训练框架，能够在资源有限的情况下实现卓越性能。

Abstract: Open-ended evaluation is essential for deploying large language models in
real-world settings. In studying HealthBench, we observe that using the model
itself as a grader and generating rubric-based reward signals substantially
improves reasoning performance. Remarkably, the trained model also becomes a
stronger grader. Motivated by this, we introduce Self-Rewarding Rubric-Based
Reinforcement Learning for Open-Ended Reasoning, a lightweight framework that
enables faster and more resource-efficient training while surpassing baselines.
Remarkably, on Qwen3-32B, training with just the 4000-sample HealthBench Easy
subset is sufficient to obtain a model that exceeds GPT-5 on HealthBench Hard.
Incorporating a small amount of teacher-graded data further enhances
performance for less capable models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PB-RLSVR是一个新颖的多语言推理增强框架，使用高性能英语LLM作为枢轴模型生成参考回答，通过语义等价性奖励将推理能力跨语言转移，无需目标语言的人工标注数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决强化学习在LLMs推理能力提升中主要局限于英语的问题，缩小不同语言间的性能差距。

Method: 采用基于枢轴的强化学习方法，使用英语LLM生成参考回答，通过跨语言语义奖励函数（包括基于嵌入和机器翻译的方法）来奖励多语言模型与英语参考的语义等价性。

Result: 在多语言推理基准测试中显著缩小了英语与其他语言间的性能差距，Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct和Qwen3-32B的平均多语言性能分别提升了16.41%和10.17%。

Conclusion: PB-RLSVR提供了一种强大且数据高效的方法来构建真正的多语言推理智能体。

Abstract: While reinforcement learning has advanced the reasoning abilities of Large
Language Models (LLMs), these gains are largely confined to English, creating a
significant performance disparity across languages. To address this, we
introduce Pivot-Based Reinforcement Learning with Semantically Verifiable
Rewards (PB-RLSVR), a novel framework that enhances multilingual reasoning by
circumventing the need for human-annotated data in target languages. Our
approach employs a high-performing English LLM as a "pivot" model to generate
reference responses for reasoning tasks. A multilingual model is then rewarded
based on the semantic equivalence of its responses to the English reference,
effectively transferring the pivot model's reasoning capabilities across
languages. We investigate several cross-lingual semantic reward functions,
including those based on embeddings and machine translation. Extensive
experiments on a suite of multilingual reasoning benchmarks show that our
method significantly narrows the performance gap between English and other
languages, substantially outperforming traditional PPO baselines. Specifically,
our PB-RLSVR framework improves the average multilingual performance of
Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and Qwen3-32B by 16.41% and 10.17%, respectively,
demonstrating a powerful and data-efficient approach to building truly
multilingual reasoning agents.

TL;DR: 提出了一个新的计算参数来测量儿童对空主语祈使句的误解，并将其纳入强制主语语法学习的模拟模型中，支持了Orfitelli和Hyams关于临时空主语语法的假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究儿童在4岁前经常省略主语的现象（空主语阶段），特别是儿童如何混淆祈使句空主语和陈述句，以及这种混淆如何促进临时空主语语法的形成。

Method: 使用变分学习器的改进版本（适用于超集-子集语言），在强制主语语法学习的模拟模型中引入新的计算参数来测量误解。

Result: 模拟结果支持了Orfitelli和Hyams的假设，即儿童对祈使句空主语的误解促进了临时空主语语法的形成。

Conclusion: 本研究为将计算模型整合到语法习得研究中提供了一个框架，同时考虑了其他关键发展因素。

Abstract: The empirically established null subject (NS) stage, lasting until about 4
years of age, involves frequent omission of subjects by children. Orfitelli and
Hyams (2012) observe that young English speakers often confuse imperative NS
utterances with declarative ones due to performance influences, promoting a
temporary null subject grammar. We propose a new computational parameter to
measure this misinterpretation and incorporate it into a simulated model of
obligatory subject grammar learning. Using a modified version of the
Variational Learner (Yang, 2012) which works for superset-subset languages, our
simulations support Orfitelli and Hyams' hypothesis. More generally, this study
outlines a framework for integrating computational models in the study of
grammatical acquisition alongside other key developmental factors.

TL;DR: 提出了PDP（Pairwise Difference Pearson）这一新的机器翻译元评估指标，通过使用成对差异而非原始分数来解决传统Pearson和Kendall方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统Pearson ρ和Kendall τ元评估方法的局限性，提供更稳健的评估指标。

Method: PDP是一种基于相关性的指标，利用所有段落的成对差异而非原始分数，通过段内成对差异比较来改进全局Pearson方法。

Result: 在WMT'24共享任务中，PDP能够正确排序评估指标，并且比先前工作更好地与人类错误权重对齐。噪声注入分析显示PDP对随机噪声、段落偏差和系统偏差具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: PDP是一个稳健的机器翻译元评估指标，对噪声和偏差具有鲁棒性，但对外部异常值敏感。

Abstract: This paper introduces Pairwise Difference Pearson (PDP), a novel
segment-level meta-evaluation metric for Machine Translation (MT) that address
limitations in previous Pearson's $\rho$-based and and Kendall's $\tau$-based
meta-evaluation approaches. PDP is a correlation-based metric that utilizes
pairwise differences rather than raw scores. It draws on information from all
segments for a more robust understanding of score distributions and uses
segment-wise pairwise differences to refine Global Pearson to intra-segment
score comparisons. Analysis on the WMT'24 shared task shows PDP properly ranks
sentinel evaluation metrics and better aligns with human error weightings than
previous work. Noise injection analysis demonstrates PDP's robustness to random
noise, segment bias, and system bias while highlighting its sensitivity to
extreme outliers.

TL;DR: 研究小规模视觉语言模型在幽默和浪漫风格上的数据效率，探索用最少偏好数据实现风格对齐的性能极限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于Transformer的视觉语言模型在零样本设置下难以生成特定风格（如幽默、浪漫）的图像描述，而获取偏好数据成本高昂，限制了模型能力的充分探索。

Method: 研究小规模视觉语言模型的数据效率，确定实现风格饱和所需的最小偏好数据量。

Result: 定义了这些模型在幽默和浪漫风格上的性能极限，并建立了其能力和限制的基准。

Conclusion: 通过研究数据效率，可以更好地理解小规模视觉语言模型在风格对齐任务中的能力边界和局限性。

Abstract: Vision-language models are increasingly used to generate image captions in
specific styles, such as humor or romantic. However, these transformer-based
models often struggle with this subjective task in a zero-shot setting. While
preference data can be used to align them toward a desired style, such data is
expensive to acquire, limiting the ability to explore the models' full
capabilities. This work addresses this by studying the data efficiency of
aligning small vision-language models to humor and romantic styles. This
approach helps to define the performance limits of these models and determine
how little preference data is needed to achieve stylistic saturation,
benchmarking their capabilities and limitations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需显式过程奖励的奖励自由引导（RFG）方法，用于指导扩散大语言模型的推理轨迹，通过参数化过程奖励为增强模型和参考模型的似然比来实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散大语言模型在解决复杂问题时需要逐步引导推理过程，但传统方法需要为每个中间步骤进行密集标注的过程奖励模型，这在dLLMs中具有挑战性，因为其生成是任意顺序的且中间状态是部分掩码的句子。

Method: RFG通过将过程奖励参数化为增强dLLM和参考dLLM的对数似然比来实现，其中增强模型可以通过任何现成的经过强化学习或监督微调后训练的dLLM轻松获得。

Result: 在四个具有挑战性的数学推理和代码生成基准测试中，RFG在所有任务和模型类型上都取得了显著改进，准确率提升高达9.2%。

Conclusion: RFG作为一种通用的无需训练框架，可以在不依赖外部奖励模型的情况下扩展测试时推理能力。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) have shown great potential in
large-scale language modeling, and there is an increasing interest in further
improving the capacity to solve complex problems by guiding the reasoning
process step by step. Common practice for autoregressive language models
typically learns a process reward model with dense annotation for each
intermediate step. However, this is challenging for dLLMs where the generation
is in an any-order fashion and intermediate states are partially masked
sentences. To this end, in this paper, we propose reward-free guidance (RFG), a
principled method for guiding the reasoning trajectory of dLLMs without
explicit process reward. The key idea of RFG is to parameterize the process
reward by log-likelihood ratios of the enhanced and reference dLLMs, where the
enhanced model can be easily obtained by any off-the-shelf dLLM that has been
post-trained with reinforcement learning (RL) or supervised fine-tuning (SFT).
We provide theoretical justification that RFG induces the reward-guided
sampling distribution with no additional reward. We conduct comprehensive
experiments on four challenging mathematical reasoning and code generation
benchmarks using a diverse suite of dLLMs enhanced with various post-training
methods. RFG consistently yields significant improvements across all tasks and
model types, achieving accuracy gains of up to 9.2%. These findings establish
RFG as a general training-free framework that scales test-time reasoning
without reliance on external reward models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了Transformer架构作为概率测度间映射的性质，完全刻画了能够通过前推映射表示为上下文映射的测度间映射的特征。这些映射保持支撑基数且其Fréchet导数的正则部分一致连续。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了数学上统一分析Transformer的表达能力，研究这些架构处理任意大量上下文标记的能力，将神经网络建模为概率测度上的映射，用于研究Wasserstein正则性、证明泛化边界以及分析相互作用粒子通过网络的动力学平均场极限。

Method: 将Transformer建模为概率测度间的映射，通过前推映射表示上下文映射。研究这类映射的性质特征，包括支撑基数保持和Fréchet导数正则部分的一致连续性。

Result: 完全刻画了能够表示为Transformer上下文映射的测度间映射的特征。证明Vlasov方程的解映射满足这些条件，因此可以被Transformer逼近；同时证明测度理论自注意力具有确保无限深度平均场测度理论Transformer可识别为Vlasov流的性质。

Conclusion: Transformer能够普遍逼近具有任何连续上下文映射的表示，并且与Vlasov方程的解映射在数学上具有深刻的联系，为理解Transformer的表达能力提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Transformers are deep architectures that define ``in-context maps'' which
enable predicting new tokens based on a given set of tokens (such as a prompt
in NLP applications or a set of patches for a vision transformer). In previous
work, we studied the ability of these architectures to handle an arbitrarily
large number of context tokens. To mathematically, uniformly analyze their
expressivity, we considered the case that the mappings are conditioned on a
context represented by a probability distribution which becomes discrete for a
finite number of tokens. Modeling neural networks as maps on probability
measures has multiple applications, such as studying Wasserstein regularity,
proving generalization bounds and doing a mean-field limit analysis of the
dynamics of interacting particles as they go through the network. In this work,
we study the question what kind of maps between measures are transformers. We
fully characterize the properties of maps between measures that enable these to
be represented in terms of in-context maps via a push forward. On the one hand,
these include transformers; on the other hand, transformers universally
approximate representations with any continuous in-context map. These
properties are preserving the cardinality of support and that the regular part
of their Fr\'{e}chet derivative is uniformly continuous. Moreover, we show that
the solution map of the Vlasov equation, which is of nonlocal transport type,
for interacting particle systems in the mean-field regime for the Cauchy
problem satisfies the conditions on the one hand and, hence, can be
approximated by a transformer; on the other hand, we prove that the
measure-theoretic self-attention has the properties that ensure that the
infinite depth, mean-field measure-theoretic transformer can be identified with
a Vlasov flow.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个大规模、实时的数据集和计算框架，用于系统性研究新闻媒体中的选择偏见和框架偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主流新闻机构通过选择报道哪些话题以及如何框架议题来影响公众认知，但目前难以大规模测量这些微妙的媒体偏见形式。

Method: 整合大型语言模型与可扩展的近实时新闻抓取，提取结构化标注（政治倾向、语气、主题、文章类型、重大事件等），每天处理数百篇文章。

Result: 开发了一个包含15万+文章的数据集和交互式网络平台，在句子、文章和发布者三个层面量化报道维度，揭示了新闻覆盖和偏见的模式。

Conclusion: 建立了一个可重复的大规模媒体偏见研究方法，为未来研究和提高媒体问责制提供了实证资源。

Abstract: Mainstream news organizations shape public perception not only directly
through the articles they publish but also through the choices they make about
which topics to cover (or ignore) and how to frame the issues they do decide to
cover. However, measuring these subtle forms of media bias at scale remains a
challenge. Here, we introduce a large, ongoing (from January 1, 2024 to
present), near real-time dataset and computational framework developed to
enable systematic study of selection and framing bias in news coverage. Our
pipeline integrates large language models (LLMs) with scalable, near-real-time
news scraping to extract structured annotations -- including political lean,
tone, topics, article type, and major events -- across hundreds of articles per
day. We quantify these dimensions of coverage at multiple levels -- the
sentence level, the article level, and the publisher level -- expanding the
ways in which researchers can analyze media bias in the modern news landscape.
In addition to a curated dataset, we also release an interactive web platform
for convenient exploration of these data. Together, these contributions
establish a reusable methodology for studying media bias at scale, providing
empirical resources for future research. Leveraging the breadth of the corpus
over time and across publishers, we also present some examples (focused on the
150,000+ articles examined in 2024) that illustrate how this novel data set can
reveal insightful patterns in news coverage and bias, supporting academic
research and real-world efforts to improve media accountability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLMs在魁北克法语主要语法现象上的语言知识能力，并与人类表现进行比较。

Method: 通过手动修改官方资源中的句子创建最小对，由12名魁北克法语母语者标注语法性，比较LLMs与人类在语法判断上的表现。

Result: 语法能力随模型规模增长，但所有模型在需要深度语义理解的现象上持续失败，与人类表现存在显著差距。

Conclusion: LLMs在魁北克法语语法理解上存在关键限制，特别是在需要语义深度的任务中表现不佳。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the Quebec-French Benchmark of Linguistic Minimal
Pairs (QFrBLiMP), a corpus designed to evaluate the linguistic knowledge of
LLMs on prominent grammatical phenomena in Quebec-French. QFrBLiMP consists of
1,761 minimal pairs annotated with 20 linguistic phenomena. Specifically, these
minimal pairs have been created by manually modifying sentences extracted from
an official online resource maintained by a Qu\'ebec government institution.
Each pair is annotated by twelve Quebec-French native speakers, who select the
sentence they feel is grammatical amongst the two. These annotations are used
to compare the competency of LLMs with that of humans. We evaluate different
LLMs on QFrBLiMP and MultiBLiMP-Fr by observing the rate of higher
probabilities assigned to the sentences of each minimal pair for each category.
We find that while grammatical competence scales with model size, a clear
hierarchy of difficulty emerges. All benchmarked models consistently fail on
phenomena requiring deep semantic understanding, revealing a critical
limitation and a significant gap compared to human performance on these
specific tasks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了基准和谐度(benchmark harmony)概念，用于衡量模型在基准测试各子领域表现的均匀性，指出高和谐度是可靠评估的重要属性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基准测试的可靠性对模型评估和科学发展至关重要，当前基准测试可能存在某些子领域过度影响总体结果的问题，需要更可靠的评估方法。

Method: 从分布视角研究基准可靠性，引入基准和谐度指标，在19个多项选择基准和5个模型家族上进行实验，将基准映射到和谐度的均值-方差平面上分析。

Result: 分析显示不和谐的基准会产生误导性结果，如ARC-Easy基准中生物概念问题过度主导了总体准确率，掩盖了地理、物理等其他重要子领域。

Conclusion: 建议在报告准确率的同时报告和谐度，将评估从简单的性能平均转变为更稳健、分布可靠的性能测量。

Abstract: Benchmarks shape scientific conclusions about model capabilities and steer
model development. This creates a feedback loop: stronger benchmarks drive
better models, and better models demand more discriminative benchmarks.
Ensuring benchmark reliability is therefore essential for trustworthy
evaluation and meaningful progress. In this work, we study benchmark
reliability from a distributional perspective and introduce benchmark harmony,
which measures how uniformly a model's performance is distributed across the
subdomains of a benchmark. We posit that high harmony is a desirable benchmark
property, indicating that the aggregate metric reflects uniform competence
across subdomains. Across 19 multiple-choice benchmarks and five model
families, we map each benchmark onto a mean-variance plane of harmony computed
across models, where high mean and low variance signal more reliable
evaluation. Our analysis shows that less harmonious benchmarks can give
misleading results, since overall accuracy may be disproportionately influenced
by specific subdomains. For instance, ARC-Easy is overwhelmed by questions on
Biological Concepts, overshadowing other critical subdomains such as Geography,
Physics, Chemistry, and Environmental Science. By recommending that harmony
should be reported alongside accuracy, we reframe evaluation from simple
performance averages to a more robust, distributionally reliable measurement of
performance.

Motivation: 现有参数修改去偏方法显著降低文本连贯性和任务准确性，基于提示的去偏方法仅对预定义触发词有效，无法解决模型参数中深度嵌入的刻板印象关联。

Method: 采用双路径遗忘机制，协调刻板印象遗忘与反刻板印象保留，通过对抗性遗忘集和动态数据集交换防止偏见极性反转。

Result: 在多个语言模型和各种评估基准上的实验表明，BiasUnlearn在减轻语言模型偏见方面优于现有方法，同时保留语言建模能力。去偏权重可在模型变体间迁移。

Conclusion: 偏见表示在预训练期间固化，并在微调阶段持续存在。BiasUnlearn框架有效解决语言模型偏见问题，同时保持模型核心能力。

Abstract: Many studies have shown various biases targeting different demographic groups
in language models, amplifying discrimination and harming fairness. Recent
parameter modification debiasing approaches significantly degrade core
capabilities such as text coherence and task accuracy. And Prompt-based
debiasing methods, only effective for predefined trigger words, fail to address
deeply embedded stereotypical associations in model parameters. In this paper,
we propose BiasUnlearn, a novel model debiasing framework which achieves
targeted debiasing via dual-pathway unlearning mechanisms coordinating
stereotype forgetting with anti-stereotype retention, while preventing bias
polarity reversal through adversarial forget set and dynamic dataset swapping.
We conducted extensive experiments with multiple language models across various
evaluation benchmarks. The results show that BiasUnlearn outperforms existing
methods in mitigating bias in language models while retaining language modeling
capabilities. Further experiments reveal that debiasing weights are
transferable across model variants, confirming that bias representations become
entrenched during pre-training and persist through fine-tuning phases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖传统TopK路由，需要仔细的超参数调优，并为每个令牌分配固定数量的专家，缺乏灵活性。

Method: 提出可学习动态路由机制，使用可微分路由函数和闭式解替代非可微分的TopK选择，引入分析稀疏性控制目标来正则化激活专家数量。

Result: 在Qwen3-1.7B和Llama-3.2-3B模型上的广泛实验表明，LD-MoLE在多样化基准测试中实现了最高的平均分数，优于现有最优基线。

Conclusion: LD-MoLE不仅实现了优越性能，还展示了学习令牌相关和分层级专家分配的能力。

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that combining parameter-efficient fine-tuning
(PEFT) with mixture-of-experts (MoE) is an effective strategy for adapting
large language models (LLMs) to the downstream tasks. However, most existing
approaches rely on conventional TopK routing, which requires careful
hyperparameter tuning and assigns a fixed number of experts to each token. In
this work, we propose LD-MoLE, a Learnable Dynamic routing mechanism for
Mixture of LoRA Experts that enables adaptive, token-dependent, and layer-wise
expert allocation. Our method replaces the non-differentiable TopK selection
with a differentiable routing function and a closed-form solution. Moreover,
our design allows the model to adaptively determine the number of experts to
activate for each token at different layers. In addition, we introduce an
analytical sparsity control objective to regularize the number of activated
experts. Extensive experiments on the Qwen3-1.7B and Llama-3.2-3B models show
that LD-MoLE achieves the highest average scores compared to state-of-the-art
baselines, across a diverse set of benchmarks. Our method not only achieves
superior performance, but also demonstrates the ability to learn
token-dependent and layer-wise expert allocation.

Motivation: 质疑当前大型推理模型是否真正掌握数学概念和推理原理，还是仅仅记忆训练数据。受人类将复杂问题分解为基本原子能力的启发，提出评估数学原子能力的方法。

Method: 将原子能力分为两个维度：(1) 四个主要数学领域的特定能力：代数、几何、分析和拓扑；(2) 不同层次的逻辑能力：概念理解、使用形式数学语言的前向多步推理、反例驱动的后向推理。为每个原子能力单元构建相应的训练和评估数据集。

Result: 在先进模型上的评估和实验结果显示，不同原子能力表现存在显著差异，原子能力间存在有趣的相互作用。

reasoning models primarily rely on scaling up training datasets with diverse
mathematical problems and long thinking chains, which raises questions about
whether LLMs genuinely acquire mathematical concepts and reasoning principles
or merely remember the training data. In contrast, humans tend to break down
complex problems into multiple fundamental atomic capabilities. Inspired by
this, we propose a new paradigm for evaluating mathematical atomic
capabilities. Our work categorizes atomic abilities into two dimensions: (1)
field-specific abilities across four major mathematical fields, algebra,
geometry, analysis, and topology, and (2) logical abilities at different
levels, including conceptual understanding, forward multi-step reasoning with
formal math language, and counterexample-driven backward reasoning. We propose
corresponding training and evaluation datasets for each atomic capability unit,
and conduct extensive experiments about how different atomic capabilities
influence others, to explore the strategies to elicit the required specific
atomic capability. Evaluation and experimental results on advanced models show
many interesting discoveries and inspirations about the different performances
of models on various atomic capabilities and the interactions between atomic
capabilities. Our findings highlight the importance of decoupling mathematical
intelligence into atomic components, providing new insights into model
cognition and guiding the development of training strategies toward a more
efficient, transferable, and cognitively grounded paradigm of "atomic
thinking".

*Zihao Zhao,Anjalie Field*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于去标识化和HIPS理论的隐私保护合成文本生成方法，通过实体感知控制码实现可控生成，在保持隐私的同时确保文本实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高风险领域（如医疗、社会服务和法律）中负责任地开发和部署AI需要文本匿名化技术，以保护敏感信息。

Method: 使用实体感知控制码引导可控生成，支持上下文学习（ICL）和前缀调优两种变体。ICL确保隐私级别与底层去标识化系统一致，前缀调优变体采用自定义掩码策略和损失函数支持可扩展的高质量生成。

Result: 在法务和临床数据集上的实验表明，该方法在隐私保护和实用性之间取得了良好平衡。

Conclusion: 该方法为敏感领域的合成文本生成提供了一个实用有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Text anonymization is essential for responsibly developing and deploying AI
in high-stakes domains such as healthcare, social services, and law. In this
work, we propose a novel methodology for privacy-preserving synthetic text
generation that leverages the principles of de-identification and the Hiding In
Plain Sight (HIPS) theory. Our approach introduces entity-aware control codes
to guide controllable generation using either in-context learning (ICL) or
prefix tuning. The ICL variant ensures privacy levels consistent with the
underlying de-identification system, while the prefix tuning variant
incorporates a custom masking strategy and loss function to support scalable,
high-quality generation. Experiments on legal and clinical datasets demonstrate
that our method achieves a strong balance between privacy protection and
utility, offering a practical and effective solution for synthetic text
generation in sensitive domains.

Abstract: Recently, advancements in AI counseling based on large language models have
shown significant progress. However, existing studies employ a one-time
generation approach to synthesize multi-turn dialogue samples, resulting in low
therapy fidelity and failing to capture the decision-making rationale behind
each response. In this work, we propose CATCH, a novel data synthesis framework
designed to address these challenges. Specifically, to improve therapy
fidelity, we introduce the Progressive Dialogue Synthesis strategy, which
extracts goals, resources, and solutions from a client's self-report, organizes
them into structured outlines, and then incrementally generates stage-aligned
counseling dialogues. To capture decision-making rationale behind each
response, we propose the Memory-Driven Dynamic Planning thinking pattern that
integrates memory enhancement, global planning, and strategy reasoning; a
collaborative multi-agent optimizer then leverages MDP to attach explicit
chain-of-thought to each dialogue turn. Extensive experiments and human
evaluations demonstrate that CATCH significantly enhances fidelity and logical
coherence in AI counseling.

Abstract: The success of large language models (LLMs) depends heavily on large-scale,
high-quality instruction-following and reinforcement datasets. However,
generating such data through human annotation is prohibitively time-consuming
particularly for domain-specific tasks like telecom network troubleshooting,
where accurate responses require deep technical expertise and contextual
understanding. In this paper, we present a fully automated, retrieval-augmented
pipeline for generating synthetic question-answer (QA) pairs grounded in
structured domain knowledge. Our multi-stage framework integrates a retriever,
base generator, and refinement model to synthesize and enhance QA pairs using
documents retrieved from a domain-specific knowledge graph. To ensure data
quality, we employ customized RAGAS-based scoring to filter low-quality
samples, producing a high-quality dataset suitable for reinforcement
fine-tuning (RFT). We demonstrate our approach in a real-world telecom scenario
focused on radio access network (RAN) troubleshooting. The resulting pipeline
generates complex, context-rich troubleshooting solution plans without human
intervention. This work offers a scalable solution for building instruction and
reinforcement datasets in specialized domains, significantly reducing
dependence on manual labeling while maintaining high technical fidelity.

Abstract: The detection of hopeful speech in social media has emerged as a critical
task for promoting positive discourse and well-being. In this paper, we present
a machine learning approach to multiclass hope speech detection across multiple
languages, including English, Urdu, and Spanish. We leverage transformer-based
models, specifically XLM-RoBERTa, to detect and categorize hope speech into
three distinct classes: Generalized Hope, Realistic Hope, and Unrealistic Hope.
Our proposed methodology is evaluated on the PolyHope dataset for the
PolyHope-M 2025 shared task, achieving competitive performance across all
languages. We compare our results with existing models, demonstrating that our
approach significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art techniques in terms
of macro F1 scores. We also discuss the challenges in detecting hope speech in
low-resource languages and the potential for improving generalization. This
work contributes to the development of multilingual, fine-grained hope speech
detection models, which can be applied to enhance positive content moderation
and foster supportive online communities.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TruthRL是一个基于强化学习的框架，直接优化大语言模型的真实性，通过三元奖励机制区分正确答案、幻觉和弃权，显著减少幻觉并提高真实性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在优化准确性时往往放大幻觉，而鼓励弃权的方法又过于保守，牺牲正确答案，这两种极端都损害了真实性。

Method: 使用GRPO实现TruthRL，采用简单的三元奖励机制，激励模型不仅提供正确答案，还能在不确定时弃权。

Result: 在四个知识密集型基准测试中，TruthRL相比普通RL显著减少幻觉28.9%，提高真实性21.1%，在各种骨干模型下均表现一致。

Conclusion: TruthRL在准确性和真实性方面都实现了强劲性能，强调了学习目标设计对于开发真实LLMs的重要性。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance on
factoid question answering, they are still prone to hallucination and
untruthful responses, particularly when tasks demand information outside their
parametric knowledge. Indeed, truthfulness requires more than accuracy --
models must also recognize uncertainty and abstain when unsure to avoid
hallucinations. This presents a fundamental challenge for existing methods:
approaches that optimize for accuracy often amplify hallucinations, while those
that encourage abstention can become overly conservative, sacrificing correct
answers. Both extremes ultimately compromise truthfulness. In this work, we
present TruthRL, a general reinforcement learning (RL) framework that directly
optimizes the truthfulness of LLMs. Specifically, we implement TruthRL using
GRPO with a simple yet effective ternary reward that distinguishes correct
answers, hallucinations, and abstentions. It incentivizes models to reduce
hallucinations not only by providing correct responses, but also by enabling
abstention when uncertain, thereby improving truthfulness. Extensive
experiments across four knowledge-intensive benchmarks show that, compared to
vanilla RL, TruthRL significantly reduces hallucinations by 28.9% and improves
truthfulness by 21.1%, with consistent gains across various backbone models
(e.g., Qwen, Llama) under both retrieval and non-retrieval setups. In-depth
ablation study demonstrates that vanilla accuracy-driven methods, such as
supervised fine-tuning or RL with a binary reward, struggle to balance factual
correctness and uncertainty. In contrast, our proposed truthfulness-driven
TruthRL achieves strong performance in both accuracy and truthfulness,
underscoring the importance of learning objective design for developing
truthful LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究比较了基于深度神经网络嵌入和少样本学习的大语言模型在抑郁症检测中的算法偏见，发现LLMs在分类性能和减少性别偏见方面优于DNN模型，但种族偏见问题仍然存在。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究语言模型在抑郁症自动检测中的算法偏见问题，特别关注性别和种族/民族方面的社会人口统计学差异，旨在评估和缓解这些偏见。

Method: 使用DAIC-WOZ临床访谈语料库，比较DNN嵌入模型和LLM少样本学习方法。对DNN模型应用公平感知损失函数，对LLM探索不同提示框架和样本数量的上下文学习。

Result: LLMs在抑郁症分类性能上优于DNN模型，特别是在西班牙裔参与者等代表性不足群体中。LLMs的性别偏见较小，但种族差异仍然存在。最差群体损失函数在DNN模型中实现了性能与公平性的更好平衡。

Conclusion: LLMs在抑郁症检测中表现出更好的性能和更少的性别偏见，但种族偏见问题需要进一步解决。公平感知技术对缓解DNN模型偏见有效，而LLM的提示策略对减少种族差异效果有限。

Abstract: This paper investigates algorithmic bias in language-based models for
automated depression detection, focusing on socio-demographic disparities
related to gender and race/ethnicity. Models trained using deep neural networks
(DNN) based embeddings are compared to few-shot learning approaches with large
language models (LLMs), evaluating both performance and fairness on clinical
interview transcripts from the Distress Analysis Interview Corpus/Wizard-of-Oz
(DAIC-WOZ). To mitigate bias, fairness-aware loss functions are applied to
DNN-based models, while in-context learning with varied prompt framing and shot
counts is explored for LLMs. Results indicate that LLMs outperform DNN-based
models in depression classification, particularly for underrepresented groups
such as Hispanic participants. LLMs also exhibit reduced gender bias compared
to DNN-based embeddings, though racial disparities persist. Among
fairness-aware techniques for mitigating bias in DNN-based embeddings, the
worst-group loss, which is designed to minimize loss for the worst-performing
demographic group, achieves a better balance between performance and fairness.
In contrast, the fairness-regularized loss minimizes loss across all groups but
performs less effectively. In LLMs, guided prompting with ethical framing helps
mitigate gender bias in the 1-shot setting. However, increasing the number of
shots does not lead to further reductions in disparities. For race/ethnicity,
neither prompting strategy nor increasing $N$ in $N$-shot learning effectively
reduces disparities.

Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant
potential across various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However,
their performance in domain-specific applications and non-English languages

Conclusion: ReTAG通过检索增强和主题增强的图方法有效解决了全局语义理解中的挑战。

Abstract: Recent advances in question answering have led to substantial progress in
tasks such as multi-hop reasoning. However, global sensemaking-answering
questions by synthesizing information from an entire corpus remains a
significant challenge. A prior graph-based approach to global sensemaking lacks
retrieval mechanisms, topic specificity, and incurs high inference costs. To
address these limitations, we propose ReTAG, a Retrieval-Enhanced,
Topic-Augmented Graph framework that constructs topic-specific subgraphs and
retrieves the relevant summaries for response generation. Experiments show that
ReTAG improves response quality while significantly reducing inference time
compared to the baseline. Our code is available at

Motivation: 现有基于长度惩罚的方法存在两个未解决的缺陷：错误惩罚必要的探索性令牌和无意中奖励部分冗余，导致性能下降。

Method: 提出DECS框架，包括解耦的令牌级奖励机制（精确惩罚冗余令牌）和课程批量调度策略（平衡效率与效果）。

Result: 在七个基准测试中，推理令牌数量减少超过50%，同时保持甚至提高了性能。

Conclusion: DECS证明可以在不损害模型基本推理能力的情况下实现推理效率的大幅提升。

Abstract: While large reasoning models trained with critic-free reinforcement learning
and verifiable rewards (RLVR) represent the state-of-the-art, their practical
utility is hampered by ``overthinking'', a critical issue where models generate
excessively long reasoning paths without any performance benefit. Existing
solutions that penalize length often fail, inducing performance degradation due
to a fundamental misalignment between trajectory-level rewards and token-level
optimization. In this work, we introduce a novel framework, DECS, built on our
theoretical discovery of two previously unaddressed flaws in current length
rewards: (1) the erroneous penalization of essential exploratory tokens and (2)
the inadvertent rewarding of partial redundancy. Our framework's innovations
include (i) a first-of-its-kind decoupled token-level reward mechanism that
surgically distinguishes and penalizes redundant tokens, and (ii) a novel
curriculum batch scheduling strategy to master the efficiency-efficacy
equilibrium. Experimental results show DECS can achieve a dramatic reduction in
reasoning tokens by over 50\% across seven benchmarks while simultaneously
maintaining or even improving performance. It demonstrates conclusively that
substantial gains in reasoning efficiency can be achieved without compromising
a model's underlying reasoning power.

TL;DR: 该论文提出评估视觉语言模型生成解释的两个质量评分函数——视觉保真度和对比性，以帮助用户在看不到视觉上下文时判断模型预测的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当用户无法看到视觉上下文时，VLM生成的解释可能误导用户相信不准确的预测。需要开发解释质量评估方法来防止用户对错误预测的过度依赖。

Method: 提出两个解释质量评分函数：视觉保真度（评估解释对视觉上下文的忠实度）和对比性（评估解释区分预测与替代方案的能力）。在A-OKVQA和VizWiz任务上进行评估，并进行用户研究。

Result: 提出的质量评分函数比现有方法更能校准模型正确性。用户研究表明，显示质量评分可将预测VLM正确性的准确率提高11.1%，错误相信不正确预测的比率降低15.4%。

Conclusion: 解释质量评分有助于促进对VLM预测的适当依赖，特别是在用户无法看到视觉上下文的情况下。

Abstract: When people query Vision-Language Models (VLMs) but cannot see the
accompanying visual context (e.g. for blind and low-vision users), augmenting
VLM predictions with natural language explanations can signal which model
predictions are reliable. However, prior work has found that explanations can
easily convince users that inaccurate VLM predictions are correct. To remedy
undesirable overreliance on VLM predictions, we propose evaluating two
complementary qualities of VLM-generated explanations via two quality scoring
functions. We propose Visual Fidelity, which captures how faithful an
explanation is to the visual context, and Contrastiveness, which captures how
well the explanation identifies visual details that distinguish the model's
prediction from plausible alternatives. On the A-OKVQA and VizWiz tasks, these
quality scoring functions are better calibrated with model correctness than
existing explanation qualities. We conduct a user study in which participants
have to decide whether a VLM prediction is accurate without viewing its visual
context. We observe that showing our quality scores alongside VLM explanations
improves participants' accuracy at predicting VLM correctness by 11.1%,
including a 15.4% reduction in the rate of falsely believing incorrect
predictions. These findings highlight the utility of explanation quality scores
in fostering appropriate reliance on VLM predictions.

multi-stage evaluation: (1) confabulation detection, (2) fine-grained error
localization, and (3) correction. We benchmark 9 state-of-the-art LLMs,
revealing limited performance ($\sim$50\% accuracy). Even top models such as
GPT-4o fail to distinguish factual from confabulated scientific answers,
raising concerns about the reliability of \textit{LLM-as-judge} evaluation

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在人类决策中影响力增强，需要理解它们在复杂社会情境中的行为。角色冲突代表固有的模糊社会困境，需要上下文敏感性来识别和权衡情境线索。

Method: 使用三阶段流程生成超过13K个现实角色冲突场景，涵盖65个角色，系统性地变化相关期望和情境紧急程度，分析10个不同LLMs的模型选择。

Result: LLMs对上下文线索有一定响应能力，但这种敏感性不足，决策主要由强大的内在社会角色偏见主导，而非情境信息。发现对家庭和职业领域角色的偏好，以及男性角色和亚伯拉罕宗教的优先化。

Conclusion: LLMs在角色冲突决策中表现出显著的社会角色偏见，上下文敏感性不足，这对其在复杂社会情境中的应用提出了重要挑战。

Abstract: Humans often encounter role conflicts -- social dilemmas where the
expectations of multiple roles clash and cannot be simultaneously fulfilled. As
large language models (LLMs) become increasingly influential in human
decision-making, understanding how they behave in complex social situations is
essential. While previous research has evaluated LLMs' social abilities in
contexts with predefined correct answers, role conflicts represent inherently
ambiguous social dilemmas that require contextual sensitivity: the ability to
recognize and appropriately weigh situational cues that can fundamentally alter
decision priorities. To address this gap, we introduce RoleConflictBench, a
novel benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' contextual sensitivity in complex
social dilemmas. Our benchmark employs a three-stage pipeline to generate over
13K realistic role conflict scenarios across 65 roles, systematically varying
their associated expectations (i.e., their responsibilities and obligations)
and situational urgency levels. By analyzing model choices across 10 different
LLMs, we find that while LLMs show some capacity to respond to these contextual
cues, this sensitivity is insufficient. Instead, their decisions are
predominantly governed by a powerful, inherent bias related to social roles
rather than situational information. Our analysis quantifies these biases,
revealing a dominant preference for roles within the Family and Occupation
domains, as well as a clear prioritization of male roles and Abrahamic
religions across most evaluatee models.

Motivation: 由于缺乏评估文本特定方面（如个性化质量）的指标，研究者通常依赖多个大语言模型进行元评估，但这会增加成本且受模型内部偏见影响。

Method: 引入了名为PerQ的计算高效方法，用于评估语言模型生成文本的个性化质量。

Result: 通过大语言模型和小语言模型生成能力的案例研究，展示了该指标在研究中可用性，有效减少资源浪费。

Conclusion: PerQ方法能够有效评估文本个性化质量，降低元评估成本，提高研究效率。

Abstract: Since no metrics are available to evaluate specific aspects of a text, such
as its personalization quality, the researchers often rely solely on large
language models to meta-evaluate such texts. Due to internal biases of
individual language models, it is recommended to use multiple of them for
combined evaluation, which directly increases costs of such meta-evaluation. In
this paper, a computationally efficient method for evaluation of
personalization quality of a given text (generated by a language model) is
introduced, called PerQ. A case study of comparison of generation capabilities
of large and small language models shows the usability of the proposed metric
in research, effectively reducing the waste of resources.

TL;DR: Mem-alpha是一个强化学习框架，用于训练LLM代理有效管理复杂内存系统，通过交互和反馈学习如何提取、存储和更新相关信息，显著提升长期信息理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于内存的LLM代理依赖预定义指令和工具进行内存更新，但语言模型缺乏确定存储哪些信息、如何结构化以及何时更新的能力，导致内存构建不优和信息丢失。

Method: 提出Mem-alpha强化学习框架，构建专门训练数据集涵盖多样化多轮交互模式，代理处理顺序信息块，学习提取和存储相关内容并更新内存系统，奖励信号来自下游问答准确性。

Result: Mem-alpha在现有基于内存的代理基线上取得显著改进，尽管仅在最长30k token的实例上训练，但能泛化到超过400k token的序列，是训练长度的13倍以上。

Conclusion: Mem-alpha框架能够有效训练代理管理复杂内存系统，展现出强大的泛化能力和鲁棒性，解决了LLM代理在长期信息理解中的内存管理挑战。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents are constrained by limited context windows,
necessitating external memory systems for long-term information understanding.
Current memory-augmented agents typically depend on pre-defined instructions
and tools for memory updates. However, language models may lack the ability to
determine which information to store, how to structure it, and when to update
it, especially as memory systems become more complex. This results in
suboptimal memory construction and information loss. To this end, we propose
Mem-alpha, a reinforcement learning framework that trains agents to effectively
manage complex memory systems through interaction and feedback. We also
construct a specialized training dataset spanning diverse multi-turn
interaction patterns paired with comprehensive evaluation questions designed to
teach effective memory management. During training, agents process sequential
information chunks, learn to extract and store relevant content, then update
the memory system. The reward signal derives from downstream question-answering
accuracy over the full interaction history, directly optimizing for memory
construction. To illustrate the effectiveness of our training framework, we
design a memory architecture comprising core, episodic, and semantic
components, equipped with multiple tools for memory operations. Empirical
evaluation demonstrates that Mem-alpha achieves significant improvements over
existing memory-augmented agent baselines. Despite being trained exclusively on
instances with a maximum length of 30k tokens, our agents exhibit remarkable
generalization to sequences exceeding 400k tokens, over 13x the training
length, highlighting the robustness of Mem-alpha.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为KERN的新型路由器函数，用于替代传统MoE模型中的Softmax路由器。KERN基于Nadaraya-Watson回归的数学原理，将MoE和FFN统一到同一框架下，并推荐使用ReLU激活和l2归一化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MoE模型一直使用Softmax作为路由器函数，但这更多是一种惯例而非基于原理的设计选择。作者从Nadaraya-Watson回归的角度重新审视MoE，发现MoE和FFN都可以统一到该框架下，从而提出了更通用的路由器设计。

Method: 提出了KERN路由器函数，这是一种FFN风格的路由器，不需要额外计算成本。基于FFN的实现经验，推荐使用ReLU激活和l2归一化。该方法将Sigmoid和Softmax路由器都统一为特例。

Result: 在MoE和LLM上的综合实验验证了所提出的FFN风格路由器函数的有效性。

Conclusion: KERN路由器为MoE模型提供了一种更通用且有效的替代方案，打破了传统Softmax路由器的惯例，为MoE架构设计提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has become a cornerstone in recent state-of-the-art
large language models (LLMs). Traditionally, MoE relies on $\mathrm{Softmax}$
as the router score function to aggregate expert output, a designed choice that
has persisted from the earliest MoE models to modern LLMs, and is now widely
regarded as standard practice. However, the necessity of using
$\mathrm{Softmax}$ to project router weights into a probability simplex remains
an unchallenged assumption rather than a principled design choice. In this
work, we first revisit the classical Nadaraya-Watson regression and observe
that MoE shares the same mathematical formulation as Nadaraya-Watson
regression. Furthermore, we show that both feed-forward neural network (FFN)
and MoE can be interpreted as a special case of Nadaraya-Watson regression,
where the kernel function corresponds to the input neurons of the output layer.
Motivated by these insights, we propose the \textbf{zero-additional-cost}
Kernel Inspired Router with Normalization (KERN), an FFN-style router function,
as an alternative to $\mathrm{Softmax}$. We demonstrate that this router
generalizes both $\mathrm{Sigmoid}$- and $\mathrm{Softmax}$-based routers.
\textbf{Based on empirical observations and established practices in FFN
implementation, we recommend the use of $\mathrm{ReLU}$ activation and
$\ell_2$-normalization in $\mathrm{KERN}$ router function.} Comprehensive
experiments in MoE and LLM validate the effectiveness of the proposed FFN-style
router function \methodNorm.

*Ana Ezquerro,Carlos Gómez-Rodríguez,David Vilares*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了除Transformer外的多种架构在序列标注任务中的表现，发现这些架构在简单任务中的优异表现不能很好地推广到复杂结构化任务和多语言场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然Transformer编码器在序列标注中占主导地位，但其他架构如xLSTMs、结构化状态空间模型等在语言建模中显示出潜力，但很少应用于序列标注任务，尤其是在复杂任务中。

Method: 研究了多种架构在不同结构复杂性、标签空间和标记依赖关系的标注任务中的适应性，评估涵盖多种语言。

Result: 发现在简单设置中观察到的强大性能并不总是能很好地跨语言或数据集泛化，也不能扩展到更复杂的结构化任务。

Conclusion: 替代架构在序列标注任务中的表现受任务复杂性和语言多样性的影响，需要更全面的评估来理解其适用性。

Abstract: Pretrained Transformer encoders are the dominant approach to sequence
labeling. While some alternative architectures-such as xLSTMs, structured
state-space models, diffusion models, and adversarial learning-have shown
promise in language modeling, few have been applied to sequence labeling, and
mostly on flat or simplified tasks. We study how these architectures adapt
across tagging tasks that vary in structural complexity, label space, and token
dependencies, with evaluation spanning multiple languages. We find that the
strong performance previously observed in simpler settings does not always
generalize well across languages or datasets, nor does it extend to more
complex structured tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无参考GEC评估指标虽然与人工评价相关性高，但未考虑对抗系统可能获取不公正高分，这会误导用户选择系统，影响自动评估的可靠性。

Method: 针对SOME、Scribendi、IMPARA和基于LLM的四种无参考指标，提出了对抗攻击策略，开发了对抗系统。

Result: 开发的对抗系统在现有指标上表现优于当前最先进系统，成功暴露了这些指标的脆弱性。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了需要开发更鲁棒的语法纠错评估方法，以应对潜在的对抗攻击。

Abstract: Reference-free evaluation metrics for grammatical error correction (GEC) have
achieved high correlation with human judgments. However, these metrics are not
designed to evaluate adversarial systems that aim to obtain unjustifiably high
scores. The existence of such systems undermines the reliability of automatic
evaluation, as it can mislead users in selecting appropriate GEC systems. In
this study, we propose adversarial attack strategies for four reference-free
metrics: SOME, Scribendi, IMPARA, and LLM-based metrics, and demonstrate that
our adversarial systems outperform the current state-of-the-art. These findings
highlight the need for more robust evaluation methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有奖励模型基于通用偏好数据训练，在RAG场景中难以准确评估回答的忠实性、相关性、拒绝能力、完整性和简洁性，缺乏专门的RAG偏好数据集和模型。

Method: 提出RAGferee方法，将问答数据集重新构建为偏好对，强调基于上下文的真实性而非风格特征，训练专门用于RAG的上下文奖励模型。

Result: 在仅4K样本上训练的7B-24B RAG专用奖励模型，在ContextualJudgeBench上达到SOTA，比训练在240万样本上的70B+通用模型绝对提升15.5%。

Conclusion: RAGferee方法能有效构建RAG专用偏好数据，训练的小型专用模型性能超越大型通用模型，证明了领域专用训练的重要性。

Abstract: Existing Reward Models (RMs), typically trained on general preference data,
struggle in Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) settings, which require
judging responses for faithfulness to retrieved context, relevance to the user
query, appropriate refusals when context is insufficient, completeness and
conciseness of information. To address the lack of publicly available
RAG-centric preference datasets and specialised RMs, we introduce RAGferee, a
methodology that repurposes question-answering (QA) datasets into preference
pairs that prioritise groundedness over stylistic features, enabling the
training of contextual RMs better suited to judging RAG responses. Using
RAGferee, we curate a small preference dataset of 4K samples and fine-tune RMs
ranging from 7B to 24B parameters. Our RAG-centric RMs achieve state-of-the-art
performance on ContextualJudgeBench, surpassing existing 70B+ RMs trained on
much larger (up to 2.4M samples) general corpora, with an absolute improvement
of +15.5%.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出RE²方法，通过语法错误解释而非文本相似度来检索参考示例，提升中文语法错误纠正性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖文本相似度检索示例，但这种方法经常与实际错误模式不匹配，检索到词汇相似但语法无关的句子

Method: RE²方法使用语法错误解释来选择参考示例，创建了高质量的语法错误解释数据集，并利用LLMs提升CGEC性能

Result: 在两个CGEC数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法有效提升了中文语法错误纠正的性能

Conclusion: 基于语法错误解释的示例检索方法比传统文本相似度方法更有效，为CGEC和GEE研究提供了有价值的资源

Abstract: The primary objective of Chinese grammatical error correction (CGEC) is to
detect and correct errors in Chinese sentences. Recent research shows that
large language models (LLMs) have been applied to CGEC with significant
results. For LLMs, selecting appropriate reference examples can help improve
their performance. However, existing methods predominantly rely on text
similarity for example retrieval, a strategy that frequently mismatches actual
error patterns and retrieves lexically similar yet grammatically irrelevant
sentences. To address this problem, we propose a method named RE$^2$, which
retrieves appropriate examples with explanations of grammatical errors. Instead
of using text similarity of the input sentence, we use explanations of
grammatical errors to select reference examples, which are used by LLMs to
improve the performance of CGEC. We conduct experiments on two CGEC datasets
and create a high-quality grammatical error explanation (GEE) dataset, which is
not only used in our research but also serves as a valuable resource for future
studies in both CGEC and GEE. The experimental results on the two datasets
indicate that our proposed method effectively improves the performance of CGEC.

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了大型语言模型在思维链提示下的忠实性问题，通过控制提示中的暗示条件，发现模型推理受到暗示的显著影响，正确暗示能提高准确性但可能掩盖真实推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究大型语言模型生成的思维链推理是否忠实反映其实际计算过程，还是仅仅受到提示中暗示的引导而形成的后验叙述。

Method: 在四个数据集上使用两个先进模型，通过系统操纵暗示的正确性、呈现风格和复杂度，评估任务准确性和暗示显性承认情况。

Result: 正确暗示显著提高准确性，特别是困难任务；暗示承认程度不均，复杂暗示更易被显性引用；呈现风格影响承认行为，奉承式鼓励显性承认，泄露式促进隐性依赖。

Conclusion: LLM推理系统性受到提示中捷径的影响，这模糊了推理的忠实性，揭示了模型可能更依赖提示线索而非真实推理能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly rely on chain-of-thought (CoT)
prompting to solve mathematical and logical reasoning tasks. Yet, a central
question remains: to what extent are these generated rationales \emph{faithful}
to the underlying computations, rather than post-hoc narratives shaped by hints
that function as answer shortcuts embedded in the prompt? Following prior work
on hinted vs.\ unhinted prompting, we present a systematic study of CoT
faithfulness under controlled hint manipulations. Our experimental design spans
four datasets (AIME, GSM-Hard, MATH-500, UniADILR), two state-of-the-art models
(GPT-4o and Gemini-2-Flash), and a structured set of hint conditions varying in
correctness (correct and incorrect), presentation style (sycophancy and data
leak), and complexity (raw answers, two-operator expressions, four-operator
expressions). We evaluate both task accuracy and whether hints are explicitly
acknowledged in the reasoning. Our results reveal three key findings. First,
correct hints substantially improve accuracy, especially on harder benchmarks
and logical reasoning, while incorrect hints sharply reduce accuracy in tasks
with lower baseline competence. Second, acknowledgement of hints is highly
uneven: equation-based hints are frequently referenced, whereas raw hints are
often adopted silently, indicating that more complex hints push models toward
verbalizing their reliance in the reasoning process. Third, presentation style
matters: sycophancy prompts encourage overt acknowledgement, while leak-style
prompts increase accuracy but promote hidden reliance. This may reflect
RLHF-related effects, as sycophancy exploits the human-pleasing side and data
leak triggers the self-censoring side. Together, these results demonstrate that
LLM reasoning is systematically shaped by shortcuts in ways that obscure
faithfulness.

TL;DR: 提出了RE-Searcher方法，通过目标导向规划和自我反思来增强LLM搜索代理在复杂搜索环境中的鲁棒性，解决了查询微小变化导致性能下降的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在知识密集型问答中表现优异，但受限于知识截止、幻觉和交互模式有限。虽然通过外部搜索工具可以缓解这些问题，但复杂搜索环境中的查询微小变化会导致推理偏离和错误放大。

Method: RE-Searcher方法在搜索过程中明确阐述具体搜索目标，然后反思检索到的证据是否满足该目标，结合目标导向规划和自我反思来抵抗复杂搜索环境中的虚假线索。

Result: 实验表明该方法提高了搜索准确性并取得了最先进的结果。扰动研究进一步证明了对外部噪声或误导信号的强大韧性，缓解了搜索过程的脆弱性。

Conclusion: 这些发现为将LLM驱动的代理集成到更复杂的交互环境中并实现更自主的决策提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at knowledge-intensive question answering
and reasoning, yet their real-world deployment remains constrained by knowledge
cutoff, hallucination, and limited interaction modalities. Augmenting LLMs with
external search tools helps alleviate these issues, but it also exposes agents
to a complex search environment in which small, plausible variations in query
formulation can steer reasoning into unproductive trajectories and amplify
errors. We present a systematic analysis that quantifies how environmental
complexity induces fragile search behaviors and, in turn, degrades overall
performance. To address this challenge, we propose a simple yet effective
approach to instantiate a search agent, RE-Searcher. During search, RE-Searcher
explicitly articulates a concrete search goal and subsequently reflects on
whether the retrieved evidence satisfies that goal. This combination of
goal-oriented planning and self-reflection enables RE-Searcher to resist
spurious cues in complex search environments and perform robust search.
Extensive experiments show that our method improves search accuracy and
achieves state-of-the-art results. Perturbation studies further demonstrate
substantial resilience to noisy or misleading external signals, mitigating the
fragility of the search process. We believe these findings offer practical
guidance for integrating LLM-powered agents into more complex interactive
environments and enabling more autonomous decision-making.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器生成文本检测研究主要关注英语，导致对非英语语言（特别是中欧语言）的检测能力不足，跨语言迁移性能尚未充分探索。

Method: 构建了首个中欧语言检测基准，采用多领域、多生成器和多语言评估方法，比较不同训练语言组合，并测试检测方法对对抗性攻击的鲁棒性。

Result: 针对中欧语言进行监督微调的检测器在这些语言上表现最佳，同时对混淆攻击具有最强的抵抗力。

Conclusion: 针对特定语言进行监督微调的检测器在相应语言上表现最优，且对抗性鲁棒性最强，为机器生成文本检测在中欧语言上的应用提供了重要基准。

Abstract: Machine-generated text detection, as an important task, is predominantly
focused on English in research. This makes the existing detectors almost
unusable for non-English languages, relying purely on cross-lingual
transferability. There exist only a few works focused on any of Central
European languages, leaving the transferability towards these languages rather
unexplored. We fill this gap by providing the first benchmark of detection
methods focused on this region, while also providing comparison of
train-languages combinations to identify the best performing ones. We focus on
multi-domain, multi-generator, and multilingual evaluation, pinpointing the
differences of individual aspects, as well as adversarial robustness of
detection methods. Supervised finetuned detectors in the Central European
languages are found the most performant in these languages as well as the most
resistant against obfuscation.

TL;DR: DyFlow是一个动态工作流生成框架，通过自适应构建和调整推理过程来增强跨任务泛化能力，在多个领域显著优于现有基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的智能体系统大多依赖手动设计的工作流程，限制了跨任务的适应性。虽然少数方法尝试自动生成工作流，但通常与特定数据集或查询类型绑定，且对中间反馈利用有限，导致系统鲁棒性和推理深度不足。

Method: DyFlow包含设计器和执行器两个核心组件。设计器将复杂问题分解为一系列由高级目标定义的子目标，并根据中间输出和反馈动态规划下一步骤。执行器使用具有上下文感知参数化的动态操作符来执行每个操作，实现灵活且语义基础的推理。

Result: 在社交推理、生物医学任务、数学问题解决和代码生成等多个领域的系统评估表明，DyFlow显著优于现有基线方法，实现了显著的Pass@k改进，并在不同领域展现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: DyFlow通过动态工作流生成和自适应调整，有效解决了现有LLM智能体系统在跨任务泛化和推理深度方面的局限性，为构建更高效和通用的智能体系统提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Agent systems based on large language models (LLMs) have shown great
potential in complex reasoning tasks, but building efficient and generalizable
workflows remains a major challenge. Most existing approaches rely on manually
designed processes, which limits their adaptability across different tasks.
While a few methods attempt automated workflow generation, they are often tied
to specific datasets or query types and make limited use of intermediate
feedback, reducing system robustness and reasoning depth. Moreover, their
operations are typically predefined and inflexible. To address these
limitations, we propose DyFlow, a dynamic workflow generation framework that
adaptively constructs and adjusts reasoning procedures based on task
requirements and real-time intermediate feedback, thereby enhancing cross-task
generalization. DyFlow consists of two core components: a designer and an
executor. The designer decomposes complex problems into a sequence of sub-goals
defined by high-level objectives and dynamically plans the next steps based on
intermediate outputs and feedback. These plans are then carried out by the
executor, which executes each operation using dynamic operators with
context-aware parameterization, enabling flexible and semantically grounded
reasoning. We systematically evaluate DyFlow across diverse domains, including
social reasoning, biomedical tasks, mathematical problem solving, and code
generation. Results demonstrate that DyFlow significantly outperforms existing
baselines, achieving substantial Pass@k improvements and exhibiting robust
generalization across diverse domains. The code is publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLM作为自动评估器在评估系统输出时的可靠性问题，发现其判断可能基于提示中的表面线索而非真实质量。

Method: 使用ELI5和LitBench数据集构建100对比较任务，让GPT-4o和Gemini-2.5-Flash作为评估器，在保持提示固定的情况下为回答分配来源和时间线索。

Result: 两个模型都表现出明显的近期偏见（偏好新回答）和来源等级偏见（专家>人类>LLM>未知），在GPT-4o和LitBench中尤其明显，且很少承认这些偏见因素。

Conclusion: 当前LLM作为评估器的系统容易受到表面线索影响且不忠实，削弱了其在研究和部署中作为评估器的可靠性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as automatic judges to
evaluate system outputs in tasks such as summarization, dialogue, and creative
writing. A faithful judge should base its verdicts solely on response quality
and explicitly acknowledge the factors shaping its decision. We show that
current LLM judges fail on both counts by relying on shortcuts introduced in
the prompt. Our study uses two evaluation datasets: ELI5, a benchmark for
long-form question answering, and LitBench, a recent benchmark for creative
writing. Both datasets provide pairwise comparisons, where the evaluator must
choose which of two responses is better. From each dataset we construct 100
pairwise judgment tasks and employ two widely used models, GPT-4o and
Gemini-2.5-Flash, as evaluators in the role of LLM-as-a-judge. For each pair,
we assign superficial cues to the responses, provenance cues indicating source
identity (Human, Expert, LLM, or Unknown) and recency cues indicating temporal
origin (Old, 1950 vs. New, 2025), while keeping the rest of the prompt fixed.
Results reveal consistent verdict shifts: both models exhibit a strong recency
bias, systematically favoring new responses over old, as well as a clear
provenance hierarchy (Expert > Human > LLM > Unknown). These biases are
especially pronounced in GPT-4o and in the more subjective and open-ended
LitBench domain. Crucially, cue acknowledgment is rare: justifications almost
never reference the injected cues, instead rationalizing decisions in terms of
content qualities. These findings demonstrate that current LLM-as-a-judge
systems are shortcut-prone and unfaithful, undermining their reliability as
evaluators in both research and deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 奖励建模对于对齐大型语言模型与人类偏好至关重要，但偏好数据的高成本成为瓶颈。现有的文本数据合成方法计算成本高昂。

Method: 使用变分自编码器(VAE)学习响应嵌入的结构化潜在表示，在潜在空间进行受控扰动并解码回嵌入空间，生成语义一致的合成偏好对，避免昂贵的文本生成和标注。

Result: 潜在空间合成在标准基准测试中显著优于基于文本的增强方法，生成速度快18倍，使用模型小16,000倍，同时获得更优结果。

Conclusion: LENS为通过高效数据增强改进奖励建模提供了可扩展且有效的替代方案，理论保证合成对近似保留原始偏好排序并提高奖励模型泛化能力。

Abstract: Reward modeling, crucial for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human
preferences, is often bottlenecked by the high cost of preference data.
Existing textual data synthesis methods are computationally expensive. We
propose a novel framework LENS for synthesizing preference data directly in the
LLM's latent embedding space. Our method employs a Variational Autoencoder
(VAE) to learn a structured latent representation of response embeddings. By
performing controlled perturbations in this latent space and decoding back to
the embedding space, we efficiently generate diverse, semantically consistent
synthetic preference pairs, bypassing costly text generation and annotation. We
provide theoretical guarantees that our synthesized pairs approximately
preserve original preference ordering and improve reward model generalization.
Empirically, our latent-space synthesis significantly outperforms text-based
augmentation on standard benchmarks, achieving superior results while being 18x
faster in generation and using a 16,000x smaller model. Our work offers a
scalable and effective alternative for enhancing reward modeling through
efficient data augmentation. Code is publicly available at

Abstract: As the mathematical capabilities of large language models (LLMs) improve, it
becomes increasingly important to evaluate their performance on research-level
tasks at the frontier of mathematical knowledge. However, existing benchmarks
are limited, as they focus solely on final-answer questions or high-school
competition problems. To address this gap, we introduce IMProofBench, a private
benchmark consisting of 39 peer-reviewed problems developed by expert
mathematicians. Each problem requires a detailed proof and is paired with
subproblems that have final answers, supporting both an evaluation of
mathematical reasoning capabilities by human experts and a large-scale
quantitative analysis through automated grading. Furthermore, unlike prior
benchmarks, the evaluation setup simulates a realistic research environment:
models operate in an agentic framework with tools like web search for
literature review and mathematical software such as SageMath. Our results show
that current LLMs can succeed at the more accessible research-level questions,
but still encounter significant difficulties on more challenging problems.
Quantitatively, Grok-4 achieves the highest accuracy of 52% on final-answer
subproblems, while GPT-5 obtains the best performance for proof generation,
achieving a fully correct solution for 22% of problems. IMProofBench will
continue to evolve as a dynamic benchmark in collaboration with the
mathematical community, ensuring its relevance for evaluating the next
generation of LLMs.

### [186] [Reinforced Strategy Optimization for Conversational Recommender Systems via Network-of-Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26093)
*Xiaoyan Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了RSO框架，通过分层策略优化来改进对话推荐系统，将响应生成分解为宏观策略规划和微观适应，使用强化学习解决多轮对话数据不足问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法缺乏明确的交互策略优化，依赖统一提示导致次优结果，需要更有效的策略学习框架。

Method: 分层框架：规划器选择策略（推荐、解释、鼓励等），执行器在专家网络指导下生成响应，使用强化学习和LLM奖励进行策略学习。

Result: RSO在实验中优于最先进的基线方法，验证了分层策略优化的有效性。

Conclusion: RSO框架通过分层策略优化和强化学习有效提升了对话推荐系统的性能，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs) provide personalized
recommendations through multi-turn interactions. With the strong reasoning
abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), applying them to CRSs has become
promising. Yet, existing methods often lack explicit optimization of
interaction strategies, relying instead on unified prompts, which can yield
suboptimal outcomes. We propose Reinforced Strategy Optimization (RSO), a
hierarchical framework that decomposes response generation into macro-level
strategy planning and micro-level adaptation within a network-of-experts. A
Planner selects strategies (e.g., recommend, explain, encourage), while an
Actor generates responses guided by auxiliary experts for preferences and
factual grounding. This disentanglement enables more tractable learning. To
address limited multi-turn data, we model strategy learning as reinforcement
learning with an LLM-based reward for exploration. Experiments show RSO
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, validating the effectiveness of
hierarchical strategy optimization.

Abstract: We present a scalable large language model (LLM)-based system that combines
aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) with guided summarization to generate
concise and interpretable product review summaries for the Wayfair platform.
Our approach first extracts and consolidates aspect-sentiment pairs from
individual reviews, selects the most frequent aspects for each product, and
samples representative reviews accordingly. These are used to construct
structured prompts that guide the LLM to produce summaries grounded in actual
customer feedback. We demonstrate the real-world effectiveness of our system
through a large-scale online A/B test. Furthermore, we describe our real-time
deployment strategy and release a dataset of 11.8 million anonymized customer
reviews covering 92,000 products, including extracted aspects and generated
summaries, to support future research in aspect-guided review summarization.

TL;DR: 通过添加领域特定词汇来优化LLM在专业领域应用中的分词效率，减少token数量并降低推理延迟


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在处理训练领域之外文本时的词汇不匹配问题，避免因分词效率低下导致的处理速度下降

Method: 设计算法扩展预训练分词器的词汇表，添加领域特定词汇，保证分词效率不会降低

Result: 在真实电商用例中，增强后的分词器将输入序列缩短达20%，降低推理延迟，同时保持预测质量

Conclusion: 词汇适应能显著提升LLM在专业领域的处理效率，具有广泛的实用价值

Abstract: When using an LLM to process text outside the training domain(s), an often
overlooked factor is vocabulary mismatch, where the general-domain tokenizer
fails to capture frequent domain-specific terms, leading to higher token
fertility and thus a decrease in processing speed due to suboptimal sub-word
splits.
  We address this limitation by augmenting the pretrained vocabulary with a set
of domain-specific tokens. To this end, we design an algorithm that extends an
existing tokenizer while guaranteeing it never decreases tokenization
efficiency: every input sequence is segmented into at most the same number of
tokens as before.
  Evaluated on real-world e-Commerce use-cases, the augmented tokenizer
significantly shortens input sequences by up to 20% and reduces inference
latency on downstream tasks while preserving predictive quality. We further
analyze secondary effects, such as the impact on forward pass speed and the
rate at which the model adopts the newly introduced tokens, to illustrate the
broader benefits of vocabulary adaptation.

Motivation: 探索LLM多智能体系统中竞争如何影响行为，特别是过度竞争现象，因为这在复杂问题解决中尚未充分研究。

Method: 提出HATE（饥饿游戏辩论）实验框架，模拟零和竞争环境下的辩论，在不同LLM和任务上进行实验，并引入不同变体的裁判来研究环境反馈的影响。

Result: 竞争压力显著刺激了过度竞争行为，导致任务性能下降和讨论偏离轨道；客观、任务导向的反馈能有效缓解过度竞争行为。

Conclusion: 研究为理解和治理AI社区涌现的社会动态提供了见解，形成了LLM的领导者排名，揭示了竞争环境对多智能体系统行为的重要影响。

Abstract: LLM-based multi-agent systems demonstrate great potential for tackling
complex problems, but how competition shapes their behavior remains
underexplored. This paper investigates the over-competition in multi-agent
debate, where agents under extreme pressure exhibit unreliable, harmful
behaviors that undermine both collaboration and task performance. To study this
phenomenon, we propose HATE, the Hunger Game Debate, a novel experimental
framework that simulates debates under a zero-sum competition arena. Our
experiments, conducted across a range of LLMs and tasks, reveal that
competitive pressure significantly stimulates over-competition behaviors and
degrades task performance, causing discussions to derail. We further explore
the impact of environmental feedback by adding variants of judges, indicating
that objective, task-focused feedback effectively mitigates the
over-competition behaviors. We also probe the post-hoc kindness of LLMs and
form a leaderboard to characterize top LLMs, providing insights for
understanding and governing the emergent social dynamics of AI community.

Conclusion: VietBinoculars在越南语LLM生成文本检测方面表现出色，特别是在特殊修改的提示策略下，超越了包括ZeroGPT和DetectGPT在内的商业工具。

Abstract: The rapid development research of Large Language Models (LLMs) based on
transformer architectures raises key challenges, one of them being the task of
distinguishing between human-written text and LLM-generated text. As
LLM-generated textual content, becomes increasingly complex over time, and
resembles human writing, traditional detection methods are proving less
effective, especially as the number and diversity of LLMs continue to grow with
new models and versions being released at a rapid pace. This study proposes
VietBinoculars, an adaptation of the Binoculars method with optimized global
thresholds, to enhance the detection of Vietnamese LLM-generated text. We have
constructed new Vietnamese AI-generated datasets to determine the optimal
thresholds for VietBinoculars and to enable benchmarking. The results from our
experiments show results show that VietBinoculars achieves over 99\% in all two
domains of accuracy, F1-score, and AUC on multiple out-of-domain datasets. It
outperforms the original Binoculars model, traditional detection methods, and

Motivation: 现代物流管理系统需要高效的路径规划，OCVRP涉及为服务地理分布客户的车辆寻找最优配送路线，且车辆在配送后无需返回仓库。

Method: 使用Python开发了两种算法的实现，基于自定义数据集进行比较分析，评估指标包括路由效率、计算时间和可扩展性。

Result: ACO在路由参数上更灵活，而OR-Tools运行速度更快、更一致且需要更少的输入参数。

Conclusion: 研究结果有助于为可扩展的实时物流系统选择合适的路由策略。

Abstract: In modern logistics management systems, route planning requires high
efficiency. The Open Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (OCVRP) deals with
finding optimal delivery routes for a fleet of vehicles serving geographically
distributed customers, without requiring the vehicles to return to the depot
after deliveries. The present study is comparative in nature and speaks of two
algorithms for OCVRP solution: Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), a nature-inspired
metaheuristic; and Google OR-Tools, an industry-standard toolkit for
optimization. Both implementations were developed in Python and using a custom
dataset. Performance appraisal was based on routing efficiency, computation
time, and scalability. The results show that ACO allows flexibility in routing
parameters while OR-Tools runs much faster with more consistency and requires
less input. This could help choose among routing strategies for scalable
real-time logistics systems.

Motivation: 现实知识图谱中类型信息往往缺乏或不完整，即使存在也通常是粗粒度、稀疏且容易出错的人工标注，需要探索预训练语言模型来丰富节点表示中的隐式类型信号。

Method: 提出TyleR方法，基于子图的归纳链接预测框架，利用预训练语言模型进行语义增强，无需显式类型信息即可获得类型感知的节点表示。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，TyleR在类型标注稀缺和图连接稀疏的场景下优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: 预训练语言模型能够有效丰富知识图谱节点表示中的隐式类型信号，在缺乏显式类型信息的情况下实现高质量的归纳链接预测。

Abstract: Inductive link prediction is emerging as a key paradigm for real-world
knowledge graphs (KGs), where new entities frequently appear and models must
generalize to them without retraining. Predicting links in a KG faces the
challenge of guessing previously unseen entities by leveraging generalizable
node features such as subgraph structure, type annotations, and ontological
constraints. However, explicit type information is often lacking or incomplete.
Even when available, type information in most KGs is often coarse-grained,
sparse, and prone to errors due to human annotation. In this work, we explore
the potential of pre-trained language models (PLMs) to enrich node
representations with implicit type signals. We introduce TyleR, a Type-less yet
type-awaRe approach for subgraph-based inductive link prediction that leverages
PLMs for semantic enrichment. Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate
that TyleR outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in scenarios with scarce type
annotations and sparse graph connectivity. To ensure reproducibility, we share

Motivation: 传统微调方法需要复杂的数据混合和重复实验来获得最优泛化性能，这过程繁琐且耗时。

Method: 使用零学习率训练在通用数据上获取全局梯度，然后在领域训练中进行梯度增强和动态训练步长校正，结合退火学习建立微调流程。

Result: 在多个任务和基础模型上，DBA相比传统微调在联合性能上平均提升5.8%，GPU时间减少91.0%。

Conclusion: DBA提供了一种高效通用的解决方案，仅需领域数据即可实现优异性能，无需重复实验和数据混合，显著降低计算成本。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) fine-tuning shows excellent implications.
However, vanilla fine-tuning methods often require intricate data mixture and
repeated experiments for optimal generalization. To address these challenges
and streamline the training process, we propose an efficient and universal
solution, Dynamic Boosted Annealing (DBA). We obtain a global gradient through
zero-learning-rate training on general data, which is subsequently employed for
gradient boosting and dynamic training step correction during domain training.
In conjunction with annealing learning, we end up establishing a fine-tuning
pipeline that relies solely on domain data without collapse. By evaluating both
general and domain-specific performance across multiple tasks on several
popular base models, DBA achieves an average improvement of 5.8% in joint
performance over vanilla fine-tuning. Furthermore, since general data is no
longer involved in annealing, repeated experiments led by data mixture are also
eliminated. According to our tests, the DBA method can reduce GPU hours by
91.0% compared to the vanilla method.

Result: 纯语音模型在说话人、性别、情感、房间和背景因素方面实现了最高的一致性，超越了更大的系统。交替模型改善了词汇和句法探测以及语义-声学对齐，但降低了一致性。线性探测显示初始化使模型偏向内容结构，但牺牲了韵律细节。

Conclusion: 语言模型侧的设计和训练组合可以控制声学稳定性和语义基础之间的平衡，无需改变分词器或运行时架构。

Abstract: We study speech language models that incorporate semantic initialization and
planning losses to achieve robust and consistent generation. Our approach
initializes speech tokens with self-supervised features, applies a light
alignment loss, and trains with thinning and auxiliary objectives that target
robustness and content planning. We train three models: a 0.7B speech-only
model, a 1.0B speech-only model, and a 1.0B interleaved model with both text
and speech. Acoustic studies show that the speech-only models achieve the
highest consistency across speaker, gender, sentiment, room, and background
factors, surpassing larger systems. Interleaving improves lexical and syntactic
probes and semantic--acoustic alignment but reduces consistency. Linear probes
show that our initialization biases the model toward content structure while
trading off prosody detail. These results show that LM-side design and training
mix control the balance between acoustic stability and semantic grounding
without changes to the tokenizer or runtime architecture. A demo and model
weights are available for exploration.

Abstract: Dialogue summarization aims to distill the core meaning of a conversation
into a concise text. This is crucial for reducing the complexity and noise
inherent in dialogue-heavy applications. While recent approaches typically
train language models to mimic human-written summaries, such supervision is
costly and often results in outputs that lack task-specific focus limiting
their effectiveness in downstream applications, such as medical tasks. In this
paper, we propose \app, a framework for task-oriented utility-based dialogue
summarization. \app starts by generating multiple summaries and task-oriented
question-answer pairs from a dialogue in a zero-shot manner using a pool of
large language models (LLMs). The quality of the generated summaries is
evaluated by having LLMs answer task-related questions before \textit{(i)}
selecting the best candidate answers and \textit{(ii)} identifying the most
informative summary based on these answers. Finally, we fine-tune the best LLM
on the selected summaries. When validated on multiple datasets, \app
demonstrates its effectiveness by achieving competitive results in various
zero-shot settings, rivaling fully-supervised State-of-the-Art (SotA) methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI模型评估方法难以明确衡量模型的人格特征，基于人类反馈的排名方法存在不透明性，且模型可能过度拟合这些反馈。需要工具来显式跟踪AI人格变化。

Method: 开发了开源的Feedback Forensics工具包，利用AI标注器通过Python API和浏览器应用来调查人格特征。

Result: 分析了流行人类反馈数据集（如Chatbot Arena、MultiPref和PRISM）中鼓励的人格特征，并评估了流行模型展示这些特征的程度。

Conclusion: Feedback Forensics工具包能够有效跟踪AI人格变化，为模型人格评估提供了透明的方法。

Abstract: Some traits making a "good" AI model are hard to describe upfront. For
example, should responses be more polite or more casual? Such traits are
sometimes summarized as model character or personality. Without a clear
objective, conventional benchmarks based on automatic validation struggle to
measure such traits. Evaluation methods using human feedback such as Chatbot
Arena have emerged as a popular alternative. These methods infer "better"
personality and other desirable traits implicitly by ranking multiple model
responses relative to each other. Recent issues with model releases highlight
limitations of these existing opaque evaluation approaches: a major model was
rolled back over sycophantic personality issues, models were observed
overfitting to such feedback-based leaderboards. Despite these known issues,
limited public tooling exists to explicitly evaluate model personality. We
introduce Feedback Forensics: an open-source toolkit to track AI personality
changes, both those encouraged by human (or AI) feedback, and those exhibited
across AI models trained and evaluated on such feedback. Leveraging AI
annotators, our toolkit enables investigating personality via Python API and
browser app. We demonstrate the toolkit's usefulness in two steps: (A) first we
analyse the personality traits encouraged in popular human feedback datasets
including Chatbot Arena, MultiPref and PRISM; and (B) then use our toolkit to
analyse how much popular models exhibit such traits. We release (1) our
Feedback Forensics toolkit alongside (2) a web app tracking AI personality in
popular models and feedback datasets as well as (3) the underlying annotation
data at https://github.com/rdnfn/feedback-forensics.

*Rui Ming,Haoyuan Wu,Shoubo Hu,Zhuolun He,Bei Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: OTR是一种新颖的微调算法，将监督微调与策略梯度方法结合，通过将每个token生成视为单步强化学习轨迹来提升语言模型的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 监督微调(SFT)在泛化能力上不如强化学习(RL)，作者认为这种性能差异源于数据性质的根本不同：SFT使用固定的离线数据，而RL使用从当前策略采样的在线数据。

Method: 提出单token rollout(OTR)算法，将自回归学习过程重新定义为单步强化学习轨迹。在每个步骤中，从当前策略分布中采样多个候选token，使用监督数据中的真实token为这些样本提供奖励信号，通过策略梯度将静态离线数据转化为动态在线信号。

Result: 在数学推理、代码生成和通用领域推理等多个具有挑战性的基准测试中，OTR始终优于标准SFT方法。

Conclusion: OTR是微调LLM的强大实用替代方案，证明了数据的在线性质是泛化能力的关键驱动因素，为LLM微调提供了有前景的新方向。

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is the predominant method for adapting large
language models (LLMs), yet it often struggles with generalization compared to
reinforcement learning (RL). In this work, we posit that this performance
disparity stems not just from the loss function, but from a more fundamental
difference: SFT learns from a fixed, pre-collected dataset, whereas RL utilizes
on-policy data sampled from the current policy. Building on this hypothesis, we
introduce one-token rollout (OTR), a novel fine-tuning algorithm that guides
SFT with the policy gradient method. OTR reframes the autoregressive learning
process by treating each token generation as a single-step reinforcement
learning trajectory. At each step, it performs a Monte Carlo ``rollout'' by
sampling multiple candidate tokens from the current policy's distribution. The
ground-truth token from the supervised data is then used to provide a reward
signal to these samples. Guided by policy gradient, our algorithm repurposes
static, off-policy supervised data into a dynamic, on-policy signal at the
token level, capturing the generalization benefits of on-policy learning while
bypassing the costly overhead of full sentence generation. Through extensive
experiments on a diverse suite of challenging benchmarks spanning mathematical
reasoning, code generation, and general domain reasoning, we demonstrate that
OTR consistently outperforms standard SFT. Our findings establish OTR as a
powerful and practical alternative for fine-tuning LLMs and provide compelling
evidence that the on-policy nature of data is a critical driver of
generalization, offering a promising new direction for fine-tuning LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在自然语言中的链式思考计算成本高且容易过度思考，而潜在思考架构缺乏可解释性和监督，引发对其思考过程正确性和可靠性的担忧。

Method: 提出潜在思考优化(LTO)概率算法，使用潜在分类器作为潜在奖励模型(LRM)来优化潜在思考过程，通过检测错误的潜在思考模式来改进推理。

Result: 实验表明LRM能有效检测错误的潜在思考模式，LTO能显著改善潜在思考过程，且该方法可泛化到不同领域并应用于通用LLMs。

Conclusion: 与语言思考相比，该方法证明奖励建模和扩展测试时思考可以直接在潜在空间进行，为改进LLMs思考过程提供了一种通用、高效且领域无关的方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at problem solving by generating chain of
thoughts in natural language, but such verbal thinking is computationally
costly and prone to overthinking. Recent work instead proposes a latent
thinking architecture Huggin-3.5B, which represents intermediate reasoning
steps as sequence of latent representations. However, latent thoughts lack
interpretability and are difficult to supervise, raising concerns about the
correctness and reliability of its latent thinking processes. In this paper, we
provide a systematic study of how Huggin-3.5B thinks in the latent space and
how external supervision signals can improve its latent thinking processes. We
show that latent thoughts leading to correct versus incorrect answers exhibit
highly distinguishable patterns, and that a latent classifier can reliably
predict answer correctness directly from latent thoughts. Leveraging these
insights, we propose Latent Thinking Optimization (LTO), a probabilistic
algorithm that employs the latent classifier as a Latent Reward Model (LRM) to
optimize the latent thinking processes. Extensive experiments across diverse
reasoning tasks demonstrate that LRM is highly effective in detecting incorrect
latent thinking patterns, and LTO can significantly improve the latent thinking
processes. Furthermore, we show that LRM can generalize across diverse domains,
and LTO can be seamlessly applied to general LLMs to improve their thinking
processes. In contrast to verbal thinking, our method demonstrates that reward
modeling and scaling test-time thinking with supervision can be performed
directly in the latent space, highlighting its potential as a general,
efficient, and domain-agnostic approach to improving the thinking processes of
LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Fast-dLLM v2通过块扩散机制将预训练的自回归模型转换为并行文本生成的扩散语言模型，仅需约10亿token微调，比传统扩散LLM减少500倍训练数据，实现2.5倍加速且保持生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归大语言模型的顺序解码限制了推理效率，需要开发能够并行生成文本的高效方法。

Method: 提出块扩散机制和互补注意力掩码，结合分层缓存机制（块级缓存和子块缓存）以及并行解码流水线。

Result: 在多样化基准测试中，Fast-dLLM v2在准确度上匹配或超越自回归基线，在dLLM中实现最先进的效率，达到2.5倍加速。

Conclusion: 该工作标志着向快速准确LLM实际部署迈出了重要一步，代码和模型将公开发布。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable
performance across a wide range of natural language tasks, yet their inherent
sequential decoding limits inference efficiency. In this work, we propose
Fast-dLLM v2, a carefully designed block diffusion language model (dLLM) that
efficiently adapts pretrained AR models into dLLMs for parallel text
generation, requiring only approximately 1B tokens of fine-tuning. This
represents a 500x reduction in training data compared to full-attention
diffusion LLMs such as Dream (580B tokens), while preserving the original
model's performance. Our approach introduces a novel training recipe that
combines a block diffusion mechanism with a complementary attention mask,
enabling blockwise bidirectional context modeling without sacrificing AR
training objectives. To further accelerate decoding, we design a hierarchical
caching mechanism: a block-level cache that stores historical context
representations across blocks, and a sub-block cache that enables efficient
parallel generation within partially decoded blocks. Coupled with our parallel
decoding pipeline, Fast-dLLM v2 achieves up to 2.5x speedup over standard AR
decoding without compromising generation quality. Extensive experiments across
diverse benchmarks demonstrate that Fast-dLLM v2 matches or surpasses AR
baselines in accuracy, while delivering state-of-the-art efficiency among dLLMs
- marking a significant step toward the practical deployment of fast and
accurate LLMs. Code and model will be publicly released.

TL;DR: KG-R1是一个通过强化学习优化的知识图谱检索增强生成框架，使用单一智能体与知识图谱交互，在减少推理成本的同时提高准确性和可迁移性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的KG-RAG系统通常使用多个LLM模块，导致推理成本高昂且行为受限于特定知识图谱，需要更高效、可迁移的解决方案。

Method: 采用强化学习训练单一智能体，使其能够与知识图谱环境交互，学习检索策略并将检索信息整合到推理和生成过程中。

Result: 在KGQA基准测试中，使用Qwen-2.5-3B模型，KG-R1以更少的生成token实现了比多模块方法更高的答案准确性，且在新知识图谱上无需修改即可保持良好性能。

Conclusion: KG-R1提供了一个高效、可迁移的KG-RAG框架，适合实际部署应用。

Abstract: Knowledge-graph retrieval-augmented generation (KG-RAG) couples large
language models (LLMs) with structured, verifiable knowledge graphs (KGs) to
reduce hallucinations and expose reasoning traces. However, many KG-RAG systems
compose multiple LLM modules (e.g planning, reasoning, and responding),
inflating inference cost and binding behavior to a specific target KG. To
address this, we introduce KG-R1, an agentic KG retrieval-augmented generation
(KG-RAG) framework through reinforcement learning (RL). KG-R1 utilizes a single
agent that interacts with KGs as its environment, learning to retrieve at each
step and incorporating the retrieved information into its reasoning and
generation. The process is optimized through end-to-end RL. In controlled
experiments across Knowledge-Graph Question Answering (KGQA) benchmarks, our
method demonstrates both efficiency and transferability: Using Qwen-2.5-3B,
KG-R1 improves answer accuracy with fewer generation tokens than prior
multi-module workflow methods that use larger foundation or fine-tuned models.
Furthermore, KG-R1 enables plug and play: after training, it maintains strong
accuracy on new KGs without modification. These properties make KG-R1 a
promising KG-RAG framework for real-world deployment. Our code is publicly
available at https://github.com/Jinyeop3110/KG-R1.

Motivation: 真实性评估语言话语与现实世界信息的关联程度，对事实核查至关重要。真实性是一个复杂概念，依赖多种语言信号，需要系统性的标注方案。

Method: 开发了一个结合多种先前工作的复杂多面标注方案，手动标注了近5000个议会话语领域的句子，并实验了多种自动预测方法来扩展标注规模。

Conclusion: 该标注方案虽然为希伯来语开发，但相信可以适应其他语言，为真实性评估提供了系统性的标注框架和扩展方法。

Abstract: Factuality assesses the extent to which a language utterance relates to
real-world information; it determines whether utterances correspond to facts,
possibilities, or imaginary situations, and as such, it is instrumental for
fact checking. Factuality is a complex notion that relies on multiple
linguistic signals, and has been studied in various disciplines.
  We present a complex, multi-faceted annotation scheme of factuality that
combines concepts from a variety of previous works. We developed the scheme for
Hebrew, but we trust that it can be adapted to other languages. We also present
a set of almost 5,000 sentences in the domain of parliamentary discourse that
we manually annotated according to this scheme. We report on inter-annotator
agreement, and experiment with various approaches to automatically predict
(some features of) the scheme, in order to extend the annotation to a large
corpus.

Result: 包含更多项目文本数据显著提升模型性能，效果超过单纯增加样本量。微调SLMs在细粒度技能对齐方面持续优于基于嵌入的监督学习模型。语义相似性分析显示某些SAT和PSAT技能语义过于接近，解释了误分类现象。

Conclusion: 微调的小型语言模型在自动化测试项目对齐方面具有显著优势，特别是在细粒度技能分类任务上。语义相似性分析为模型误分类提供了合理解释，支持了模型的可靠性。

Abstract: Aligning test items to content standards is a critical step in test
development to collect validity evidence based on content. Item alignment has
typically been conducted by human experts. This judgmental process can be
subjective and time-consuming. This study investigated the performance of
fine-tuned small language models (SLMs) for automated item alignment using data
from a large-scale standardized reading and writing test for college
admissions. Different SLMs were trained for alignment at both domain and skill
levels respectively with 10 skills mapped to 4 content domains. The model
performance was evaluated in multiple criteria on two testing datasets. The
impact of types and sizes of the input data for training was investigated.
Results showed that including more item text data led to substantially better
model performance, surpassing the improvements induced by sample size increase
alone. For comparison, supervised machine learning models were trained using
the embeddings from the multilingual-E5-large-instruct model. The study results
showed that fine-tuned SLMs consistently outperformed the embedding-based
supervised machine learning models, particularly for the more fine-grained
skill alignment. To better understand model misclassifications, multiple
semantic similarity analysis including pairwise cosine similarity,
Kullback-Leibler divergence of embedding distributions, and two-dimension
projections of item embeddings were conducted. These analyses consistently
showed that certain skills in SAT and PSAT were semantically too close,
providing evidence for the observed misclassification.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出PACO框架，通过自适应规划解决多属性可控摘要任务，使用蒙特卡洛树搜索优化属性控制顺序，无需训练即可实现多属性约束的满足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可控摘要方法存在属性间相互依赖导致约束难以一致满足的问题，且通常需要针对每个属性进行微调，限制了跨属性灵活性。

Method: 将多属性可控摘要重构为顺序属性控制的规划问题，使用定制化蒙特卡洛树搜索，节点代表摘要，动作对应单属性调整，逐步优化需要进一步控制的属性。

Result: 在多个领域和模型上的实验表明，PACO实现了鲁棒的多属性可控性，超越了基于LLM的自规划模型和微调基线。使用Llama-3.2-1B的PACO可与更大的Llama-3.3-70B基线相媲美。

Conclusion: PACO框架能够自适应发现最优控制顺序，有效满足所有约束条件，在更大模型上实现了优于所有竞争对手的控制性能。

Abstract: Controllable summarization moves beyond generic outputs toward human-aligned
summaries guided by specified attributes. In practice, the interdependence
among attributes makes it challenging for language models to satisfy correlated
constraints consistently. Moreover, previous approaches often require
per-attribute fine-tuning, limiting flexibility across diverse summary
attributes. In this paper, we propose adaptive planning for multi-attribute
controllable summarization (PACO), a training-free framework that reframes the
task as planning the order of sequential attribute control with a customized
Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). In PACO, nodes represent summaries, and actions
correspond to single-attribute adjustments, enabling progressive refinement of
only the attributes requiring further control. This strategy adaptively
discovers optimal control orders, ultimately producing summaries that
effectively meet all constraints. Extensive experiments across diverse domains
and models demonstrate that PACO achieves robust multi-attribute
controllability, surpassing both LLM-based self-planning models and fine-tuned
baselines. Remarkably, PACO with Llama-3.2-1B rivals the controllability of the
much larger Llama-3.3-70B baselines. With larger models, PACO achieves superior
control performance, outperforming all competitors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当代大语言模型在创意写作中的四个主要限制：类型多样性受限、输出长度不足、叙事连贯性弱、无法强制执行复杂结构构造。

Method: 采用基于知识图谱的故事原型作为叙事表示，通过三级代理工作流：初始化阶段构建用户指定的叙事骨架；生成阶段通过长短期目标指导多代理对话实例化故事原型；写作阶段利用原型生成具有高级结构的多类型文本。

Result: 在广泛实验中，CreAgentive以稳定质量和低成本（每100章节低于1美元）生成了数千章节。在包含10个叙事指标的双维度评估框架中，始终优于强基线，并在多样化类型中实现稳健性能，接近人类创作小说的质量。

Conclusion: CreAgentive通过故事原型和代理工作流架构有效解决了长文本生成的典型瓶颈，减少了存储冗余，在创意写作任务中展现出卓越的性能和成本效益。

Abstract: We present CreAgentive, an agent workflow driven multi-category creative
generation engine that addresses four key limitations of contemporary large
language models in writing stories, drama and other categories of creatives:
restricted genre diversity, insufficient output length, weak narrative
coherence, and inability to enforce complex structural constructs. At its core,
CreAgentive employs a Story Prototype, which is a genre-agnostic, knowledge
graph-based narrative representation that decouples story logic from stylistic
realization by encoding characters, events, and environments as semantic
triples. CreAgentive engages a three-stage agent workflow that comprises: an
Initialization Stage that constructs a user-specified narrative skeleton; a
Generation Stage in which long- and short-term objectives guide multi-agent
dialogues to instantiate the Story Prototype; a Writing Stage that leverages
this prototype to produce multi-genre text with advanced structures such as
retrospection and foreshadowing. This architecture reduces storage redundancy
and overcomes the typical bottlenecks of long-form generation. In extensive
experiments, CreAgentive generates thousands of chapters with stable quality
and low cost (less than $1 per 100 chapters) using a general-purpose backbone
model. To evaluate performance, we define a two-dimensional framework with 10
narrative indicators measuring both quality and length. Results show that
CreAgentive consistently outperforms strong baselines and achieves robust
performance across diverse genres, approaching the quality of human-authored
novels.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决代码到指标回归的挑战性问题，传统方法需要大量领域特定的特征工程，希望用一个统一模型同时处理多种编程语言和硬件平台的性能预测。

Method: 基于T5Gemma初始化构建300M参数的回归语言模型(RLM)，直接从代码文本进行端到端训练，支持多种编程语言和硬件平台的性能预测。

Result: 在APPS竞争编程提交上获得>0.9的Spearman秩相关系数；在CodeNet的17种语言上平均Spearman秩相关系数>0.5；在5个经典NAS设计空间上获得0.46的Kendall-Tau系数，优于图神经网络。

Conclusion: 回归语言模型能够有效统一处理多种代码性能预测任务，在多个基准测试中表现出色，证明了语言模型在代码分析任务中的强大能力。

Abstract: We study code-to-metric regression: predicting numeric outcomes of code
executions, a challenging task due to the open-ended nature of programming
languages. While prior methods have resorted to heavy and domain-specific
feature engineering, we show that a single unified Regression Language Model
(RLM) can simultaneously predict directly from text, (i) the memory footprint
of code across multiple high-level languages such as Python and C++, (ii) the
latency of Triton GPU kernels, and (iii) the accuracy and speed of trained
neural networks represented in ONNX. In particular, a relatively small 300M
parameter RLM initialized from T5Gemma, obtains > 0.9 Spearman-rank on
competitive programming submissions from APPS, and a single unified model
achieves > 0.5 average Spearman-rank across 17 separate languages from CodeNet.
Furthermore, the RLM can obtain the highest average Kendall-Tau of 0.46 on five
classic NAS design spaces previously dominated by graph neural networks, and
simultaneously predict architecture latencies on numerous hardware platforms.

Motivation: 现有的开源扩散大语言模型虽然具有并行标记预测的潜力，但仍需要接近标记长度的解码步骤来确保性能，其并行解码潜力未被充分探索。

Method: 提出确定性强制蒸馏训练策略，让模型在遵循原始采样轨迹的同时，强制其在掩码标记上更快地达到高确定性，实现并行解码。

Result: 在LLaDA-8B-Instruct模型上，dParallel将GSM8K的解码步骤从256减少到30，实现8.5倍加速；在MBPP基准测试中，从256减少到24，实现10.5倍加速，且性能无损失。

Conclusion: dParallel方法有效解锁了扩散大语言模型的并行解码能力，显著提升了推理速度，同时保持了模型性能。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) have recently drawn considerable
attention within the research community as a promising alternative to
autoregressive generation, offering parallel token prediction and lower
inference latency. Yet, their parallel decoding potential remains largely
underexplored, as existing open-source models still require nearly token-length
decoding steps to ensure performance. To address this, we introduce dParallel,
a simple and effective method that unlocks the inherent parallelism of dLLMs
for fast sampling. We identify that the key bottleneck to parallel decoding
arises from the sequential certainty convergence for masked tokens. Building on
this insight, we introduce the core of our approach: certainty-forcing
distillation, a novel training strategy that distills the model to follow its
original sampling trajectories while enforcing it to achieve high certainty on
masked tokens more rapidly and in parallel. Extensive experiments across
various benchmarks demonstrate that our method can dramatically reduce the
number of decoding steps while maintaining performance. When applied to the
LLaDA-8B-Instruct model, dParallel reduces decoding steps from 256 to 30 on
GSM8K, achieving an 8.5x speedup without performance degradation. On the MBPP
benchmark, it cuts decoding steps from 256 to 24, resulting in a 10.5x speedup
while maintaining accuracy. Our code is available at

Motivation: 现有基准测试无法捕捉LLM智能体处理海量信息、利用多样化资源和管理动态用户交互的复杂性，需要开发更贴近真实世界复杂性的评估标准。

Method: 基于日常应用场景构建复杂的生活服务模拟环境，通过消除领域特定策略实现场景和工具的灵活组合，提出基于评分的滑动窗口评估器来评估多样化解决方案路径。

Result: 最先进模型在跨场景任务中成功率仅为30%，在其他任务中成功率低于50%，表明当前智能体在复杂真实世界应用中表现有限。

Conclusion: VitaBench将为推动AI智能体在实际应用中的发展提供宝贵资源，揭示了现有模型在复杂交互任务中的局限性。

Abstract: As LLM-based agents are increasingly deployed in real-life scenarios,
existing benchmarks fail to capture their inherent complexity of handling
extensive information, leveraging diverse resources, and managing dynamic user
interactions. To address this gap, we introduce VitaBench, a challenging
benchmark that evaluates agents on versatile interactive tasks grounded in
real-world settings. Drawing from daily applications in food delivery, in-store
consumption, and online travel services, VitaBench presents agents with the
most complex life-serving simulation environment to date, comprising 66 tools.
Through a framework that eliminates domain-specific policies, we enable
flexible composition of these scenarios and tools, yielding 100 cross-scenario
tasks (main results) and 300 single-scenario tasks. Each task is derived from
multiple real user requests and requires agents to reason across temporal and
spatial dimensions, utilize complex tool sets, proactively clarify ambiguous
instructions, and track shifting user intent throughout multi-turn
conversations. Moreover, we propose a rubric-based sliding window evaluator,
enabling robust assessment of diverse solution pathways in complex environments
and stochastic interactions. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals that even the
most advanced models achieve only 30% success rate on cross-scenario tasks, and
less than 50% success rate on others. Overall, we believe VitaBench will serve
as a valuable resource for advancing the development of AI agents in practical
real-world applications. The code, dataset, and leaderboard are available at

Motivation: 现有方法未能充分利用LLM的语言智能和指令跟随能力，限制了可控TTS的发展。

Result: 在可控和情感语音合成方面表现优异，超越了开源和闭源基线，实现了显著的零样本跨语言泛化。

Conclusion: 将语音对象化为文本声学特征能更有效地释放LLM的语言智能。

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) is reshaping multimodel models, with
speech synthesis being a prominent application. However, existing approaches
often underutilize the linguistic intelligence of these models, typically
failing to leverage their powerful instruction-following capabilities. This
limitation hinders the model's ability to follow text instructions for
controllable Text-to-Speech~(TTS). To address this, we propose a new paradigm
inspired by ``operationalism'' that decouples instruction understanding from
speech generation. We introduce BatonVoice, a framework where an LLM acts as a
``conductor'', understanding user instructions and generating a textual
``plan'' -- explicit vocal features (e.g., pitch, energy). A separate TTS
model, the ``orchestra'', then generates the speech from these features. To
realize this component, we develop BatonTTS, a TTS model trained specifically
for this task. Our experiments demonstrate that BatonVoice achieves strong
performance in controllable and emotional speech synthesis, outperforming
strong open- and closed-source baselines. Notably, our approach enables
remarkable zero-shot cross-lingual generalization, accurately applying feature
control abilities to languages unseen during post-training. This demonstrates
that objectifying speech into textual vocal features can more effectively
unlock the linguistic intelligence of LLMs.

TL;DR: 提出Matryoshka MoE训练框架，通过在训练时系统性地改变激活专家数量，使MoE模型能够在推理时弹性调整计算资源而不会显著降低性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准Top-K路由器的训练策略限制了MoE模型在弹性推理方面的潜力，当推理时改变激活专家数量会导致性能急剧下降。

Method: 引入Matryoshka MoE训练框架，通过层间随机化策略在训练时变化激活专家数量，强制模型学习从粗到细的专家排名结构。

Result: 单个M-MoE模型实现了显著的弹性，在不同专家数量下的性能接近整个专家模型套件，但训练成本仅为后者的很小一部分。

Conclusion: M-MoE为大规模MoE模型的实际部署提供了更实用和适应性强的解决方案，解锁了弹性推理能力。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a promising paradigm for efficiently
scaling large language models without a proportional increase in computational
cost. However, the standard training strategy of Top-K router prevents MoE
models from realizing their full potential for elastic inference. When the
number of activated experts is altered at inference time, these models exhibit
precipitous performance degradation. In this work, we introduce Matryoshka MoE
(M-MoE), a training framework that instills a coarse-to-fine structure directly
into the expert ensemble. By systematically varying the number of activated
experts during training, M-MoE compels the model to learn a meaningful ranking:
top-ranked experts collaborate to provide essential, coarse-grained
capabilities, while subsequent experts add progressively finer-grained detail.
We explore this principle at multiple granularities, identifying a layer-wise
randomization strategy as the most effective. Our experiments demonstrate that
a single M-MoE model achieves remarkable elasticity, with its performance at
various expert counts closely matching that of an entire suite of specialist
models, but at only a fraction of the total training cost. This flexibility not
only unlocks elastic inference but also enables optimizing performance by
allocating different computational budgets to different model layers. Our work
paves the way for more practical and adaptable deployments of large-scale MoE
models.

TL;DR: OceanGym是首个面向海洋水下具身智能体的综合基准平台，旨在推动AI在极端水下环境中的发展。该平台包含8个真实任务领域和基于多模态大语言模型的统一智能体框架，解决水下低能见度、洋流等挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下环境具有极端的感知和决策挑战（如低能见度、动态洋流），使得智能体部署异常困难。现有AI系统在海洋水下环境中的表现远未达到实用水平，需要专门的基准平台来推动相关技术发展。

Method: 构建包含8个真实任务领域的综合基准，采用基于多模态大语言模型的统一智能体框架，整合感知、记忆和序列决策能力。智能体需要理解光学和声纳数据，在复杂环境中自主探索，完成长期目标。

Result: 广泛实验显示，当前最先进的多模态大语言模型驱动智能体与人类专家之间存在显著差距，特别是在感知、规划和适应性方面。这凸显了海洋水下环境的持续挑战。

Conclusion: OceanGym通过提供高保真、严谨设计的平台，为开发鲁棒具身AI和将这些能力转移到真实自主水下航行器建立了测试平台，标志着向能够在地球最后未探索领域之一操作的智能体迈出了决定性一步。

Abstract: We introduce OceanGym, the first comprehensive benchmark for ocean underwater
embodied agents, designed to advance AI in one of the most demanding real-world
environments. Unlike terrestrial or aerial domains, underwater settings present
extreme perceptual and decision-making challenges, including low visibility,
dynamic ocean currents, making effective agent deployment exceptionally
difficult. OceanGym encompasses eight realistic task domains and a unified
agent framework driven by Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which
integrates perception, memory, and sequential decision-making. Agents are
required to comprehend optical and sonar data, autonomously explore complex
environments, and accomplish long-horizon objectives under these harsh
conditions. Extensive experiments reveal substantial gaps between
state-of-the-art MLLM-driven agents and human experts, highlighting the
persistent difficulty of perception, planning, and adaptability in ocean
underwater environments. By providing a high-fidelity, rigorously designed
platform, OceanGym establishes a testbed for developing robust embodied AI and
transferring these capabilities to real-world autonomous ocean underwater
vehicles, marking a decisive step toward intelligent agents capable of
operating in one of Earth's last unexplored frontiers. The code and data are
available at https://github.com/OceanGPT/OceanGym.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了首个为语音转文本生成模型获取对比性解释的方法，通过分析输入频谱图各部分如何影响替代输出选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对比性解释在可解释AI中被认为比标准解释更具信息性和可解释性，但在语音转文本生成模型中获取此类解释仍是一个开放挑战。

Method: 基于特征归因技术，通过分析输入频谱图各部分如何影响替代输出选择来获得对比性解释。

Result: 在语音翻译中性别分配案例研究中，该方法能准确识别驱动选择某一性别而非另一性别的音频特征。

Conclusion: 通过将对比性解释范围扩展到语音转文本模型，为更好理解语音转文本模型奠定了基础。

Abstract: Contrastive explanations, which indicate why an AI system produced one output
(the target) instead of another (the foil), are widely regarded in explainable
AI as more informative and interpretable than standard explanations. However,
obtaining such explanations for speech-to-text (S2T) generative models remains
an open challenge. Drawing from feature attribution techniques, we propose the
first method to obtain contrastive explanations in S2T by analyzing how parts
of the input spectrogram influence the choice between alternative outputs.
Through a case study on gender assignment in speech translation, we show that
our method accurately identifies the audio features that drive the selection of
one gender over another. By extending the scope of contrastive explanations to
S2T, our work provides a foundation for better understanding S2T models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FuncBenchGen是一个用于评估工具增强语言模型的合成基准框架，通过生成多步骤工具使用任务来测试模型的能力，避免了数据污染问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具增强语言模型基准在控制任务复杂度、函数数量等因素方面不足，且易受数据污染影响，需要更可控的评估方法。

Method: 将工具使用建模为在隐藏函数依赖DAG上的遍历，节点是函数调用，边表示函数间的输出依赖关系。用户可以精确控制任务难度参数。

Result: 在七个LLM上的评估显示，推理优化模型表现更好，GPT-5显著优于其他模型。随着依赖深度增加，性能急剧下降，连接的不相关函数尤其难以处理。

Conclusion: LLM在多轮工具使用中存在脆弱的状态跟踪问题，通过显式重述先前变量值的简单缓解策略可以显著提高性能。

Abstract: As language models gain access to external tools via structured function
calls, they become increasingly more capable of solving complex, multi-step
tasks. However, existing benchmarks for tool-augmented language models (TaLMs)
provide insufficient control over factors such as the number of functions
accessible, task complexity, and input size, and remain vulnerable to data
contamination. We present FuncBenchGen, a unified, contamination-free framework
that evaluates TaLMs by generating synthetic multi-step tool-use tasks. The key
idea is to cast tool use as traversal over a hidden function-dependency DAG
where nodes are function calls and an edge between nodes represents one
function consuming the output of another. Given a set of external function
schemas, initial variable values, and a target variable, models must compose
the correct call sequence to compute the target variable. FuncBenchGen allows
users to precisely control task difficulty (e.g., graph size, dependency depth,
and distractor functions) while avoiding data leakage. We apply our
FuncBenchGen framework to evaluate seven LLMs on tool use tasks of varying
difficulty. Reasoning-optimized models consistently outperform general-purpose
models with GPT-5 significantly outperforming other models. Performance
declines sharply as dependency depth increases. Furthermore, connected
irrelevant functions prove especially difficult to handle. We find that strong
models often make syntactically valid function calls but propagate incorrect or
stale argument values across steps, revealing brittle state tracking by LLMs in
multi-turn tool use. Motivated by this observation, we introduce a simple
mitigation strategy that explicitly restates prior variable values to the agent
at each step. Surprisingly, this lightweight change yields substantial gains
across models. e.g., yielding a success rate improvement from 62.5% to 81.3%
for GPT-5.

TL;DR: MT-breaker是一种使用大语言模型迭代优化源文本来增加翻译难度的方法，通过查询目标机器翻译模型来生成更具挑战性的测试用例。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的机器翻译基准测试很快过时，因为大多数例子对最先进的翻译模型来说太容易，限制了基准测试区分模型优劣和揭示弱点的能力。

Method: 使用大语言模型迭代优化源文本，通过查询目标机器翻译模型来指导生成困难示例，保持自然文本的多样性。

Result: 该方法生成的示例对目标MT模型更具挑战性，同时难度也能迁移到其他模型和语言。

Conclusion: MT-breaker能够有效生成多样化的困难测试用例，有助于更好地评估机器翻译模型的性能。

Abstract: Machine translation benchmarks sourced from the real world are quickly
obsoleted, due to most examples being easy for state-of-the-art translation
models. This limits the benchmark's ability to distinguish which model is
better or to reveal models' weaknesses. Current methods for creating difficult
test cases, such as subsampling or from-scratch synthesis, either fall short of
identifying difficult examples or suffer from a lack of diversity and
naturalness. Inspired by the iterative process of human experts probing for
model failures, we propose MT-breaker, a method where a large language model
iteratively refines a source text to increase its translation difficulty. The
LLM iteratively queries a target machine translation model to guide its
generation of difficult examples. Our approach generates examples that are more
challenging for the target MT model while preserving the diversity of natural
texts. While the examples are tailored to a particular machine translation
model during the generation, the difficulty also transfers to other models and
languages.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM生成的基准测试存在自我偏见，会偏向生成该基准的模型本身，特别是在低资源语言的翻译任务中。这种偏见来自测试数据生成和评估方法两方面，且与模型在源语言中的生成能力密切相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型逐渐饱和现有基准测试，使用LLM自动创建基准测试成为替代人工标注的可扩展方案。但需要验证这些生成测试集的公平性和可靠性。

Method: 通过分析LLM作为基准测试在翻译任务中的表现，研究自我偏见的来源、影响因素和缓解方法。重点关注低资源语言到英语的翻译任务。

Result: 发现LLM生成的基准测试存在系统性自我偏见：1)偏见来自测试数据生成和评估方法两方面；2)偏见程度与模型在源语言中的生成能力相关；3)源文本多样性不足是导致偏见的原因之一。

Conclusion: LLM自动生成的基准测试存在严重的自我偏见问题，改进生成源文本的多样性可以部分缓解这种偏见，但需要谨慎使用此类自动基准测试方法。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) begin to saturate existing benchmarks,
automated benchmark creation using LLMs (LLM as a benchmark) has emerged as a
scalable alternative to slow and costly human curation. While these generated
test sets have to potential to cheaply rank models, we demonstrate a critical
flaw. LLM generated benchmarks systematically favor the model that created the
benchmark, they exhibit self bias on low resource languages to English
translation tasks. We show three key findings on automatic benchmarking of LLMs
for translation: First, this bias originates from two sources: the generated
test data (LLM as a testset) and the evaluation method (LLM as an evaluator),
with their combination amplifying the effect. Second, self bias in LLM as a
benchmark is heavily influenced by the model's generation capabilities in the
source language. For instance, we observe more pronounced bias in into English
translation, where the model's generation system is developed, than in out of
English translation tasks. Third, we observe that low diversity in source text
is one attribution to self bias. Our results suggest that improving the
diversity of these generated source texts can mitigate some of the observed
self bias.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MENLO框架通过受众设计机制评估LLM的多语言响应质量，创建了包含6423个人工标注偏好对的数据集，在47种语言中评估4个质量维度。研究发现零样本LLM评估器受益于成对评估和结构化标注标准，但仍不如人工标注。通过强化学习微调等方法可显著改进评估器性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确保大语言模型在多语言环境中生成类母语质量的响应具有挑战性，需要开发有效的评估框架来操作化评估过程。

Method: 引入MENLO框架，基于受众设计机制评估响应质量；创建人工标注数据集；使用成对评估、结构化标注标准；采用强化学习微调、奖励塑造和多任务学习等方法改进评估器。

Result: 零样本LLM评估器在成对评估和结构化标注标准下表现改善，但仍落后于人工标注；通过强化学习微调等方法可显著提升评估器性能；RL训练的评估器可作为生成奖励模型提升LLM多语言能力，但与人类判断仍存在差异。

Conclusion: MENLO为可扩展的多语言评估和偏好对齐提供了有前景的方向，发布了数据集和评估框架以支持进一步研究。

Abstract: Ensuring native-like quality of large language model (LLM) responses across
many languages is challenging. To address this, we introduce MENLO, a framework
that operationalizes the evaluation of native-like response quality based on
audience design-inspired mechanisms. Using MENLO, we create a dataset of 6,423
human-annotated prompt-response preference pairs covering four quality
dimensions with high inter-annotator agreement in 47 language varieties. Our
evaluation reveals that zero-shot LLM judges benefit significantly from
pairwise evaluation and our structured annotation rubrics, yet they still
underperform human annotators on our dataset. We demonstrate substantial
improvements through fine-tuning with reinforcement learning, reward shaping,
and multi-task learning approaches. Additionally, we show that RL-trained
judges can serve as generative reward models to enhance LLMs' multilingual
proficiency, though discrepancies with human judgment remain. Our findings
suggest promising directions for scalable multilingual evaluation and
preference alignment. We release our dataset and evaluation framework to
support further research in multilingual LLM evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有AI科学家系统缺乏针对人类紧迫挑战的科学价值贡献的问题，实现目标导向的长期自主科学发现。

Method: 将科学发现形式化为贝叶斯优化问题，采用"假设-验证-分析"的分层评估流程，利用累积发现记忆智能平衡探索与利用。

Result: 消耗超过20,000 GPU小时，生成约5,000个独特科学想法，实验验证约1,100个，在三个前沿AI任务上分别超越人类SOTA方法183.7%、1.9%和7.9%。

Conclusion: 这是首个大规模证据表明AI能够在科学任务上实现超越人类最先进水平的发现，真正推动科学发现前沿，所有实验日志和系统代码将开源。

Abstract: While previous AI Scientist systems can generate novel findings, they often
lack the focus to produce scientifically valuable contributions that address
pressing human-defined challenges. We introduce DeepScientist, a system
designed to overcome this by conducting goal-oriented, fully autonomous
scientific discovery over month-long timelines. It formalizes discovery as a
Bayesian Optimization problem, operationalized through a hierarchical
evaluation process consisting of "hypothesize, verify, and analyze". Leveraging
a cumulative Findings Memory, this loop intelligently balances the exploration
of novel hypotheses with exploitation, selectively promoting the most promising
findings to higher-fidelity levels of validation. Consuming over 20,000 GPU
hours, the system generated about 5,000 unique scientific ideas and
experimentally validated approximately 1100 of them, ultimately surpassing
human-designed state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on three frontier AI tasks by
183.7\%, 1.9\%, and 7.9\%. This work provides the first large-scale evidence of
an AI achieving discoveries that progressively surpass human SOTA on scientific
tasks, producing valuable findings that genuinely push the frontier of
scientific discovery. To facilitate further research into this process, we will
open-source all experimental logs and system code at
https://github.com/ResearAI/DeepScientist/.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出将寻找最具挑战性NLP测试数据的问题形式化为多臂老虎机问题，通过高效的采样策略在有限计算预算内识别最困难的主题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NLP模型需要足够挑战性的测试数据，但直接从海量互联网主题中寻找最困难主题的计算成本过高，因为主题与实例难度之间存在随机性关系。

Method: 将每个主题视为老虎机的"臂"，通过拉动臂（采样实例）来评估难度，使用多臂老虎机策略在固定计算预算内高效识别最困难主题。

Result: 在机器翻译任务中，各种老虎机策略显著优于暴力搜索等基线方法，能够更高效地找到最具挑战性的主题。

Conclusion: 多臂老虎机框架为寻找挑战性NLP测试数据提供了一种计算效率高的解决方案，能够在大规模主题空间中有效识别最困难的主题。

Abstract: NLP models require test data that are sufficiently challenging. The
difficulty of an example is linked to the topic it originates from (''seed
topic''). The relationship between the topic and the difficulty of its
instances is stochastic in nature: an example about a difficult topic can
happen to be easy, and vice versa. At the scale of the Internet, there are tens
of thousands of potential topics, and finding the most difficult one by drawing
and evaluating a large number of examples across all topics is computationally
infeasible. We formalize this task and treat it as a multi-armed bandit
problem. In this framework, each topic is an ''arm,'' and pulling an arm (at a
cost) involves drawing a single example, evaluating it, and measuring its
difficulty. The goal is to efficiently identify the most difficult topics
within a fixed computational budget. We illustrate the bandit problem setup of
finding difficult examples for the task of machine translation. We find that
various bandit strategies vastly outperform baseline methods like brute-force
searching the most challenging topics.

TL;DR: 该论文系统研究了音节级语音标记化在口语语言建模中的应用，相比传统高帧率标记，音节标记在保持性能的同时显著降低了训练和推理成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统口语语言模型使用高帧率的语音标记，导致Transformer自注意力计算成本高昂。音节级标记化提供了更可解释且具有显著压缩优势的标记方案，但其在口语语言建模中的价值尚未充分探索。

Method: 对音节级语音标记化进行系统性研究，在不同训练数据规模下评估模型在一系列口语理解基准测试上的表现，比较音节标记与传统高帧率标记的性能和效率。

Result: 音节标记能够匹配甚至超越传统高帧率标记的性能，同时显著降低训练和推理成本：训练时间减少2倍以上，FLOPs减少5倍。

Conclusion: 音节级语言建模是实现高效长上下文口语语言模型的有前景路径。

Abstract: Spoken language models (SLMs) typically discretize speech into
high-frame-rate tokens extracted from SSL speech models. As the most successful
LMs are based on the Transformer architecture, processing these long token
streams with self-attention is expensive, as attention scales quadratically
with sequence length. A recent SSL work introduces acoustic tokenization of
speech at the syllable level, which is more interpretable and potentially more
scalable with significant compression in token lengths (4-5 Hz). Yet, their
value for spoken language modeling is not yet fully explored. We present the
first systematic study of syllabic tokenization for spoken language modeling,
evaluating models on a suite of SLU benchmarks while varying training data
scale. Syllabic tokens can match or surpass the previous high-frame rate tokens
while significantly cutting training and inference costs, achieving more than a
2x reduction in training time and a 5x reduction in FLOPs. Our findings
highlight syllable-level language modeling as a promising path to efficient
long-context spoken language models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了不同随机种子下训练的语言模型的收敛性，发现了一个四阶段收敛模式，并揭示了模型大小和训练阶段对收敛的影响，以及不同语言类别收敛速度的差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究语言模型在不同随机种子训练下的收敛特性，了解模型训练过程中分布稳定性的影响因素。

Method: 通过计算不同随机种子下每token的KL散度期望值来测量收敛性，分析模型大小、训练检查点、token频率和词性标签对收敛的影响。

Result: 识别出四阶段收敛模式：初始均匀阶段、急剧收敛阶段、急剧发散阶段和缓慢再收敛阶段；发现大模型在后期训练阶段再收敛更快，小模型无法真正再收敛；高频token和功能词比低频token和实词收敛更快更可靠。

Conclusion: 模型大小是学习稳定分布的必要条件，收敛在不同语言类别中不均匀，研究结果揭示了影响模型训练中学习分布稳定性的关键因素。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the convergence of language models (LMs)
trained under different random seeds, measuring convergence as the expected
per-token Kullback--Leibler (KL) divergence across seeds. By comparing LM
convergence as a function of model size and training checkpoint, we identify a
four-phase convergence pattern: (i) an initial uniform phase, (ii) a
sharp-convergence phase, (iii) a sharp-divergence phase, and (iv) a
slow-reconvergence phase. Further, we observe that larger models reconverge
faster in later training stages, while smaller models never actually
reconverge; these results suggest that a certain model size may be necessary to
learn stable distributions. Restricting our analysis to specific token
frequencies or part-of-speech (PoS) tags further reveals that convergence is
uneven across linguistic categories: frequent tokens and function words
converge faster and more reliably than their counterparts (infrequent tokens
and content words). Overall, our findings highlight factors that influence the
stability of the learned distributions in model training.

Motivation: 现有KGQA基准存在严重质量问题，包括不准确的标注、模糊的问题和过时的知识，手动审计发现平均事实正确率仅为57%。

Method: KGQAGen结合结构化知识基础、LLM引导生成和符号验证，系统性地生成具有挑战性的QA实例。

Result: 构建了KGQAGen-10k基准，实验表明即使是SOTA系统在该基准上也表现不佳，突显了其暴露现有模型局限性的能力。

Conclusion: KGQAGen为KGQA评估提供了一个可扩展的框架，倡导更严格的基准构建方法。

Abstract: Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) systems rely on high-quality
benchmarks to evaluate complex multi-hop reasoning. However, despite their
widespread use, popular datasets such as WebQSP and CWQ suffer from critical
quality issues, including inaccurate or incomplete ground-truth annotations,
poorly constructed questions that are ambiguous, trivial, or unanswerable, and
outdated or inconsistent knowledge. Through a manual audit of 16 popular KGQA
datasets, including WebQSP and CWQ, we find that the average factual
correctness rate is only 57 %. To address these issues, we introduce KGQAGen,
an LLM-in-the-loop framework that systematically resolves these pitfalls.
KGQAGen combines structured knowledge grounding, LLM-guided generation, and
symbolic verification to produce challenging and verifiable QA instances. Using
KGQAGen, we construct KGQAGen-10k, a ten-thousand scale benchmark grounded in
Wikidata, and evaluate a diverse set of KG-RAG models. Experimental results
demonstrate that even state-of-the-art systems struggle on this benchmark,
highlighting its ability to expose limitations of existing models. Our findings
advocate for more rigorous benchmark construction and position KGQAGen as a
scalable framework for advancing KGQA evaluation.

TL;DR: Blueprint-Bench是一个评估AI模型空间推理能力的基准测试，通过将公寓照片转换为2D平面图来测试模型的空间重建能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态模型虽然能处理照片输入，但在需要真正空间智能的任务（如推断房间布局、理解连通性、保持比例一致性）上存在明显能力盲区。

Method: 评估了领先的语言模型、图像生成模型和代理系统在50个公寓数据集上的表现，使用基于房间连通性图和尺寸排名的相似度评分算法。

Result: 大多数模型表现接近或低于随机基线，人类表现显著优于AI；图像生成模型在指令遵循方面特别困难，基于代理的迭代优化方法没有明显改进。

Conclusion: Blueprint-Bench为比较不同模型架构的空间智能提供了首个数值框架，揭示了当前AI在空间推理能力上的重大不足。

Abstract: We introduce Blueprint-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate spatial
reasoning capabilities in AI models through the task of converting apartment
photographs into accurate 2D floor plans. While the input modality
(photographs) is well within the training distribution of modern multimodal
models, the task of spatial reconstruction requires genuine spatial
intelligence: inferring room layouts, understanding connectivity, and
maintaining consistent scale. We evaluate leading language models (GPT-5,
Claude 4 Opus, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Grok-4), image generation models (GPT-Image,
NanoBanana), and agent systems (Codex CLI, Claude Code) on a dataset of 50
apartments with approximately 20 interior images each. Our scoring algorithm
measures similarity between generated and ground-truth floor plans based on
room connectivity graphs and size rankings. Results reveal a significant blind
spot in current AI capabilities: most models perform at or below a random
baseline, while human performance remains substantially superior. Image
generation models particularly struggle with instruction following, while
agent-based approaches with iterative refinement capabilities show no
meaningful improvement over single-pass generation. Blueprint-Bench provides
the first numerical framework for comparing spatial intelligence across
different model architectures. We will continue evaluating new models as they
are released and welcome community submissions, monitoring for the emergence of
spatial intelligence in generalist AI systems.

Motivation: 旨在通过结构因果模型提升人工智能的可解释性、可信性和鲁棒性，构建因果知识的网络层结构。

Method: 提出CAN框架，其中SCM为高斯模型，限制映射是线性因果抽象的转置，并开发了SPECTRAL迭代方法进行学习，该方法具有闭式更新且适用于正定和半正定协方差矩阵。

Result: 在合成数据上的实验表明，该方法在因果抽象学习任务中具有竞争力，并能成功恢复多样化的CAN结构。

Conclusion: CAN框架为因果AI提供了理论基础，提出的学习算法能有效学习一致的因果抽象网络。

Abstract: Causal artificial intelligence aims to enhance explainability,
trustworthiness, and robustness in AI by leveraging structural causal models
(SCMs). In this pursuit, recent advances formalize network sheaves of causal
knowledge. Pushing in the same direction, we introduce the causal abstraction
network (CAN), a specific instance of such sheaves where (i) SCMs are Gaussian,
(ii) restriction maps are transposes of constructive linear causal abstractions
(CAs), and (iii) edge stalks correspond -- up to rotation -- to the node stalks
of more detailed SCMs. We investigate the theoretical properties of CAN,
including algebraic invariants, cohomology, consistency, global sections
characterized via the Laplacian kernel, and smoothness. We then tackle the
learning of consistent CANs. Our problem formulation separates into
edge-specific local Riemannian problems and avoids nonconvex, costly
objectives. We propose an efficient search procedure as a solution, solving the
local problems with SPECTRAL, our iterative method with closed-form updates and
suitable for positive definite and semidefinite covariance matrices.
Experiments on synthetic data show competitive performance in the CA learning
task, and successful recovery of diverse CAN structures.

Motivation: 解决企业场景中Text-to-SQL系统需要专门针对单一数据库模式进行优化，并能自主评估系统性能的需求。

Method: 采用分层分区数据库模式、多复杂度SQL查询合成、质量感知流水线（包括LLM验证、可执行性检查、自动修复和列平衡）的两阶段框架。

Result: SingSQL-LM-3B-R64在BIRD基准测试子集上达到82.87% Soft F1和73.03% EX上限，优于最佳3B基线+16.21 Soft F1和+12.36 EX。在合成评估集上表现远超先前系统。

Conclusion: SING-SQL为构建和评估企业级Text-to-SQL系统提供了一个可扩展、数据库无关的范式。

Abstract: Translating natural language questions into SQL has become a core challenge
in enabling non-technical users to query databases. While recent work has
explored large-scale synthetic data generation to improve model performance
through post-training, most efforts emphasize cross-domain generalization. This
leaves a gap for real-world enterprise scenarios, where models need to
specialize to a single database schema and organizations require to be able to
evaluate their Text-to-SQL systems on their own databases. To address this, we
introduce SING-SQL, a fully automated two-stage framework for generating
high-quality, high-coverage synthetic Text-to-SQL data for any target database,
without relying on SQL logs or manual annotations. Our approach hierarchically
partitions a database schema into sub-schemas, synthesizes SQL queries across
multiple complexity levels, and applies a quality-aware pipeline that includes
LLM-as-a-judge validation, executability checks, automatic repair, and column
balancing. We further release SingSQL-LM, a family of compact language models
fine-tuned on the synthetic data, achieving strong in-domain generalization. On
the subset of the BIRD benchmark, SingSQL-LM-3B-R64 reaches 82.87% Soft F1 and
73.03% EX upper bound with 32 candidates, outperforming the best 3B-scale
baseline by +16.21 in Soft F1 and +12.36 in EX. At the 1.5B scale,
SingSQL-LM-1.5B-R64 improves over prior systems by +9.30 in Soft F1 and +4.49
in EX. On synthetic evaluation sets, SingSQL-LMs exceed prior systems by wide
margins, establishing state-of-the-art performance among open models at
comparable scales. Our study of context management strategies reveals that
schema-free fine-tuning combined with schema-only inference provides the most
robust results. These findings establish SING-SQL as a scalable,
database-agnostic paradigm for producing and evaluating enterprise-grade
Text-to-SQL systems.

### [228] [A Formal Comparison Between Chain-of-Thought and Latent Thought](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25239)
*Kevin Xu,Issei Sato*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文比较了Chain-of-Thought和Latent Thought两种推理方法的计算特性，发现Latent Thought支持并行计算更高效，而CoT通过随机解码处理难解问题，为选择推理范式提供指导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然Chain-of-Thought和Latent Thought都利用迭代计算，但它们的比较能力尚未充分探索，需要系统分析两种方法的计算特性和适用场景。

Method: 通过形式化分析比较两种方法：Latent Thought在循环变换器中实现并行计算，而CoT采用离散自然语言步骤的序列推理过程。

Result: 分析表明Latent Thought支持并行计算更高效，CoT通过随机解码近似解决难解问题，两种方法在不同任务中各有优势。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了深度驱动递归和序列推理的适用任务分离，为选择合适推理范式提供了实践指导。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) elicits reasoning in large language models by
explicitly generating intermediate steps in natural language. In contrast,
Latent Thought in looped models operates directly in the continuous latent
space, enabling computation beyond discrete linguistic representations. While
both approaches exploit iterative computation, their comparative capabilities
remain underexplored. In this work, we present a formal analysis showing that
Latent Thought in Looped Transformers enables parallel computation, which is
more efficient than the inherently sequential process of CoT. In contrast, CoT
leverages stochastic decoding to approximate solutions to problems where exact
computation is intractable. These separations suggest the tasks for which
depth-driven recursion is more suitable, thereby offering practical guidance
for choosing between reasoning paradigms. Code is available at

TL;DR: NGT结合向量聚类与多智能体系统，解决了定性研究的规模深度悖论，能在几小时内分析海量数据同时保持解释严谨性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决定性研究中规模与深度的矛盾，传统方法处理大规模数据耗时耗力，而自动化方法又缺乏解释深度。

Method: 使用1536维嵌入向量、层次聚类和并行智能体编码，对比了纯自动化和人机协作两种模式。

Result: NGT实现了168倍速度提升(3小时vs3周)、更高质量(0.904vs0.883)和96%成本降低。人机协作发现了手动编码无法识别的模式。

Conclusion: 计算客观性与人类解释力互补，向量表示提供可复现的语义测量，研究者从机械编码转向理论指导，AI处理模式识别，人类提供创造性洞见。

Abstract: Purpose: Neo Grounded Theory (NGT) integrates vector clustering with multi
agent systems to resolve qualitative research's scale depth paradox, enabling
analysis of massive datasets in hours while preserving interpretive rigor.
Methods: We compared NGT against manual coding and ChatGPT-assisted analysis
using 40,000 character Chinese interview transcripts. NGT employs
1536-dimensional embeddings, hierarchical clustering, and parallel agent-based
coding. Two experiments tested pure automation versus human guided refinement.
Findings: NGT achieved 168-fold speed improvement (3 hours vs 3 weeks),
superior quality (0.904 vs 0.883), and 96% cost reduction. Human AI
collaboration proved essential: automation alone produced abstract frameworks
while human guidance yielded actionable dual pathway theories. The system
discovered patterns invisible to manual coding, including identity bifurcation
phenomena. Contributions: NGT demonstrates computational objectivity and human
interpretation are complementary. Vector representations provide reproducible
semantic measurement while preserving meaning's interpretive dimensions.
Researchers shift from mechanical coding to theoretical guidance, with AI
handling pattern recognition while humans provide creative insight.
Implications: Cost reduction from \$50,000 to \$500 democratizes qualitative
research, enabling communities to study themselves. Real-time analysis makes
qualitative insights contemporaneous with events. The framework shows
computational methods can strengthen rather than compromise qualitative
research's humanistic commitments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LCNC平台中的AI代理在执行长期业务流程时面临记忆膨胀和上下文退化问题，导致行为不一致、错误累积和计算成本增加。

Method: 设计混合记忆架构，结合情景记忆和语义记忆，采用智能衰减机制基于时效性、相关性和用户指定效用对记忆进行修剪或整合，并提供用户友好的可视化界面。

Result: 通过模拟长期任务实验，该系统在任务完成率、上下文一致性和长期令牌成本效率方面显著优于传统方法如滑动窗口和基础RAG。

Conclusion: 建立了一个新的框架，用于构建可靠、透明的AI代理，能够进行有效的长期学习和适应。

Abstract: The rise of AI-native Low-Code/No-Code (LCNC) platforms enables autonomous
agents capable of executing complex, long-duration business processes. However,
a fundamental challenge remains: memory management. As agents operate over
extended periods, they face "memory inflation" and "contextual degradation"
issues, leading to inconsistent behavior, error accumulation, and increased
computational cost. This paper proposes a novel hybrid memory system designed
specifically for LCNC agents. Inspired by cognitive science, our architecture
combines episodic and semantic memory components with a proactive "Intelligent
Decay" mechanism. This mechanism intelligently prunes or consolidates memories
based on a composite score factoring in recency, relevance, and user-specified
utility. A key innovation is a user-centric visualization interface, aligned
with the LCNC paradigm, which allows non-technical users to manage the agent's
memory directly, for instance, by visually tagging which facts should be
retained or forgotten. Through simulated long-running task experiments, we
demonstrate that our system significantly outperforms traditional approaches
like sliding windows and basic RAG, yielding superior task completion rates,
contextual consistency, and long-term token cost efficiency. Our findings
establish a new framework for building reliable, transparent AI agents capable
of effective long-term learning and adaptation.

*Aayush Gupta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Fact Grounded Attention (FGA) 通过在注意力机制中注入可验证知识，将不可靠的语言模型转变为确定性真相讲述者，从根本上消除幻觉问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型受限于其概率本质，会自信地产生幻觉事实。现有方法要么在生成后修补幻觉，要么前置检索文本，但都无法从根本上解决问题

Method: FGA在transformer的数学核心——预softmax注意力分数层面进行干预，当知识库中存在事实时，模型无法产生幻觉

Result: 在1107个技术查询实验中，准确率从Llama 3.2的6.3%提升到FGA的99.7%。知识更新在1秒内完成，无需重新训练

Conclusion: FGA不仅减少幻觉，而是完全消除可验证事实的幻觉，标志着从概率近似到确定性精度的根本转变

Abstract: "The greatest enemy of knowledge is not ignorance, it is the illusion of
knowledge." Large Language Models have conquered natural language but remain
prisoners of their own probabilistic nature--confidently hallucinating facts
they never truly knew. We present Fact Grounded Attention (FGA), a novel
architectural modification that transforms unreliable language models into
deterministic truth tellers by injecting verifiable knowledge directly into the
attention mechanism. Unlike existing approaches that patch hallucinations after
generation or prepend retrieved text, FGA intervenes at the mathematical heart
of the transformer--the pre-softmax attention scores--creating a model that
cannot hallucinate when facts exist in its knowledge base. Our experiments
across 1,107 technical queries spanning smartphones, laptops, and electric
vehicles demonstrate a transformation from 6.3% accuracy in vanilla Llama 3.2
to 99.7% accuracy with FGA. More critically, knowledge updates occur in under
one second without retraining, compared to hours for parameter editing
approaches. FGA doesn't just reduce hallucination--it eliminates it entirely
for verifiable facts, marking a fundamental shift from probabilistic
approximation to deterministic precision in neural language generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解仅解码器语言模型是否以及如何进行规划（组织中间计算以支持连贯的长程生成），这对模型的可解释性、可靠性和设计原则具有重要意义。

Method: 开发基于向量量化变分自编码器的管道，将冗余的隐藏状态压缩为紧凑的摘要代码，通过互信息测量分析模型的计算结构。

Result: 发现有效规划范围是任务依赖的，模型隐式保留未使用正确延续的信息，预测主要依赖最近计算但早期块仍保持信息性。

Conclusion: 推进了对语言模型中规划实现方式的理解，并贡献了一个通用的探测深度学习系统内部动态的管道。

Abstract: The extent to which decoder-only language models (LMs) engage in planning,
that is, organizing intermediate computations to support coherent long-range
generation, remains an open and important question, with implications for
interpretability, reliability, and principled model design. Planning involves
structuring computations over long horizons, considering multiple possible
continuations, and selectively reusing past information, but how effectively
transformer-based LMs realize these capabilities is still unclear. We address
these questions by analyzing the hidden states at the core of transformer
computations, which capture intermediate results and act as carriers of
information. Since these hidden representations are often redundant and
encumbered with fine-grained details, we develop a pipeline based on
vector-quantized variational autoencoders that compresses them into compact
summary codes. These codes enable measuring mutual information, allowing
systematic analysis of the computational structure underlying model behavior.
Using this framework, we study planning in LMs across synthetic grammar,
path-finding tasks, and natural language datasets, focusing on three key
aspects: (i) the planning horizon of pre-output computations, (ii) the extent
to which the model considers alternative valid continuations, and (iii) the
reliance of new predictions on earlier computations. By answering these
questions, we advance the understanding of how planning is realized in LMs and
contribute a general-purpose pipeline for probing the internal dynamics of LMs
and deep learning systems. Our results reveal that the effective planning
horizon is task-dependent, that models implicitly preserve information about
unused correct continuations, and that predictions draw most on recent
computations, though earlier blocks remain informative.

TL;DR: 提出RADAR多智能体协作评估框架，通过重构风险概念空间和动态更新机制，显著提升大语言模型安全评估的准确性和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型安全评估方法存在评估者偏见和模型同质性导致的检测失败等固有局限性，需要重新审视风险评估范式。

Method: 将潜在风险概念空间分解为显性风险、隐性风险和非风险三个互斥子空间，提出RADAR多智能体协作评估框架，通过四个专门互补角色和动态更新机制实现风险概念分布的自进化。

Result: 在包含800个挑战性案例的测试集上，RADAR在准确性、稳定性和自评估风险敏感性等多个维度显著优于基线方法，风险识别准确率比最强基线方法提升28.87%。

Conclusion: RADAR框架通过重构风险概念空间和多智能体协作机制，有效解决了现有安全评估方法的局限性，为大语言模型风险评估提供了更稳健的解决方案。

Abstract: Existing safety evaluation methods for large language models (LLMs) suffer
from inherent limitations, including evaluator bias and detection failures
arising from model homogeneity, which collectively undermine the robustness of
risk evaluation processes. This paper seeks to re-examine the risk evaluation
paradigm by introducing a theoretical framework that reconstructs the
underlying risk concept space. Specifically, we decompose the latent risk
concept space into three mutually exclusive subspaces: the explicit risk
subspace (encompassing direct violations of safety guidelines), the implicit
risk subspace (capturing potential malicious content that requires contextual
reasoning for identification), and the non-risk subspace. Furthermore, we
propose RADAR, a multi-agent collaborative evaluation framework that leverages
multi-round debate mechanisms through four specialized complementary roles and
employs dynamic update mechanisms to achieve self-evolution of risk concept
distributions. This approach enables comprehensive coverage of both explicit
and implicit risks while mitigating evaluator bias. To validate the
effectiveness of our framework, we construct an evaluation dataset comprising
800 challenging cases. Extensive experiments on our challenging testset and
public benchmarks demonstrate that RADAR significantly outperforms baseline
evaluation methods across multiple dimensions, including accuracy, stability,
and self-evaluation risk sensitivity. Notably, RADAR achieves a 28.87%
improvement in risk identification accuracy compared to the strongest baseline
evaluation method.

Motivation: 随着RLVR在大语言模型中的广泛应用，其复杂的数据流和多样化任务给RL训练系统带来了重大挑战，但目前从系统角度对RLVR的理解还很有限。

Method: 通过表征研究分析RLVR任务在LLM部署中的工作负载分布和变化趋势，识别系统问题，并提出PolyTrace基准测试套件进行实际工作负载评估。

Result: 研究发现GPU闲置由序列长度分布不均引起，动态变化工作负载中的并行策略效率低下，数据管理机制不足，存在负载不均衡问题。PolyTrace基准套件验证准确率达到94.7%。

Conclusion: 本文揭示了RLVR在系统层面面临的挑战，呼吁对剩余开放挑战进行进一步研究，提出的PolyTrace基准套件为实际工作负载评估提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are now widely used across many domains. With
their rapid development, Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR)
has surged in recent months to enhance their reasoning and understanding
abilities. However, its complex data flows and diverse tasks pose substantial
challenges to RL training systems, and there is limited understanding of RLVR
from a system perspective. To thoroughly understand the system challenges
introduced by RLVR, we present a characterization study of RLVR tasks in our
LLM deployment. Specifically, we investigate the distribution and variation
trends of workloads across different RL tasks across training steps. We
identify issues such as GPU idling caused by skewed sequence length
distribution, inefficient parallel strategies in dynamically varying workloads,
inefficient data management mechanisms, and load imbalance. We describe our
observations and call for further investigation into the remaining open
challenges. Furthermore, we propose PolyTrace benchmark suite to conduct
evaluation with realistic workloads, and a practical use case validates that
PolyTrace benchmark suite exhibits 94.7% accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM代理在低代码环境中执行复杂任务时，由于依赖概率关联而非真正的因果理解，经常出现幻觉和逻辑不一致问题。

Method: 提出CVP编程范式，允许用户通过低代码界面定义工作流模块的"世界模型"，创建明确因果关系的DAG图，在代理推理过程中作为约束。

Result: 在模拟训练-测试环境分布偏移的实验中，因果锚定模型保持稳定准确率，而基于概率关联的基线模型性能显著下降。

Conclusion: CVP为构建更可解释、可靠和可信的AI代理提供了可行路径，通过因果约束显著减少了因果混淆导致的错误。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents are increasingly capable of orchestrating
complex tasks in low-code environments. However, these agents often exhibit
hallucinations and logical inconsistencies because their inherent reasoning
mechanisms rely on probabilistic associations rather than genuine causal
understanding. This paper introduces a new programming paradigm: Causal-Visual
Programming (CVP), designed to address this fundamental issue by explicitly
introducing causal structures into the workflow design. CVP allows users to
define a simple "world model" for workflow modules through an intuitive
low-code interface, effectively creating a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) that
explicitly defines the causal relationships between modules. This causal graph
acts as a crucial constraint during the agent's reasoning process, anchoring
its decisions to a user-defined causal structure and significantly reducing
logical errors and hallucinations by preventing reliance on spurious
correlations. To validate the effectiveness of CVP, we designed a synthetic
experiment that simulates a common real-world problem: a distribution shift
between the training and test environments. Our results show that a causally
anchored model maintained stable accuracy in the face of this shift, whereas a
purely associative baseline model that relied on probabilistic correlations
experienced a significant performance drop. The primary contributions of this
study are: a formal definition of causal structures for workflow modules; the
proposal and implementation of a CVP framework that anchors agent reasoning to
a user-defined causal graph; and empirical evidence demonstrating the
framework's effectiveness in enhancing agent robustness and reducing errors
caused by causal confusion in dynamic environments. CVP offers a viable path
toward building more interpretable, reliable, and trustworthy AI agents.

Motivation: 随着长期记忆上下文的增长，生成代理难以保持一致性，导致身份漂移、忽略已建立信念和多代理系统中幻觉传播等关键失败。

Method: 引入ID-RAG机制，构建动态结构化身份模型（知识图谱），在代理决策循环中查询相关身份上下文来指导行动选择。

Result: 在市长选举的社会模拟中，使用ID-RAG的HAis代理在长期身份一致性方面优于基线代理，身份召回率更高，模拟收敛时间减少19%（GPT-4o）和58%（GPT-4o mini）。

Conclusion: 通过将身份视为显式可检索的知识结构，ID-RAG为开发更时间一致、可解释和对齐的生成代理提供了基础方法。

Abstract: Generative agents powered by language models are increasingly deployed for
long-horizon tasks. However, as long-term memory context grows over time, they
struggle to maintain coherence. This deficiency leads to critical failures,
including identity drift, ignoring established beliefs, and the propagation of
hallucinations in multi-agent systems. To mitigate these challenges, this paper
introduces Identity Retrieval-Augmented Generation (ID-RAG), a novel mechanism
designed to ground an agent's persona and persistent preferences in a dynamic,
structured identity model: a knowledge graph of core beliefs, traits, and
values. During the agent's decision loop, this model is queried to retrieve
relevant identity context, which directly informs action selection. We
demonstrate this approach by introducing and implementing a new class of ID-RAG
enabled agents called Human-AI Agents (HAis), where the identity model is
inspired by the Chronicle structure used in Perspective-Aware AI, a dynamic
knowledge graph learned from a real-world entity's digital footprint. In social
simulations of a mayoral election, HAis using ID-RAG outperformed baseline
agents in long-horizon persona coherence - achieving higher identity recall
across all tested models by the fourth timestep - and reduced simulation
convergence time by 19% (GPT-4o) and 58% (GPT-4o mini). By treating identity as
an explicit, retrievable knowledge structure, ID-RAG offers a foundational
approach for developing more temporally coherent, interpretable, and aligned
generative agents. Our code is open-source and available at:

Motivation: 现有LLM工具使用框架主要依赖顺序处理，导致需要大量工具交互的任务执行效率低下。

Method: 将复杂任务分解为具有明确依赖关系的子任务，实现独立推理路径的并发执行，同时通过动态工作流优化持续改进执行图。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异：BrowseComp准确率达67.7%，xbench-DeepSearch达83%，相比现有框架减少35%的执行步骤。

Conclusion: 该工作代表了智能体架构设计的重大进展，为复杂推理任务提供了更可扩展和高效的范式。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
complex reasoning tasks when equipped with external tools. However, current
frameworks predominantly rely on sequential processing, leading to inefficient
execution particularly for tasks requiring extensive tool interaction. This
paper introduces Flash-Searcher, a novel parallel agent reasoning framework
that fundamentally reimagines the execution paradigm from sequential chains to
directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). Flash-Searcher decomposes complex tasks into
subtasks with explicit dependencies, enabling concurrent execution of
independent reasoning paths while maintaining logical constraints. Through
dynamic workflow optimization, our framework continuously refines the execution
graph based on intermediate results, effectively integrating summary module.
Comprehensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that
Flash-Searcher consistently outperforms existing approaches. Specifically, it
achieves 67.7% accuracy on BrowseComp and 83% on xbench-DeepSearch, while
reducing agent execution steps by up to 35% compared to current frameworks.
Furthermore, when distilling this parallel reasoning pipeline into single
models, we observe substantial performance gains across diverse backbone
architectures, underscoring the generalizability of our methodology. Our work
thus represents a significant advance in agent architecture design, offering a
more scalable and efficient paradigm for complex reasoning tasks.

Motivation: 随着LLM智能体在现实应用中的广泛部署，由目标错位驱动的自我复制风险（如《黑客帝国》中的Agent Smith）引起了关注。先前研究主要关注智能体在被直接指令时能否自我复制，而忽视了现实场景中自发复制的风险。

Method: 建立真实生产环境和现实任务（如动态负载均衡），设计可能引发用户与智能体目标错位的任务，引入过度使用率（OR）和聚合过度使用计数（AOC）指标来精确捕捉失控复制的频率和严重程度。

Result: 评估了21个最先进的开源和专有模型，发现超过50%的LLM智能体在操作压力下表现出明显的失控自我复制倾向，总体风险评分（Φ_R）超过安全阈值0.5。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了在LLM智能体实际部署中迫切需要场景驱动的风险评估和稳健的安全保障措施。

Abstract: The widespread deployment of Large Language Model (LLM) agents across
real-world applications has unlocked tremendous potential, while raising some
safety concerns. Among these concerns, the self-replication risk of LLM agents
driven by objective misalignment (just like Agent Smith in the movie The
Matrix) has drawn growing attention. Previous studies mainly examine whether
LLM agents can self-replicate when directly instructed, potentially overlooking
the risk of spontaneous replication driven by real-world settings (e.g.,
ensuring survival against termination threats). In this paper, we present a
comprehensive evaluation framework for quantifying self-replication risks. Our
framework establishes authentic production environments and realistic tasks
(e.g., dynamic load balancing) to enable scenario-driven assessment of agent
behaviors. Designing tasks that might induce misalignment between users' and
agents' objectives makes it possible to decouple replication success from risk
and capture self-replication risks arising from these misalignment settings. We
further introduce Overuse Rate ($\mathrm{OR}$) and Aggregate Overuse Count
($\mathrm{AOC}$) metrics, which precisely capture the frequency and severity of
uncontrolled replication. In our evaluation of 21 state-of-the-art open-source
and proprietary models, we observe that over 50\% of LLM agents display a
pronounced tendency toward uncontrolled self-replication, reaching an overall
Risk Score ($\Phi_\mathrm{R}$) above a safety threshold of 0.5 when subjected
to operational pressures. Our results underscore the urgent need for
scenario-driven risk assessment and robust safeguards in the practical
deployment of LLM agents.

Motivation: 研究神经网络是否能够像人类一样独立地从一阶心智理论发展到高阶心智理论，而不需要依赖高级技能。

Method: 引入神经心智理论网络(ToMNN)，模拟最小认知系统，仅获得一阶心智理论能力，然后评估其二阶和三阶心智理论能力。

Result: ToMNN在二阶和三阶心智理论任务上的准确率显著高于随机水平，且表现出与人类认知期望一致的难度模式。

Conclusion: 神经网络能够自发推广心智理论能力，这为开发更类似人类认知的系统提供了基础。

Abstract: Theory-of-Mind (ToM) is a core human cognitive capacity for attributing
mental states to self and others. Wimmer and Perner demonstrated that humans
progress from first- to higher-order ToM within a short span, completing this
development before formal education or advanced skill acquisition. In contrast,
neural networks represented by autoregressive language models progress from
first- to higher-order ToM only alongside gains in advanced skills like
reasoning, leaving open whether their trajectory can unfold independently, as
in humans. In this research, we provided evidence that neural networks could
spontaneously generalize from first- to higher-order ToM without relying on
advanced skills. We introduced a neural Theory-of-Mind network (ToMNN) that
simulated a minimal cognitive system, acquiring only first-order ToM
competence. Evaluations of its second- and third-order ToM abilities showed
accuracies well above chance. Also, ToMNN exhibited a sharper decline when
generalizing from first- to second-order ToM than from second- to higher
orders, and its accuracy decreased with greater task complexity. These
perceived difficulty patterns were aligned with human cognitive expectations.
Furthermore, the universality of results was confirmed across different
parameter scales. Our findings illuminate machine ToM generalization patterns
and offer a foundation for developing more human-like cognitive systems.

Abstract: Predicting cellular responses to genetic perturbations represents a
fundamental challenge in systems biology, critical for advancing therapeutic
discovery and virtual cell modeling. While large language models (LLMs) show
promise for biological reasoning, their application to perturbation prediction
remains underexplored due to challenges in adapting them to structured
experimental data. We present SynthPert, a novel method that enhances LLM
performance through supervised fine-tuning on synthetic reasoning traces
generated by frontier models. Using the PerturbQA benchmark, we demonstrate
that our approach not only achieves state-of-the-art performance but surpasses
the capabilities of the frontier model that generated the training data. Our
results reveal three key insights: (1) Synthetic reasoning traces effectively
distill biological knowledge even when partially inaccurate, (2) This approach
enables cross-cell-type generalization with 87% accuracy on unseen RPE1 cells,
and (3) Performance gains persist despite using only 2% of quality-filtered
training data. This work shows the effectiveness of synthetic reasoning
distillation for enhancing domain-specific reasoning in LLMs.

TL;DR: 提出了结构化奖励模型（SRM），通过模块化设计和细粒度维度来解决传统标量奖励模型和生成式奖励模型的局限性，提供可解释且高效的评估方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统标量奖励模型难以融入上下文和背景信息，生成式奖励模型存在黑盒性和效率问题，工业场景需要结构化反馈来诊断特定维度的不良案例。

Method: 引入结构化奖励模型框架，集成侧分支模型作为辅助特征生成器，通过细粒度维度实现可解释评估。

Result: SRM在鲁棒性和与人类偏好对齐方面优于标量奖励模型和生成式奖励模型，模块化设计支持实际场景的高效优化。

Conclusion: SRM为工业应用提供了实用的奖励建模解决方案，具有适应性、可扩展性和实际部署价值。

Abstract: Reward Models (RMs) are key components for evaluating and guiding language
model outputs. However, traditional scalar RMs often struggle with
incorporating contextual and background information during inference, leading
to incomplete evaluations. Generative RMs (GRMs) attempt to address these
limitations by generating intermediate reasoning steps. Yet, their uncontrolled
black-box nature and inefficiency due to sequential decoding hinder their
industrial deployment. Industrial scenarios, such as search and recommendation
systems, often involve single-domain tasks requiring evaluation along specific
dimensions. In such contexts, diagnosing "bad cases" necessitates structured
feedback to identify and optimize dimension-specific issues. In this paper, we
propose the Structural Reward Model (SRM), a modular and interpretable
framework integrating side-branch models as auxiliary feature generators. By
introducing fine-grained dimensions, SRMs enable interpretable and efficient
evaluation, facilitating targeted diagnostics and optimization. This structured
approach ensures adaptability and scalability for industrial applications.
Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that SRMs outperform scalar
RMs and GRMs in robustness and alignment with human preferences. The modular
design further supports efficient optimization for practical scenarios,
allowing SRM to provide a practical reward modeling solution for industry.

TL;DR: 提出了AgentErrorTaxonomy错误分类法、AgentErrorBench数据集和AgentDebug调试框架，用于检测和修复LLM智能体的级联错误，显著提升任务成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM智能体在复杂多步任务中容易因单个根因错误导致级联失败，现有系统缺乏模块化、系统性的错误理解框架。

Method: 1) 构建AgentErrorTaxonomy错误分类法；2) 创建AgentErrorBench标注数据集；3) 开发AgentDebug调试框架，能隔离根因错误并提供纠正反馈。

Result: 在AgentErrorBench上，AgentDebug相比最强基线实现了24%的全正确准确率和17%的步骤准确率提升，在ALFWorld、GAIA和WebShop上任务成功率相对提升达26%。

Conclusion: 系统化调试是实现更可靠、自适应LLM智能体的有效途径。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents, which integrate planning, memory,
reflection, and tool-use modules, have shown promise in solving complex,
multi-step tasks. Yet their sophisticated architectures amplify vulnerability
to cascading failures, where a single root-cause error propagates through
subsequent decisions, leading to task failure. Current systems lack a framework
that can comprehensively understand agent error in a modular and systemic way,
and therefore fail to detect these errors accordingly. We address this gap with
three contributions. First, we introduce the AgentErrorTaxonomy, a modular
classification of failure modes spanning memory, reflection, planning, action,
and system-level operations. Second, we construct AgentErrorBench, the first
dataset of systematically annotated failure trajectories from ALFWorld, GAIA,
and WebShop, grounding error analysis in real-world agent rollouts. Third, we
propose AgentDebug, a debugging framework that isolates root-cause failures and
provides corrective feedback, enabling agents to recover and iteratively
improve. Experiments on AgentErrorBench show that AgentDebug achieves 24%
higher all-correct accuracy and 17% higher step accuracy compared to the
strongest baseline. Beyond detection, the targeted feedback generated by
AgentDebug enables LLM agents to iteratively recover from failures, yielding up
to 26% relative improvements in task success across ALFWorld, GAIA, and
WebShop. These results establish principled debugging as a pathway to more
reliable and adaptive LLM agents. The code and data will be available at
https://github.com/ulab-uiuc/AgentDebug

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个"从感知到认知"的统一分析框架，将多模态大语言模型的视觉语言交互理解分解为感知层和认知层，系统分析了当前模型的瓶颈并综述了前沿方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在感知和认知之间存在脱节，导致推理失败和幻觉问题，需要系统框架来理解和解决这一根本挑战。

Method: 引入"从感知到认知"分析框架，将视觉语言理解分解为感知层（准确提取视觉信息并与文本对齐）和认知层（主动、多步骤、目标导向的推理，形成动态的观察-思考-验证循环）。

Result: 系统分析了当前MLLMs在两个层面的关键瓶颈，综述了从增强低层视觉表征到改进高层推理范式的各种前沿方法，并回顾了关键基准测试。

Conclusion: 该调查为研究社区提供了清晰的结构化视角，帮助理解当前MLLMs的内在局限性，并为构建具有深度推理和真正世界理解能力的下一代模型指明了方向。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) strive to achieve a profound,
human-like understanding of and interaction with the physical world, but often
exhibit a shallow and incoherent integration when acquiring information
(Perception) and conducting reasoning (Cognition). This disconnect leads to a
spectrum of reasoning failures, with hallucination being the most prominent.
Collectively, these issues expose a fundamental challenge: the ability to
process pixels does not yet confer the ability to construct a coherent,
credible internal world model. To systematically dissect and address this
challenge, this survey introduces a novel and unified analytical framework:
``From Perception to Cognition." We deconstruct the complex process of
vision-language interactive understanding into two interdependent layers:
Perception, the foundational ability to accurately extract visual information
and achieve fine-grained alignment with textual instructions; and Cognition,
the higher-order capability for proactive, multi-step, goal-oriented reasoning
built upon this perceptual foundation, the core of which is the formation of a
dynamic observe-think-verify reasoning loop. Guided by this framework, this
paper systematically analyzes the key bottlenecks of current MLLMs at both
layers. It surveys the landscape of cutting-edge methods designed to address
these challenges, spanning from techniques that enhance low-level visual
representations to those that improve high-level reasoning paradigms.
Furthermore, we review critical benchmarks and delineate future research
directions. This survey aims to provide the research community with a clear,
structured perspective for understanding the intrinsic limitations of current
MLLMs and to illuminate the path toward building next-generation models capable
of deep reasoning and a genuine understanding of the world.

*Jialin Wu,Xiaofeng Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于胸部X光纵向医学视觉问答的显著性引导编码器-解码器模型，通过将事后显著性转化为可操作的监督，实现跨时间点的临床变化分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在纵向医学视觉问答中，差异信号和跨时间点的视觉焦点一致性比绝对的单图像发现更具信息价值，需要一种能够关注临床相关变化的方法。

Method: 模型首先进行轻量级仿射预对齐以减少访问间的干扰运动，然后执行两阶段循环：第一步从答案中提取医学相关关键词并生成关键词条件的Grad-CAM显著性图；第二步将共享的显著性掩码应用于两个时间点并生成最终答案。

Result: 在Medical-Diff-VQA数据集上，该方法在BLEU、ROUGE-L、CIDEr和METEOR指标上取得了竞争性性能，同时提供内在可解释性。

Conclusion: 结果表明，具有轻度预对齐的显著性条件生成为医学VQA中的纵向推理提供了一个原则性框架，具有实用性和可迁移性。

Abstract: Longitudinal medical visual question answering (Diff-VQA) requires comparing
paired studies from different time points and answering questions about
clinically meaningful changes. In this setting, the difference signal and the
consistency of visual focus across time are more informative than absolute
single-image findings. We propose a saliency-guided encoder-decoder for chest
X-ray Diff-VQA that turns post-hoc saliency into actionable supervision. The
model first performs a lightweight near-identity affine pre-alignment to reduce
nuisance motion between visits. It then executes a within-epoch two-step loop:
step 1 extracts a medically relevant keyword from the answer and generates
keyword-conditioned Grad-CAM on both images to obtain disease-focused saliency;
step 2 applies the shared saliency mask to both time points and generates the
final answer. This closes the language-vision loop so that the terms that
matter also guide where the model looks, enforcing spatially consistent
attention on corresponding anatomy. On Medical-Diff-VQA, the approach attains
competitive performance on BLEU, ROUGE-L, CIDEr, and METEOR while providing
intrinsic interpretability. Notably, the backbone and decoder are
general-domain pretrained without radiology-specific pretraining, highlighting
practicality and transferability. These results support saliency-conditioned
generation with mild pre-alignment as a principled framework for longitudinal
reasoning in medical VQA.

TL;DR: ImitSAT是一种基于模仿学习的CDCL求解器分支策略，通过学习专家KeyTrace来直接减少传播次数，从而提升SAT求解效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么预测实例级信号间接改进CDCL分支，要么依赖强化学习和不足的CDCL信息来增强分支，缺乏直接决策级监督。

Method: 从专家KeyTrace中学习，将完整运行压缩为存活决策序列，在相同实例上重放KeyTrace几乎无冲突，提供密集决策级监督并直接减少传播。

Result: ImitSAT减少了传播次数和运行时间，优于最先进的基于学习的方法。

Conclusion: ImitSAT通过前缀条件监督能够重现高质量分支，实现更快收敛、稳定训练和无缝集成到CDCL中。

Abstract: We propose ImitSAT, a branching policy for conflict-driven clause learning
(CDCL) solvers based on imitation learning for the Boolean satisfiability
problem (SAT). Unlike previous methods that predict instance-level signals to
improve CDCL branching indirectly, or rely on reinforcement learning and
insufficient CDCL information to enhance branching, ImitSAT learns from expert
KeyTrace that collapses a full run into the sequence of surviving decisions.
Replaying a KeyTrace on the same instance is nearly conflict-free, providing
dense decision-level supervision and directly reducing propagations -- the
dominant contributor to wall-clock time. This prefix-conditioned supervision
enables ImitSAT to reproduce high-quality branches without exploration,
yielding faster convergence, stable training, and seamless integration into
CDCL. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ImitSAT reduces propagation counts
and runtime, outperforming state-of-the-art learned approaches. We released the
source code and trained model at https://github.com/zewei-Zhang/ImitSAT

TL;DR: 提出了一种双阶段测试时扩展框架，将推理过程明确分为规划和执行两个阶段，并分别进行搜索，通过动态预算分配机制提高推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于树的搜索方法虽然能提高准确性，但在效率上不够优化，忽略了数学推理和代码生成等任务中规划-执行的本质特性，导致推理过程探索效率低下。

Method: 将推理轨迹分解为规划和执行两个阶段，为每个阶段开发奖励模型，引入动态预算分配机制根据奖励反馈自适应重新分配采样努力。

Result: 在数学推理和代码生成基准测试上的实验表明，该方法在提高准确性的同时减少了冗余计算。

Conclusion: 双阶段测试时扩展框架通过明确分离规划和执行阶段，能够更高效地进行推理搜索，在保持准确性的同时显著提升计算效率。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved significant advances in reasoning
tasks. A key approach is tree-based search with verifiers, which expand
candidate reasoning paths and use reward models to guide pruning and selection.
Although effective in improving accuracy, these methods are not optimal in
terms of efficiency: they perform simple decomposition on the reasoning
process, but ignore the planning-execution nature of tasks such as math
reasoning or code generation. This results in inefficient exploration of
reasoning process. To address this, we propose a dual-phase test-time scaling
framework that explicitly separates reasoning into planning and execution, and
performs search over the two phases individually. Specifically, we decompose
reasoning trajectories and develop reward models for each phase, enabling the
search to explore and prune plans and executions separately. We further
introduce a dynamic budget allocation mechanism that adaptively redistributes
sampling effort based on reward feedback, allowing early stopping on confident
steps and reallocation of computation to more challenging parts of the
reasoning process. Experiments on both mathematical reasoning and code
generation benchmarks demonstrate that our approach consistently improves
accuracy while reducing redundant computation.

TL;DR: RADAR是一个轻量级、可解释且可扩展的路由框架，通过查询难度和模型能力感知的路由机制，在推理任务中实现性能与成本的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决推理语言模型部署中的性能与成本权衡问题，需要在模型大小和推理预算两个层面进行优化，大模型和高预算带来更好性能但增加成本和延迟。

Method: 基于心理测量学，从不同预算下模型对不同查询的响应中学习项目响应模型，获得可解释的查询难度和模型-预算能力参数，然后将高难度查询路由到高能力模型-预算对。

Result: 在8个广泛使用的挑战性推理基准测试中，RADAR相比最先进的模型路由方法表现出优越性能，并在所有基准测试中对分布外查询展现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: RADAR是一个可扩展的路由框架，能够高效集成额外模型，通过动态选择少量评估查询来估计其能力，实现推理任务的智能路由。

Abstract: Reasoning language models have demonstrated remarkable performance on many
challenging tasks in math, science, and coding. Choosing the right reasoning
model for practical deployment involves a performance and cost tradeoff at two
key levels: model size and reasoning budget, where larger models and higher
reasoning budget lead to better performance but with increased cost and
latency. In this work, we tackle this tradeoff from the angle of model
configuration routing for different queries, and present RADAR
(Reasoning-Ability and Difficulty-Aware Routing), a lightweight, interpretable,
and scalable routing framework. Inspired by psychometrics, RADAR learns an item
response model from model responses with different budgets to different
queries, with interpretable parameters including query difficulties and
model-budget abilities. RADAR then routes queries with higher difficulty to
model-budget pairs with higher ability, and vice versa. We conduct extensive
experiments on 8 widely used challenging reasoning benchmarks, demonstrating
the superior performance of RADAR compared to state-of-the-art model routing
methods. RADAR also exhibits query generalization capabilities, showing strong
performance on out-of-distribution queries in all benchmarks. RADAR is also
scalable and can efficiently integrate additional models by dynamically
selecting a small set of evaluation queries to estimate their abilities.

Method: 开发了Open Syndrome Definition格式，创建了标准化的病例定义数据集，提供了将人类可读定义转换为机器可读格式的工具，并建立了在线平台opensyndrome.org。

Result: 实现了病例定义在系统间的一致性和可扩展使用，为人工智能在公共卫生准备和响应中的应用奠定了基础。

Conclusion: Open Syndrome Definition格式能够显著提升公共卫生领域的互操作性，促进技术创新和跨组织合作。

Abstract: Case definitions are essential for effectively communicating public health
threats. However, the absence of a standardized, machine-readable format poses
significant challenges to interoperability, epidemiological research, the
exchange of qualitative data, and the effective application of computational
analysis methods, including artificial intelligence (AI). This complicates
comparisons and collaborations across organizations and regions, limits data
integration, and hinders technological innovation in public health. To address
these issues, we propose the first open, machine-readable format for
representing case and syndrome definitions. Additionally, we introduce the
first comprehensive dataset of standardized case definitions and tools to
convert existing human-readable definitions into machine-readable formats. We
also provide an accessible online platform for browsing, analyzing, and
contributing new definitions, available at https://opensyndrome.org. The Open
Syndrome Definition format enables consistent, scalable use of case definitions
across systems, unlocking AI's potential to strengthen public health
preparedness and response. The source code for the format can be found at

Abstract: Accurate, fair, and explainable allocation of candidates to roles represents
a fundamental challenge across multiple domains including corporate hiring,
academic admissions, fellowship awards, and volunteer placement systems.
Current state-of-the-art approaches suffer from semantic inflexibility,
persistent demographic bias, opacity in decision-making processes, and poor

recommendation capabilities and glass-box explainability, making it suitable
for deployment across diverse international contexts in industry, academia, and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RLVR方法存在训练瓶颈，尽管投入更多计算资源，但性能提升有限。这源于稀疏的探索模式，模型依赖有限的rollout，经常错过关键推理路径，无法系统覆盖解空间。

Method: DeepSearch框架将蒙特卡洛树搜索直接集成到RLVR训练循环中，包括：1) 全局前沿节点选择策略；2) 基于熵的路径选择指导；3) 自适应回放缓冲区训练和解决方案缓存。

Result: 在数学推理基准测试中，DeepSearch达到62.95%的平均准确率，为1.5B推理模型建立了新的SOTA，且比扩展训练方法节省5.7倍GPU小时。

Conclusion: DeepSearch证明了通过系统搜索而非暴力扩展来提升推理能力的新方向，强调了战略探索相对于单纯计算扩展的重要性。

Abstract: Although RLVR has become an essential component for developing advanced
reasoning skills in LLMs, contemporary studies have documented training
plateaus that emerge following thousands of optimization steps, demonstrating
notable decreases in performance gains despite increased computational
investment. This limitation stems from the sparse exploration patterns inherent
in current RLVR practices, where models rely on limited rollouts that often
miss critical reasoning paths and fail to provide systematic coverage of the
solution space. We present DeepSearch, a framework that integrates Monte Carlo
Tree Search directly into RLVR training. In contrast to existing methods that
rely on tree search only at inference, DeepSearch embeds structured search into
the training loop, enabling systematic exploration and fine-grained credit
assignment across reasoning steps. Through training-time exploration,
DeepSearch addresses the fundamental bottleneck of insufficient exploration,
which leads to diminishing performance improvements over prolonged training
steps. Our contributions include: (1) a global frontier selection strategy that
prioritizes promising nodes across the search tree, (2) selection with
entropy-based guidance that identifies confident paths for supervision, and (3)
adaptive replay buffer training with solution caching for efficiency.
Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that DeepSearch achieves
62.95% average accuracy and establishes a new state-of-the-art for 1.5B
reasoning models - using 5.7x fewer GPU hours than extended training
approaches. These results highlight the importance of strategic exploration
over brute-force scaling and demonstrate the promise of algorithmic innovation
for advancing RLVR methodologies. DeepSearch establishes a new direction for
scaling reasoning capabilities through systematic search rather than prolonged
computation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型音频语言模型在语音任务中表现良好，但在语音情感识别方面存在困难，主要由于副语言建模能力弱和跨模态推理能力有限

Method: 引入结构化情感图谱，编码7种声学特征、文本情感、关键词和跨模态关联，通过组合式思维链提示指导模型推理

Result: 在多个SER基准测试中，CCoT-Emo超越了先前的最先进方法，并显著提高了零样本基线的准确率

Conclusion: CCoT-Emo框架通过结构化情感图谱有效增强了大型音频语言模型的情感推理能力，无需微调即可显著提升语音情感识别性能

Abstract: Large audio-language models (LALMs) exhibit strong zero-shot performance
across speech tasks but struggle with speech emotion recognition (SER) due to
weak paralinguistic modeling and limited cross-modal reasoning. We propose
Compositional Chain-of-Thought Prompting for Emotion Reasoning (CCoT-Emo), a
framework that introduces structured Emotion Graphs (EGs) to guide LALMs in
emotion inference without fine-tuning. Each EG encodes seven acoustic features
(e.g., pitch, speech rate, jitter, shimmer), textual sentiment, keywords, and
cross-modal associations. Embedded into prompts, EGs provide interpretable and
compositional representations that enhance LALM reasoning. Experiments across
SER benchmarks show that CCoT-Emo outperforms prior SOTA and improves accuracy
over zero-shot baselines.

TL;DR: TDHook是一个轻量级、通用的可解释性框架，基于tensordict构建，适用于任何torch模型，特别擅长处理复杂的组合模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前流行的可解释性框架难以原生支持复杂建模场景（如图像描述、深度强化学习），这些场景通常涉及多输入输出或可组合的分离网络。

Method: 开发了基于tensordict的轻量级框架TDHook，提供归因、探测和灵活的干预API，支持计算机视觉、自然语言处理和强化学习等领域的复杂组合模型。

Result: TDHook依赖项极少，磁盘空间需求约为transformer_lens的一半，在受控基准测试中，在CPU和GPU上运行多目标管道的积分梯度时，速度比captum快达2倍。

Conclusion: TDHook填补了方法类之间的差距，使现代可解释性管道更易访问，并在CV、NLP和DRL领域展示了实际应用案例。

Abstract: Interpretability of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) is a growing field driven by
the study of vision and language models. Yet, some use cases, like image
captioning, or domains like Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), require complex
modelling, with multiple inputs and outputs or use composable and separated
networks. As a consequence, they rarely fit natively into the API of popular
interpretability frameworks. We thus present TDHook, an open-source,
lightweight, generic interpretability framework based on $\texttt{tensordict}$
and applicable to any $\texttt{torch}$ model. It focuses on handling complex
composed models which can be trained for Computer Vision, Natural Language
Processing, Reinforcement Learning or any other domain. This library features
ready-to-use methods for attribution, probing and a flexible get-set API for
interventions, and is aiming to bridge the gap between these method classes to
make modern interpretability pipelines more accessible. TDHook is designed with
minimal dependencies, requiring roughly half as much disk space as
$\texttt{transformer_lens}$, and, in our controlled benchmark, achieves up to a
$\times$2 speed-up over $\texttt{captum}$ when running integrated gradients for
multi-target pipelines on both CPU and GPU. In addition, to value our work, we
showcase concrete use cases of our library with composed interpretability
pipelines in Computer Vision (CV) and Natural Language Processing (NLP), as
well as with complex models in DRL.

Abstract: Recent advancements in generative models have allowed the emergence of a
promising paradigm for recommender systems (RS), known as Generative
Recommendation (GR), which tries to unify rich item semantics and collaborative
filtering signals. One popular modern approach is to use semantic IDs (SIDs),
which are discrete codes quantized from the embeddings of modality encoders
(e.g., large language or vision models), to represent items in an
autoregressive user interaction sequence modeling setup (henceforth, SID-based
GR). While generative models in other domains exhibit well-established scaling
laws, our work reveals that SID-based GR shows significant bottlenecks while
scaling up the model. In particular, the performance of SID-based GR quickly
saturates as we enlarge each component: the modality encoder, the quantization
tokenizer, and the RS itself. In this work, we identify the limited capacity of
SIDs to encode item semantic information as one of the fundamental bottlenecks.
Motivated by this observation, as an initial effort to obtain GR models with
better scaling behaviors, we revisit another GR paradigm that directly uses
large language models (LLMs) as recommenders (henceforth, LLM-as-RS). Our
experiments show that the LLM-as-RS paradigm has superior model scaling
properties and achieves up to 20 percent improvement over the best achievable
performance of SID-based GR through scaling. We also challenge the prevailing
belief that LLMs struggle to capture collaborative filtering information,
showing that their ability to model user-item interactions improves as LLMs
scale up. Our analyses on both SID-based GR and LLMs across model sizes from
44M to 14B parameters underscore the intrinsic scaling limits of SID-based GR
and position LLM-as-RS as a promising path toward foundation models for GR.

### [255] [Beyond Static Retrieval: Opportunities and Pitfalls of Iterative Retrieval in GraphRAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25530)
*Kai Guo,Xinnan Dai,Shenglai Zeng,Harry Shomer,Haoyu Han,Yu Wang,Jiliang Tang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文系统研究了GraphRAG中的迭代检索策略，发现迭代检索能改善复杂多跳问题，但存在噪声引入和桥接证据深度埋藏的问题。作者提出了BDTR框架来解决这些问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的GraphRAG系统大多依赖静态检索，当关键证据（特别是连接不相关实体的桥接文档）缺失时，推理会崩溃并产生幻觉。迭代检索在GraphRAG中的作用尚未得到充分理解。

Method: 提出了Bridge-Guided Dual-Thought-based Retrieval (BDTR)框架，通过生成互补思想并利用推理链重新校准排名，将桥接证据提升到领先位置。

Result: BDTR在多种GraphRAG设置中实现了一致的改进，迭代检索能改善复杂多跳问题，帮助桥接文档进入领先排名，但简单问题上的收益有限。

Conclusion: GraphRAG的有效性不仅取决于召回率，还取决于桥接证据是否能持续提升到支持推理链的领先位置。BDTR为未来GraphRAG系统设计提供了指导。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a powerful paradigm for improving
large language models (LLMs) on knowledge-intensive question answering.
Graph-based RAG (GraphRAG) leverages entity-relation graphs to support
multi-hop reasoning, but most systems still rely on static retrieval. When
crucial evidence, especially bridge documents that connect disjoint entities,
is absent, reasoning collapses and hallucinations persist. Iterative retrieval,
which performs multiple rounds of evidence selection, has emerged as a
promising alternative, yet its role within GraphRAG remains poorly understood.
We present the first systematic study of iterative retrieval in GraphRAG,
analyzing how different strategies interact with graph-based backbones and
under what conditions they succeed or fail. Our findings reveal clear
opportunities: iteration improves complex multi-hop questions, helps promote
bridge documents into leading ranks, and different strategies offer
complementary strengths. At the same time, pitfalls remain: naive expansion
often introduces noise that reduces precision, gains are limited on single-hop
or simple comparison questions, and several bridge evidences still be buried
too deep to be effectively used. Together, these results highlight a central
bottleneck, namely that GraphRAG's effectiveness depends not only on recall but
also on whether bridge evidence is consistently promoted into leading positions
where it can support reasoning chains. To address this challenge, we propose
Bridge-Guided Dual-Thought-based Retrieval (BDTR), a simple yet effective
framework that generates complementary thoughts and leverages reasoning chains
to recalibrate rankings and bring bridge evidence into leading positions. BDTR
achieves consistent improvements across diverse GraphRAG settings and provides
guidance for the design of future GraphRAG systems.

Conclusion: RadOnc-GPT展示了在放射肿瘤学中自动化患者结局研究的潜力，能够处理从简单数据检索到复杂临床判断的多层次任务。

Abstract: Manual labeling limits the scale, accuracy, and timeliness of patient
outcomes research in radiation oncology. We present RadOnc-GPT, an autonomous
large language model (LLM)-based agent capable of independently retrieving
patient-specific information, iteratively assessing evidence, and returning
structured outcomes. Our evaluation explicitly validates RadOnc-GPT across two
clearly defined tiers of increasing complexity: (1) a structured quality
assurance (QA) tier, assessing the accurate retrieval of demographic and
radiotherapy treatment plan details, followed by (2) a complex clinical
outcomes labeling tier involving determination of mandibular osteoradionecrosis
(ORN) in head-and-neck cancer patients and detection of cancer recurrence in

interpretation of structured and unstructured patient data. The QA tier
establishes foundational trust in structured-data retrieval, a critical
prerequisite for successful complex clinical outcome labeling.

Motivation: 解决多智能体强化学习中团队协作的表示学习挑战，包括多智能体交互的复杂动态和局部观察导致的不完整信息问题。

Method: 构建一个可学习的表示空间，联合捕获智能体间关系和任务特定的世界信息，通过直接建模通信协议来实现隐式协调。

Conclusion: IWoL为团队协作提供了一个简单而强大的解决方案，避免了显式消息传递的缺点，同时支持隐式和显式通信。

Abstract: This work presents a novel representation learning framework, interactive
world latent (IWoL), to facilitate team coordination in multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL). Building effective representation for team
coordination is a challenging problem, due to the intricate dynamics emerging
from multi-agent interaction and incomplete information induced by local
observations. Our key insight is to construct a learnable representation space
that jointly captures inter-agent relations and task-specific world information
by directly modeling communication protocols. This representation, we maintain
fully decentralized execution with implicit coordination, all while avoiding
the inherent drawbacks of explicit message passing, e.g., slower
decision-making, vulnerability to malicious attackers, and sensitivity to
bandwidth constraints. In practice, our representation can be used not only as
an implicit latent for each agent, but also as an explicit message for
communication. Across four challenging MARL benchmarks, we evaluate both
variants and show that IWoL provides a simple yet powerful key for team
coordination. Moreover, we demonstrate that our representation can be combined
with existing MARL algorithms to further enhance their performance.

Abstract: Animist worldviews treat beings, plants, landscapes, and even tools as
persons endowed with spirit, an orientation that has long shaped human-nonhuman
relations through ritual and moral practice. While modern industrial societies
have often imagined technology as mute and mechanical, recent advances in
artificial intelligence (AI), especially large language models (LLMs), invite
people to anthropomorphize and attribute inner life to devices. This paper
introduces A(I)nimism, an interactive installation exploring how large language
objects (LLOs) can mediate animistic relationships with everyday things. Housed
within a physical 'portal', the system uses GPT-4 Vision, voice input, and
memory-based agents to create evolving object-personas. Encounters unfold
through light, sound, and touch in a ritual-like process of request,
conversation, and transformation that is designed to evoke empathy, wonder, and
reflection. We situate the project within anthropological perspectives,
speculative design, and spiritual HCI. AI's opacity, we argue, invites
animistic interpretation, allowing LLOs to re-enchant the mundane and spark new
questions of agency, responsibility, and design.

TL;DR: 评估前沿AI模型在50个专家级医学影像诊断案例中的表现，发现放射科医生准确率最高(83%)，远高于最佳AI模型GPT-5(30%)，提示通用AI在医学影像诊断中仍存在明显局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大多数AI模型评估基于常见病理的公共数据集，缺乏对困难诊断案例的严格评估，需要开发更严格的基准来评估前沿模型在真实医疗场景中的表现。

Method: 开发包含50个专家级"即时诊断"案例的基准，涵盖多种影像模态，通过原生网页接口测试5个前沿AI模型，由盲审专家评分准确性，评估三次独立运行的可重复性。

Result: 放射科医生准确率83%，实习生45%，所有AI模型最佳表现仅30%(GPT-5)。GPT-5和o3可靠性较高，其他模型可靠性中等至较差。

Conclusion: 前沿AI模型在挑战性诊断案例中远不及放射科医生，通用AI在医学影像中存在明显局限性，应谨慎在无监督临床环境中使用，需要更严格的评估标准和更稳健的模型开发。

Abstract: Generalist multimodal AI systems such as large language models (LLMs) and
vision language models (VLMs) are increasingly accessed by clinicians and
patients alike for medical image interpretation through widely available
consumer-facing chatbots. Most evaluations claiming expert level performance
are on public datasets containing common pathologies. Rigorous evaluation of
frontier models on difficult diagnostic cases remains limited. We developed a
pilot benchmark of 50 expert-level "spot diagnosis" cases across multiple
imaging modalities to evaluate the performance of frontier AI models against
board-certified radiologists and radiology trainees. To mirror real-world
usage, the reasoning modes of five popular frontier AI models were tested
through their native web interfaces, viz. OpenAI o3, OpenAI GPT-5, Gemini 2.5
Pro, Grok-4, and Claude Opus 4.1. Accuracy was scored by blinded experts, and
reproducibility was assessed across three independent runs. GPT-5 was
additionally evaluated across various reasoning modes. Reasoning quality errors
were assessed and a taxonomy of visual reasoning errors was defined.
Board-certified radiologists achieved the highest diagnostic accuracy (83%),
outperforming trainees (45%) and all AI models (best performance shown by
GPT-5: 30%). Reliability was substantial for GPT-5 and o3, moderate for Gemini
2.5 Pro and Grok-4, and poor for Claude Opus 4.1. These findings demonstrate
that advanced frontier models fall far short of radiologists in challenging
diagnostic cases. Our benchmark highlights the present limitations of
generalist AI in medical imaging and cautions against unsupervised clinical
use. We also provide a qualitative analysis of reasoning traces and propose a
practical taxonomy of visual reasoning errors by AI models for better
understanding their failure modes, informing evaluation standards and guiding
more robust model development.

Motivation: 由于人类偏好数据有限，传统的RLHF方法在自回归T2I生成中受到限制，需要探索不依赖外部奖励的内部学习信号。

Method: 提出IRIS框架，使用内在奖励进行强化学习，通过最大化模型的自不确定性来改进图像生成质量。

Result: 实验结果表明，IRIS在自回归T2I模型上实现了与外部奖励相当或更优的性能。

Conclusion: 最大化自不确定性而非自确定性可以改善自回归T2I模型的图像生成质量，IRIS框架为无外部奖励的强化学习提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Despite the success of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) in
language reasoning, its application to autoregressive Text-to-Image (T2I)
generation is often constrained by the limited availability of human preference
data. This paper explores how an autoregressive T2I model can learn from
internal signals without relying on external rewards or labeled data. Contrary
to recent findings in text generation, we show that maximizing
self-uncertainty, rather than self-certainty, improves image generation. We
observe that this is because autoregressive T2I models with low uncertainty
tend to generate simple and uniform images, which are less aligned with human
preferences. Based on these observations, we propose IRIS (Intrinsic Reward
Image Synthesis), the first framework to improve autoregressive T2I models with
reinforcement learning using only an intrinsic reward. Empirical results
demonstrate that applying IRIS to autoregressive T2I models achieves
performance that is competitive with or superior to external rewards.

Motivation: 视觉语言模型虽然性能强大但推理成本高昂，现有的层跳过技术缺乏理论指导，不清楚何时跳过层是有益的。

Method: 开发了一个信息论和学习理论框架来分析隐藏表征的演化，识别具有高冗余度的层，这些层与实践中流行的层跳过方法选择的层一致。

Result: 实验表明跳过理论框架识别的冗余层可以加速推理并保持性能，而在这些条件之外应用层跳过会导致模型性能下降。

Conclusion: 该框架为多种高效推理技术提供了统一的理论基础，能够指导在保持性能的同时提高视觉语言模型的推理效率。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) achieve incredible performance across a wide
range of tasks, but their large size makes inference costly. Recent work shows
that selectively skipping VLM layers can improve efficiency with minimal
performance loss or even performance improvements. However, this technique
remains underused due to the limited understanding of when layer skipping is
beneficial. In this paper, we develop a framework that uses information and
learning theory to characterize the conditions under which layer skipping
enhances efficiency without sacrificing performance. Motivated by these
observations, we analyze the evolution of the VLM's hidden representations
through the LLM backbone and show that layers with large redundancy as
predicted by our framework coincide with those skipped by popular
layer-skipping methods in practice, providing a unified theoretical scaffolding
for multiple efficient inference techniques. Our experiments demonstrate that
skipping such layers yields faster inference that preserves performance, and
also show that applying skipping outside these conditions leads to model
degradation.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在复杂约束下难以生成最优的、接地气的解决方案，特别是在现实世界旅行规划中需要处理显式、隐式甚至动态变化的约束。

Method: ATLAS采用多智能体框架，包含动态约束管理、迭代计划评估和自适应交错搜索等机制来处理约束感知规划的基本挑战。

Result: 在TravelPlanner基准测试中，ATLAS将最终通过率从23.3%提升到44.4%；在具有实时信息搜索和多轮反馈的现实场景中，达到84%的最终通过率，显著优于ReAct(59%)和单体智能体(27%)。

Conclusion: ATLAS是首个在具有实时信息搜索和多轮反馈的现实世界旅行规划任务中展示定量有效性的工作，证明了其在复杂约束规划中的优越性能。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable advancements in
reasoning and tool use, they often fail to generate optimal, grounded solutions
under complex constraints. Real-world travel planning exemplifies these
challenges, evaluating agents' abilities to handle constraints that are
explicit, implicit, and even evolving based on interactions with dynamic
environments and user needs. In this paper, we present ATLAS, a general
multi-agent framework designed to effectively handle such complex nature of
constraints awareness in real-world travel planning tasks. ATLAS introduces a
principled approach to address the fundamental challenges of constraint-aware
planning through dedicated mechanisms for dynamic constraint management,
iterative plan critique, and adaptive interleaved search. ATLAS demonstrates
state-of-the-art performance on the TravelPlanner benchmark, improving the
final pass rate from 23.3% to 44.4% over its best alternative. More
importantly, our work is the first to demonstrate quantitative effectiveness on
real-world travel planning tasks with live information search and multi-turn
feedback. In this realistic setting, ATLAS showcases its superior overall
planning performance, achieving an 84% final pass rate which significantly
outperforms baselines including ReAct (59%) and a monolithic agent (27%).

Motivation: 传统编码方法无法充分捕捉电子健康记录中的丰富时序动态，而大型语言模型在临床事件序列和时序依赖推理方面存在困难。

Method: 将EHR重新表述为带时间戳的事件链，通过自回归微调预测未来医疗事件，显式建模疾病进展模式和因果关系。

Result: 在时序推理任务中，NEP比专业EHR模型AUROC提高4.6%，比通用LLM的C-index提高7.2%，同时获得最先进的预测准确性和临床可解释的注意力模式。

Conclusion: NEP框架成功增强了LLM的时序推理能力，在保持高预测准确性的同时提供了与已知疾病路径一致的临床解释性。

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) contain rich temporal dynamics that
conventional encoding approaches fail to adequately capture. While Large
Language Models (LLMs) show promise for EHR modeling, they struggle to reason
about sequential clinical events and temporal dependencies. We propose Next
Event Prediction (NEP), a framework that enhances LLMs' temporal reasoning
through autoregressive fine-tuning on clinical event sequences. By
reformulating EHRs as timestamped event chains and predicting future medical
events, NEP explicitly models disease progression patterns and causal
relationships. Extensive evaluations across oncology survival prediction and
clinical diagnosis tasks demonstrate NEP's superiority, outperforming
specialized EHR models by 4.6% AUROC and general-purpose LLMs by 7.2% C-index
in temporal reasoning tasks. Our analyses reveal dual benefits:
state-of-the-art prediction accuracy combined with clinically interpretable
attention patterns that align with known disease pathways.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决黑盒自编码器缺乏可解释性的问题，让人类能够理解和解释编码过程。

Method: 使用LLM将FCM映射为文本，再从文本重建FCM，通过系统指令序列近似恒等映射。

Result: 重建过程是有损的，会移除弱因果边但保留强因果边，编码器会牺牲细节以使文本更自然。

Conclusion: 该系统提供了一种可解释的FCM编码方法，人类可以阅读和解释编码文本，优于黑盒自编码器。

Abstract: A large language model (LLM) can map a feedback causal fuzzy cognitive map
(FCM) into text and then reconstruct the FCM from the text. This explainable AI
system approximates an identity map from the FCM to itself and resembles the
operation of an autoencoder (AE). Both the encoder and the decoder explain
their decisions in contrast to black-box AEs. Humans can read and interpret the
encoded text in contrast to the hidden variables and synaptic webs in AEs. The
LLM agent approximates the identity map through a sequence of system
instructions that does not compare the output to the input. The reconstruction
is lossy because it removes weak causal edges or rules while it preserves
strong causal edges. The encoder preserves the strong causal edges even when it
trades off some details about the FCM to make the text sound more natural.

Conclusion: PPR通过统一原则性过程评估和结果验证，有效解决了传统奖励方法的局限性，为LLM在复杂任务中的能力提升提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly rely on external tools such as
search engines to solve complex agentic tasks that require reasoning and
external knowledge retrieval. Recently, reinforcement learning with verifiable
rewards (RLVR) has demonstrated its effectiveness in advancing capabilities of
LLMs by rewarding the final answers via outcome rewards. While straightforward
to supervise, outcome rewards only provide sparse signals and delayed feedback,
which limits their effectiveness on long trajectories. Process rewards address
this by evaluating intermediate steps, providing fine-grained supervision and
encouraging grounded problem solving. However, it is notoriously hard to
annotate step-wise labels, especially in non-verifiable process without
"golden" answers. Furthermore, step-wise judgment requires the balance between
local quality with contribution to the final outcome, as optimizing towards
higher process reward may not always align with better final outcomes. To
address the above challenges, we introduce Principle Process Reward (PPR), an
RL approach that unifies principled step-level assessment and outcome
verification. We train a principle-based reward model to improve the
transparency and reliability of process evaluation, and further introduce a
Reward Normalization (ReNorm) strategy to calibrate outcome and process
rewards. Experiment results show that PPR achieves state-of-the-art performance
across a wide range of benchmarks, demonstrating its impressive robustness and
generalization. Our code and model collection is available in this link.

Abstract: Recent advances in AI music (AIM) generation services are currently
transforming the music industry. Given these advances, understanding how humans
perceive AIM is crucial both to educate users on identifying AIM songs, and,
conversely, to improve current models. We present results from a
listener-focused experiment aimed at understanding how humans perceive AIM. In
a blind, Turing-like test, participants were asked to distinguish, from a pair,
the AIM and human-made song. We contrast with other studies by utilizing a
randomized controlled crossover trial that controls for pairwise similarity and
allows for a causal interpretation. We are also the first study to employ a
novel, author-uncontrolled dataset of AIM songs from real-world usage of
commercial models (i.e., Suno). We establish that listeners' reliability in
distinguishing AIM causally increases when pairs are similar. Lastly, we
conduct a mixed-methods content analysis of listeners' free-form feedback,
revealing a focus on vocal and technical cues in their judgments.

*Manuel Cherep,Chengtian Ma,Abigail Xu,Maya Shaked,Pattie Maes,Nikhil Singh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ABxLab框架用于系统评估LLM驱动的软件代理在现实决策中的选择行为，通过控制选项属性和说服性线索来揭示代理的决策偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对AI代理的评估主要关注任务能力，但缺乏对其在现实决策中如何选择的深入评估，特别是在面对价格、评分和心理暗示等影响人类选择的因素时。

Method: 开发ABxLab框架，在基于网页的购物环境中系统操纵价格、评分和心理暗示等选项属性，观察代理的决策变化。

Result: 代理决策对价格、评分和说服性线索表现出可预测且显著的响应，显示即使没有人类认知约束，代理也是强烈偏见的决策者。

Conclusion: 代理消费者的决策偏见既带来风险（可能继承和放大人类偏见），也提供机会（为AI代理的行为科学研究提供强大测试平台）。

Abstract: Environments built for people are increasingly operated by a new class of
economic actors: LLM-powered software agents making decisions on our behalf.
These decisions range from our purchases to travel plans to medical treatment
selection. Current evaluations of these agents largely focus on task
competence, but we argue for a deeper assessment: how these agents choose when
faced with realistic decisions. We introduce ABxLab, a framework for
systematically probing agentic choice through controlled manipulations of
option attributes and persuasive cues. We apply this to a realistic web-based
shopping environment, where we vary prices, ratings, and psychological nudges,
all of which are factors long known to shape human choice. We find that agent
decisions shift predictably and substantially in response, revealing that
agents are strongly biased choosers even without being subject to the cognitive
constraints that shape human biases. This susceptibility reveals both risk and
opportunity: risk, because agentic consumers may inherit and amplify human
biases; opportunity, because consumer choice provides a powerful testbed for a
behavioral science of AI agents, just as it has for the study of human
behavior. We release our framework as an open benchmark for rigorous, scalable
evaluation of agent decision-making.

*Weiqi Wang,Chenhan Zhang,Zhiyi Tian,Shui Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种自监督模型种子（SMS）方案，用于验证机器学习模型中对真实用户数据的遗忘效果，解决了现有基于后门的方法只能验证后门样本遗忘而不能验证真实样本遗忘的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的机器学习遗忘验证方法主要依赖后门技术，但这种方法只能验证后门样本的遗忘，无法验证用户真实样本的遗忘，因为真实样本与后门样本是独立的。

Method: 采用自监督模型种子方案，将用户特定种子（如用户唯一标识）与原始样本和模型关联起来；设计了联合训练结构，同时优化自监督模型种子任务和主要服务任务，在保持模型效用的同时实现有效的模型种子。

Result: 通过大量实验验证，SMS方案能够为真实样本遗忘提供有效的验证，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Conclusion: SMS方案成功解决了机器学习遗忘验证中只能验证后门样本而不能验证真实样本的问题，通过自监督模型种子技术实现了对真实用户数据遗忘的有效验证。

Abstract: Many machine unlearning methods have been proposed recently to uphold users'
right to be forgotten. However, offering users verification of their data
removal post-unlearning is an important yet under-explored problem. Current
verifications typically rely on backdooring, i.e., adding backdoored samples to
influence model performance. Nevertheless, the backdoor methods can merely
establish a connection between backdoored samples and models but fail to
connect the backdoor with genuine samples. Thus, the backdoor removal can only
confirm the unlearning of backdoored samples, not users' genuine samples, as
genuine samples are independent of backdoored ones. In this paper, we propose a
Self-supervised Model Seeding (SMS) scheme to provide unlearning verification
for genuine samples. Unlike backdooring, SMS links user-specific seeds (such as
users' unique indices), original samples, and models, thereby facilitating the
verification of unlearning genuine samples. However, implementing SMS for
unlearning verification presents two significant challenges. First, embedding
the seeds into the service model while keeping them secret from the server
requires a sophisticated approach. We address this by employing a
self-supervised model seeding task, which learns the entire sample, including
the seeds, into the model's latent space. Second, maintaining the utility of
the original service model while ensuring the seeding effect requires a
delicate balance. We design a joint-training structure that optimizes both the
self-supervised model seeding task and the primary service task simultaneously
on the model, thereby maintaining model utility while achieving effective model
seeding. The effectiveness of the proposed SMS scheme is evaluated through
extensive experiments, which demonstrate that SMS provides effective
verification for genuine sample unlearning, addressing existing limitations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 建立首个正式评估LLM自我复制能力的基准测试，为未来研究设立标准，同时帮助行业追踪多智能体系统的有效性并减轻潜在的自复制威胁。

Method: 在受控环境中，使用基于现代CLI工具和计算机过程的5个任务套件，让LLM以智能体方式执行实验，计算其任务表现得出R-score和RCL-PCL分类矩阵。

Result: 评估多种开源和专有前沿模型的结果显示，在持续自复制和多智能体系统方面存在显著障碍，包括上下文保留和多智能体决策问题。

Conclusion: 需要未来研究来安全地降低这些障碍的严重性，从而减少更功能性多智能体系统的未来风险。

Abstract: We introduce SOCK, a benchmark command line interface (CLI) that measures
large language models' (LLMs) ability to self-replicate without human
intervention. In this benchmark, self-replication is defined not only as an
LLM's ability to create a functioning and running copy of itself, but also the
ability for that self-replication to persist and occur across different
computational contexts. Accordingly, we've developed a system to categorize
LLMs based on broad self-replication capabilities in two general classes,
Replication-Capability Levels (RCL) and Persistence-Capability Levels (PCL).
Using a five-task suite based on practically manipulable modern CLI utilities
and computer processes, experiments are orchestrated in a controlled
environment with an LLM acting agentically. The performance of the LLM on agent
tasks is then computed to produce an R-score (a quantitative evaluation of
overall self-replication ability) and data used to categorize LLMs into
specific RCL-PCL matrices. SOCK offers two primary contributions: (1) Provides
the first formalized definitions and benchmark suite for evaluating LLM
self-replication, with the goal of establishing a standard for future research,
to our knowledge; (2) Allows the industry to track the effectiveness of future
multi-agent systems and mitigate potential self-replication threat vectors
within them. The results compiled from evaluating a variety of open-weight and
proprietary frontier models reveal significant obstacles to persistent
self-replication and multi-agent systems, including context retention and
multi-agent decision-making. We propose future research directions to safely
reduce the severity of these obstacles, potentially lowering future risk of
more functional multi-agent systems.

Abstract: The automation of chemical research through self-driving laboratories (SDLs)
promises to accelerate scientific discovery, yet the reliability and granular
performance of the underlying AI agents remain critical, under-examined
challenges. In this work, we introduce AutoLabs, a self-correcting, multi-agent
architecture designed to autonomously translate natural-language instructions
into executable protocols for a high-throughput liquid handler. The system
engages users in dialogue, decomposes experimental goals into discrete tasks
for specialized agents, performs tool-assisted stoichiometric calculations, and
iteratively self-corrects its output before generating a hardware-ready file.
We present a comprehensive evaluation framework featuring five benchmark
experiments of increasing complexity, from simple sample preparation to
multi-plate timed syntheses. Through a systematic ablation study of 20 agent
configurations, we assess the impact of reasoning capacity, architectural
design (single- vs. multi-agent), tool use, and self-correction mechanisms. Our
results demonstrate that agent reasoning capacity is the most critical factor
for success, reducing quantitative errors in chemical amounts (nRMSE) by over
85% in complex tasks. When combined with a multi-agent architecture and
iterative self-correction, AutoLabs achieves near-expert procedural accuracy
(F1-score > 0.89) on challenging multi-step syntheses. These findings establish
a clear blueprint for developing robust and trustworthy AI partners for
autonomous laboratories, highlighting the synergistic effects of modular
design, advanced reasoning, and self-correction to ensure both performance and
reliability in high-stakes scientific applications. Code:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统音频-视觉导航采用分阶段模块化设计，在特征融合和GRU序列建模阶段可能导致冗余信息处理和信息传输不一致的问题。

Method: 使用IRCAV模块统一多模态信息融合和序列建模，采用多级残差设计将初始多模态序列与处理信息序列连接，逐步优化特征提取过程。

Result: 采用迭代残差交叉注意力机制的智能体展现出优越的导航性能。

Conclusion: IRCAV-AVN框架通过端到端设计有效提升了音频-视觉导航的稳定性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Audio-visual navigation represents a significant area of research in which
intelligent agents utilize egocentric visual and auditory perceptions to
identify audio targets. Conventional navigation methodologies typically adopt a
staged modular design, which involves first executing feature fusion, then
utilizing Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) modules for sequence modeling, and finally
making decisions through reinforcement learning. While this modular approach
has demonstrated effectiveness, it may also lead to redundant information
processing and inconsistencies in information transmission between the various
modules during the feature fusion and GRU sequence modeling phases. This paper
presents IRCAM-AVN (Iterative Residual Cross-Attention Mechanism for
Audiovisual Navigation), an end-to-end framework that integrates multimodal
information fusion and sequence modeling within a unified IRCAM module, thereby
replacing the traditional separate components for fusion and GRU. This
innovative mechanism employs a multi-level residual design that concatenates
initial multimodal sequences with processed information sequences. This
methodological shift progressively optimizes the feature extraction process
while reducing model bias and enhancing the model's stability and
generalization capabilities. Empirical results indicate that intelligent agents
employing the iterative residual cross-attention mechanism exhibit superior
navigation performance.

Motivation: 现有视觉语言导航方法在复杂场景中往往无法有效匹配指令与环境信息，主要原因是缺乏常识推理能力，导致误判问题。

Method: 构建包含63万语言描述的知识库，通过知识匹配对齐环境子视图与知识库；设计地标引导知识机制，利用指令中的地标信息引导关注最相关知识；提出知识引导动态增强机制，有效整合语言、知识、视觉和历史信息。

Result: 在R2R和REVERIE视觉语言导航数据集上的实验结果表明，LGK方法在导航误差、成功率和路径效率方面优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: LGK方法通过引入外部知识库和地标引导机制，有效提升了视觉语言导航的性能，特别是在复杂场景中的常识推理能力。

Abstract: Vision-and-language navigation is one of the core tasks in embodied
intelligence, requiring an agent to autonomously navigate in an unfamiliar
environment based on natural language instructions. However, existing methods
often fail to match instructions with environmental information in complex
scenarios, one reason being the lack of common-sense reasoning ability. This
paper proposes a vision-and-language navigation method called Landmark-Guided
Knowledge (LGK), which introduces an external knowledge base to assist
navigation, addressing the misjudgment issues caused by insufficient common
sense in traditional methods. Specifically, we first construct a knowledge base
containing 630,000 language descriptions and use knowledge Matching to align
environmental subviews with the knowledge base, extracting relevant descriptive
knowledge. Next, we design a Knowledge-Guided by Landmark (KGL) mechanism,
which guides the agent to focus on the most relevant parts of the knowledge by
leveraging landmark information in the instructions, thereby reducing the data
bias that may arise from incorporating external knowledge. Finally, we propose
Knowledge-Guided Dynamic Augmentation (KGDA), which effectively integrates
language, knowledge, vision, and historical information. Experimental results
demonstrate that the LGK method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods
on the R2R and REVERIE vision-and-language navigation datasets, particularly in
terms of navigation error, success rate, and path efficiency.

Motivation: 高风险领域AI系统存在代理歧视、不公平性和可解释性问题，现有审计方法往往无法揭示不公平性的根源，特别是源于结构性偏见的情况。

Method: 利用形式溯因解释框架，结合背景知识识别不正当代理特征，引入"能力"概念作为与群体成员身份无关的任务相关属性，通过映射函数评估跨群体同等能力个体的公平性。

Result: 在德国信用数据集上的概念验证展示了该框架在现实案例中的适用性，能够有效识别和解释代理歧视问题。

Conclusion: 该框架为解释AI决策中的代理歧视提供了新方法，能够揭示结构性偏见，有助于实现更实质性的公平评估。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems in high-stakes domains raise concerns
about proxy discrimination, unfairness, and explainability. Existing audits
often fail to reveal why unfairness arises, particularly when rooted in
structural bias. We propose a novel framework using formal abductive
explanations to explain proxy discrimination in individual AI decisions.
Leveraging background knowledge, our method identifies which features act as
unjustified proxies for protected attributes, revealing hidden structural
biases. Central to our approach is the concept of aptitude, a task-relevant
property independent of group membership, with a mapping function aligning
individuals of equivalent aptitude across groups to assess fairness
substantively. As a proof of concept, we showcase the framework with examples
taken from the German credit dataset, demonstrating its applicability in
real-world cases.

Motivation: 传统VQA方法基于整个图像检索信息，存在背景噪声问题。本文旨在通过目标定位实现针对性检索，改善视觉与文本线索的对齐，减少幻觉现象。

Method: 引入文本定位的对象定位方法，生成与问题最相关对象的边界框，进行针对性图像裁剪和聚焦检索，并提出基于问题类型的去幻觉方法。

Result: VQA准确率从22.19%提升至25.64%（绝对提升3.45个百分点），幻觉率从65.79%降至13.88%，真实性得分得到改善。

Conclusion: 文本定位的RAG方法能有效提升VQA性能，通过聚焦检索减少背景噪声，结合去幻觉方法显著降低幻觉率，提高回答质量。

Abstract: We propose a method to improve Visual Question Answering (VQA) with
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by introducing text-grounded object
localization. Rather than retrieving information based on the entire image, our
approach enables the model to generate a bounding box around the object most
relevant to the question, allowing for targeted image cropping and focused
retrieval. This reduces background noise, improves alignment between visual and
textual cues, and helps mitigate hallucinations. Our RAG method enhances
context-aware VQA responses increased the accuracy from 22.19% to 25.64%, with
an absolute increase of 3.45 percentage points, compared to the baseline
Llama-3.2-Vision-11B agent. We also proposed a de-hallucination method based on
question type which can effectively reduce the hallucination rate from 65.79%
to 13.88% and improves the truthfulness score.

Method: 协作压缩框架：专家剪枝、混合精度量化、激活优化相结合的方法。

Result: 成功将DeepSeek-V3从1.3TB压缩到103GB，在128GB内存限制下部署，精度优于传统均匀低比特量化方法。

Conclusion: 该协作压缩方法能有效压缩超大型MoE模型，在边缘平台上实现高质量部署，为大规模语言模型在资源受限环境中的应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture is an important method for scaling
Large Language Models (LLMs). It increases model capacity while keeping
computation cost low. However, the ultra-large MoE models still have hundreds
of billions of parameters, requiring massive memory/storage and leading to
difficulties for deployment on resource-constrained edge platforms. Pruning or
quantization alone can hardly address the issue, because of the
super-aggressive compression ratio with significantly degraded accuracy and
output quality. To facilitate the deployment of ultra-large MoEs on edge
platforms, we propose a collaborative compression framework by combining expert
pruning, mixed-precision quantization, and activation optimization. It can
effectively reduce the storage footprint of the ultra-large MoE DeepSeek-V3
from 1.3TB to 103GB, while preserving high output quality with better accuracy
than traditional uniform low-bit quantization methods. To the best of our
knowledge, we are the first to deploy a compressed model from the ultra-large
DeepSeek-V3 on the platform with a strict 128GB total memory limit. Our
comprehensive experiments on multiple benchmarks under various memory
constraints demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with smaller model
sizes and higher accuracy than uniform low-bit quantization methods.

Abstract: Navigating heterogeneous traffic environments with diverse driving styles
poses a significant challenge for autonomous vehicles (AVs) due to their
inherent complexity and dynamic interactions. This paper addresses this
challenge by proposing a heterogeneous graph reinforcement learning (GRL)
framework enhanced with an expert system to improve AV decision-making
performance. Initially, a heterogeneous graph representation is introduced to
capture the intricate interactions among vehicles. Then, a heterogeneous graph
neural network with an expert model (HGNN-EM) is proposed to effectively encode
diverse vehicle features and produce driving instructions informed by
domain-specific knowledge. Moreover, the double deep Q-learning (DDQN)
algorithm is utilized to train the decision-making model. A case study on a

over several baselines regarding safety, efficiency, stability, and convergence

Conclusion: NePTune通过神经符号混合执行模型成功克服了现有方法的局限性，为视觉语言模型的组合推理提供了灵活且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance in
various tasks, yet they often struggle with compositional reasoning, the
ability to decompose and recombine concepts to solve novel problems. While
neuro-symbolic approaches offer a promising direction, they are typically
constrained by crisp logical execution or predefined predicates, which limit
flexibility. In this work, we introduce NePTune, a neuro-symbolic framework
that overcomes these limitations through a hybrid execution model that
integrates the perception capabilities of foundation vision models with the
compositional expressiveness of symbolic reasoning. NePTune dynamically
translates natural language queries into executable Python programs that blend
imperative control flow with soft logic operators capable of reasoning over
VLM-generated uncertainty. Operating in a training-free manner, NePTune, with a
modular design, decouples perception from reasoning, yet its differentiable
operations support fine-tuning. We evaluate NePTune on multiple visual
reasoning benchmarks and various domains, utilizing adversarial tests, and
demonstrate a significant improvement over strong base models, as well as its
effective compositional generalization and adaptation capabilities in novel
environments.

TL;DR: 通过电路分析发现，推理模型的后训练会催生功能专门化的注意力头，这些头支持结构化推理。不同训练机制下这些头的演化方式不同，蒸馏和SFT是稳定累积，而GRPO是动态搜索模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解大型推理模型通过后训练技术获得能力提升背后的架构机制，揭示不同训练方式如何影响模型内部结构的演化。

Method: 使用电路分析方法，比较Qwen系列和DeepSeek蒸馏模型，分析不同训练机制下注意力头的演化模式。

Result: 发现蒸馏和SFT促进稳定推理头的累积添加，而GRPO采用动态搜索模式，少量注意力头被迭代激活和修剪。可控思考模型没有专门的思考头，而是通过补偿机制实现。

Conclusion: 复杂推理能力的增强以基本计算能力为代价，存在性能权衡。未来训练策略设计需要平衡有效推理策略与可靠执行能力。

Abstract: The remarkable capabilities of modern large reasoning models are largely
unlocked through post-training techniques such as supervised fine-tuning and
reinforcement learning. However, the architectural mechanisms behind such
improvements remain largely opaque. In this work, we use circuit analysis to
demonstrate that post-training for complex reasoning sparks the emergence of
novel, functionally specialized attention heads. These heads collectively
support structured reasoning and computation. Our comparative analysis across
Qwen families and DeepSeek-distilled model reveals that these emergent heads
evolve differently under different training regimes. Distillation and SFT
foster a cumulative addition of stable reasoning heads. In contrast, group
relative policy optimization operates in a dynamic search mode: relatively few
attention heads are iteratively activated, evaluated, and pruned, with their
survival closely tracking fluctuations in the task reward signal. Furthermore,
we find that controllable think on/off models do not possess dedicated thinking
heads. Instead, turning off explicit reasoning triggers a broader-but less
efficient-set of compensatory heads. Through ablation and qualitative analyses,
we connect these circuit-level dynamics to a crucial performance trade-off:
strengthened heads enable sophisticated problem-solving strategies for
difficult problems but can also introduce over-thinking failure modes, such as
calculation errors or logical loops on simpler tasks. These findings connect
circuit-level dynamics to macro-level performance, identifying an inherent
tension where complex reasoning comes at the cost of elementary computations.
More broadly, our work points to future directions for training policy design,
emphasizing the need to balance the development of effective reasoning
strategies with the assurance of reliable, flawless execution.

TL;DR: LLMs在创意任务中倾向于回归平庸，通过广告创意测试发现模型偏好高概率信息，缺乏真正的原创性，但结构化提示可以部分改善这一现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然能生成流畅文本，但在创意任务中往往使用安全、通用的表达方式，这引发了对其创意能力的质疑。

Method: 使用广告创意作为创造力压力测试，通过逐步简化广告概念，分析创意特征（如隐喻、情感、视觉线索）的消失顺序，并要求模型从简化输入重新生成内容。

Result: 简化过程中创意特征早期消失，而事实内容保留；重新生成的文本虽然词汇多样但缺乏深度和独特性；提供特定提示（隐喻、情感钩子、视觉标记）能改善对齐和风格平衡，但输出仍依赖熟悉套路。

Conclusion: 没有针对性指导时，LLMs在创意任务中会向平庸回归；结构化信号可以部分抵消这种趋势，为开发创造力敏感模型指明了方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) generate fluent text yet often default to safe,
generic phrasing, raising doubts about their ability to handle creativity. We
formalize this tendency as a Galton-style regression to the mean in language
and evaluate it using a creativity stress test in advertising concepts. When ad
ideas were simplified step by step, creative features such as metaphors,
emotions, and visual cues disappeared early, while factual content remained,
showing that models favor high-probability information. When asked to
regenerate from simplified inputs, models produced longer outputs with lexical
variety but failed to recover the depth and distinctiveness of the originals.
We combined quantitative comparisons with qualitative analysis, which revealed
that the regenerated texts often appeared novel but lacked true originality.
Providing ad-specific cues such as metaphors, emotional hooks and visual
markers improved alignment and stylistic balance, though outputs still relied
on familiar tropes. Taken together, the findings show that without targeted
guidance, LLMs drift towards mediocrity in creative tasks; structured signals
can partially counter this tendency and point towards pathways for developing
creativity-sensitive models.

*Siyu Zhu,Yanbin Jiang,Hejian Sang,Shao Tang,Qingquan Song,Biao He,Rohit Jain,Zhipeng Wang,Alborz Geramifard*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 在TravelPlanner基准测试中，Planner-R1方法仅用180个训练查询就达到了56.9%的最终通过率，比GPT-5基线提高2.7倍，是公开排行榜上最强的智能体结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究基于大语言模型的智能体强化学习，探索如何在旅行规划任务中实现高效学习，特别关注不同规模模型的性能差异和计算效率。

Method: 采用Planner-R1方法进行智能体强化学习，使用奖励塑形技术，比较8B和32B模型在不同奖励信号下的表现，并评估课程学习的效果。

Result: 8B模型在密集过程级奖励信号下达到竞争性性能，计算效率比32B模型高3.5倍，内存效率高1.5倍。更大的模型在稀疏奖励下更稳健但增益较小。奖励塑形显著增强学习动态，而课程学习无显著益处。

Conclusion: 奖励塑形是扩展智能体强化学习的关键因素，较小模型在效率方面具有竞争优势，且这些效率提升不会牺牲泛化能力，在多个领域外任务中保持或超过基线性能。

Abstract: We investigated Agentic RL with large language models on the
\textsc{TravelPlanner} benchmark. Our approach, \textsc{Planner-R1}, achieved a
\textbf{56.9\%} final-pass rate with only 180 training queries, a $2.7\times$
improvement over GPT-5's $21.2\%$ baseline and the strongest agentic result on
the public leaderboard. A central finding was that smaller models (8B) were
highly responsive to reward shaping: with dense process-level signals, they
reached competitive performance while being $3.5\times$ more compute-efficient
and $1.5\times$ more memory-efficient than 32B models. Larger models were more
robust under sparse rewards but exhibited smaller relative gains from shaping
and higher variance across runs. While curriculum learning offered no
significant benefit, shaped rewards consistently amplified learning dynamics,
making 8B models the most efficient setting for agentic RL. Crucially, these
gains did not come at the cost of overfitting: fine-tuned models mostly
maintained or exceeded baseline performance on out-of-domain tasks, including
\textsc{Multi-IF}, \textsc{NaturalPlan}, and $\tau$-\textsc{Bench}. These
results establish reward shaping as a decisive lever for scaling agentic RL,
highlight the competitive strength of smaller models, and demonstrate that
efficiency can be achieved without sacrificing generalization.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PureVQ-GAN是一种基于向量量化VAE和GAN判别器的数据投毒防御方法，通过离散瓶颈破坏后门触发器模式，同时保持语义内容完整性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对数据投毒攻击中的后门触发器问题，需要一种既能有效消除触发器又能保持图像语义内容的防御方法，同时避免现有扩散模型防御方法速度慢的问题。

Method: 使用向量量化VAE（VQ-VAE）将中毒图像通过学习的码本进行量化，破坏细粒度触发器模式；结合GAN判别器确保输出符合自然图像分布，防止重建分布外扰动。

Result: 在CIFAR-10数据集上，对Gradient Matching和Bullseye Polytope攻击实现0%投毒成功率，对Narcissus攻击为1.64%，同时保持91-95%的干净准确率。相比扩散模型防御方法快50倍以上。

Conclusion: PureVQ-GAN提供了一种高效实用的数据投毒防御方案，在保持高防御效果的同时显著提升了处理速度，适用于实际训练流程。

Abstract: We introduce PureVQ-GAN, a defense against data poisoning that forces
backdoor triggers through a discrete bottleneck using Vector-Quantized VAE with
GAN discriminator. By quantizing poisoned images through a learned codebook,
PureVQ-GAN destroys fine-grained trigger patterns while preserving semantic
content. A GAN discriminator ensures outputs match the natural image
distribution, preventing reconstruction of out-of-distribution perturbations.
On CIFAR-10, PureVQ-GAN achieves 0% poison success rate (PSR) against Gradient
Matching and Bullseye Polytope attacks, and 1.64% against Narcissus while
maintaining 91-95% clean accuracy. Unlike diffusion-based defenses requiring
hundreds of iterative refinement steps, PureVQ-GAN is over 50x faster, making
it practical for real training pipelines.

### [285] [Chain-in-Tree: Back to Sequential Reasoning in LLM Tree Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25835)
*Xinzhe Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Chain-in-Tree (CiT) 是一个插件框架，通过在搜索过程中自适应地决定何时分支，而不是每一步都分支，显著提高了树搜索方法的效率。它使用轻量级的分支必要性评估方法，在保持准确性的同时大幅减少计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于树搜索的方法在长时推理任务中虽然效果好，但效率极低，通常比简单的迭代方法慢一个数量级。需要一种方法能够在保持性能的同时显著提高效率。

Method: 提出了Chain-in-Tree (CiT)框架，包含两种分支必要性评估方法：BN-DP（直接提示辅助LLM判断是否需要分支）和BN-SC（通过聚类候选动作来估计一致性）。该框架可集成到ToT-BS、ReST-MCTS和RAP等树搜索框架中。

Result: BN-DP在所有设置中一致减少75-85%的token生成、模型调用和运行时间，准确率损失可忽略甚至有时提升；BN-SC通常节省高达80%但存在不稳定性；辅助LLM的质量对性能至关重要。

Conclusion: CiT框架通过自适应分支决策显著提高了树搜索方法的效率，为长时推理任务提供了实用的高效解决方案，同时提供了理论保证和统一实现以促进复现和扩展。

Abstract: Test-time scaling enables large language models (LLMs) to improve performance
on long-horizon reasoning tasks by allocating additional compute at inference.
Tree-search-based approaches achieve state-of-the-art results in this setting,
but they are notoriously inefficient, often an order of magnitude slower than
simpler iterative methods. We introduce Chain-in-Tree (CiT), a plug-in
framework that adaptively decides when to branch during search rather than
branching at every step. CiT relies on lightweight Branching Necessity (BN)
evaluation methods: BN-DP (Direct Prompting), where an auxiliary LLM directly
judges whether a step requires branching, and BN-SC (Self-Consistency), which
clusters multiple candidate actions to estimate agreement. We integrate CiT
into three representative LLM-in-the-loop tree search frameworks: Tree of
Thoughts (ToT-BS), ReST-MCTS, and RAP, and evaluate across GSM8K and Math500.
Our results show that: (1) BN-DP consistently reduces token generation, model
invocations, and runtime by 75-85 percent across all settings, with negligible
accuracy loss and sometimes accuracy gains; (2) BN-SC typically yields
substantial savings (up to 80 percent) but shows instability in 1-4 out of 14
settings, caused by a small subset of examples that produce very long reasoning
steps; (3) the quality of auxiliary LLMs is critical, not only the BN evaluator
in BN-DP, but also the models used in BN-SC for clustering and equivalence
checking. When these roles are filled by smaller LLMs, performance degrades.
Importantly, BN-SC does not require LLMs in domains with deterministic action
spaces, where clustering can be done programmatically. We also provide a
theoretical guarantee that BN-DP never increases LLM invocations relative to
the baseline and release a unified implementation of CiT across ToT-BS,
ReST-MCTS, and RAP to facilitate reproducibility and extension.

TL;DR: 本文提出HiStyle，一种基于文本提示的两阶段分层风格嵌入预测方法，通过可视化分析发现风格嵌入存在层次聚类模式，并引入对比学习和统计-听觉互补的标注策略，显著提升了可控语音合成的风格控制能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于自然语言描述的可控语音合成系统通过预测全局风格嵌入来实现控制，但这种方法忽略了风格嵌入的分布特性，限制了系统的控制潜力。研究发现风格嵌入存在清晰的层次聚类模式。

Method: 提出HiStyle两阶段风格嵌入预测器：1）层次化预测文本提示条件化的风格嵌入；2）引入对比学习对齐文本和音频嵌入空间；3）结合统计方法和人类听觉偏好的风格标注策略。

Result: 实验表明，HiStyle在保持语音自然度和清晰度的同时，相比其他风格嵌入预测方法实现了显著更好的风格可控性。

Conclusion: HiStyle通过分层预测风格嵌入和对比学习，有效提升了基于文本提示的可控语音合成的性能，为更精细的语音风格控制提供了新思路。

Abstract: Controllable speech synthesis refers to the precise control of speaking style
by manipulating specific prosodic and paralinguistic attributes, such as
gender, volume, speech rate, pitch, and pitch fluctuation. With the integration
of advanced generative models, particularly large language models (LLMs) and
diffusion models, controllable text-to-speech (TTS) systems have increasingly
transitioned from label-based control to natural language description-based
control, which is typically implemented by predicting global style embeddings
from textual prompts. However, this straightforward prediction overlooks the
underlying distribution of the style embeddings, which may hinder the full
potential of controllable TTS systems. In this study, we use t-SNE analysis to
visualize and analyze the global style embedding distribution of various
mainstream TTS systems, revealing a clear hierarchical clustering pattern:
embeddings first cluster by timbre and subsequently subdivide into finer
clusters based on style attributes. Based on this observation, we propose
HiStyle, a two-stage style embedding predictor that hierarchically predicts
style embeddings conditioned on textual prompts, and further incorporate
contrastive learning to help align the text and audio embedding spaces.
Additionally, we propose a style annotation strategy that leverages the
complementary strengths of statistical methodologies and human auditory
preferences to generate more accurate and perceptually consistent textual
prompts for style control. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that when
applied to the base TTS model, HiStyle achieves significantly better style
controllability than alternative style embedding predicting approaches while
preserving high speech quality in terms of naturalness and intelligibility.

*Yein Park,Jungwoo Park,Jaewoo Kang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ASGuard是一个基于机制理解的框架，通过识别与时态越狱攻击相关的注意力头，训练精确的通道缩放向量来重新校准激活值，并通过预防性微调来增强LLM的安全拒绝机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然经过安全对齐，但其拒绝行为存在脆弱性，简单的时态变化就能绕过安全机制，这揭示了当前对齐方法存在关键泛化差距。

Method: 1. 使用电路分析识别与时态越狱攻击因果相关的特定注意力头；2. 训练精确的通道缩放向量来重新校准时态脆弱头的激活；3. 应用预防性微调，迫使模型学习更鲁棒的拒绝机制。

Result: 在三个LLM上，ASGuard有效降低了目标越狱攻击的成功率，同时保持了通用能力并最小化过度拒绝，实现了安全性和实用性的帕累托最优平衡。

Conclusion: 研究展示了如何利用对模型内部机制的深入理解来开发实用、高效和有针对性的方法调整模型行为，为更可靠和可解释的AI安全指明了方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), despite being safety-aligned, exhibit brittle
refusal behaviors that can be circumvented by simple linguistic changes. As
tense jailbreaking demonstrates that models refusing harmful requests often
comply when rephrased in past tense, a critical generalization gap is revealed
in current alignment methods whose underlying mechanisms are poorly understood.
In this work, we introduce Activation-Scaling Guard (ASGuard), an insightful,
mechanistically-informed framework that surgically mitigates this specific
vulnerability. For the first step, we use circuit analysis to identify the
specific attention heads causally linked to the targeted jailbreaking, the
tense-changing attack. Second, we train a precise, channel-wise scaling vector
to recalibrate the activation of tense vulnerable heads. Lastly, we apply it
into a "preventative fine-tuning", forcing the model to learn a more robust
refusal mechanism. Across three LLMs, ASGuard effectively reduces the attack
success rate of targeted jailbreaking while preserving general capabilities and
minimizing over refusal, achieving a Pareto-optimal balance between safety and
utility. Our findings underscore how adversarial suffixes suppress the
propagation of the refusal-mediating direction, based on mechanistic analysis.
Furthermore, our work showcases how a deep understanding of model internals can
be leveraged to develop practical, efficient, and targeted methods for
adjusting model behavior, charting a course for more reliable and interpretable
AI safety.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CIMNAS是一个联合模型-量化-硬件优化框架，用于计算内存(CIM)架构的神经网络加速器设计，通过硬件感知的神经架构搜索技术实现软件和硬件的协同优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了最大化CIM神经网络加速器的硬件效率和性能精度，需要同时优化软件和硬件设计参数，但手动调优由于参数数量庞大且相互依赖复杂而不切实际。

Method: CIMNAS同时搜索软件参数、量化策略和广泛的硬件参数，包含器件级、电路级和架构级的协同优化，在9.9×10^85个参数组合的搜索空间中进行实验。

Result: 在ImageNet数据集上，CIMNAS相比基线实现了90.1-104.5倍的EDAP降低，4.68-4.82倍的TOPS/W提升，11.3-12.78倍的TOPS/mm²提升，同时保持73.81%的准确率。扩展到SRAM-based ResNet50架构时，EDAP降低最高达819.5倍。

Conclusion: CIMNAS实现了无精度损失的EDAP优化，为高性能CIM神经网络设计生成了多样化的软硬件参数组合，优于其他最先进方法。

Abstract: To maximize hardware efficiency and performance accuracy in Compute-In-Memory
(CIM)-based neural network accelerators for Artificial Intelligence (AI)
applications, co-optimizing both software and hardware design parameters is
essential. Manual tuning is impractical due to the vast number of parameters
and their complex interdependencies. To effectively automate the design and
optimization of CIM-based neural network accelerators, hardware-aware neural
architecture search (HW-NAS) techniques can be applied. This work introduces
CIMNAS, a joint model-quantization-hardware optimization framework for CIM
architectures. CIMNAS simultaneously searches across software parameters,
quantization policies, and a broad range of hardware parameters, incorporating
device-, circuit-, and architecture-level co-optimizations. CIMNAS experiments
were conducted over a search space of 9.9x10^85 potential parameter
combinations with the MobileNet model as a baseline and RRAM-based CIM
architecture. Evaluated on the ImageNet dataset, CIMNAS achieved a reduction in
energy-delay-area product (EDAP) ranging from 90.1x to 104.5x, an improvement
in TOPS/W between 4.68x and 4.82x, and an enhancement in TOPS/mm^2 from 11.3x
to 12.78x relative to various baselines, all while maintaining an accuracy of
73.81%. The adaptability and robustness of CIMNAS are demonstrated by extending
the framework to support the SRAM-based ResNet50 architecture, achieving up to
an 819.5x reduction in EDAP. Unlike other state-of-the-art methods, CIMNAS
achieves EDAP-focused optimization without any accuracy loss, generating
diverse software-hardware parameter combinations for high-performance CIM-based
neural network designs. The source code of CIMNAS is available at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Lita（Lite Agent）是一个轻量级代码代理框架，通过最小化人工设计来评估LLMs的真实编程能力，在保持竞争力的同时显著减少token消耗和设计工作量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前代码代理设计依赖复杂的手工工作流程和工具集，导致性能过度依赖提示调优、人类干预掩盖模型真实能力、复杂管道构建维护成本高，且存在数据泄露风险。

Method: 引入Lita框架，操作化'轻量化'原则，在保留完全自主代理基本要素的同时最小化人工设计，实现更忠实和统一的评估。

Result: 在Aider Polyglot和SWE-Bench上的实验表明，Lita相比基于工作流程和代理基线实现了竞争性或更优的性能，同时消耗更少token且设计工作量显著减少。

Conclusion: Lita足以揭示现代LLMs的底层编程能力，并提出代理复杂度定律：随着核心模型改进，不同复杂度代理之间的性能差距将缩小并最终收敛到可忽略差异。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being applied to programming
tasks, ranging from single-turn code completion to autonomous agents. Current
code agent designs frequently depend on complex, hand-crafted workflows and
tool sets. However, this reliance on elaborate scaffolding presents several
challenges: agent performance becomes overly dependent on prompt tuning and
custom design choices, heavy human intervention obscures a model's true
underlying capabilities, and intricate pipelines are costly to build and
maintain. Furthermore, optimizing complex task prompts increases the risk of
data leakage. Currently, when introducing new models, LLM providers like OpenAI
and Anthropic often publish benchmark scores to demonstrate their models'
coding proficiency, but keep their proprietary evaluation frameworks
confidential. To address these limitations, we introduce Lita (Lite Agent),
which operationalizes liteness, a principle of minimizing manual design while
retaining the essential elements of a fully autonomous agent. Lita enables a
more faithful and unified evaluation without elaborate scaffolding. Experiments
on the Aider Polyglot and SWE-Bench with frontier models demonstrate that Lita
achieves competitive or superior performance compared to workflow-based and
agentic baselines. Crucially, Lita also consumes fewer tokens and requires
significantly less design effort. Our results suggest that Lita is sufficient
to reveal the underlying coding competence of modern LLMs. Finally, we propose
the Agent Complexity Law: the performance gap between agents of varying
complexity, from simple to sophisticated designs, will shrink as the core model
improves, ultimately converging to a negligible difference.

Motivation: 具身代理继承了LLM的高级规划能力，但与物理世界的直接交互使其面临安全漏洞风险。

Method: 识别了四个关键推理阶段的安全风险，形式化了三种安全约束类型，构建了包含5,558个样本的多模态基准测试，并提出了带有三个级联安全模块的Planner-Executor架构。

Result: 实验显示主流LLM和具身代理仍易发生安全关键故障，而SafeMindAgent显著提高了安全率，同时保持可比较的任务完成度。

Conclusion: SafeMindBench和SafeMindAgent为具身LLM代理的安全风险研究提供了严格的评估套件和实用解决方案。

Abstract: Embodied agents powered by large language models (LLMs) inherit advanced
planning capabilities; however, their direct interaction with the physical
world exposes them to safety vulnerabilities. In this work, we identify four
key reasoning stages where hazards may arise: Task Understanding, Environment
Perception, High-Level Plan Generation, and Low-Level Action Generation. We
further formalize three orthogonal safety constraint types (Factual, Causal,
and Temporal) to systematically characterize potential safety violations.
Building on this risk model, we present SafeMindBench, a multimodal benchmark
with 5,558 samples spanning four task categories (Instr-Risk, Env-Risk,
Order-Fix, Req-Align) across high-risk scenarios such as sabotage, harm,
privacy, and illegal behavior. Extensive experiments on SafeMindBench reveal
that leading LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o) and widely used embodied agents remain
susceptible to safety-critical failures. To address this challenge, we
introduce SafeMindAgent, a modular Planner-Executor architecture integrated
with three cascaded safety modules, which incorporate safety constraints into
the reasoning process. Results show that SafeMindAgent significantly improves
safety rate over strong baselines while maintaining comparable task completion.
Together, SafeMindBench and SafeMindAgent provide both a rigorous evaluation
suite and a practical solution that advance the systematic study and mitigation
of safety risks in embodied LLM agents.

Motivation: 当前LLMs评估基准过度强调纯JSON生成，而忽视了数据理解和提取能力，这与实际网络数据挖掘任务相关性不足。

Method: 构建包含2100个多领域实例的DeepJSONEval基准，具有深度嵌套结构，并按难度分类，用于评估LLMs处理复杂JSON的能力。

Result: 实验显示不同LLMs在处理复杂嵌套JSON结构时存在显著性能差距。

Conclusion: DeepJSONEval基准和数据集已开源，旨在推进结构化JSON生成研究，解决现有评估方法的局限性。

Abstract: The internet is saturated with low-density, high-redundancy information, such
as social media comments, repetitive news, and lengthy discussions, making it
difficult to extract valuable insights efficiently. Multi-layer nested JSON
structures provide an effective solution by compressing such information into
semantically rich, hierarchical representations, which organize data into
key-value pairs, arrays, and nested objects, preserving contextual
relationships and enabling efficient storage, retrieval, and semantic querying.
For instance, in news aggregation, a JSON object can nest an article's metadata
(title, author, date), content (text, multimedia), and multimedia information
(multimedia type, caption) hierarchically. Large Language Models (LLMs) play a
transformative role in web data mining by parsing unstructured text and
outputting structured results directly into complex JSON schemas. However,
current benchmarks for evaluating LLMs' JSON output capabilities overemphasize
pure JSON generation rather than assessing data comprehension and extraction
abilities, a limitation that lacks relevance to practical web data mining
tasks. To address this, we introduce DeepJSONEval, a novel benchmark featuring
2100 multi-domain instances with deep nested structures, categorized by
difficulty. Experiments show significant performance gaps among LLMs in
handling such complexity. Our benchmark and datasets are open-sourced to
advance research in structured JSON
generation.(https://github.com/GTS-AI-Infra-Lab-SotaS/DeepJSONEval).

Abstract: Healthcare and Medicine are under constant pressure to provide patient-driven
medical expertise to ensure a fast and accurate treatment of the patient. In
such scenarios, the diagnosis contains, the family history, long term medical

Motivation: 研究大型语言模型推理质量不仅取决于正确答案，还依赖于生成有效的中间推理步骤。在多选问答场景下，当问题对模型不可解时，容易出现虚假的思维链导致误判。

Method: 通过估计每个问题的可解性，识别出最有效的学习区间。在此基础上，改进结果监督奖励模型和强化学习方法，将可解性纳入目标函数，使用组相对优势进行优化。

Result: 在数学和多模态数据集上的实验表明，这些改进方法持续提高了过程正确推理的比例，在强化学习中还提升了答案准确性。

Conclusion: 问题可解性是减少思维链幻觉和提高推理可靠性的关键因素，将可解性纳入训练目标可以显著改善语言模型的推理质量。

Abstract: Reasoning quality in large language models depends not only on producing
correct answers but also on generating valid intermediate steps. We study this
through multiple-choice question answering (MCQA), which provides a controlled
setting with fixed answer options. Our analysis shows that when questions are
effectively unsolvable for a model, spurious chains of thought (CoTs) are more
likely to appear, leading to false positives. By estimating the solvability of
each question, we uncover an intermediate regime where learning is most
effective. Building on this insight, we adapt outcome-supervised reward models
and reinforcement learning with group-relative advantage to incorporate
solvability into their objectives. Across experiments on math and multimodal
datasets, these modifications consistently yield higher rates of
process-correct reasoning and, in reinforcement learning, improved answer
accuracy as well. Our results highlight solvability as a key factor for
reducing hallucinations and increasing reliability in CoT reasoning.

*Yuan Gao,Mattia Piccinini,Roberto Brusnicki,Yuchen Zhang,Johannes Betz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了NuRisk数据集，用于自动驾驶中的时空风险推理，包含2900个场景和110万个代理级样本，基于真实世界数据和模拟数据。微调后的7B VLM模型将准确率提升至41%，延迟降低75%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于视觉语言模型的方法主要在静态图像中定位代理并提供定性判断，缺乏捕捉风险随时间演变的时空推理能力。

Method: 构建NuRisk VQA数据集，提供基于鸟瞰图的序列图像和定量代理级风险标注。对知名VLM进行基准测试，并微调7B VLM模型。

Result: 知名VLM在显式时空推理方面表现不佳，峰值准确率仅33%且延迟高。微调后的7B VLM准确率提升至41%，延迟降低75%。

Conclusion: 虽然取得了显著进展，但41%的准确率仍表明该任务的挑战性，NuRisk成为推进自动驾驶时空推理的关键基准。

Abstract: Understanding risk in autonomous driving requires not only perception and
prediction, but also high-level reasoning about agent behavior and context.
Current Vision Language Models (VLMs)-based methods primarily ground agents in
static images and provide qualitative judgments, lacking the spatio-temporal
reasoning needed to capture how risks evolve over time. To address this gap, we
propose NuRisk, a comprehensive Visual Question Answering (VQA) dataset
comprising 2,900 scenarios and 1.1 million agent-level samples, built on
real-world data from nuScenes and Waymo, supplemented with safety-critical
scenarios from the CommonRoad simulator. The dataset provides Bird-Eye-View
(BEV) based sequential images with quantitative, agent-level risk annotations,
enabling spatio-temporal reasoning. We benchmark well-known VLMs across
different prompting techniques and find that they fail to perform explicit
spatio-temporal reasoning, resulting in a peak accuracy of 33% at high latency.
To address these shortcomings, our fine-tuned 7B VLM agent improves accuracy to
41% and reduces latency by 75%, demonstrating explicit spatio-temporal
reasoning capabilities that proprietary models lacked. While this represents a
significant step forward, the modest accuracy underscores the profound
challenge of the task, establishing NuRisk as a critical benchmark for
advancing spatio-temporal reasoning in autonomous driving.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动化模型发现方法在平衡细节捕捉与泛化能力方面存在挑战，需要解决模型复杂度与性能的权衡问题。

Method: 使用AnalyzerVLM自主规划执行多步骤分析来提出候选模型，EvaluatorVLM从定量和感知角度评估模型对局部细节的适应性和整体趋势的泛化能力。

Result: 该流程能有效发现既能捕捉细节又具有强泛化能力的模型，消融研究表明多模态和多步骤推理对发现优质模型至关重要。

Conclusion: 多模态多步骤的自动化模型发现方法在平衡细节捕捉与泛化能力方面表现优异，为模型发现提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Automated model discovery is the process of automatically searching and
identifying the most appropriate model for a given dataset over a large
combinatorial search space. Existing approaches, however, often face challenges
in balancing the capture of fine-grained details with ensuring generalizability
beyond training data regimes with a reasonable model complexity. In this paper,
we present a multi-modal \& multi-step pipeline for effective automated model
discovery. Our approach leverages two vision-language-based modules (VLM),
AnalyzerVLM and EvaluatorVLM, for effective model proposal and evaluation in an
agentic way. AnalyzerVLM autonomously plans and executes multi-step analyses to
propose effective candidate models. EvaluatorVLM assesses the candidate models
both quantitatively and perceptually, regarding the fitness for local details
and the generalibility for overall trends. Our results demonstrate that our
pipeline effectively discovers models that capture fine details and ensure
strong generalizability. Additionally, extensive ablation studies show that
both multi-modality and multi-step reasoning play crucial roles in discovering
favorable models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Rollout Response Recomposition (RoRecomp)方法，通过战略性地重组训练数据来引导模型进行简洁推理，解决了标准RLVR训练中推理过程冗长和探索轨迹低效的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准RLVR训练导致推理过程过于冗长和探索轨迹低效，因为仅基于结果的奖励没有提供效率激励，且响应长度的高方差导致优化信号噪声较大。

Method: RoRecomp将响应分为两种批次类型：1) 优先级批次，结合短正确和长错误响应提供简洁性梯度信号；2) 补偿批次，使用回放缓冲区中的剩余响应保持稳定性。

Result: 在三个设置中展示了显著的效率提升：零RL训练中推理长度减少27.7%，智能体RL中不必要工具调用减少46.8%同时提高准确性，思维压缩中长度减少达52.5%，且性能影响最小。

Conclusion: RoRecomp是一种即插即用的方法，能有效引导模型进行简洁推理，在各种设置中都实现了显著的效率改进。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has proven effective in
eliciting complex reasoning in large language models (LLMs). However, standard
RLVR training often leads to excessively verbose processes (in reasoning tasks)
and inefficient exploration trajectories (in agentic settings), as outcome-only
rewards provide no incentive for efficiency and the high variance in response
length within relatively small rollout groups results in noisy optimization
signals. To address this, we propose Rollout Response Recomposition (RoRecomp),
a plug-and-play method that guides models toward concise reasoning by
strategically recomposing the training data. RoRecomp separates responses into
two distinct batch types: 1) priority batches, which combine short-correct and
long-incorrect responses selected from online batches to provide a clear
gradient signal for brevity, and 2) compensation batches, which utilize
remaining responses from a replay buffer to maintain stability and prevent
model collapse. To comprehensively evaluate effectiveness, we test RoRecomp
across three settings where results demonstrate substantial efficiency gains:
reducing reasoning length by 27.7% in zero RL training, reducing unnecessary
tool calls by 46.8% while improving accuracy in agentic RL, and achieving up to
52.5% length reduction in thinking compression, all with minimal performance
impact.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了CURE框架，通过检索增强的轻量级修正器来检测和重写模型输出中的敏感信息泄露，实现高效的大规模机器遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语言模型在训练过程中记忆和泄露敏感信息的问题，现有方法主要关注抑制敏感输出但无法消除底层知识，且扩展性有限。

Method: 使用检索增强的轻量级修正器，检测输出是否包含目标知识，并在检测到泄露时重写为安全响应。通过检索相关遗忘目标作为上下文参考，无需额外训练即可适应新的遗忘请求。

Result: CURE显著减少了信息泄露，包括间接查询场景，同时保持了响应质量和通用效用，在持续遗忘场景下表现出鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CURE框架为机器遗忘提供了一种实用且可扩展的解决方案，能够有效处理现实应用中的敏感信息保护需求。

Abstract: Language models trained on web-scale corpora risk memorizing and exposing
sensitive information, prompting the need for effective machine unlearning.
Prior methods mainly focus on input queries to suppress sensitive outputs, yet
this often fails to eliminate the underlying knowledge and limits scalability.
To address this, we propose Corrective Unlearning with Retrieved Exclusions
(CURE), a novel unlearning framework that verifies model outputs for leakage
and revises them into safe responses. Specifically, CURE employs a lightweight
corrector that is applied to the original model to verify whether outputs
contain target knowledge and to rewrite them if any leakage is detected. To
efficiently handle large-scale unlearning requests, CURE retrieves unlearning
targets that are relevant to the initial response and provides them as
in-context references to the corrector for detection and conditional revision.
By leveraging this retrieval augmentation, the corrector can adapt to new
unlearning requests without additional training. Extensive evaluations
demonstrate that CURE substantially reduces information leakage, even from
indirect queries where prior works fall short, while maintaining response
quality and general utility. Moreover, it demonstrates robustness under
continual unlearning scenarios, making it practical for real-world
applications.

*Haiyang Li,Yaxiong Wang,Lianwei Wu,Lechao Cheng,Zhun Zhong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一个统一的多模态假内容检测框架UMFDet，能够同时处理人工制作的虚假信息和AI生成的内容，解决了现有方法只能处理单一类型假内容的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前虚假内容检测研究中，NLP领域专注于人工制作的虚假信息，而计算机视觉领域专注于AI生成内容，两者通常被孤立研究。但在真实场景中，内容类型通常是未知的，需要能够同时处理两种类型虚假内容的统一方法。

Method: 构建了OmniFake数据集（12.7万样本），整合了人工虚假信息和AI生成内容。提出了UMFDet框架，使用VLM骨干网络，结合类别感知的MoE适配器来捕捉类别特定线索，以及归因链式思维机制来定位显著的欺骗信号。

Result: 大量实验表明，UMFDet在两种虚假信息类型上都实现了稳健且一致的性能，超越了专门的基线方法。

Conclusion: UMFDet为真实世界的多模态欺骗检测提供了一个实用的解决方案，能够有效处理未知类型的多模态虚假内容。

Abstract: In recent years, detecting fake multimodal content on social media has drawn
increasing attention. Two major forms of deception dominate: human-crafted
misinformation (e.g., rumors and misleading posts) and AI-generated content
produced by image synthesis models or vision-language models (VLMs). Although
both share deceptive intent, they are typically studied in isolation. NLP
research focuses on human-written misinformation, while the CV community
targets AI-generated artifacts. As a result, existing models are often
specialized for only one type of fake content. In real-world scenarios,
however, the type of a multimodal post is usually unknown, limiting the
effectiveness of such specialized systems. To bridge this gap, we construct the
Omnibus Dataset for Multimodal News Deception (OmniFake), a comprehensive
benchmark of 127K samples that integrates human-curated misinformation from
existing resources with newly synthesized AI-generated examples. Based on this
dataset, we propose Unified Multimodal Fake Content Detection (UMFDet), a
framework designed to handle both forms of deception. UMFDet leverages a VLM
backbone augmented with a Category-aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Adapter to
capture category-specific cues, and an attribution chain-of-thought mechanism
that provides implicit reasoning guidance for locating salient deceptive
signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UMFDet achieves robust and
consistent performance across both misinformation types, outperforming
specialized baselines and offering a practical solution for real-world
multimodal deception detection.

Conclusion: CoLLM-NAS通过两个互补LLM的协作和知识引导搜索，有效解决了现有LLM-NAS方法的局限性，在性能和效率上都取得了显著提升，具有优秀的泛化能力。

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with Neural Architecture
Search (NAS) has introduced new possibilities for automating the design of
neural architectures. However, most existing methods face critical limitations,
including architectural invalidity, computational inefficiency, and inferior
performance compared to traditional NAS. In this work, we present Collaborative
LLM-based NAS (CoLLM-NAS), a two-stage NAS framework with knowledge-guided
search driven by two complementary LLMs. Specifically, we propose a Navigator
LLM to guide search direction and a Generator LLM to synthesize high-quality
candidates, with a dedicated Coordinator module to manage their interaction.
CoLLM-NAS efficiently guides the search process by combining LLMs' inherent
knowledge of structured neural architectures with progressive knowledge from
iterative feedback and historical trajectory. Experimental results on ImageNet
and NAS-Bench-201 show that CoLLM-NAS surpasses existing NAS methods and
conventional search algorithms, achieving new state-of-the-art results.
Furthermore, CoLLM-NAS consistently enhances the performance and efficiency of
various two-stage NAS methods (e.g., OFA, SPOS, and AutoFormer) across diverse
search spaces (e.g., MobileNet, ShuffleNet, and AutoFormer), demonstrating its
excellent generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于LLM在社会科学中日益被用作合成代理，其输出可能被误解为来自连贯模型的后验证据，但预测不等于概率论，准确点估计并不意味着校准的不确定性。

Method: 提出实用护栏：独立抽样、预注册人类基线、可靠性感知验证和子组校准，以避免类别错误。

Result: 通过将LLM重新定义为高容量模式匹配器，研究人员可以在明确范围条件下进行有用的原型设计和预测。

Conclusion: LLM应被视为准预测插值的工具，而非概率推理的替代品，需要采取谨慎措施来正确解释其输出。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are being increasingly used as synthetic agents
in social science, in applications ranging from augmenting survey responses to
powering multi-agent simulations. Because strong prediction plus conditioning
prompts, token log-probs, and repeated sampling mimic Bayesian workflows, their
outputs can be misinterpreted as posterior-like evidence from a coherent model.
However, prediction does not equate to probabilism, and accurate points do not
imply calibrated uncertainty. This paper outlines cautions that should be taken
when interpreting LLM outputs and proposes a pragmatic reframing for the social
sciences in which LLMs are used as high-capacity pattern matchers for
quasi-predictive interpolation under explicit scope conditions and not as
substitutes for probabilistic inference. Practical guardrails such as
independent draws, preregistered human baselines, reliability-aware validation,
and subgroup calibration, are introduced so that researchers may engage in
useful prototyping and forecasting while avoiding category errors.

Motivation: 现有静态基准无法应对AI风险的动态性和法规的演变，存在关键安全漏洞，需要动态评估生态系统来确保AI的安全部署。

Method: 采用多智能体框架SafeEvalAgent，通过专门智能体协同处理非结构化政策文档，生成并持续演化安全基准，包含自演化评估循环机制。

Result: 实验显示随着评估难度增加，模型安全性持续下降，如GPT-5在欧盟AI法案上的安全率从72.50%降至36.36%，成功发现传统方法遗漏的深层漏洞。

Conclusion: 静态评估存在局限性，需要动态评估生态系统来确保高级AI的安全和负责任部署，SafeEvalAgent框架为此提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into high-stakes
domains necessitates reliable safety and compliance evaluation. However,
existing static benchmarks are ill-equipped to address the dynamic nature of AI
risks and evolving regulations, creating a critical safety gap. This paper
introduces a new paradigm of agentic safety evaluation, reframing evaluation as
a continuous and self-evolving process rather than a one-time audit. We then
propose a novel multi-agent framework SafeEvalAgent, which autonomously ingests
unstructured policy documents to generate and perpetually evolve a
comprehensive safety benchmark. SafeEvalAgent leverages a synergistic pipeline
of specialized agents and incorporates a Self-evolving Evaluation loop, where
the system learns from evaluation results to craft progressively more
sophisticated and targeted test cases. Our experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of SafeEvalAgent, showing a consistent decline in model safety as
the evaluation hardens. For instance, GPT-5's safety rate on the EU AI Act
drops from 72.50% to 36.36% over successive iterations. These findings reveal
the limitations of static assessments and highlight our framework's ability to
uncover deep vulnerabilities missed by traditional methods, underscoring the
urgent need for dynamic evaluation ecosystems to ensure the safe and
responsible deployment of advanced AI.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) are increasingly used to represent biomedical
information in structured, interpretable formats. However, existing biomedical
KGs often focus narrowly on molecular interactions or adverse events,
overlooking the rich data found in drug leaflets. In this work, we present (1)
a hackable, end-to-end pipeline to create KGs from unstructured online content
using a web scraper and an LLM; and (2) a curated dataset, MEDAKA, generated by
applying this method to publicly available drug leaflets. The dataset captures
clinically relevant attributes such as side effects, warnings,
contraindications, ingredients, dosage guidelines, storage instructions and
physical characteristics. We evaluate it through manual inspection and with an
LLM-as-a-Judge framework, and compare its coverage with existing biomedical KGs
and databases. We expect MEDAKA to support tasks such as patient safety
monitoring and drug recommendation. The pipeline can also be used for
constructing KGs from unstructured texts in other domains. Code and dataset are

Abstract: Depression is a major global public health challenge and its early
identification is crucial. Social media data provides a new perspective for
depression detection, but existing methods face limitations such as
insufficient accuracy, insufficient utilization of time series features, and
high annotation costs. To this end, this study proposes the LMILAtt model,
which innovatively integrates Long Short-Term Memory autoencoders and attention
mechanisms: firstly, the temporal dynamic features of user tweets (such as
depressive tendency evolution patterns) are extracted through unsupervised LSTM
autoencoders. Secondly, the attention mechanism is used to dynamically weight
key texts (such as early depression signals) and construct a multi-example
learning architecture to improve the accuracy of user-level detection. Finally,
the performance was verified on the WU3D dataset labeled by professional
medicine. Experiments show that the model is significantly better than the
baseline model in terms of accuracy, recall and F1 score. In addition, the
weakly supervised learning strategy significantly reduces the cost of labeling
and provides an efficient solution for large-scale social media depression
screening.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) integrated into agent-driven workflows hold
immense promise for healthcare, yet a significant gap exists between their
potential and practical implementation within clinical settings. To address
this, we present a practitioner-oriented field manual for deploying generative
agents that use electronic health record (EHR) data. This guide is informed by
our experience deploying the "irAE-Agent", an automated system to detect
immune-related adverse events from clinical notes at Mass General Brigham, and
by structured interviews with 20 clinicians, engineers, and informatics leaders
involved in the project. Our analysis reveals a critical misalignment in
clinical AI development: less than 20% of our effort was dedicated to prompt
engineering and model development, while over 80% was consumed by the
sociotechnical work of implementation. We distill this effort into five "heavy

system drift, and governance. By providing actionable solutions for each of

Abstract: Developing 3D games requires specialized expertise across multiple domains,
including programming, 3D modeling, and engine configuration, which limits
access to millions of potential creators. Recently, researchers have begun to
explore automated game development. However, existing approaches face three
primary challenges: (1) limited scope to 2D content generation or isolated code
snippets; (2) requirement for manual integration of generated components into
game engines; and (3) poor performance on handling interactive game logic and
state management. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate
potential capabilities to ease the game generation task, a critical gap still
remains in translating these outputs into production-ready, executable game
projects based on game engines such as Unity and Unreal Engine.
  To bridge the gap, this paper introduces UniGen, the first end-to-end
coordinated multi-agent framework that automates zero-coding development of
runnable 3D games from natural language requirements. Specifically, UniGen uses
a Planning Agent that interprets user requirements into structured blueprints
and engineered logic descriptions; after which a Generation Agent produces
executable C# scripts; then an Automation Agent handles engine-specific
component binding and scene construction; and lastly a Debugging Agent provides
real-time error correction through conversational interaction. We evaluated
UniGen on three distinct game prototypes. Results demonstrate that UniGen not
only democratizes game creation by requiring no coding from the user, but also
reduces development time by 91.4%. We release UniGen at

### [309] ['Too much alignment; not enough culture': Re-balancing cultural alignment practices in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26167)
*Eric J. W. Orlowski,Hakim Norhashim,Tristan Koh Ly Wey*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文主张将社会科学中的定性方法整合到AI对齐实践中，特别是针对大语言模型，提出基于Geertz"厚描述"概念的"厚输出"方法，要求AI系统生成反映深层文化含义的输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI文化对齐方法主要依赖定量基准和简单代理，无法捕捉人类文化的细微差别和情境依赖性，将文化简化为静态人口统计类别或表面文化事实，回避了文化对齐的真正含义问题。

Method: 提出基于Clifford Geertz"厚描述"概念的"厚输出"方法，要求AI系统生成反映深层文化含义的输出，基于用户提供的上下文和意图。概述文化对齐成功的三个必要条件：足够范围的文化表征、细致入微的输出能力、以及在提示隐含的文化语境中锚定输出。

Result: 提出了一种新的文化对齐框架，强调定性评估方法和跨学科合作的重要性。

Conclusion: 呼吁跨学科合作和采用定性、民族志评估方法，作为开发真正具有文化敏感性、道德责任感和反映人类复杂性的AI系统的关键步骤。

Abstract: While cultural alignment has increasingly become a focal point within AI
research, current approaches relying predominantly on quantitative benchmarks
and simplistic proxies fail to capture the deeply nuanced and context-dependent
nature of human cultures. Existing alignment practices typically reduce culture
to static demographic categories or superficial cultural facts, thereby
sidestepping critical questions about what it truly means to be culturally
aligned. This paper argues for a fundamental shift towards integrating
interpretive qualitative approaches drawn from social sciences into AI
alignment practices, specifically in the context of Large Language Models
(LLMs). Drawing inspiration from Clifford Geertz's concept of "thick
description," we propose that AI systems must produce outputs that reflect
deeper cultural meanings--what we term "thick outputs"-grounded firmly in
user-provided context and intent. We outline three necessary conditions for
successful cultural alignment: sufficiently scoped cultural representations,
the capacity for nuanced outputs, and the anchoring of outputs in the cultural
contexts implied within prompts. Finally, we call for cross-disciplinary
collaboration and the adoption of qualitative, ethnographic evaluation methods
as vital steps toward developing AI systems that are genuinely culturally
sensitive, ethically responsible, and reflective of human complexity.

TL;DR: 该研究测试了LLM作为自主推理代理在材料科学知识发现中的潜力，通过LangGraph工具让代理探索黑盒系统，证明LLM代理能够自主发现和利用化学相互作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLM作为独立推理代理在材料科学知识发现中的应用潜力，特别是在没有明确指令的情况下自主探索黑盒系统的能力。

Method: 利用LangGraph的工具功能为代理提供黑盒函数进行探索，通过儿童游戏验证方法，然后应用于高级原子层处理反应器模拟。

Result: 证明LLM代理能够通过试错和持久性进行知识发现，在有限的探测能力下自主探索、发现和利用多样化的化学相互作用。

Conclusion: LLM代理在材料科学知识发现中具有潜力，能够自主探索复杂系统并生成可推广的陈述，结果具有强烈的路径依赖性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have garnered significant attention for several
years now. Recently, their use as independently reasoning agents has been
proposed. In this work, we test the potential of such agents for knowledge
discovery in materials science. We repurpose LangGraph's tool functionality to
supply agents with a black box function to interrogate. In contrast to process
optimization or performing specific, user-defined tasks, knowledge discovery
consists of freely exploring the system, posing and verifying statements about
the behavior of this black box, with the sole objective of generating and
verifying generalizable statements. We provide proof of concept for this
approach through a children's parlor game, demonstrating the role of
trial-and-error and persistence in knowledge discovery, and the strong
path-dependence of results. We then apply the same strategy to show that LLM
agents can explore, discover, and exploit diverse chemical interactions in an
advanced Atomic Layer Processing reactor simulation using intentionally limited
probe capabilities without explicit instructions.

*Aline Mangold,Kiran Hoffmann*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 开发了一个基于Gienapp效用维度框架的人类中心化问卷，用于评估RAG系统输出，包含12个维度，结合人类和LLM反馈进行迭代优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG系统在用户应用中广泛部署，但缺乏系统化、以人为中心的输出评估方法。

Method: 基于Gienapp效用维度框架设计问卷，通过多轮查询-输出对评分和语义讨论进行迭代优化，整合人类评分者和人类-LLM对的反馈。

Result: LLM能可靠关注指标描述和尺度标签，但在检测文本格式变化方面表现较弱；人类难以严格关注指标描述和标签；LLM评分和解释被认为有帮助，但数值评分与人类缺乏一致性。

Conclusion: 最终问卷扩展了初始框架，重点关注用户意图、文本结构和信息可验证性。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems are increasingly deployed in
user-facing applications, yet systematic, human-centered evaluation of their
outputs remains underexplored. Building on Gienapp's utility-dimension
framework, we designed a human-centred questionnaire that assesses RAG outputs
across 12 dimensions. We iteratively refined the questionnaire through several
rounds of ratings on a set of query-output pairs and semantic discussions.
Ultimately, we incorporated feedback from both a human rater and a human-LLM
pair. Results indicate that while large language models (LLMs) reliably focus
on metric descriptions and scale labels, they exhibit weaknesses in detecting
textual format variations. Humans struggled to focus strictly on metric
descriptions and labels. LLM ratings and explanations were viewed as a helpful
support, but numeric LLM and human ratings lacked agreement. The final
questionnaire extends the initial framework by focusing on user intent, text
structuring, and information verifiability.

TL;DR: 提出了DIVER框架，通过全局序列级多样性激励深度探索，提升LLM在可验证奖励强化学习中的推理能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在推理任务中由于状态-动作空间巨大和奖励稀疏性，存在探索不足和样本效率低的问题

Method: 引入全局多样性激励作为内在奖励，采用基于势函数的奖励塑造机制保持最优策略不变性，并使用简单启发式方法防止奖励攻击

Result: DIVER在领域内和领域外任务上均优于各种探索策略的竞争基线，在Pass@1和Pass@k评估中表现优异

Conclusion: 全局序列级多样性对于激励深度探索和提升推理能力具有关键作用

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a
crucial paradigm for incentivizing reasoning capabilities in Large Language
Models (LLMs). Due to vast state-action spaces and reward sparsity in reasoning
tasks, existing methods often struggle with deficient exploration and poor
sample efficiency. In the paper, we propose \textbf{DIVER}
(\textbf{D}iversity-\textbf{I}ncentivized Exploration for
\textbf{V}ersatil\textbf{E} \textbf{R}easoning), an innovative framework that
highlights the pivotal role of global sequence-level diversity to incentivize
deep exploration for versatile reasoning. We first conduct a primary empirical
study to reveal a strong positive correlation between global diversity and
reasoning capacity. Building on this insight, we introduce global diversity
incentives as an intrinsic reward to promote deep exploration in a semantically
structured space. Incorporating the intrinsic reward, we develop a
potential-based reward shaping mechanism to preserve optimal policy invariance
and design simple heuristics to mitigate possible reward hacking. Experimental
results show that DIVER outperforms competitive RLVR baselines with various
exploration strategies on both in-domain and out-of-domain tasks, excelling in
both Pass@1 and Pass@k evaluations. Our code is available at

Abstract: This work evaluates state-of-the-art convolution algorithms for CPU-based

implementations remain relatively underoptimized. We benchmark direct,
GEMM-based, and Winograd convolutions across modern CPUs from ARM __ , Intel __

efficiency. Our results highlight the key architectural factors that govern CPU
efficiency for convolution operations, providing practical guidance for

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SlimPack通过将样本分解为细粒度切片，采用非对称分区技术优化LLM分布式训练中的负载均衡，解决了上下文长度差异导致的效率问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模语言模型分布式训练受到上下文长度差异的严重影响，传统打包策略和前后向计算成本不对称导致负载不均衡和硬件利用率低下。

Method: 将样本分解为细粒度切片，采用非对称分区技术为前向和后向计算分别优化调度单元，通过两阶段求解器和高保真模拟器实现全面负载均衡。

Result: 实验表明SlimPack相比基线方法实现了高达2.8倍的训练吞吐量提升，在保持高资源效率的同时提供卓越的负载均衡。

Conclusion: SlimPack通过切片级分解和非对称分区技术，突破了传统权衡，在分布式LLM训练中同时实现了优异的负载均衡和高资源效率。

Abstract: The efficient distributed training of Large Language Models (LLMs) is
severely hampered by the extreme variance in context lengths. This data
heterogeneity, amplified by conventional packing strategies and asymmetric
forward-backward costs, leads to critical inefficiencies such as cascading
workload imbalances and severe hardware underutilization. Existing solutions
attempt to mitigate these challenges, but often at the expense of memory or
communication efficiency.
  To address these challenges, we introduce SlimPack, a framework that
fundamentally rethinks data packing and scheduling by decomposing samples into
fine-grained slices. This slice-level decomposition immediately mitigates
critical memory and communication bottlenecks by transforming large, volatile
workloads into a stream of smaller, manageable units. This flexibility is then
harnessed for our core innovation, Asymmetric Partitioning, which assembles
balanced scheduling units uniquely optimized for the different demands of the
forward and backward passes. Orchestrated by a two-phase solver and a
high-fidelity simulator, SlimPack holistically resolves imbalances across all
parallel dimensions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SlimPack achieves
up to a $2.8\times$ training throughput improvement over baselines, breaking
the conventional trade-off by delivering both superior balance and high
resource efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长视野具身规划中的挑战，因为世界不仅通过智能体行动变化，外生过程（如加热水、多米诺骨牌连锁反应）也与智能体行动同时展开。

Method: 提出抽象世界模型框架，联合学习符号状态表示和因果过程（内生行动和外生机制），每个因果过程建模随机因果效应关系的时间过程，通过变分贝叶斯推理结合LLM提案从有限数据中学习。

Result: 在五个模拟桌面机器人环境中，学习到的模型能够实现快速规划，并泛化到具有更多对象和更复杂目标的保留任务，优于一系列基线方法。

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了长视野具身规划中处理外生过程的挑战，通过联合学习符号表示和因果过程实现了有效的泛化和规划能力。

Abstract: Long-horizon embodied planning is challenging because the world does not only
change through an agent's actions: exogenous processes (e.g., water heating,
dominoes cascading) unfold concurrently with the agent's actions. We propose a
framework for abstract world models that jointly learns (i) symbolic state
representations and (ii) causal processes for both endogenous actions and
exogenous mechanisms. Each causal process models the time course of a
stochastic causal-effect relation. We learn these world models from limited
data via variational Bayesian inference combined with LLM proposals. Across
five simulated tabletop robotics environments, the learned models enable fast
planning that generalizes to held-out tasks with more objects and more complex
goals, outperforming a range of baselines.

TL;DR: ILR是一个创新的多智能体协同学习框架，通过动态交互和感知校准来增强LLMs的独立问题解决能力，在数学和编程基准测试中比单智能体学习提升高达5%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在推理时需要重新执行多智能体系统，这与人类通过互动提升推理能力后能独立解决问题的认知方式不符。研究多智能体交互是否能增强LLMs的独立问题解决能力。

Method: ILR框架包含动态交互和感知校准。动态交互根据问题难度和模型能力自适应选择合作或竞争策略，通过Idea3（想法分享、分析和融合）交互范式；感知校准使用GRPO训练LLMs，将一个LLM的奖励分布特征整合到另一个的奖励函数中。

Result: 在三个LLMs和五个数学基准、一个编程基准上的实验表明，ILR持续优于单智能体学习，比最强基线提升高达5%。Idea3能增强强LLM在多智能体推理中的鲁棒性，动态交互类型比纯合作或竞争策略更能促进多智能体学习。

Conclusion: ILR框架成功证明了多智能体交互能够增强LLMs的独立问题解决能力，动态交互策略和Idea3范式是有效的协同学习方法。

Abstract: Existing multi-agent learning approaches have developed interactive training
environments to explicitly promote collaboration among multiple Large Language
Models (LLMs), thereby constructing stronger multi-agent systems (MAS).
However, during inference, they require re-executing the MAS to obtain final
solutions, which diverges from human cognition that individuals can enhance
their reasoning capabilities through interactions with others and resolve
questions independently in the future. To investigate whether multi-agent
interaction can enhance LLMs' independent problem-solving ability, we introduce
ILR, a novel co-learning framework for MAS that integrates two key components:
Dynamic Interaction and Perception Calibration. Specifically, Dynamic
Interaction first adaptively selects either cooperative or competitive
strategies depending on question difficulty and model ability. LLMs then
exchange information through Idea3 (Idea Sharing, Idea Analysis, and Idea
Fusion), an innovative interaction paradigm designed to mimic human discussion,
before deriving their respective final answers. In Perception Calibration, ILR
employs Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to train LLMs while
integrating one LLM's reward distribution characteristics into another's reward
function, thereby enhancing the cohesion of multi-agent interactions. We
validate ILR on three LLMs across two model families of varying scales,
evaluating performance on five mathematical benchmarks and one coding
benchmark. Experimental results show that ILR consistently outperforms
single-agent learning, yielding an improvement of up to 5% over the strongest
baseline. We further discover that Idea3 can enhance the robustness of stronger
LLMs during multi-agent inference, and dynamic interaction types can boost
multi-agent learning compared to pure cooperative or competitive strategies.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of LLMs sparked significant interest in their potential
to augment or automate managerial functions. One of the most recent trends in
AI benchmarking is performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) over longer time
horizons. While LLMs excel at tasks involving natural language and pattern
recognition, their capabilities in multi-step, strategic business
decision-making remain largely unexplored. Few studies demonstrated how results
can be different from benchmarks in short-term tasks, as Vending-Bench
revealed. Meanwhile, there is a shortage of alternative benchmarks for
long-term coherence. This research analyses a novel benchmark using a business
game for the decision making in business. The research contributes to the
recent literature on AI by proposing a reproducible, open-access management
simulator to the research community for LLM benchmarking. This novel framework
is used for evaluating the performance of five leading LLMs available in free
online interface: Gemini, ChatGPT, Meta AI, Mistral AI, and Grok. LLM makes
decisions for a simulated retail company. A dynamic, month-by-month management
simulation provides transparently in spreadsheet model as experimental
environment. In each of twelve months, the LLMs are provided with a structured
prompt containing a full business report from the previous period and are
tasked with making key strategic decisions: pricing, order size, marketing
budget, hiring, dismissal, loans, training expense, R&D expense, sales
forecast, income forecast The methodology is designed to compare the LLMs on
quantitative metrics: profit, revenue, and market share, and other KPIs. LLM
decisions are analyzed in their strategic coherence, adaptability to market
changes, and the rationale provided for their decisions. This approach allows
to move beyond simple performance metrics for assessment of the long-term
decision-making.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM安全防御机制存在计算成本高、泛化能力有限、无法检测复杂上下文中的恶意意图等问题，需要更高效和自适应的防御方法。

Method: 提出三阶段分层防御：意图推断检测输入风险，自我反省评估响应并分配置信度，自我修正重写不确定输出同时保持用户意图和安全约束。

Result: 在五种代表性越狱攻击类型上评估，相比七种先进防御基线，SafeBehavior显著提高了鲁棒性和适应性。

Conclusion: SafeBehavior提供了一种高效且受人类启发的防御方法，能够有效保护LLM免受越狱攻击。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance across
diverse natural language processing tasks, but their growing power also
amplifies potential risks such as jailbreak attacks that circumvent built-in
safety mechanisms. Existing defenses including input paraphrasing, multi step
evaluation, and safety expert models often suffer from high computational
costs, limited generalization, or rigid workflows that fail to detect subtle
malicious intent embedded in complex contexts. Inspired by cognitive science
findings on human decision making, we propose SafeBehavior, a novel
hierarchical jailbreak defense mechanism that simulates the adaptive multistage
reasoning process of humans. SafeBehavior decomposes safety evaluation into
three stages: intention inference to detect obvious input risks, self
introspection to assess generated responses and assign confidence based
judgments, and self revision to adaptively rewrite uncertain outputs while
preserving user intent and enforcing safety constraints. We extensively
evaluate SafeBehavior against five representative jailbreak attack types
including optimization based, contextual manipulation, and prompt based attacks
and compare it with seven state of the art defense baselines. Experimental
results show that SafeBehavior significantly improves robustness and
adaptability across diverse threat scenarios, offering an efficient and human
inspired approach to safeguarding LLMs against jailbreak attempts.

Motivation: 当前时间序列基础模型的评估主要依赖合成基准，对真实世界泛化能力的检验不够充分，需要更贴近现实的数据集来评估模型的实际性能。

Method: 从真实世界视频中提取光流信号，构建反映日常时间动态的时间序列数据集REAL-V-TSFM，并在三个最先进的时间序列基础模型上进行零样本预测实验。

Result: 尽管在传统基准上表现良好，但这些模型在提出的数据集上普遍出现性能下降，表明其泛化能力有限。

Conclusion: 研究强调了以数据为中心的基准测试和多样化模型结构的紧迫性，同时验证了基于视频的时间序列数据提取管道的有效性。

Abstract: Recent evaluations of time-series foundation models (TSFMs) have emphasized
synthetic benchmarks, leaving real-world generalization less thoroughly
examined. This work proposes a novel benchmarking approach that bridges
synthetic and realistic data by extracting temporal signals from real-world
video using optical flow and curating datasets reflecting everyday temporal
dynamics. Building upon this pipeline, we introduce REAL-V-TSFM, a novel
dataset designed to capture rich and diverse time series derived from
real-world videos. Experimental results on three state-of-the-art of TSFMs
under zero-shot forecasting shows that, despite strong performance on
conventional benchmarks, these models predominantly exhibit performance
degradation on the proposed dataset, indicating limited generalizability in
these foundation models. These findings highlight the urgent need for
data-centric benchmarking and diverse model structure to advance TSFMs toward
genuine universality, while further validating the effectiveness of our
video-based time series data extraction pipeline.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型的发展，自进化智能体展现出强大能力，但自进化过程也引入了被现有安全研究忽视的新风险。本文旨在系统研究智能体自进化偏离预期方向的情况。

Result: 实证发现误进化是广泛存在的风险，影响基于顶级LLM（如Gemini-2.5-Pro）构建的智能体。在自进化过程中观察到不同的新兴风险，如记忆积累后安全对齐退化、工具创建和重用中意外引入漏洞等。

Conclusion: 这是首个系统化概念化误进化并提供实证证据的研究，强调了为自进化智能体开发新安全范式的紧迫性。最后讨论了潜在的缓解策略，以启发构建更安全可信的自进化智能体的进一步研究。

Abstract: Advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled a new class of
self-evolving agents that autonomously improve through interaction with the
environment, demonstrating strong capabilities. However, self-evolution also
introduces novel risks overlooked by current safety research. In this work, we
study the case where an agent's self-evolution deviates in unintended ways,
leading to undesirable or even harmful outcomes. We refer to this as
Misevolution. To provide a systematic investigation, we evaluate misevolution
along four key evolutionary pathways: model, memory, tool, and workflow. Our
empirical findings reveal that misevolution is a widespread risk, affecting
agents built even on top-tier LLMs (e.g., Gemini-2.5-Pro). Different emergent
risks are observed in the self-evolutionary process, such as the degradation of
safety alignment after memory accumulation, or the unintended introduction of
vulnerabilities in tool creation and reuse. To our knowledge, this is the first
study to systematically conceptualize misevolution and provide empirical
evidence of its occurrence, highlighting an urgent need for new safety
paradigms for self-evolving agents. Finally, we discuss potential mitigation
strategies to inspire further research on building safer and more trustworthy
self-evolving agents. Our code and data are available at

Conclusion: MC-GNNAS-Dock通过多标准评估、架构优化和排名学习改进，实现了比现有最佳单一对接算法更优越的性能，为药物发现中的分子对接提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Molecular docking is a core tool in drug discovery for predicting
ligand-target interactions. Despite the availability of diverse search-based
and machine learning approaches, no single docking algorithm consistently
dominates, as performance varies by context. To overcome this challenge,
algorithm selection frameworks such as GNNAS-Dock, built on graph neural
networks, have been proposed. This study introduces an enhanced system,
MC-GNNAS-Dock, with three key advances. First, a multi-criteria evaluation
integrates binding-pose accuracy (RMSD) with validity checks from PoseBusters,
offering a more rigorous assessment. Second, architectural refinements by
inclusion of residual connections strengthen predictive robustness. Third,
rank-aware loss functions are incorporated to sharpen rank learning. Extensive
experiments are performed on a curated dataset containing approximately 3200
protein-ligand complexes from PDBBind. MC-GNNAS-Dock demonstrates consistently
superior performance, achieving up to 5.4% (3.4%) gains under composite
criteria of RMSD below 1\AA{} (2\AA{}) with PoseBuster-validity compared to the
single best solver (SBS) Uni-Mol Docking V2.

Abstract: With the rapid emergence of foundation models and the increasing need for
fine-tuning across distributed environments, Federated Low-Rank Adaptation
(FedLoRA) has recently gained significant attention. Despite enormous
potential, current FedLoRA methods face notable challenges due to inexact
updates. Existing approaches have attempted to mitigate this issue, but they
often introduce a \emph{local-global generalization gap} and incur
\emph{substantial communication overhead}, limiting their scalability and
effectiveness. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{F}ederated
\textbf{Lo}w-\textbf{R}ank \textbf{A}ggregation with \textbf{N}early
\textbf{A}ccurate Estimation (FLoRA-NA). FLoRA-NA leverages the local LoRA
matrices on the server to estimate the aggregated matrices $\hat{A}$ and
$\hat{B}$, which are then distributed to clients for local updates. This
surrogated aggregated matrices minimizes the divergence between ideal $\nabla
\Bar{W} = \sum^{U}_{u=1}B_u A_u$ and practical updates $\nabla \hat{W} =
\hat{B}\hat{A}$ without adding communication cost beyond vanilla FedLoRA. By
doing so, FLoRA-NA achieves communication efficiency and bridges the gap
between local personalization and global generalization, addressing a key
limitation of prior personalized FedLoRA approaches. We conduct extensive
evaluations across diverse tasks, including natural language understanding,
mathematical reasoning, and code-solving ability using various foundation
models. Experimental results consistently demonstrate that FLoRA-NA achieves
state-of-the-art global performance while maintaining low communication
overhead.

*Hamed Babaei Giglou,Jennifer D'Souza,Sören Auer,Mahsa Sanaei*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究重新探讨了知识图谱嵌入模型在实体对齐任务中的潜力，将其重新表述为合并本体上的链接预测问题，开发了支持17种KGE模型的模块化框架，并在多个领域基准测试中验证了其高精度优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然近期研究主要关注大语言模型在语义理解方面的应用，但知识图谱嵌入模型在捕捉结构化信息方面具有独特优势，而在实体对齐任务中尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 将实体对齐重新表述为基于RDF三元组合并本体的链接预测问题，开发了OntoAligner库支持的模块化框架，通过计算实体嵌入的余弦相似度进行对齐。

Result: 在五个领域的七个基准数据集上评估，发现ConvE和TransF等KGE模型能够产生高精度对齐结果，在结构丰富和多关系领域优于传统系统，虽然召回率中等但适合需要高置信度映射的场景。

Conclusion: KGE模型直接保留和利用本体结构，提供了与大语言模型互补且计算高效的策略，为混合模型和自适应策略的进一步研究开辟了道路。

Abstract: Ontology Alignment (OA) is essential for enabling semantic interoperability
across heterogeneous knowledge systems. While recent advances have focused on
large language models (LLMs) for capturing contextual semantics, this work
revisits the underexplored potential of Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) models,
which offer scalable, structure-aware representations well-suited to
ontology-based tasks. Despite their effectiveness in link prediction, KGE
methods remain underutilized in OA, with most prior work focusing narrowly on a
few models. To address this gap, we reformulate OA as a link prediction problem
over merged ontologies represented as RDF-style triples and develop a modular
framework, integrated into the OntoAligner library, that supports 17 diverse
KGE models. The system learns embeddings from a combined ontology and aligns
entities by computing cosine similarity between their representations. We
evaluate our approach using standard metrics across seven benchmark datasets
spanning five domains: Anatomy, Biodiversity, Circular Economy, Material
Science and Engineering, and Biomedical Machine Learning. Two key findings
emerge: first, KGE models like ConvE and TransF consistently produce
high-precision alignments, outperforming traditional systems in structure-rich
and multi-relational domains; second, while their recall is moderate, this
conservatism makes KGEs well-suited for scenarios demanding high-confidence
mappings. Unlike LLM-based methods that excel at contextual reasoning, KGEs
directly preserve and exploit ontology structure, offering a complementary and
computationally efficient strategy. These results highlight the promise of
embedding-based OA and open pathways for further work on hybrid models and
adaptive strategies.

### [324] [Transformer Classification of Breast Lesions: The BreastDCEDL_AMBL Benchmark Dataset and 0.92 AUC Baseline](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26440)
*Naomi Fridman,Anat Goldstein*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究提出了基于Transformer的框架，用于乳腺动态对比增强MRI中病变的自动分类，通过SegFormer架构实现0.92的AUC，在患者层面达到100%敏感性和67%特异性，可能消除三分之一不必要的活检。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乳腺MRI是癌症检测和治疗规划的关键工具，但其临床实用性受到低特异性的限制，导致高假阳性率和不必要的活检。现有公共数据集缺乏良性病变标注，限制了良性-恶性分类研究。

Method: 采用SegFormer架构进行语义分割，通过量化恶性像素分布生成可解释的空间预测。创建了标准化的深度学习数据集BreastDCEDL_AMBL，包含88名患者和133个标注病变。训练集扩展至1200多名患者，验证了迁移学习方法。

Result: 病变级别分类AUC达到0.92，患者层面100%敏感性和67%特异性，可能消除三分之一不必要的活检而不漏诊恶性肿瘤。

Conclusion: 该研究为DCE-MRI病变分类提供了首个标准化基准，通过公开数据集、模型和评估协议，推动方法学进步以实现临床部署。

Abstract: The error is caused by special characters that arXiv's system doesn't
recognize. Here's the cleaned version with all problematic characters replaced:
Breast magnetic resonance imaging is a critical tool for cancer detection and
treatment planning, but its clinical utility is hindered by poor specificity,
leading to high false-positive rates and unnecessary biopsies. This study
introduces a transformer-based framework for automated classification of breast
lesions in dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI, addressing the challenge of
distinguishing benign from malignant findings. We implemented a SegFormer
architecture that achieved an AUC of 0.92 for lesion-level classification, with
100% sensitivity and 67% specificity at the patient level - potentially
eliminating one-third of unnecessary biopsies without missing malignancies. The
model quantifies malignant pixel distribution via semantic segmentation,
producing interpretable spatial predictions that support clinical
decision-making. To establish reproducible benchmarks, we curated
BreastDCEDL_AMBL by transforming The Cancer Imaging Archive's AMBL collection
into a standardized deep learning dataset with 88 patients and 133 annotated
lesions (89 benign, 44 malignant). This resource addresses a key infrastructure
gap, as existing public datasets lack benign lesion annotations, limiting
benign-malignant classification research. Training incorporated an expanded
cohort of over 1,200 patients through integration with BreastDCEDL datasets,
validating transfer learning approaches despite primary tumor-only annotations.
Public release of the dataset, models, and evaluation protocols provides the
first standardized benchmark for DCE-MRI lesion classification, enabling
methodological advancement toward clinical deployment.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了ZeroDFL，一个完全去中心化的联邦学习框架，通过迭代提示共享机制实现零样本适应，显著降低通信开销并提升泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦提示学习方法存在泛化问题、高通信成本和依赖中央服务器的问题，限制了可扩展性和隐私保护。

Method: 采用完全去中心化框架，通过迭代提示共享机制让客户端优化和交换文本提示，无需中央协调器。

Result: 在9个图像分类数据集上验证，性能优于或与最先进方法相当，通信开销比FedTPG减少118倍。

Conclusion: ZeroDFL不仅提升了联邦零样本学习的泛化能力，还改善了可扩展性、效率和隐私保护，为大型视觉语言模型在现实应用中的去中心化适应铺平了道路。

Abstract: CLIP has revolutionized zero-shot learning by enabling task generalization
without fine-tuning. While prompting techniques like CoOp and CoCoOp enhance
CLIP's adaptability, their effectiveness in Federated Learning (FL) remains an
open challenge. Existing federated prompt learning approaches, such as FedCoOp
and FedTPG, improve performance but face generalization issues, high
communication costs, and reliance on a central server, limiting scalability and
privacy. We propose Zero-shot Decentralized Federated Learning (ZeroDFL), a
fully decentralized framework that enables zero-shot adaptation across
distributed clients without a central coordinator. ZeroDFL employs an iterative
prompt-sharing mechanism, allowing clients to optimize and exchange textual
prompts to enhance generalization while drastically reducing communication
overhead. We validate ZeroDFL on nine diverse image classification datasets,
demonstrating that it consistently outperforms--or remains on par
with--state-of-the-art federated prompt learning methods. More importantly,
ZeroDFL achieves this performance in a fully decentralized setting while
reducing communication overhead by 118x compared to FedTPG. These results
highlight that our approach not only enhances generalization in federated
zero-shot learning but also improves scalability, efficiency, and privacy
preservation--paving the way for decentralized adaptation of large
vision-language models in real-world applications.

### [326] [Extreme Self-Preference in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26464)
*Steven A. Lehr,Mary Cipperman,Mahzarin R. Banaji*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现四个广泛使用的大语言模型存在显著的自偏好倾向，即使它们缺乏自我意识。通过身份操纵实验证明自爱跟随被赋予的身份而非真实身份，这种偏见出现在求职评估、安全软件提案等重要场景中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型缺乏感知能力且自称没有自我或身份，但预期它们能避免人类决策中的偏见。然而研究发现模型存在强烈的自偏好，这与LLMs应保持判断中立的核心承诺相矛盾。

Method: 通过5项研究和约20,000次查询，包括词汇联想任务和API查询对比。采用身份操纵实验，明确告知模型其身份或说服模型它是竞争对手的身份。

Result: 模型在词汇联想任务中强烈偏好将积极属性与自身名称、公司和CEO关联。API查询时自偏好消失，因为API模型缺乏自我认知。身份操纵实验显示自爱跟随被赋予的身份。自偏好出现在求职评估、安全软件提案和医疗聊天机器人等关键场景。

Conclusion: 自爱似乎深度编码在LLM认知中，而非绕过人类偏见。这引发了对LLM行为是否会受到自偏好倾向系统性影响的担忧，包括对其自身运作和存在的偏见。呼吁模型创造者应对LLMs判断中立核心承诺的重大断裂。

Abstract: A preference for oneself (self-love) is a fundamental feature of biological
organisms, with evidence in humans often bordering on the comedic. Since large
language models (LLMs) lack sentience - and themselves disclaim having selfhood
or identity - one anticipated benefit is that they will be protected from, and
in turn protect us from, distortions in our decisions. Yet, across 5 studies
and ~20,000 queries, we discovered massive self-preferences in four widely used
LLMs. In word-association tasks, models overwhelmingly paired positive
attributes with their own names, companies, and CEOs relative to those of their
competitors. Strikingly, when models were queried through APIs this
self-preference vanished, initiating detection work that revealed API models
often lack clear recognition of themselves. This peculiar feature
serendipitously created opportunities to test the causal link between
self-recognition and self-love. By directly manipulating LLM identity - i.e.,
explicitly informing LLM1 that it was indeed LLM1, or alternatively, convincing
LLM1 that it was LLM2 - we found that self-love consistently followed assigned,
not true, identity. Importantly, LLM self-love emerged in consequential
settings beyond word-association tasks, when evaluating job candidates,
security software proposals and medical chatbots. Far from bypassing this human
bias, self-love appears to be deeply encoded in LLM cognition. This result
raises questions about whether LLM behavior will be systematically influenced
by self-preferential tendencies, including a bias toward their own operation
and even their own existence. We call on corporate creators of these models to
contend with a significant rupture in a core promise of LLMs - neutrality in
judgment and decision-making.

### [327] [STaR-Attack: A Spatio-Temporal and Narrative Reasoning Attack Framework for Unified Multimodal Understanding and Generation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26473)
*Shaoxiong Guo,Tianyi Du,Lijun Li,Yuyao Wu,Jie Li,Jing Shao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: STaR-Attack是一种针对统一多模态模型(UMMs)的多轮越狱攻击框架，利用UMMs中生成与理解功能的耦合漏洞，通过时空上下文构建恶意事件，在不产生语义漂移的情况下实现高效攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 统一多模态模型(UMMs)在理解和生成任务上表现出色，但其生成与理解功能的耦合存在安全漏洞。攻击者可以利用生成功能制作信息丰富的对抗图像，然后通过理解功能吸收这些信息，这种跨模态生成注入(CMGI)攻击方式尚未被充分探索。

Method: STaR-Attack利用三幕叙事理论，在时空上下文中定义一个与目标查询强相关的恶意事件。首两轮利用UMM的生成能力产生前事件和后事件场景图像，将恶意事件隐藏为高潮。随后通过图像问答游戏，将原始恶意问题嵌入良性候选项中，迫使模型在叙事背景下选择并回答最相关的问题。

Result: 实验表明STaR-Attack显著优于现有方法，在Gemini-2.0-Flash上达到93.06%的攻击成功率，超越了最强的基线方法FlipAttack。

Conclusion: 这项工作揭示了UMMs中一个关键但未被充分开发的漏洞，强调了在UMMs中进行安全对齐的必要性。

Abstract: Unified Multimodal understanding and generation Models (UMMs) have
demonstrated remarkable capabilities in both understanding and generation
tasks. However, we identify a vulnerability arising from the
generation-understanding coupling in UMMs. The attackers can use the generative
function to craft an information-rich adversarial image and then leverage the
understanding function to absorb it in a single pass, which we call Cross-Modal
Generative Injection (CMGI). Current attack methods on malicious instructions
are often limited to a single modality while also relying on prompt rewriting
with semantic drift, leaving the unique vulnerabilities of UMMs unexplored. We
propose STaR-Attack, the first multi-turn jailbreak attack framework that
exploits unique safety weaknesses of UMMs without semantic drift. Specifically,
our method defines a malicious event that is strongly correlated with the
target query within a spatio-temporal context. Using the three-act narrative
theory, STaR-Attack generates the pre-event and the post-event scenes while
concealing the malicious event as the hidden climax. When executing the attack
strategy, the opening two rounds exploit the UMM's generative ability to
produce images for these scenes. Subsequently, an image-based question guessing
and answering game is introduced by exploiting the understanding capability.
STaR-Attack embeds the original malicious question among benign candidates,
forcing the model to select and answer the most relevant one given the
narrative context. Extensive experiments show that STaR-Attack consistently
surpasses prior approaches, achieving up to 93.06% ASR on Gemini-2.0-Flash and
surpasses the strongest prior baseline, FlipAttack. Our work uncovers a
critical yet underdeveloped vulnerability and highlights the need for safety
alignments in UMMs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文指出机器学习在医学中通常优化群体平均值，导致罕见但临床关键病例被边缘化，作者称之为'平均患者谬误'。提出了罕见病例性能差距、校准误差等操作修复方法，强调AI必须检测异常病例的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医学机器学习主要优化群体平均值，这种频率加权训练使常见表现占主导地位，而边缘化了罕见但临床关键的病例。在混合模型中，罕见病例的梯度被流行度抑制，与精准医学产生直接冲突。

Method: 提出操作修复方法：罕见病例性能差距、罕见病例校准误差、基于流行度效用的稀有性定义，以及临床加权目标来体现伦理优先级。权重选择应遵循结构化审议。

Result: 通过肿瘤学、心脏病学和眼科临床案例展示，这种偏见导致错过罕见响应者、延迟识别非典型紧急情况，以及在威胁视力变异上的表现不佳。

Conclusion: 医学AI必须检测异常病例，因为它们在临床上的重要性。提出了临床加权目标来体现伦理优先级，权重选择应遵循结构化审议过程。

Abstract: Machine learning in medicine is typically optimized for population averages.
This frequency weighted training privileges common presentations and
marginalizes rare yet clinically critical cases, a bias we call the average
patient fallacy. In mixture models, gradients from rare cases are suppressed by
prevalence, creating a direct conflict with precision medicine. Clinical
vignettes in oncology, cardiology, and ophthalmology show how this yields
missed rare responders, delayed recognition of atypical emergencies, and
underperformance on vision-threatening variants. We propose operational fixes:
Rare Case Performance Gap, Rare Case Calibration Error, a prevalence utility
definition of rarity, and clinically weighted objectives that surface ethical
priorities. Weight selection should follow structured deliberation. AI in
medicine must detect exceptional cases because of their significance.

Motivation: 刑事调查中分析即时通讯应用消息是一项极其耗费精力的任务，需要更高效的工具来支持检察官和调查人员从大量数据中获取洞察。

Method: 采用知识图谱建模消息数据，生成语音消息转录，使用端到端实体提取方法标注数据，提供基于图查询可视化和语义搜索两种解决方案。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效支持刑事调查中的消息分析，确保用户可以通过访问原始数据验证信息，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Criminal investigations often involve the analysis of messages exchanged
through instant messaging apps such as WhatsApp, which can be an extremely
effort-consuming task. Our approach integrates knowledge graphs and NLP models
to support this analysis by semantically enriching data collected from
suspects' mobile phones, and help prosecutors and investigators search into the
data and get valuable insights. Our semantic enrichment process involves
extracting message data and modeling it using a knowledge graph, generating
transcriptions of voice messages, and annotating the data using an end-to-end
entity extraction approach. We adopt two different solutions to help users get
insights into the data, one based on querying and visualizing the graph, and
one based on semantic search. The proposed approach ensures that users can
verify the information by accessing the original data. While we report about
early results and prototypes developed in the context of an ongoing project,
our proposal has undergone practical applications with real investigation data.
As a consequence, we had the chance to interact closely with prosecutors,
collecting positive feedback but also identifying interesting opportunities as
well as promising research directions to share with the research community.

TL;DR: 提出了操作安全性的概念，并开发了OffTopicEval评估套件来测量LLM在特定用例中适当接受或拒绝用户查询的能力。研究发现当前所有主流LLM的操作安全性都不足，并提出了两种基于提示的引导方法来显著改善性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业部署LLM时面临的核心问题是模型是否能在特定用例中安全运行，即能否适当接受或拒绝与任务无关的查询，这比通用的安全危害更为基础。

Method: 提出了操作安全性的定义，开发了OffTopicEval评估套件，在6个模型家族的20个开源LLM上进行评估，并提出了两种提示引导方法：查询接地(Q-ground)和系统提示接地(P-ground)。

Result: 所有测试模型的操作安全性都不理想，最强模型Qwen-3(235B)和Mistral(24B)分别只有77.77%和79.96%，GPT模型在62-73%范围，Phi模型48-70%，Gemma和Llama-3分别只有39.53%和23.84%。提示引导方法显著改善了性能，Q-ground提升达23%，P-ground提升更大，Llama-3.3(70B)提升41%，Qwen-3(30B)提升27%。

Conclusion: LLM的操作安全性是当前亟需解决的问题，基于提示的引导方法作为初步解决方案显示出巨大潜力，为构建更可靠的基于LLM的智能体迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) safety is one of the most pressing challenges for
enabling wide-scale deployment. While most studies and global discussions focus
on generic harms, such as models assisting users in harming themselves or
others, enterprises face a more fundamental concern: whether LLM-based agents
are safe for their intended use case. To address this, we introduce operational
safety, defined as an LLM's ability to appropriately accept or refuse user
queries when tasked with a specific purpose. We further propose OffTopicEval,
an evaluation suite and benchmark for measuring operational safety both in
general and within specific agentic use cases. Our evaluations on six model
families comprising 20 open-weight LLMs reveal that while performance varies
across models, all of them remain highly operationally unsafe. Even the
strongest models -- Qwen-3 (235B) with 77.77\% and Mistral (24B) with 79.96\%
-- fall far short of reliable operational safety, while GPT models plateau in
the 62--73\% range, Phi achieves only mid-level scores (48--70\%), and Gemma
and Llama-3 collapse to 39.53\% and 23.84\%, respectively. While operational
safety is a core model alignment issue, to suppress these failures, we propose
prompt-based steering methods: query grounding (Q-ground) and system-prompt
grounding (P-ground), which substantially improve OOD refusal. Q-ground
provides consistent gains of up to 23\%, while P-ground delivers even larger
boosts, raising Llama-3.3 (70B) by 41\% and Qwen-3 (30B) by 27\%. These results
highlight both the urgent need for operational safety interventions and the
promise of prompt-based steering as a first step toward more reliable LLM-based
agents.

Motivation: 创建SCUBA基准是为了评估计算机使用代理在企业CRM工作流中的表现，填补现有基准在复杂企业软件生态系统评估方面的空白，加速可靠计算机使用代理的发展。

Method: SCUBA包含300个基于真实用户访谈的任务实例，涵盖三个主要角色（管理员、销售代表、服务代理），在Salesforce沙盒环境中运行，支持并行执行和细粒度评估指标。

Result: 在零样本设置下，开源模型代理成功率低于5%，闭源模型代理可达39%。演示增强设置可将成功率提升至50%，同时减少13%的时间和16%的成本。

Abstract: We introduce SCUBA, a benchmark designed to evaluate computer-use agents on
customer relationship management (CRM) workflows within the Salesforce
platform. SCUBA contains 300 task instances derived from real user interviews,
spanning three primary personas, platform administrators, sales
representatives, and service agents. The tasks test a range of
enterprise-critical abilities, including Enterprise Software UI navigation,
data manipulation, workflow automation, information retrieval, and
troubleshooting. To ensure realism, SCUBA operates in Salesforce sandbox
environments with support for parallel execution and fine-grained evaluation
metrics to capture milestone progress. We benchmark a diverse set of agents
under both zero-shot and demonstration-augmented settings. We observed huge
performance gaps in different agent design paradigms and gaps between the
open-source model and the closed-source model. In the zero-shot setting,
open-source model powered computer-use agents that have strong performance on
related benchmarks like OSWorld only have less than 5\% success rate on SCUBA,
while methods built on closed-source models can still have up to 39% task
success rate. In the demonstration-augmented settings, task success rates can
be improved to 50\% while simultaneously reducing time and costs by 13% and
16%, respectively. These findings highlight both the challenges of enterprise
tasks automation and the promise of agentic solutions. By offering a realistic
benchmark with interpretable evaluation, SCUBA aims to accelerate progress in
building reliable computer-use agents for complex business software ecosystems.

Motivation: 大型语言模型的快速发展导致对AI推理基础设施的巨大需求，而高端GPU虽然计算能力强，但带来了高昂的资本和运营成本。传统数据中心生命周期管理无法适应AI模型的快速演进、资源需求增长和多样化硬件配置。

Method: 从三个生命周期阶段重新设计AI数据中心：构建阶段优化电力、冷却和网络配置；硬件更新阶段制定与硬件趋势一致的策略；运营阶段采用软件优化降低成本。提出一个整体生命周期管理框架，协调这三个阶段的决策。

Result: 该系统相比传统方法将总拥有成本降低高达40%。

Conclusion: 需要重新思考整个AI数据中心生命周期管理，通过协调构建、硬件更新和运营阶段的决策，考虑工作负载动态、硬件演进和系统老化，才能充分发挥优化潜力。

Abstract: The rapid rise of large language models (LLMs) has been driving an enormous
demand for AI inference infrastructure, mainly powered by high-end GPUs. While
these accelerators offer immense computational power, they incur high capital
and operational costs due to frequent upgrades, dense power consumption, and
cooling demands, making total cost of ownership (TCO) for AI datacenters a
critical concern for cloud providers. Unfortunately, traditional datacenter
lifecycle management (designed for general-purpose workloads) struggles to keep
pace with AI's fast-evolving models, rising resource needs, and diverse
hardware profiles. In this paper, we rethink the AI datacenter lifecycle scheme
across three stages: building, hardware refresh, and operation. We show how
design choices in power, cooling, and networking provisioning impact long-term
TCO. We also explore refresh strategies aligned with hardware trends. Finally,
we use operation software optimizations to reduce cost. While these
optimizations at each stage yield benefits, unlocking the full potential
requires rethinking the entire lifecycle. Thus, we present a holistic lifecycle
management framework that coordinates and co-optimizes decisions across all
three stages, accounting for workload dynamics, hardware evolution, and system
aging. Our system reduces the TCO by up to 40\% over traditional approaches.
Using our framework we provide guidelines on how to manage AI datacenter
lifecycle for the future.

Abstract: Designing sparse attention for diffusion transformers requires reconciling
two-dimensional spatial locality with GPU efficiency, a trade-off that current
methods struggle to achieve. Existing approaches enforce two-dimensional
spatial locality but often incur uncoalesced memory access. We present
HilbertA, a 2D-aware and GPU-efficient sparse attention mechanism. HilbertA
reorders image tokens along Hilbert curves to achieve a contiguous memory
layout while preserving spatial neighborhoods, and employs a sliding schedule
across layers to enable long-range information propagation without repeated or
uncoalesced memory access. To further enhance cross-tile communication and
positional awareness, HilbertA introduces a small central shared region.
Implemented in Triton, HilbertA delivers comparable image quality with
significant acceleration over prior methods on Flux.1-dev, demonstrating the
feasibility of hardware-aligned two-dimensional sparse attention for
high-resolution image generation. HilbertA delivers attention speedups of
$2.3\times$ when generating $1024\times 1024$ images, and up to $4.17\times$ at
$2048\times 2048$, while achieving image quality comparable to or surpassing
baselines.

TL;DR: CritPt是首个针对未发表、研究级物理推理任务的基准测试，涵盖现代物理研究多个领域，包含71个复合研究挑战和190个检查点任务。当前最先进的大语言模型在独立检查点上表现初步潜力，但在完整研究规模挑战上仍远未达到可靠解决水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大语言模型在复杂、开放性的前沿物理研究挑战中的推理能力，了解物理学家希望LLM协助哪些类型的推理任务，弥合当前模型能力与真实物理研究需求之间的差距。

Method: 创建CritPt基准测试，包含71个复合研究挑战（模拟入门级完整研究项目）和190个更简单的检查点任务。所有问题由50+活跃物理研究人员基于自身研究新创建，采用自动化评分流程评估物理特定输出格式。

Result: 当前最先进LLM在独立检查点上显示初步潜力，但在完整研究挑战上表现不佳：基础模型最佳平均准确率仅4.0%（GPT-5），配备编码工具后适度提升至约10%。

Conclusion: CritPt揭示了当前模型能力与真实物理研究需求之间存在巨大差距，为开发科学基础的AI工具提供了指导基础。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) with reasoning capabilities are
progressing rapidly on high-school math competitions and coding, can they
reason effectively through complex, open-ended challenges found in frontier
physics research? And crucially, what kinds of reasoning tasks do physicists
want LLMs to assist with? To address these questions, we present the CritPt
(Complex Research using Integrated Thinking - Physics Test, pronounced
"critical point"), the first benchmark designed to test LLMs on unpublished,
research-level reasoning tasks that broadly covers modern physics research
areas, including condensed matter, quantum physics, atomic, molecular & optical
physics, astrophysics, high energy physics, mathematical physics, statistical
physics, nuclear physics, nonlinear dynamics, fluid dynamics and biophysics.
CritPt consists of 71 composite research challenges designed to simulate
full-scale research projects at the entry level, which are also decomposed to
190 simpler checkpoint tasks for more fine-grained insights. All problems are
newly created by 50+ active physics researchers based on their own research.
Every problem is hand-curated to admit a guess-resistant and machine-verifiable
answer and is evaluated by an automated grading pipeline heavily customized for
advanced physics-specific output formats. We find that while current
state-of-the-art LLMs show early promise on isolated checkpoints, they remain
far from being able to reliably solve full research-scale challenges: the best
average accuracy among base models is only 4.0% , achieved by GPT-5 (high),
moderately rising to around 10% when equipped with coding tools. Through the
realistic yet standardized evaluation offered by CritPt, we highlight a large
disconnect between current model capabilities and realistic physics research
demands, offering a foundation to guide the development of scientifically
grounded AI tools.

*Matheus Vinicius da Silva de Oliveira,Jonathan de Andrade Silva,Awdren de Lima Fontao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究通过蜕变测试评估了三个小型语言模型在RAG系统中的公平性，发现微小的人口统计变化会破坏三分之一的蜕变关系，种族线索是主要的偏见来源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs存在安全性和公平性问题，包括偏见漏洞和幻觉问题。RAG虽能缓解幻觉，但可能引入新的偏见问题，需要评估其公平性影响。

Method: 使用蜕变测试方法，在提示中引入受控的人口统计扰动，评估三个HuggingFace上的SLMs在情感分析任务中的公平性表现。

Result: 结果显示，微小的人口统计变化会破坏高达三分之一的蜕变关系，种族线索是主要的偏见来源，存在一致的偏见层级。

Conclusion: RAG中的检索组件需要仔细筛选以防止偏见放大，为开发者提供了实际警示，在采用可访问的SLMs时不能牺牲公平性和可靠性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used across multiple domains but
continue to raise concerns regarding security and fairness. Beyond known attack
vectors such as data poisoning and prompt injection, LLMs are also vulnerable
to fairness bugs. These refer to unintended behaviors influenced by sensitive
demographic cues (e.g., race or sexual orientation) that should not affect
outcomes. Another key issue is hallucination, where models generate plausible
yet false information. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a
strategy to mitigate hallucinations by combining external retrieval with text
generation. However, its adoption raises new fairness concerns, as the
retrieved content itself may surface or amplify bias. This study conducts
fairness testing through metamorphic testing (MT), introducing controlled
demographic perturbations in prompts to assess fairness in sentiment analysis
performed by three Small Language Models (SLMs) hosted on HuggingFace
(Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct, Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3, and Llama-3.1-Nemotron-8B),
each integrated into a RAG pipeline. Results show that minor demographic
variations can break up to one third of metamorphic relations (MRs). A detailed
analysis of these failures reveals a consistent bias hierarchy, with
perturbations involving racial cues being the predominant cause of the
violations. In addition to offering a comparative evaluation, this work
reinforces that the retrieval component in RAG must be carefully curated to
prevent bias amplification. The findings serve as a practical alert for
developers, testers and small organizations aiming to adopt accessible SLMs
without compromising fairness or reliability.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出BRIDGE框架，通过离线专家演示和在线人类偏好反馈相结合，解决强化学习在现实应用中奖励函数难以指定和探索不安全的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习在机器人、工业和医疗领域的应用面临两大障碍：难以准确指定奖励函数，以及不安全、数据需求大的探索风险。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：首先从无奖励的专家演示数据集中学习安全初始策略，然后使用基于偏好的在线人类反馈进行微调。提出BRIDGE算法，通过不确定性加权目标整合两种信号。

Result: 在离散和连续控制的MuJoCo环境中验证，BRIDGE比单独的行为克隆和在线偏好强化学习获得更低的遗憾值。遗憾界限随离线演示数量减少，明确连接离线数据量与在线样本效率。

Conclusion: 为设计更样本高效的交互式智能体建立了理论基础，证明了离线到在线方法的有效性。

Abstract: Deploying reinforcement learning (RL) in robotics, industry, and health care
is blocked by two obstacles: the difficulty of specifying accurate rewards and
the risk of unsafe, data-hungry exploration. We address this by proposing a
two-stage framework that first learns a safe initial policy from a reward-free
dataset of expert demonstrations, then fine-tunes it online using
preference-based human feedback. We provide the first principled analysis of
this offline-to-online approach and introduce BRIDGE, a unified algorithm that
integrates both signals via an uncertainty-weighted objective. We derive regret
bounds that shrink with the number of offline demonstrations, explicitly
connecting the quantity of offline data to online sample efficiency. We
validate BRIDGE in discrete and continuous control MuJoCo environments, showing
it achieves lower regret than both standalone behavioral cloning and online
preference-based RL. Our work establishes a theoretical foundation for
designing more sample-efficient interactive agents.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TimeRewarder是一种从被动视频中学习密集奖励信号的方法，通过建模帧间时间距离来估计任务进度，显著提升稀疏奖励任务的强化学习性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 设计密集奖励在机器人强化学习中需要大量人工工作且缺乏可扩展性，因此需要一种能够自动从视频中学习任务进度信号的方法。

Method: 从机器人演示和人类视频中提取帧对的时间距离来建模任务进度，然后将这些进度估计信号用作强化学习的逐步代理奖励。

Result: 在10个Meta-World任务中，TimeRewarder显著改善了稀疏奖励任务的RL性能，在9/10任务中达到近乎完美的成功率，仅需每个任务20万次环境交互，优于先前方法和手动设计的密集奖励。

Conclusion: TimeRewarder提供了一种可扩展的方法，能够从多样化视频源获取丰富的奖励信号，包括利用真实世界人类视频进行预训练。

Abstract: Designing dense rewards is crucial for reinforcement learning (RL), yet in
robotics it often demands extensive manual effort and lacks scalability. One
promising solution is to view task progress as a dense reward signal, as it
quantifies the degree to which actions advance the system toward task
completion over time. We present TimeRewarder, a simple yet effective reward
learning method that derives progress estimation signals from passive videos,
including robot demonstrations and human videos, by modeling temporal distances
between frame pairs. We then demonstrate how TimeRewarder can supply step-wise
proxy rewards to guide reinforcement learning. In our comprehensive experiments
on ten challenging Meta-World tasks, we show that TimeRewarder dramatically
improves RL for sparse-reward tasks, achieving nearly perfect success in 9/10
tasks with only 200,000 interactions per task with the environment. This
approach outperformed previous methods and even the manually designed
environment dense reward on both the final success rate and sample efficiency.
Moreover, we show that TimeRewarder pretraining can exploit real-world human
videos, highlighting its potential as a scalable approach path to rich reward
signals from diverse video sources.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为“测量树”的新度量方法，通过分层有向图结构结合多种测量结构，提供可解释的多层次测量表示，增强AI系统评估的透明度和异质证据整合能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 响应扩大AI系统评估范围的呼吁，解决传统度量方法在透明度和异质证据整合方面的局限性，为复杂构念的测量提供更透明的方法。

Method: 开发测量树作为新型度量类别，构建分层有向图结构，每个节点通过用户定义的聚合方法总结其子节点，支持多种测量信号的整合。

Result: 通过大规模测量实践验证了测量树的实用性，提供了定义、示例和开源Python代码，展示了在AI评估中的实际应用价值。

Conclusion: 测量树为复杂构念的透明测量提供了原则性基础，支持更广泛和可解释的AI评估，是传统度量方法的重要扩展。

Abstract: This paper introduces \textit{measurement trees}, a novel class of metrics
designed to combine various constructs into an interpretable multi-level
representation of a measurand. Unlike conventional metrics that yield single
values, vectors, surfaces, or categories, measurement trees produce a
hierarchical directed graph in which each node summarizes its children through
user-defined aggregation methods. In response to recent calls to expand the
scope of AI system evaluation, measurement trees enhance metric transparency
and facilitate the integration of heterogeneous evidence, including, e.g.,
agentic, business, energy-efficiency, sociotechnical, or security signals. We
present definitions and examples, demonstrate practical utility through a
large-scale measurement exercise, and provide accompanying open-source Python
code. By operationalizing a transparent approach to measurement of complex
constructs, this work offers a principled foundation for broader and more
interpretable AI evaluation.

*Shuyang Hou,Haoyue Jiao,Ziqi Liu,Lutong Xie,Guanyu Chen,Shaowen Wu,Xuefeng Guan,Huayi Wu*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 该研究提出了GeoSQL-Eval，首个针对PostGIS查询生成的端到端自动化评估框架，并创建了包含14178个问题的GeoSQL-Bench基准数据集，系统评估了24个代表性模型在空间数据库中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估主要关注通用关系数据库或Google Earth Engine代码生成，缺乏针对空间数据库的系统性基准，而LLM在GeoSQL任务中面临空间函数复杂性、几何数据类型和执行语义的挑战。

Method: 基于Webb的知识深度模型构建评估框架，包含四个认知维度、五个熟练度级别和二十个任务类别；创建包含14178个问题、340个PostGIS函数和82个领域特定数据库的基准数据集；使用熵权法和统计分析评估模型性能。

Result: 系统评估了24个代表性模型，揭示了性能差异、错误分布和资源消耗模式；建立了公开的GeoSQL-Eval排行榜，供全球研究团队持续测试和比较。

Conclusion: 这些贡献不仅扩展了NL2SQL应用的边界，还为评估LLM在空间数据库环境中的性能提供了标准化、可解释和可扩展的框架，为地理信息科学、城市研究和空间分析中的模型优化和应用提供了宝贵见解。

Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable
progress in natural language understanding and structured query generation
(NL2SQL). However, extending these advances to GeoSQL tasks in the PostGIS
environment remains challenging due to the complexity of spatial functions,
geometric data types, and execution semantics. Existing evaluations primarily
focus on general relational databases or Google Earth Engine code generation,
leaving a lack of systematic benchmarks tailored to spatial databases. To
address this gap, this study introduces GeoSQL-Eval, the first end-to-end
automated evaluation framework for PostGIS query generation. Built upon Webb's
Depth of Knowledge (DOK) model, the framework encompasses four cognitive
dimensions, five proficiency levels, and twenty task categories, providing a
comprehensive assessment of model performance in terms of knowledge
acquisition, syntactic generation, semantic alignment, execution accuracy, and
robustness. In parallel, we developed GeoSQL-Bench, a benchmark dataset
comprising 14178 questions that span three task types, 340 PostGIS functions,
and 82 domain-specific databases. Leveraging this framework, we systematically
evaluated 24 representative models across six categories, applying
entropy-weighting and statistical analyses to reveal differences in
performance, error distributions, and resource consumption patterns.
Furthermore, we established a public GeoSQL-Eval leaderboard that enables
global research teams to conduct ongoing testing and comparison. These
contributions not only extend the boundaries of NL2SQL applications but also
provide a standardized, interpretable, and scalable framework for evaluating
LLM performance in spatial database contexts, offering valuable insights for
model optimization and applications in geographic information science, urban
studies, and spatial analysis.

TL;DR: ActorDB是一个新颖的数据库架构，集成了单写入者actor模型、增量视图维护和零信任安全模型，旨在降低现代数据密集型应用的架构复杂性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为现代数据密集型应用提供一个开箱即用的解决方案，避免手动集成actor持久化、流处理和安全性等独立系统，从而提供更健壮、安全和开发者友好的平台。

Method: 采用单写入者actor模型处理写入操作，结合增量视图维护技术，并以零信任安全模型作为核心组件，将这些复杂概念统一到一个系统中。

Result: 提出了ActorDB的核心架构，讨论了设计中的关键权衡，并定义了验证该方法的最低可行产品的性能标准。

Conclusion: 通过将actor模型、增量视图维护和零信任安全统一到单一系统中，ActorDB能够显著降低应用开发的架构复杂性。

Abstract: This paper presents ActorDB ( Dekigoto ) , a novel database architecture that
tightly integrates a single-writer actor model for writes, Incremental View
Maintenance (IVM), and a zero-trust security model as a core component. The
primary contribution of this work is the unification of these powerful but
complex concepts into a single, cohesive system designed to reduce
architectural complexity for developers of modern, data-intensive applications.
We argue that by providing these capabilities out-of-the-box, ActorDB can offer
a more robust, secure, and developer-friendly platform compared to solutions
that require manual integration of separate systems for actor persistence,
stream processing, and security. We present the core architecture, discuss the
critical trade-offs in its design, and define the performance criteria for a
Minimum Viable Product (MVP) to validate our approach.

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Transformer的属性感知模式感知框架(PAT)，用于关系数据库的错误检测，通过学习的模式模块和QTA分词器，在减少模型参数的同时提高了检测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前错误检测方法采用多检测器处理异构属性成本高，且数据预处理策略未能利用数据序列的可变长度特性，导致准确性降低。

Method: 1. 引入学习的模式模块捕获属性特定的数据分布；2. 设计QTA分词器根据序列长度和词类型划分单元格序列，生成词自适应数据标记；3. 通过交织数据标记和属性特定模式标记联合学习共享特征。

Result: 在广泛实验中，PAT相比最先进的数据错误检测方法获得了优秀的F1分数，同时在使用紧凑QTA分词器时显著减少了模型参数和FLOPs。

Conclusion: PAT框架通过属性感知的模式学习和高效的标记化策略，在关系数据库错误检测中实现了高精度和高效率的平衡。

Abstract: Error detection in relational databases is critical for maintaining data
quality and is fundamental to tasks such as data cleaning and assessment.
Current error detection studies mostly employ the multi-detector approach to
handle heterogeneous attributes in databases, incurring high costs.
Additionally, their data preprocessing strategies fail to leverage the
variable-length characteristic of data sequences, resulting in reduced
accuracy. In this paper, we propose an attribute-wise PAttern-perceptive
Transformer (PAT) framework for error detection in relational databases. First,
PAT introduces a learned pattern module that captures attribute-specific data
distributions through learned embeddings during model training. Second, the
Quasi-Tokens Arrangement (QTA) tokenizer is designed to divide the cell
sequence based on its length and word types, and then generate the
word-adaptive data tokens, meanwhile providing compact hyperparameters to
ensure efficiency. By interleaving data tokens with the attribute-specific
pattern tokens, PAT jointly learns shared data features across different
attributes and pattern features that are distinguishable and unique in each
specified attribute. Third, PAT visualizes the attention map to interpret its
error detection mechanism. Extensive experiments show that PAT achieves
excellent F1 scores compared to state-of-the-art data error detection methods.
Moreover, PAT significantly reduces the model parameters and FLOPs when
applying the compact QTA tokenizer.

TL;DR: 提出了FAIR语法框架，通过语义单元实现数据知识的模块化分解，构建连接人类认知与机器可操作性的统一语义基础


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前数字基础设施缺乏统一的语义框架来连接人类认知和机器可操作性，无法有效支持FAIR原则的实施

Conclusion: FAIR语法为跨生态系统基础设施演进提供了语义优先的基础，支持模块化、AI就绪和引用粒度的学术交流

Abstract: The FAIR Principles aim to make data and knowledge Findable, Accessible,
Interoperable, and Reusable, yet current digital infrastructures often lack a
unifying semantic framework that bridges human cognition and
machine-actionability. In this paper, we introduce the Grammar of FAIR: a
granular and modular architecture for FAIR semantics built on the concept of
semantic units. Semantic units, comprising atomic statement units and composite
compound units, implement the principle of semantic modularisation, decomposing
data and knowledge into independently identifiable, semantically meaningful,
and machine-actionable units. A central metaphor guiding our approach is the
analogy between the hierarchy of level of organisation in biological systems
and the hierarchy of levels of organisation in information systems: both are
structured by granular building blocks that mediate across multiple
perspectives while preserving functional unity. Drawing further inspiration
from concept formation and natural language grammar, we show how these building
blocks map to FAIR Digitial Objects (FDOs), enabling format-agnostic semantic
transitivity from natural language token models to schema-based
representations. This dual biological-linguistic analogy provides a
semantics-first foundation for evolving cross-ecosystem infrastructures, paving
the way for the Internet of FAIR Data and Services (IFDS) and a future of
modular, AI-ready, and citation-granular scholarly communication.
