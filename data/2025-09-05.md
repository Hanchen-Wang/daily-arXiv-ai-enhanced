### [1] [Towards Efficient General Feature Prediction in Masked Skeleton Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03609)
*Shengkai Sun,Zefan Zhang,Jianfeng Dong,Zhiyong Cheng,Xiaojun Chang,Meng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出GFP框架，用高级特征预测替代传统低级坐标重建，实现高效骨架动作识别


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MAE方法局限于原始关节坐标重建，导致计算冗余和语义表示有限

Method: 使用轻量级目标生成网络动态产生多样化监督信号，采用约束优化确保特征多样性

Result: 训练速度比标准方法快6.2倍，在NTU和PKU-MMD数据集上达到SOTA性能

Conclusion: GFP框架通过高级特征预测显著提升计算效率和表示质量

Abstract: Recent advances in the masked autoencoder (MAE) paradigm have significantly
propelled self-supervised skeleton-based action recognition. However, most
existing approaches limit reconstruction targets to raw joint coordinates or
their simple variants, resulting in computational redundancy and limited
semantic representation. To address this, we propose a novel General Feature
Prediction framework (GFP) for efficient mask skeleton modeling. Our key
innovation is replacing conventional low-level reconstruction with high-level
feature prediction that spans from local motion patterns to global semantic
representations. Specifically, we introduce a collaborative learning framework
where a lightweight target generation network dynamically produces diversified
supervision signals across spatial-temporal hierarchies, avoiding reliance on
pre-computed offline features. The framework incorporates constrained
optimization to ensure feature diversity while preventing model collapse.
Experiments on NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120 and PKU-MMD demonstrate the benefits
of our approach: Computational efficiency (with 6.2$\times$ faster training
than standard masked skeleton modeling methods) and superior representation
quality, achieving state-of-the-art performance in various downstream tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于UNet分割背链的教师-学生模型，通过对比表征学习和域对抗训练模块，解决有棒分裂图识别中的域假移和数据不平衡问题，在预测试验中取得了较好的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 有棒分裂图计数工作耗时且存在观察者间变异性，AI工具虽能自动检测但容易受域假移影响，同时有棒分裂数量远少于正常核心导致严重的数据不平衡问题。

Result: 在预测试验集上，算法在踪迹1任务中获得F1分数0.7660，在踪迹2任务中获得平衡准确率0.8414。

Conclusion: 将基于分割的检测和分类集成到统一框架中，能够实现稳健的有棒分裂分析，有效解决了域假移和数据不平衡的挑战。

Abstract: Counting mitotic figures is time-intensive for pathologists and leads to
inter-observer variability. Artificial intelligence (AI) promises a solution by
automatically detecting mitotic figures while maintaining decision consistency.
However, AI tools are susceptible to domain shift, where a significant drop in
performance can occur due to differences in the training and testing sets,
including morphological diversity between organs, species, and variations in
staining protocols. Furthermore, the number of mitoses is much less than the
count of normal nuclei, which introduces severely imbalanced data for the
detection task. In this work, we formulate mitosis detection as a pixel-level
segmentation and propose a teacher-student model that simultaneously addresses
mitosis detection (Track 1) and atypical mitosis classification (Track 2). Our
method is based on a UNet segmentation backbone that integrates domain
generalization modules, namely contrastive representation learning and
domain-adversarial training. A teacher-student strategy is employed to generate
pixel-level pseudo-masks not only for annotated mitoses and hard negatives but
also for normal nuclei, thereby enhancing feature discrimination and improving
robustness against domain shift. For the classification task, we introduce a
multi-scale CNN classifier that leverages feature maps from the segmentation
model within a multi-task learning paradigm. On the preliminary test set, the
algorithm achieved an F1 score of 0.7660 in Track 1 and balanced accuracy of
0.8414 in Track 2, demonstrating the effectiveness of integrating
segmentation-based detection and classification into a unified framework for
robust mitosis analysis.

### [3] [Multi Attribute Bias Mitigation via Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03616)
*Rajeev Ranjan Dwivedi,Ankur Kumar,Vinod K Kurmi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GMBM是一个两阶段框架，通过自适应偏差集成学习和梯度抑制微调，有效解决多偏差问题，提升模型鲁棒性和公平性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界图像存在多种重叠偏差，单独处理某个偏差往往会导致其他偏差加剧，需要综合解决方案

Method: 两阶段框架：1) 自适应偏差集成学习识别已知偏差 2) 梯度抑制微调从主干网络中修剪偏差方向

Result: 在多个数据集上显著提升最差组准确率，将多属性偏差放大减半，并实现最低的SBA指标

Conclusion: GMBM是首个实用的端到端多偏差视觉识别解决方案，能有效应对偏差复杂性和分布偏移

Abstract: Real world images frequently exhibit multiple overlapping biases, including
textures, watermarks, gendered makeup, scene object pairings, etc. These biases
collectively impair the performance of modern vision models, undermining both
their robustness and fairness. Addressing these biases individually proves
inadequate, as mitigating one bias often permits or intensifies others. We
tackle this multi bias problem with Generalized Multi Bias Mitigation (GMBM), a
lean two stage framework that needs group labels only while training and
minimizes bias at test time. First, Adaptive Bias Integrated Learning (ABIL)
deliberately identifies the influence of known shortcuts by training encoders
for each attribute and integrating them with the main backbone, compelling the
classifier to explicitly recognize these biases. Then Gradient Suppression Fine
Tuning prunes those very bias directions from the backbone's gradients, leaving
a single compact network that ignores all the shortcuts it just learned to
recognize. Moreover we find that existing bias metrics break under subgroup
imbalance and train test distribution shifts, so we introduce Scaled Bias
Amplification (SBA): a test time measure that disentangles model induced bias
amplification from distributional differences. We validate GMBM on FB CMNIST,
CelebA, and COCO, where we boost worst group accuracy, halve multi attribute
bias amplification, and set a new low in SBA even as bias complexity and
distribution shifts intensify, making GMBM the first practical, end to end
multibias solution for visual recognition. Project page:

### [4] [Lightweight image segmentation for echocardiography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03631)
*Anders Kjelsrud,Lasse Løvstakken,Erik Smistad,Håvard Dalen,Gilles Van De Vyver*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文通过细细分析nnU-Net的各个组件，发现简单的affine增帽和深度监督是关键因素，从而开发了一个轻量级U-Net模型，在保持类似性能的同时大大缩小了模型规模和提高了速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然nnU-Net在心臂分割任务上表现良好，但模型过大过慢，限制了实时应用。需要找到最有效的组件来构建更轻量、更快速的模型。

Method: 通过游离研究步步评估了数据增帽方案、网络结构修改、损失函数和后处理技术。基于分析结果开发了一个轻量级U-Net模型。

Result: 轻量级U-Net（2M参数）在CAMUS数据集上达到了与nnU-Net（33M参数）统计学等效的性能（Dice分数LV/MYO/LA为0.93/0.85/0.89 vs 0.93/0.86/0.89，$p>0.05$），同时模型规模缩小16倍，速度提高4倍（1.35ms vs 5.40ms每帧）。跨数据集验证也显示了类似的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 简单的affine增帽和深度监督是心臂分割的关键技术，而复杂的增帽和大容量模型带来的收益逐渐减少。通过优化这些关键组件，可以实现更高效的轻量级模型设计。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of the left ventricle in echocardiography can enable
fully automatic extraction of clinical measurements such as volumes and
ejection fraction. While models configured by nnU-Net perform well, they are
large and slow, thus limiting real-time use. We identified the most effective
components of nnU-Net for cardiac segmentation through an ablation study,
incrementally evaluating data augmentation schemes, architectural
modifications, loss functions, and post-processing techniques. Our analysis
revealed that simple affine augmentations and deep supervision drive
performance, while complex augmentations and large model capacity offer
diminishing returns. Based on these insights, we developed a lightweight U-Net
(2M vs 33M parameters) that achieves statistically equivalent performance to
nnU-Net on CAMUS (N=500) with Dice scores of 0.93/0.85/0.89 vs 0.93/0.86/0.89
for LV/MYO/LA ($p>0.05$), while being 16 times smaller and 4 times faster
(1.35ms vs 5.40ms per frame) than the default nnU-Net configuration.
Cross-dataset evaluation on an internal dataset (N=311) confirms comparable
generalization.

### [5] [treeX: Unsupervised Tree Instance Segmentation in Dense Forest Point Clouds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03633)
*Josafat-Mattias Burmeister,Andreas Tockner,Stefan Reder,Markus Engel,Rico Richter,Jan-Peter Mund,Jürgen Döllner*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了treeX算法的改进版本，用于从近距离激光扫描点云中无监督地分割单棵树，相比原算法减少了运行时间并提高了准确性，特别在无人机激光扫描数据上表现显著提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的深度学习树实例分割方法需要大量标注数据和计算资源，需要一种资源效率更高的替代方案

Method: 改进的treeX算法结合基于聚类的树干检测和区域生长的树冠划分，提供地面激光扫描和无人机激光扫描两种参数预设

Result: 在六个公共数据集上评估，相比原算法F1分数提升0.11-0.49，无人机数据F1分数达0.58，地面数据精度与最新开源方法相当

Conclusion: 该方法可作为深度学习的资源高效替代方案，也可用于深度学习模型的半自动标签生成，已开源实现

Abstract: Close-range laser scanning provides detailed 3D captures of forest stands but
requires efficient software for processing 3D point cloud data and extracting
individual trees. Although recent studies have introduced deep learning methods
for tree instance segmentation, these approaches require large annotated
datasets and substantial computational resources. As a resource-efficient
alternative, we present a revised version of the treeX algorithm, an
unsupervised method that combines clustering-based stem detection with region
growing for crown delineation. While the original treeX algorithm was developed
for personal laser scanning (PLS) data, we provide two parameter presets, one
for ground-based laser scanning (stationary terrestrial - TLS and PLS), and one
for UAV-borne laser scanning (ULS). We evaluated the method on six public
datasets (FOR-instance, ForestSemantic, LAUTx, NIBIO MLS, TreeLearn, Wytham
Woods) and compared it to six open-source methods (original treeX, treeiso,
RayCloudTools, ForAINet, SegmentAnyTree, TreeLearn). Compared to the original
treeX algorithm, our revision reduces runtime and improves accuracy, with
instance detection F$_1$-score gains of +0.11 to +0.49 for ground-based data.
For ULS data, our preset achieves an F$_1$-score of 0.58, whereas the original
algorithm fails to segment any correct instances. For TLS and PLS data, our
algorithm achieves accuracy similar to recent open-source methods, including
deep learning. Given its algorithmic design, we see two main applications for
our method: (1) as a resource-efficient alternative to deep learning approaches
in scenarios where the data characteristics align with the method design
(sufficient stem visibility and point density), and (2) for the semi-automatic
generation of labels for deep learning models. To enable broader adoption, we
provide an open-source Python implementation in the pointtree package.

### [6] [Reg3D: Reconstructive Geometry Instruction Tuning for 3D Scene Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03635)
*Hongpei Zheng,Lintao Xiang,Qijun Yang,Qian Lin,Hujun Yin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Reg3D是一个创新的重建几何指令调优框架，通过将几何感知监督直接整合到训练过程中，解决了现有方法仅依赖文本监督的局限性，显著提升了3D场景理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型多模态模型在2D视觉理解方面取得了显著进展，但扩展到3D场景理解仍面临挑战。现有方法主要依赖纯文本监督，无法提供学习鲁棒3D空间表示所需的几何约束。

Method: Reg3D采用双监督范式，在双编码器架构中设计了互补的对象级和帧级重建任务，既将3D几何信息作为输入，又作为明确的学习目标，强制几何一致性以促进空间推理能力的发展。

Result: 在ScanQA、Scan2Cap、ScanRefer和SQA3D等多个数据集上的广泛实验表明，Reg3D带来了显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: Reg3D为空间感知多模态模型建立了一个新的训练范式，通过重建底层几何结构而非仅仅描述它们，实现了更有效的3D理解。

Abstract: The rapid development of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) has led to remarkable
progress in 2D visual understanding; however, extending these capabilities to
3D scene understanding remains a significant challenge. Existing approaches
predominantly rely on text-only supervision, which fails to provide the
geometric constraints required for learning robust 3D spatial representations.
In this paper, we introduce Reg3D, a novel Reconstructive Geometry Instruction
Tuning framework that addresses this limitation by incorporating geometry-aware
supervision directly into the training process. Our key insight is that
effective 3D understanding necessitates reconstructing underlying geometric
structures rather than merely describing them. Unlike existing methods that
inject 3D information solely at the input level, Reg3D adopts a
dual-supervision paradigm that leverages 3D geometric information both as input
and as explicit learning targets. Specifically, we design complementary
object-level and frame-level reconstruction tasks within a dual-encoder
architecture, enforcing geometric consistency to encourage the development of
spatial reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments on ScanQA, Scan2Cap,
ScanRefer, and SQA3D demonstrate that Reg3D delivers substantial performance
improvements, establishing a new training paradigm for spatially aware
multimodal models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: QuantV2X是首个完全量化的多模态多智能体V2X协同感知系统，通过统一的端到端量化策略，在保持精度的同时显著降低计算负载和传输带宽，系统延迟降低3.2倍，mAP30提升9.5。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的V2X协同感知研究主要关注精度指标，忽视了效率、延迟和实际部署等系统级考量。大多数系统依赖全精度模型，计算和传输成本高，难以在资源受限环境中实时运行。

Method: 提出QuantV2X系统，采用统一的端到端量化策略，对神经网络模型和传输消息表示同时进行量化，在低比特约束下运行。

Result: 在保持与全精度系统相当精度的同时，系统级延迟降低3.2倍，mAP30指标提升9.5，并能更有效地扩展，使更大模型适应严格内存预算。

Conclusion: QuantV2X证明了完全量化的多智能体中间融合系统在实际部署中的可行性，为V2X协同感知的实际应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Cooperative perception through Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication
offers significant potential for enhancing vehicle perception by mitigating
occlusions and expanding the field of view. However, past research has
predominantly focused on improving accuracy metrics without addressing the
crucial system-level considerations of efficiency, latency, and real-world
deployability. Noticeably, most existing systems rely on full-precision models,
which incur high computational and transmission costs, making them impractical
for real-time operation in resource-constrained environments. In this paper, we
introduce \textbf{QuantV2X}, the first fully quantized multi-agent system
designed specifically for efficient and scalable deployment of multi-modal,
multi-agent V2X cooperative perception. QuantV2X introduces a unified
end-to-end quantization strategy across both neural network models and
transmitted message representations that simultaneously reduces computational
load and transmission bandwidth. Remarkably, despite operating under low-bit
constraints, QuantV2X achieves accuracy comparable to full-precision systems.
More importantly, when evaluated under deployment-oriented metrics, QuantV2X
reduces system-level latency by 3.2$\times$ and achieves a +9.5 improvement in
mAP30 over full-precision baselines. Furthermore, QuantV2X scales more
effectively, enabling larger and more capable models to fit within strict
memory budgets. These results highlight the viability of a fully quantized
multi-agent intermediate fusion system for real-world deployment. The system
will be publicly released to promote research in this field:

Motivation: 评估三种深度学习架构在基于植物叶脉模式的自动种类分类中的效能，叶脉模式是具有高分类学相关性的关键形态特征

Method: 使用瑞典叶片数据集（15种植物，1,125张图片），对ResNet50、MobileNetV2和EfficientNetB0进行训练和测试，采用标准性能指标评估

Result: ResNet50训练准确率94.11%但存在过拟合，测试准确率88.45%；MobileNetV2测试准确率93.34%，具有更好的普通化能力；EfficientNetB0表现最优，测试准确率94.67%，准确率、召回率和F1分数均超过94.6%

Conclusion: 深度学习特别是EfficientNetB0在基于叶脉特征的自动植物分类中具有强大潜力，可以开发可扩展的高准确工具

Abstract: This study evaluates the efficacy of three deep learning architectures:
ResNet50, MobileNetV2, and EfficientNetB0 for automated plant species
classification based on leaf venation patterns, a critical morphological
feature with high taxonomic relevance. Using the Swedish Leaf Dataset
comprising images from 15 distinct species (75 images per species, totalling
1,125 images), the models were demonstrated using standard performance metrics
during training and testing phases. ResNet50 achieved a training accuracy of
94.11% but exhibited overfitting, reflected by a reduced testing accuracy of
88.45% and an F1 score of 87.82%. MobileNetV2 demonstrated better
generalization capabilities, attaining a testing accuracy of 93.34% and an F1
score of 93.23%, indicating its suitability for lightweight, real-time
applications. EfficientNetB0 outperformed both models, achieving a testing
accuracy of 94.67% with precision, recall, and F1 scores exceeding 94.6%,
highlighting its robustness in venation-based classification. The findings
underscore the potential of deep learning, particularly EfficientNetB0, in
developing scalable and accurate tools for automated plant taxonomy using
venation traits.

### [9] [LayoutGKN: Graph Similarity Learning of Floor Plans](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03737)
*Casper van Engelenburg,Jan van Gemert,Seyran Khademi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LayoutGKN是一种高效的图匹配方法，通过推迟跨图节点级交互到联合嵌入架构的最后阶段，使用可微分图核作为距离函数，在保持相似性计算性能的同时显著提升速度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 平面图通常表示为图结构来捕捉空间关系，图比较对于搜索、聚类和数据可视化等应用至关重要。现有的图匹配网络依赖昂贵的中间跨图节点级交互，导致推理时间缓慢

Method: 提出LayoutGKN方法，将跨图节点级交互推迟到联合嵌入架构的最后阶段，使用可微分图核作为最终学习到的节点级嵌入的距离函数

Result: LayoutGKN在相似性计算方面表现相当或优于图匹配网络，同时显著提高了速度

Conclusion: LayoutGKN提供了一种更高效的图比较方法，在保持性能的同时大幅提升推理速度，代码和数据已开源

Abstract: Floor plans depict building layouts and are often represented as graphs to
capture the underlying spatial relationships. Comparison of these graphs is
critical for applications like search, clustering, and data visualization. The
most successful methods to compare graphs \ie, graph matching networks, rely on
costly intermediate cross-graph node-level interactions, therefore being slow
in inference time. We introduce \textbf{LayoutGKN}, a more efficient approach
that postpones the cross-graph node-level interactions to the end of the joint
embedding architecture. We do so by using a differentiable graph kernel as a
distance function on the final learned node-level embeddings. We show that
LayoutGKN computes similarity comparably or better than graph matching networks
while significantly increasing the speed.

### [10] [Singular Value Few-shot Adaptation of Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03740)
*Taha Koleilat,Hassan Rivaz,Yiming Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLIP-SVD是一种基于奇异值分解的多模态参数高效适应方法，仅微调CLIP参数矩阵的奇异值，用0.04%的参数实现领域适应，在多个数据集上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型适应方法依赖提示工程和完整微调，成本高且可能破坏预训练知识，需要更高效的适应技术。

Method: 使用奇异值分解(SVD)修改CLIP内部参数空间，仅微调奇异值来重新缩放基向量，不注入额外模块。

Result: 在11个自然和10个生物医学数据集上实现最先进的分类结果，在少样本设置下准确率和泛化能力均优于先前方法。

Conclusion: CLIP-SVD提供了一种参数高效、性能优越且可解释的CLIP适应方法，能更好地保持模型的泛化能力。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP have shown impressive zero-shot and
few-shot learning capabilities across diverse applications. However, adapting
these models to new fine-grained domains remains difficult due to reliance on
prompt engineering and the high cost of full model fine-tuning. Existing
adaptation approaches rely on augmented components, such as prompt tokens and
adapter modules, which could limit adaptation quality, destabilize the model,
and compromise the rich knowledge learned during pretraining. In this work, we
present \textbf{CLIP-SVD}, a novel \textit{multi-modal} and
\textit{parameter-efficient} adaptation technique that leverages Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD) to modify the internal parameter space of CLIP without
injecting additional modules. Specifically, we fine-tune only the singular
values of the CLIP parameter matrices to rescale the basis vectors for domain
adaptation while retaining the pretrained model. This design enables enhanced
adaptation performance using only \textbf{0.04\%} of the model's total
parameters and better preservation of its generalization ability. CLIP-SVD
achieves state-of-the-art classification results on 11 natural and 10
biomedical datasets, outperforming previous methods in both accuracy and
generalization under few-shot settings. Additionally, we leverage a natural
language-based approach to analyze the effectiveness and dynamics of the CLIP
adaptation to allow interpretability of CLIP-SVD. The code is publicly
available at https://github.com/HealthX-Lab/CLIP-SVD.

### [11] [STA-Net: A Decoupled Shape and Texture Attention Network for Lightweight Plant Disease Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03754)
*Zongsen Qiu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了STA-Net模型，通过形状-纹理注意力模块(STAM)和训练免费的神经网络架构搜索(DeepMAD)，解决了边缘设备上植物病害诊断模型的轻量化挑战，在CCMT数据集上达到了89.00%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 因为当前的轻量网络通常使用通用的注意机制，无法有效捐捕植物病害的缩微病理特征，如不规则痕痘形状和复杂纹理，因此需要专门为植物病害诊断设计的注意力机制。

Method: 1) 使用训练免费的神经网络架构搜索方法(DeepMAD)构建高效边缘设备网络背骨 2) 提出形状-纹理注意力模块(STAM)，将注意力分为两个分支：使用可变形卷积(DCNv4)的形状感知分支和使用Gabor滤波器的纹理感知分支

Result: 在公开CCMT植物病害数据集上，STA-Net模型(仅401K参数和51.1M FLOPs)达到了89.00%的准确率和88.96%的F1分数。消融实验证明STAM在基准模型和标准注意力模型上显著提升了性能。

Conclusion: 通过解耦注意力机制集成领域知识，为边缘部署的精准农业AI提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Responding to rising global food security needs, precision agriculture and
deep learning-based plant disease diagnosis have become crucial. Yet, deploying
high-precision models on edge devices is challenging. Most lightweight networks
use attention mechanisms designed for generic object recognition, which poorly
capture subtle pathological features like irregular lesion shapes and complex
textures. To overcome this, we propose a twofold solution: first, using a
training-free neural architecture search method (DeepMAD) to create an
efficient network backbone for edge devices; second, introducing the
Shape-Texture Attention Module (STAM). STAM splits attention into two branches
-- one using deformable convolutions (DCNv4) for shape awareness and the other
using a Gabor filter bank for texture awareness. On the public CCMT plant
disease dataset, our STA-Net model (with 401K parameters and 51.1M FLOPs)
reached 89.00% accuracy and an F1 score of 88.96%. Ablation studies confirm
STAM significantly improves performance over baseline and standard attention
models. Integrating domain knowledge via decoupled attention thus presents a
promising path for edge-deployed precision agriculture AI. The source code is
available at https://github.com/RzMY/STA-Net.

TL;DR: 提出了水下伪装目标检测(UCOD)任务和DeepCamo基准数据集，开发了SLENet框架，通过Gamma-非对称增强模块和定位引导分支提升检测性能，在多个数据集上验证了其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下伪装目标检测对海洋生态学至关重要，但目前研究不足，且受到光学畸变、水体浑浊和海洋生物复杂特性的严重影响。

Method: 提出SLENet框架，包含Gamma-非对称增强(GAE)模块增强多尺度特征表示，定位引导分支(LGB)生成富含全局语义信息的位置图，多尺度监督解码器(MSSD)进行精确预测。

Result: 在DeepCamo数据集和三个基准COD数据集上的实验表明，SLENet性能优于当前最先进方法，并展现出对更广泛COD任务的高泛化能力。

Conclusion: SLENet框架有效解决了水下伪装目标检测的挑战，为海洋生态研究提供了有力的技术支撑，在多个数据集上验证了其优越性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Underwater Camouflaged Object Detection (UCOD) aims to identify objects that
blend seamlessly into underwater environments. This task is critically
important to marine ecology. However, it remains largely underexplored and
accurate identification is severely hindered by optical distortions, water
turbidity, and the complex traits of marine organisms. To address these
challenges, we introduce the UCOD task and present DeepCamo, a benchmark
dataset designed for this domain. We also propose Semantic Localization and
Enhancement Network (SLENet), a novel framework for UCOD. We first benchmark
state-of-the-art COD models on DeepCamo to reveal key issues, upon which SLENet
is built. In particular, we incorporate Gamma-Asymmetric Enhancement (GAE)
module and a Localization Guidance Branch (LGB) to enhance multi-scale feature
representation while generating a location map enriched with global semantic
information. This map guides the Multi-Scale Supervised Decoder (MSSD) to
produce more accurate predictions. Experiments on our DeepCamo dataset and
three benchmark COD datasets confirm SLENet's superior performance over SOTA
methods, and underscore its high generality for the broader COD task.

### [13] [Fitting Image Diffusion Models on Video Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03794)
*Juhun Lee,Simon S. Woo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过利用视频序列的时间归纳偏置来改善图像滿散模型的训练效果，加速收敛速度和提高生成质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图像滿散模型仅基于独立采样的静态图像进行训练，这种方式在捕捉时间信息方面有内在的信息缺失，导致收敛慢、分布覆盖范围有限和治理能力下降

Method: 提出一种简单有效的训练策略，利用连续视频帧中的时间归纳偏置来改善滿散训练，无需修改网络结构且可无缝集成到标准训练流程中

Result: 在HandCo数据集上验证，方法将收敛速度提高了2倍以上，在训练和验证集上都获得更低的FID指标，同时提高了生成的多样性，能够捕捉有意义的时间变化

Conclusion: 通过视频序列的时间信息可以有效改善滿散模型的训练效果，优化分析显示该正则化方法能够降低梯度方差，从而促进更快的收敛

Abstract: Image diffusion models are trained on independently sampled static images.
While this is the bedrock task protocol in generative modeling, capturing the
temporal world through the lens of static snapshots is information-deficient by
design. This limitation leads to slower convergence, limited distributional
coverage, and reduced generalization. In this work, we propose a simple and
effective training strategy that leverages the temporal inductive bias present
in continuous video frames to improve diffusion training. Notably, the proposed
method requires no architectural modification and can be seamlessly integrated
into standard diffusion training pipelines. We evaluate our method on the
HandCo dataset, where hand-object interactions exhibit dense temporal coherence
and subtle variations in finger articulation often result in semantically
distinct motions. Empirically, our method accelerates convergence by over
2$\text{x}$ faster and achieves lower FID on both training and validation
distributions. It also improves generative diversity by encouraging the model
to capture meaningful temporal variations. We further provide an optimization
analysis showing that our regularization reduces the gradient variance, which
contributes to faster convergence.

TL;DR: MedVista3D是一个用于3D CT分析的多尺度语义增强视觉语言预训练框架，通过局部和全局图像文本对齐解决放射诊断中的漏读、注意力盲点和沟通失败问题，在多个任务上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 放射诊断错误（漏读错误、注意力盲点和沟通失败）在临床实践中仍然普遍存在，特别是在3D成像中，医生需要检查数百个切片。现有3D视觉语言模型无法同时满足精确局部检测、全局体积级推理和语义一致的自然语言报告需求。

Method: MedVista3D采用多尺度语义增强视觉语言预训练框架，通过局部和全局图像文本对齐进行细粒度表示学习，使用语言模型重写和放射学语义匹配库来解决报告变异性问题。

Result: MedVista3D在零样本疾病分类、报告检索和医学视觉问答方面达到最先进性能，同时在器官分割和预后预测任务上表现出良好的迁移能力。

Conclusion: MedVista3D通过联合局部-全局理解和语义感知对齐，有效解决了3D放射诊断中的关键挑战，为临床实践提供了强大的辅助诊断工具。

Abstract: Radiologic diagnostic errors-under-reading errors, inattentional blindness,
and communication failures-remain prevalent in clinical practice. These issues
often stem from missed localized abnormalities, limited global context, and
variability in report language. These challenges are amplified in 3D imaging,
where clinicians must examine hundreds of slices per scan. Addressing them
requires systems with precise localized detection, global volume-level
reasoning, and semantically consistent natural language reporting. However,
existing 3D vision-language models are unable to meet all three needs jointly,
lacking local-global understanding for spatial reasoning and struggling with
the variability and noise of uncurated radiology reports. We present
MedVista3D, a multi-scale semantic-enriched vision-language pretraining
framework for 3D CT analysis. To enable joint disease detection and holistic
interpretation, MedVista3D performs local and global image-text alignment for
fine-grained representation learning within full-volume context. To address
report variability, we apply language model rewrites and introduce a Radiology
Semantic Matching Bank for semantics-aware alignment. MedVista3D achieves
state-of-the-art performance on zero-shot disease classification, report
retrieval, and medical visual question answering, while transferring well to
organ segmentation and prognosis prediction. Code and datasets will be
released.

*Mengyu Gao,Qiulei Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CaPL是一种因果引导的文本提示学习方法，通过视觉粒度化技术处理细粒度数据集，显著提升了CLIP模型在细粒度识别任务上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的CLIP提示学习方法在处理细粒度数据集时能力有限，无法捕捉不同细粒度类别间的细微差异。

Method: 提出两个模块：1）属性解耦模块使用布朗桥扩散模型将视觉特征分解为共享属性和特定属性；2）粒度学习模块通过因果推理策略整合属性构建视觉粒度。

Result: 在15个数据集上的实验表明，CaPL方法显著优于最先进的提示学习方法，特别是在细粒度数据集上表现突出。

Conclusion: 通过视觉粒度化和因果推理，CaPL能够学习更具区分性的文本提示，有效提升CLIP在细粒度识别任务中的性能。

Abstract: Prompt learning has recently attracted much attention for adapting
pre-trained vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) to downstream recognition
tasks. However, most of the existing CLIP-based prompt learning methods only
show a limited ability for handling fine-grained datasets. To address this
issue, we propose a causality-guided text prompt learning method via visual
granulation for CLIP, called CaPL, where the explored visual granulation
technique could construct sets of visual granules for the text prompt to
capture subtle discrepancies among different fine-grained classes through
casual inference. The CaPL method contains the following two modules: (1) An
attribute disentanglement module is proposed to decompose visual features into
non-individualized attributes (shared by some classes) and individualized
attributes (specific to single classes) using a Brownian Bridge Diffusion
Model; (2) A granule learning module is proposed to construct visual granules
by integrating the aforementioned attributes for recognition under two causal
inference strategies. Thanks to the learned visual granules, more
discriminative text prompt is expected to be learned. Extensive experimental
results on 15 datasets demonstrate that our CaPL method significantly
outperforms the state-of-the-art prompt learning methods, especially on
fine-grained datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于事件相机的事件幸运洞察(Event-Lucky Insight)和EGTM框架，通过事件流的高时间分辨率特性来解决传统湍流消除方法计算效率低的问题，在模型大小、推理延迟和复杂度方面分别提升710倍、214倍和224倍，同时达到最先进的恢复质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于深度学习的湍流消除方法需要从多帧图像中提取湍流线索进行"幸运融合"，但受限于帧率需要高容量网络，计算和存储效率低下。事件相机具有微秒级时间分辨率，能够从根本上解决这一瓶颈。

Method: 提出了"事件幸运洞察"理论，揭示了湍流失真与事件流逆时空分布的相关性；构建了EGTM框架，从显式但嘈杂的湍流事件中提取像素级可靠的湍流自由引导进行时间幸运融合；建立了首个真实世界事件驱动的湍流数据集。

Result: 在真实世界EGTM数据集上，方法在恢复质量方面达到最先进水平(PSNR提升0.94，SSIM提升0.08)，同时模型大小减少710倍，推理延迟降低214倍，模型复杂度降低224倍。

Conclusion: 将事件模态引入湍流消除任务具有显著的效率优势，事件相机的高时间分辨率特性能够有效解决传统方法的计算效率瓶颈问题。

Abstract: Turbulence mitigation (TM) aims to remove the stochastic distortions and
blurs introduced by atmospheric turbulence into frame cameras. Existing
state-of-the-art deep-learning TM methods extract turbulence cues from multiple
degraded frames to find the so-called "lucky'', not distorted patch, for "lucky
fusion''. However, it requires high-capacity network to learn from
coarse-grained turbulence dynamics between synchronous frames with limited
frame-rate, thus fall short in computational and storage efficiency. Event
cameras, with microsecond-level temporal resolution, have the potential to
fundamentally address this bottleneck with efficient sparse and asynchronous
imaging mechanism. In light of this, we (i) present the fundamental
\textbf{``event-lucky insight''} to reveal the correlation between turbulence
distortions and inverse spatiotemporal distribution of event streams. Then,
build upon this insight, we (ii) propose a novel EGTM framework that extracts
pixel-level reliable turbulence-free guidance from the explicit but noisy
turbulent events for temporal lucky fusion. Moreover, we (iii) build the first
turbulence data acquisition system to contribute the first real-world
event-driven TM dataset. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our
approach significantly surpass the existing SOTA TM method by 710 times, 214
times and 224 times in model size, inference latency and model complexity
respectively, while achieving the state-of-the-art in restoration quality
(+0.94 PSNR and +0.08 SSIM) on our real-world EGTM dataset. This demonstrating
the great efficiency merit of introducing event modality into TM task. Demo
code and data have been uploaded in supplementary material and will be released
once accepted.

*Nan Yang,Yang Wang,Zhanwen Liu,Yuchao Dai,Yang Liu,Xiangmo Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FocusMamba提出了一种自适应多模态特征稀疏化方法，通过事件引导的多模态稀疏化策略和跨模态聚焦融合模块，在RGB-事件检测任务中实现了精度和效率的更好平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RGB-事件检测方法在处理两种模态的低信息区域（图像背景和事件数据中的非事件区域）时采用统一处理方式，导致计算成本高且性能不佳。固定token选择方法无法适应不同复杂度的样本。

Method: 提出Event-Guided Multimodal Sparsification (EGMS)策略，利用事件相机感知的场景变化来识别和自适应丢弃各模态中的低信息区域；设计Cross-Modality Focus Fusion (CMFF)模块来有效捕获和整合两种模态的互补特征。

Result: 在DSEC-Det和PKU-DAVIS-SOD数据集上的实验表明，该方法在准确性和效率方面均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FocusMamba通过自适应协作稀疏化和高效互补信息整合，成功解决了RGB-事件检测中的计算冗余问题，实现了更好的性能平衡。

Abstract: Existing RGB-Event detection methods process the low-information regions of
both modalities (background in images and non-event regions in event data)
uniformly during feature extraction and fusion, resulting in high computational
costs and suboptimal performance. To mitigate the computational redundancy
during feature extraction, researchers have respectively proposed token
sparsification methods for the image and event modalities. However, these
methods employ a fixed number or threshold for token selection, hindering the
retention of informative tokens for samples with varying complexity. To achieve
a better balance between accuracy and efficiency, we propose FocusMamba, which
performs adaptive collaborative sparsification of multimodal features and
efficiently integrates complementary information. Specifically, an Event-Guided
Multimodal Sparsification (EGMS) strategy is designed to identify and
adaptively discard low-information regions within each modality by leveraging
scene content changes perceived by the event camera. Based on the
sparsification results, a Cross-Modality Focus Fusion (CMFF) module is proposed
to effectively capture and integrate complementary features from both
modalities. Experiments on the DSEC-Det and PKU-DAVIS-SOD datasets demonstrate
that the proposed method achieves superior performance in both accuracy and
efficiency compared to existing methods. The code will be available at

Motivation: 现有食物识别方法难以处理未见过的食物类别，需要零样本学习能力。组合零样本学习中的属性和对象与菜系和食材自然对应，适合食物识别任务

Method: SalientFusion方法包含两个组件：SalientFormer去除背景冗余并利用深度特征解决角色混淆；DebiasAT通过对齐提示词与视觉特征减少语义偏差

Result: 在提出的CZSFood-90和CZSFood-164基准数据集上取得最优结果，同时在通用CZSL数据集上也表现最佳

Conclusion: SalientFusion方法有效解决了CZSFR中的三大挑战，为零样本食物识别提供了有效的解决方案，代码已开源

Abstract: Food recognition has gained significant attention, but the rapid emergence of
new dishes requires methods for recognizing unseen food categories, motivating
Zero-Shot Food Learning (ZSFL). We propose the task of Compositional Zero-Shot
Food Recognition (CZSFR), where cuisines and ingredients naturally align with
attributes and objects in Compositional Zero-Shot learning (CZSL). However,
CZSFR faces three challenges: (1) Redundant background information distracts
models from learning meaningful food features, (2) Role confusion between
staple and side dishes leads to misclassification, and (3) Semantic bias in a
single attribute can lead to confusion of understanding. Therefore, we propose
SalientFusion, a context-aware CZSFR method with two components: SalientFormer,
which removes background redundancy and uses depth features to resolve role
confusion; DebiasAT, which reduces the semantic bias by aligning prompts with
visual features. Using our proposed benchmarks, CZSFood-90 and CZSFood-164, we
show that SalientFusion achieves state-of-the-art results on these benchmarks
and the most popular general datasets for the general CZSL. The code is
avaliable at https://github.com/Jiajun-RUC/SalientFusion.

Abstract: Human motion video generation has garnered significant research interest due
to its broad applications, enabling innovations such as photorealistic singing
heads or dynamic avatars that seamlessly dance to music. However, existing
surveys in this field focus on individual methods, lacking a comprehensive
overview of the entire generative process. This paper addresses this gap by
providing an in-depth survey of human motion video generation, encompassing
over ten sub-tasks, and detailing the five key phases of the generation
process: input, motion planning, motion video generation, refinement, and
output. Notably, this is the first survey that discusses the potential of large
language models in enhancing human motion video generation. Our survey reviews
the latest developments and technological trends in human motion video
generation across three primary modalities: vision, text, and audio. By
covering over two hundred papers, we offer a thorough overview of the field and
highlight milestone works that have driven significant technological
breakthroughs. Our goal for this survey is to unveil the prospects of human
motion video generation and serve as a valuable resource for advancing the
comprehensive applications of digital humans. A complete list of the models

TL;DR: OccTENS是一个生成式占用世界模型，通过时间下一尺度预测(TENS)任务重新定义占用世界建模，解决了传统自回归方法在效率、长期生成质量下降和可控性方面的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自回归方法在占用世界建模中存在效率低下、长期生成时出现时间退化以及缺乏可控性等问题，需要一种新的方法来同时解决这些挑战。

Method: 提出时间下一尺度预测(TENS)任务，将时间序列建模问题分解为空间尺度生成和时间场景预测；使用TensFormer模型灵活管理时间因果性和空间关系；采用整体姿态聚合策略统一建模占用和自运动。

Result: 实验表明OccTENS在占用质量和推理时间方面均优于最先进方法，实现了高质量的长时期占用生成和高效计算。

Conclusion: OccTENS通过创新的TENS框架和TensFormer架构，成功解决了占用世界建模中的关键挑战，为可控、高保真的3D场景生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose OccTENS, a generative occupancy world model that
enables controllable, high-fidelity long-term occupancy generation while
maintaining computational efficiency. Different from visual generation, the
occupancy world model must capture the fine-grained 3D geometry and dynamic
evolution of the 3D scenes, posing great challenges for the generative models.
Recent approaches based on autoregression (AR) have demonstrated the potential
to predict vehicle movement and future occupancy scenes simultaneously from
historical observations, but they typically suffer from \textbf{inefficiency},
\textbf{temporal degradation} in long-term generation and \textbf{lack of
controllability}. To holistically address these issues, we reformulate the
occupancy world model as a temporal next-scale prediction (TENS) task, which
decomposes the temporal sequence modeling problem into the modeling of spatial
scale-by-scale generation and temporal scene-by-scene prediction. With a
\textbf{TensFormer}, OccTENS can effectively manage the temporal causality and
spatial relationships of occupancy sequences in a flexible and scalable way. To
enhance the pose controllability, we further propose a holistic pose
aggregation strategy, which features a unified sequence modeling for occupancy
and ego-motion. Experiments show that OccTENS outperforms the state-of-the-art
method with both higher occupancy quality and faster inference time.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种弱监督学习方法，利用视觉语言模型为多视角图像伪标注功能部件，结合密集对比学习来建立密集功能对应关系，在跨类别物体匹配任务中表现优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在不同类别物体间建立密集对应关系时，物体功能（即物体对其他物体产生的影响）可以指导对应关系的建立，因为实现特定功能的物体部件通常在形状和外观上具有相似性。

Method: 利用视觉语言模型为多视角图像伪标注功能部件，然后与基于像素对应的密集对比学习相结合，将功能和空间知识蒸馏到新模型中，从而建立密集功能对应关系。

Result: 该方法在合成和真实评估数据集上均表现出色，优于由现成的自监督图像表示和基于视觉语言模型的基线解决方案。

Conclusion: 通过结合视觉语言模型的伪标注能力和密集对比学习，可以有效地学习跨类别物体的功能对应关系，为形状重建和机器人操作等任务提供重要支持。

Abstract: Establishing dense correspondences across image pairs is essential for tasks
such as shape reconstruction and robot manipulation. In the challenging setting
of matching across different categories, the function of an object, i.e., the
effect that an object can cause on other objects, can guide how correspondences
should be established. This is because object parts that enable specific
functions often share similarities in shape and appearance. We derive the
definition of dense functional correspondence based on this observation and
propose a weakly-supervised learning paradigm to tackle the prediction task.
The main insight behind our approach is that we can leverage vision-language
models to pseudo-label multi-view images to obtain functional parts. We then
integrate this with dense contrastive learning from pixel correspondences to
distill both functional and spatial knowledge into a new model that can
establish dense functional correspondence. Further, we curate synthetic and
real evaluation datasets as task benchmarks. Our results demonstrate the
advantages of our approach over baseline solutions consisting of off-the-shelf
self-supervised image representations and grounded vision language models.

Motivation: 对比视觉语言模型在零样本图像识别中表现出色，但在少样本场景下面临计算密集型离线微调的挑战，容易过拟合

Method: 提出双注意力机制：Memory Attn-Adapter利用支持样本细化类别嵌入，Local-Global Attn-Adapter通过整合局部和全局特征丰富图像嵌入

Result: 在跨类别和跨数据集泛化方面优于最先进方法，保持高效推理并在不同CLIP骨干网络上具有良好的扩展性

Conclusion: Attn-Adapter提供了一种有效的在线少样本学习解决方案，克服了传统提示学习的局限性，实现了更好的适应性和泛化能力

Abstract: Contrastive vision-language models excel in zero-shot image recognition but
face challenges in few-shot scenarios due to computationally intensive offline
fine-tuning using prompt learning, which risks overfitting. To overcome these
limitations, we propose Attn-Adapter, a novel online few-shot learning
framework that enhances CLIP's adaptability via a dual attention mechanism. Our
design incorporates dataset-specific information through two components: the
Memory Attn-Adapter, which refines category embeddings using support examples,
and the Local-Global Attn-Adapter, which enriches image embeddings by
integrating local and global features. This architecture enables dynamic
adaptation from a few labeled samples without retraining the base model.
Attn-Adapter outperforms state-of-the-art methods in cross-category and
cross-dataset generalization, maintaining efficient inference and scaling
across CLIP backbones.

TL;DR: SPECS是一个针对长图像描述任务设计的无参考评估指标，通过改进CLIP模型来强调特异性，在保持与人类判断高度相关的同时大幅提升计算效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估指标存在诸多问题：n-gram指标无法捕捉语义正确性，表示相似性指标计算成本高且与人类判断相关性低，LLM指标虽然相关性强但成本过高不适合迭代开发

Method: 基于CLIP模型进行改进，引入新的目标函数来强调特异性，奖励正确细节并惩罚错误信息，专门针对长图像描述任务优化

Result: SPECS在相关性方面与开源LLM指标相当，但计算效率显著更高，适合在模型开发过程中进行迭代评估

Conclusion: SPECS提供了一个实用高效的替代方案，能够在图像描述模型开发过程中进行快速迭代评估，平衡了评估质量与计算效率

Abstract: As interest grows in generating long, detailed image captions, standard
evaluation metrics become increasingly unreliable. N-gram-based metrics though
efficient, fail to capture semantic correctness. Representational Similarity
(RS) metrics, designed to address this, initially saw limited use due to high
computational costs, while today, despite advances in hardware, they remain
unpopular due to low correlation to human judgments. Meanwhile, metrics based
on large language models (LLMs) show strong correlation with human judgments,
but remain too expensive for iterative use during model development.
  We introduce SPECS (Specificity-Enhanced CLIPScore), a reference-free RS
metric tailored to long image captioning. SPECS modifies CLIP with a new
objective that emphasizes specificity: rewarding correct details and penalizing
incorrect ones. We show that SPECS matches the performance of open-source
LLM-based metrics in correlation to human judgments, while being far more
efficient. This makes it a practical alternative for iterative checkpoint
evaluation during image captioning model development.Our code can be found at

Abstract: The scarcity of well-annotated diverse medical images is a major hurdle for
developing reliable AI models in healthcare. Substantial technical advances
have been made in generative foundation models for natural images. Here we
develop `ChexGen', a generative vision-language foundation model that
introduces a unified framework for text-, mask-, and bounding box-guided
synthesis of chest radiographs. Built upon the latent diffusion transformer
architecture, ChexGen was pretrained on the largest curated chest X-ray dataset
to date, consisting of 960,000 radiograph-report pairs. ChexGen achieves
accurate synthesis of radiographs through expert evaluations and quantitative
metrics. We demonstrate the utility of ChexGen for training data augmentation
and supervised pretraining, which led to performance improvements across
disease classification, detection, and segmentation tasks using a small
fraction of training data. Further, our model enables the creation of diverse
patient cohorts that enhance model fairness by detecting and mitigating
demographic biases. Our study supports the transformative role of generative
foundation models in building more accurate, data-efficient, and equitable
medical AI systems.

Method: 提出特征级视角间运动向量预测方法，利用解码的独立视角运动特征来条件化依赖视角运动编码；提出无视差的视角间上下文预测模块，从解码的独立视角内容特征预测视角间上下文；结合视角间运动熵模型和上下文熵模型来学习视角间先验。

Abstract: Multiview video is a key data source for volumetric video, enabling immersive
3D scene reconstruction but posing significant challenges in storage and
transmission due to its massive data volume. Recently, deep learning-based
end-to-end video coding has achieved great success, yet most focus on
single-view or stereo videos, leaving general multiview scenarios
underexplored. This paper proposes an end-to-end learned multiview video coding
(LMVC) framework that ensures random access and backward compatibility while
enhancing compression efficiency. Our key innovation lies in effectively
leveraging independent-view motion and content information to enhance
dependent-view compression. Specifically, to exploit the inter-view motion
correlation, we propose a feature-based inter-view motion vector prediction
method that conditions dependent-view motion encoding on decoded
independent-view motion features, along with an inter-view motion entropy model
that learns inter-view motion priors. To exploit the inter-view content
correlation, we propose a disparity-free inter-view context prediction module
that predicts inter-view contexts from decoded independent-view content
features, combined with an inter-view contextual entropy model that captures
inter-view context priors. Experimental results show that our proposed LMVC
framework outperforms the reference software of the traditional MV-HEVC
standard by a large margin, establishing a strong baseline for future research
in this field.

TL;DR: TopoSculpt是一个用于3D细粒度管状结构拓扑优化的框架，通过整体区域建模、拓扑完整性约束和课程细化方案，显著改善了医学管状解剖结构的几何和拓扑重建精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖体素重叠度量，无法捕捉拓扑正确性和完整性。虽然拓扑感知损失和持久同调约束有潜力，但通常只能局部应用，无法保证全局保持或推理时的几何错误修正。

Method: 采用整体区域建模策略捕捉完整空间上下文；首次引入拓扑完整性Betti约束，联合执行Betti数先验和全局完整性；使用持久同调的课程细化方案从粗到细逐步纠正错误。

Result: 在肺气道和Willis环数据集上，β₀错误分别从69.00降至3.40和从1.65降至0.30，树长检测和分支检测率提高近10%。

Conclusion: TopoSculpt能有效纠正关键拓扑错误，推进复杂3D管状解剖结构的高保真建模。

Abstract: Medical tubular anatomical structures are inherently three-dimensional
conduits with lumens, enclosing walls, and complex branching topologies.
Accurate reconstruction of their geometry and topology is crucial for
applications such as bronchoscopic navigation and cerebral arterial
connectivity assessment. Existing methods often rely on voxel-wise overlap
measures, which fail to capture topological correctness and completeness.
Although topology-aware losses and persistent homology constraints have shown
promise, they are usually applied patch-wise and cannot guarantee global
preservation or correct geometric errors at inference. To address these
limitations, we propose a novel TopoSculpt, a framework for topological
refinement of 3D fine-grained tubular structures. TopoSculpt (i) adopts a
holistic whole-region modeling strategy to capture full spatial context, (ii)
first introduces a Topological Integrity Betti (TIB) constraint that jointly
enforces Betti number priors and global integrity, and (iii) employs a
curriculum refinement scheme with persistent homology to progressively correct
errors from coarse to fine scales. Extensive experiments on challenging
pulmonary airway and Circle of Willis datasets demonstrate substantial
improvements in both geometry and topology. For instance, $\beta_{0}$ errors

Abstract: Pneumothorax, the abnormal accumulation of air in the pleural space, can be
life-threatening if undetected. Chest X-rays are the first-line diagnostic
tool, but small cases may be subtle. We propose an automated deep-learning

regions. Trained on the SIIM-ACR dataset with data augmentation and a combined
binary cross-entropy plus Dice loss, the model achieved an IoU of 0.7008 and
Dice score of 0.8241 on the independent PTX-498 dataset. These results
demonstrate that the model can accurately localize pneumothoraces and support

*Zhu Wenjie,Zhang Yabin,Xin Jin,Wenjun Zeng,Lei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过多模态大语言模型构建适配性负面文本空间，提升距离和近距离OOD检测性能，减少假阻性标签影响


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法缺乏对OOD图像的理解，难以构建准确的负面空间，且假阻性标签会严重影响近距离OOD检测性能

Method: 利用MLLM的理解和推理能力：1）识别OOD图像生成表达性负面句子提升远距离OOD检测；2）识别与负面图像视觉相似的ID子集，生成视觉相似负面标签改善近距离OOD检测；3）设计适配性权重分数平衡两类负面空间

Result: 在ImageNet基准上显著降低FPR95指4.2%，创造了新的最高水平，方法无需训练且零样本，具有高扩展性

Conclusion: ANTS方法通过MLLM的理解和推理能力构建了准确的负面文本空间，有效解决了距离和近距离OOD检测的挑战，为开放环境下的OOD检测提供了高度适配性的解决方案

Abstract: The introduction of negative labels (NLs) has proven effective in enhancing
Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection. However, existing methods often lack an
understanding of OOD images, making it difficult to construct an accurate
negative space. In addition, the presence of false negative labels
significantly degrades their near-OOD performance. To address these issues, we
propose shaping an Adaptive Negative Textual Space (ANTS) by leveraging the
understanding and reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models
(MLLMs). Specifically, we identify images likely to be OOD samples as negative
images and prompt the MLLM to describe these images, generating expressive
negative sentences that precisely characterize the OOD distribution and enhance
far-OOD detection. For the near-OOD setting, where OOD samples resemble the
in-distribution (ID) subset, we first identify the subset of ID classes that
are visually similar to negative images and then leverage the reasoning
capability of MLLMs to generate visually similar negative labels tailored to
this subset, effectively reducing false negatives and improving near-OOD
detection. To balance these two types of negative textual spaces, we design an
adaptive weighted score that enables the method to handle different OOD task
settings (near-OOD and far-OOD) without relying on task-specific prior
knowledge, making it highly adaptable in open environments. On the ImageNet
benchmark, our ANTS significantly reduces the FPR95 by 4.2\%, establishing a
new state-of-the-art. Furthermore, our method is training-free and zero-shot,
enabling high scalability.

TL;DR: MMChange是一个多模态遥感变化检测方法，结合图像和文本模态，通过图像特征细化、文本差异增强和跨模态融合模块，显著提升了变化检测的准确性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习方法仅依赖图像模态，在特征表示、变化模式建模和泛化能力方面存在局限，特别是在光照和噪声干扰下表现不佳。需要多模态融合来增强性能。

Method: 提出MMChange框架：1）图像特征细化模块突出关键区域并抑制环境噪声；2）使用视觉语言模型生成双时相图像的语义描述；3）文本差异增强模块捕捉细粒度语义变化；4）图像-文本特征融合模块实现深度跨模态集成。

Result: 在LEVIRCD、WHUCD和SYSUCD三个数据集上的大量实验表明，MMChange在多个指标上一致超越了最先进的方法，验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 多模态融合方法能够显著提升遥感变化检测的性能，图像和文本模态的互补性为复杂环境下的变化检测提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Although deep learning has advanced remote sensing change detection (RSCD),
most methods rely solely on image modality, limiting feature representation,
change pattern modeling, and generalization especially under illumination and
noise disturbances. To address this, we propose MMChange, a multimodal RSCD
method that combines image and text modalities to enhance accuracy and
robustness. An Image Feature Refinement (IFR) module is introduced to highlight
key regions and suppress environmental noise. To overcome the semantic
limitations of image features, we employ a vision language model (VLM) to
generate semantic descriptions of bitemporal images. A Textual Difference
Enhancement (TDE) module then captures fine grained semantic shifts, guiding
the model toward meaningful changes. To bridge the heterogeneity between
modalities, we design an Image Text Feature Fusion (ITFF) module that enables
deep cross modal integration. Extensive experiments on LEVIRCD, WHUCD, and
SYSUCD demonstrate that MMChange consistently surpasses state of the art
methods across multiple metrics, validating its effectiveness for multimodal
RSCD. Code is available at: https://github.com/yikuizhai/MMChange.

TL;DR: SAC-MIL是一种用于WSI分类的空间感知相关多实例学习方法，通过位置编码模块和SAC块实现全实例相关性分析，在多个数据集上达到最先进性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决WSI分类中空间信息利用不足和传统Transformer方法计算复杂度高、部署困难的问题

Method: 使用位置编码模块编码实例坐标空间关系，SAC块基于MLP实现线性时间复杂度的全实例相关性计算

Result: 在CAMELYON-16、TCGA-LUNG和TCGA-BRAC数据集上取得了最先进的性能

Conclusion: SAC-MIL通过简单高效的MLP结构实现了优秀的WSI分类性能，解决了长度外推问题且易于部署

Abstract: We propose Spatial-Aware Correlated Multiple Instance Learning (SAC-MIL) for
performing WSI classification. SAC-MIL consists of a positional encoding module
to encode position information and a SAC block to perform full instance
correlations. The positional encoding module utilizes the instance coordinates
within the slide to encode the spatial relationships instead of the instance
index in the input WSI sequence. The positional encoding module can also handle
the length extrapolation issue where the training and testing sequences have
different lengths. The SAC block is an MLP-based method that performs full
instance correlation in linear time complexity with respect to the sequence
length. Due to the simple structure of MLP, it is easy to deploy since it does
not require custom CUDA kernels, compared to Transformer-based methods for WSI
classification. SAC-MIL has achieved state-of-the-art performance on the
CAMELYON-16, TCGA-LUNG, and TCGA-BRAC datasets. The code will be released upon
acceptance.

Motivation: 解决无对比剂MRI数据中肝脉管分割的挑战，因为对比增强成像序列并非总能获取，而无对比剂成像更常见但分割困难需要大量标注数据。

Method: 提出多任务学习框架，在训练期利用成对的无对比剂和对比增强MRI数据（有无脉管标注均可），通过共享任务结构改善特征表示。

Result: 辅助数据显著提高了脉管分割准确性，尤其在标注数据少时效果更明显。该方法在脑结节分割任务中也验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 即使只在训练期可用，信息丰富的辅助成像模态也能增强专家标注的效果，为医学形象分析提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Liver vessel segmentation in magnetic resonance imaging data is important for
the computational analysis of vascular remodelling, associated with a wide
spectrum of diffuse liver diseases. Existing approaches rely on contrast
enhanced imaging data, but the necessary dedicated imaging sequences are not
uniformly acquired. Images without contrast enhancement are acquired more
frequently, but vessel segmentation is challenging, and requires large-scale
annotated data. We propose a multi-task learning framework to segment vessels
in liver MRI without contrast. It exploits auxiliary contrast enhanced MRI data
available only during training to reduce the need for annotated training
examples. Our approach draws on paired native and contrast enhanced data with
and without vessel annotations for model training. Results show that auxiliary
data improves the accuracy of vessel segmentation, even if they are not
available during inference. The advantage is most pronounced if only few
annotations are available for training, since the feature representation
benefits from the shared task structure. A validation of this approach to
augment a model for brain tumor segmentation confirms its benefits across
different domains. An auxiliary informative imaging modality can augment expert
annotations even if it is only available during training.

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型多模态模型在多项选择题回答中的提示词敏感性，发现微小提示词变化可导致15%的准确率差异，提出了Promptception框架系统评估提示词敏感性，并为不同模型类型提出了针对性提示原则。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型多模态模型在多项选择题回答中的提示词设计缺乏系统理解，模型评估存在不公平性，因为最佳性能往往通过精心选择的提示词获得，需要建立系统化的提示词敏感性评估框架。

Method: 提出Promptception框架，包含61种提示类型，涵盖15个类别和6个超类别，用于评估10个不同规模的大型多模态模型在3个多项选择题基准测试上的表现。

Result: 研究发现专有模型对提示词语义更敏感，开源模型表现更稳定但在复杂提示词上表现较差，提示词变化可导致高达15%的准确率差异。

Conclusion: 需要针对不同类型的模型制定专门的提示原则，以实现更稳健和公平的模型评估，专有模型和开源模型在提示词敏感性方面表现出明显差异。

Abstract: Despite the success of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) in recent years, prompt
design for LMMs in Multiple-Choice Question Answering (MCQA) remains poorly
understood. We show that even minor variations in prompt phrasing and structure
can lead to accuracy deviations of up to 15% for certain prompts and models.
This variability poses a challenge for transparent and fair LMM evaluation, as
models often report their best-case performance using carefully selected
prompts. To address this, we introduce Promptception, a systematic framework
for evaluating prompt sensitivity in LMMs. It consists of 61 prompt types,
spanning 15 categories and 6 supercategories, each targeting specific aspects
of prompt formulation, and is used to evaluate 10 LMMs ranging from lightweight
open-source models to GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro, across 3 MCQA benchmarks:
MMStar, MMMU-Pro, MVBench. Our findings reveal that proprietary models exhibit
greater sensitivity to prompt phrasing, reflecting tighter alignment with
instruction semantics, while open-source models are steadier but struggle with
nuanced and complex phrasing. Based on this analysis, we propose Prompting
Principles tailored to proprietary and open-source LMMs, enabling more robust
and fair model evaluation.

Motivation: 现有3D语义占位预测方法忽视高度轴信息，传统通道注意力机制在所有高度层赋予均匀权重，限制了不同高度特征的强调能力

Method: 提出SliceSemOcc框架：1）使用全局和局部垂直切片提取立方体素特征 2）全局局部融合模块协调细粒度空间细节和整体上下文 3）SEAttention3D模块通过平均池化保持高度分辨率，为每个高度层赋予动态通道注意力权重

Result: 在nuScenes-SurroundOcc和nuScenes-OpenOccupancy数据集上验证，方法显著提高了平均IoU，尤其在大部分小物体类别上获得明显收益，详细的消融研究进一步验证了框架的有效性

Conclusion: SliceSemOcc框架通过垂直切片方式有效利用高度轴信息，提出的SEAttention3D注意力机制能够动态地强调不同高度层的特征，为3D语义占位预测领域提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Driven by autonomous driving's demands for precise 3D perception, 3D semantic
occupancy prediction has become a pivotal research topic. Unlike
bird's-eye-view (BEV) methods, which restrict scene representation to a 2D
plane, occupancy prediction leverages a complete 3D voxel grid to model spatial
structures in all dimensions, thereby capturing semantic variations along the
vertical axis. However, most existing approaches overlook height-axis
information when processing voxel features. And conventional SENet-style
channel attention assigns uniform weight across all height layers, limiting
their ability to emphasize features at different heights. To address these
limitations, we propose SliceSemOcc, a novel vertical slice based multimodal
framework for 3D semantic occupancy representation. Specifically, we extract
voxel features along the height-axis using both global and local vertical
slices. Then, a global local fusion module adaptively reconciles fine-grained
spatial details with holistic contextual information. Furthermore, we propose
the SEAttention3D module, which preserves height-wise resolution through
average pooling and assigns dynamic channel attention weights to each height
layer. Extensive experiments on nuScenes-SurroundOcc and nuScenes-OpenOccupancy
datasets verify that our method significantly enhances mean IoU, achieving
especially pronounced gains on most small-object categories. Detailed ablation
studies further validate the effectiveness of the proposed SliceSemOcc
framework.

Conclusion: 论文通过实验证明了假相关联检测方法的有效性，强调了在未来研究中需要谨慎使用包含假信号的图片，并通过侵入性乳腱累块分类的实际案例验证了研究结果。

Abstract: Due to their powerful feature association capabilities, neural network-based
computer vision models have the ability to detect and exploit unintended
patterns within the data, potentially leading to correct predictions based on
incorrect or unintended but statistically relevant signals. These clues may
vary from simple color aberrations to small texts within the image. In
situations where these unintended signals align with the predictive task,
models can mistakenly link these features with the task and rely on them for
making predictions. This phenomenon is referred to as spurious correlations,
where patterns appear to be associated with the task but are actually
coincidental. As a result, detection and mitigation of spurious correlations
have become crucial tasks for building trustworthy, reliable, and generalizable
machine learning models. In this work, we present a novel method to detect
spurious correlations in vision transformers, a type of neural network
architecture that gained significant popularity in recent years. Using both
supervised and self-supervised trained models, we present large-scale
experiments on the ImageNet dataset demonstrating the ability of the proposed
method to identify spurious correlations. We also find that, even if the same
architecture is used, the training methodology has a significant impact on the
model's reliance on spurious correlations. Furthermore, we show that certain
classes in the ImageNet dataset contain spurious signals that are easily
detected by the models and discuss the underlying reasons for those spurious
signals. In light of our findings, we provide an exhaustive list of the
aforementioned images and call for caution in their use in future research
efforts. Lastly, we present a case study investigating spurious signals in
invasive breast mass classification, grounding our work in real-world
scenarios.

Conclusion: LML是一个有价值的新问题，提出的方法能够有效地从多数标签中学习实例级分类。

Abstract: The paper proposes a novel multi-class Multiple-Instance Learning (MIL)
problem called Learning from Majority Label (LML). In LML, the majority class
of instances in a bag is assigned as the bag-level label. The goal of LML is to
train a classification model that estimates the class of each instance using
the majority label. This problem is valuable in a variety of applications,
including pathology image segmentation, political voting prediction, customer
sentiment analysis, and environmental monitoring. To solve LML, we propose a
Counting Network trained to produce bag-level majority labels, estimated by
counting the number of instances in each class. Furthermore, analysis
experiments on the characteristics of LML revealed that bags with a high
proportion of the majority class facilitate learning. Based on this result, we
developed a Majority Proportion Enhancement Module (MPEM) that increases the
proportion of the majority class by removing minority class instances within
the bags. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method on
four datasets compared to conventional MIL methods. Moreover, ablation studies
confirmed the effectiveness of each module. The code is available at

Abstract: In the frontier research and application of current video surveillance
technology, traditional camera systems exhibit significant limitations of
response delay exceeding 200 ms in dynamic scenarios due to the insufficient
deep feature extraction capability of automatic recognition algorithms and the
efficiency bottleneck of computing architectures, failing to meet the real-time
requirements in complex scenes. To address this issue, this study proposes a
heterogeneous computing architecture based on Phytium processors and Cambricon
accelerator cards, constructing a UAV tracking and gazing system with
millisecond-level response capability. At the hardware level, the system adopts
a collaborative computing architecture of Phytium FT-2000/4 processors and
MLU220 accelerator cards, enhancing computing power through multi-card
parallelism. At the software level, it innovatively integrates a lightweight
YOLOv5s detection network with a DeepSORT cascaded tracking algorithm, forming
a closed-loop control chain of "detection-tracking-feedback". Experimental
results demonstrate that the system achieves a stable single-frame
comprehensive processing delay of 50-100 ms in 1920*1080 resolution video
stream processing, with a multi-scale target recognition accuracy of over

Conclusion: 该方法无需模型微调或额外标注，适用于大规模数据集，通过多视角特征聚合有效解决了人员重识别中的视角偏差问题

Abstract: In person re-identification, re-ranking is a crucial step to enhance the
overall accuracy by refining the initial ranking of retrieved results. Previous
studies have mainly focused on features from single-view images, which can
cause view bias and issues like pose variation, viewpoint changes, and
occlusions. Using multi-view features to present a person can help reduce view
bias. In this work, we present an efficient re-ranking method that generates
multi-view features by aggregating neighbors' features using K-nearest Weighted
Fusion (KWF) method. Specifically, we hypothesize that features extracted from
re-identification models are highly similar when representing the same
identity. Thus, we select K neighboring features in an unsupervised manner to
generate multi-view features. Additionally, this study explores the weight
selection strategies during feature aggregation, allowing us to identify an
effective strategy. Our re-ranking approach does not require model fine-tuning
or extra annotations, making it applicable to large-scale datasets. We evaluate
our method on the person re-identification datasets Market1501, MSMT17, and
Occluded-DukeMTMC. The results show that our method significantly improves
Rank@1 and mAP when re-ranking the top M candidates from the initial ranking
results. Specifically, compared to the initial results, our re-ranking method
achieves improvements of 9.8%/22.0% in Rank@1 on the challenging datasets:
MSMT17 and Occluded-DukeMTMC, respectively. Furthermore, our approach
demonstrates substantial enhancements in computational efficiency compared to
other re-ranking methods.

Conclusion: 通过结合两种研究方向的优势，有效解决了弱监督视频解析中的错误放大问题

Abstract: Audio-Visual Video Parsing (AVVP) task aims to identify event categories and
their occurrence times in a given video with weakly supervised labels. Existing
methods typically fall into two categories: (i) designing enhanced
architectures based on attention mechanism for better temporal modeling, and
(ii) generating richer pseudo-labels to compensate for the absence of
frame-level annotations. However, the first type methods treat noisy
segment-level pseudo labels as reliable supervision and the second type methods
let indiscriminate attention spread them across all frames, the initial errors
are repeatedly amplified during training. To address this issue, we propose a
method that combines the Bi-Directional Text Fusion (BiT) module and
Category-Aware Temporal Graph (CATS) module. Specifically, we integrate the
strengths and complementarity of the two previous research directions. We first
perform semantic injection and dynamic calibration on audio and visual modality
features through the BiT module, to locate and purify cleaner and richer
semantic cues. Then, we leverage the CATS module for semantic propagation and
connection to enable precise semantic information dissemination across time.
Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in multiple key indicators on two benchmark
datasets, LLP and UnAV-100.

Abstract: Efficient perception models are essential for Advanced Driver Assistance
Systems (ADAS), as these applications require rapid processing and response to

real-time execution needs of such perception models, this study introduces the
TriLiteNet model. This model can simultaneously manage multiple tasks related

drivable area segmentation, and an Acc of 82.3% for lane line segmentation with
only 2.35M parameters and a computational cost of 7.72 GFLOPs. Our proposed
model includes a tiny configuration with just 0.14M parameters, which provides
a multi-task solution with minimal computational demand. Evaluated for latency

TL;DR: DVS-PedX是一个用于行人检测和过街意图分析的神经形态数据集，包含合成和真实世界的事件流数据，支持多种天气条件下的研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件相机具有低延迟、高动态范围和运动鲁棒性等优势，但缺乏专门用于行人安全研究的神经形态数据集。DVS-PedX旨在填补这一空白，推动基于事件的行人安全和意图预测研究。

Method: 数据集包含两个来源：(1) CARLA模拟器生成的合成事件流，控制不同天气和光照条件下的"接近-穿越"场景；(2) 真实世界JAAD行车记录仪视频通过v2e工具转换的事件流，保留自然行为和背景。提供RGB帧、事件帧和帧级标签。

Result: 提供了包含合成和真实事件流的多模态数据集，包含原始AEDAT事件文件和AVI视频文件。基线SNN模型展示了数据集可用性，并揭示了模拟到现实的差距。

Conclusion: DVS-PedX数据集将加速基于事件的行人安全、意图预测和神经形态感知研究，为领域适应和多模态融合提供基础。

Abstract: Event cameras like Dynamic Vision Sensors (DVS) report micro-timed brightness
changes instead of full frames, offering low latency, high dynamic range, and
motion robustness. DVS-PedX (Dynamic Vision Sensor Pedestrian eXploration) is a
neuromorphic dataset designed for pedestrian detection and crossing-intention
analysis in normal and adverse weather conditions across two complementary
sources: (1) synthetic event streams generated in the CARLA simulator for
controlled "approach-cross" scenes under varied weather and lighting; and (2)
real-world JAAD dash-cam videos converted to event streams using the v2e tool,
preserving natural behaviors and backgrounds. Each sequence includes paired RGB
frames, per-frame DVS "event frames" (33 ms accumulations), and frame-level
labels (crossing vs. not crossing). We also provide raw AEDAT 2.0/AEDAT 4.0
event files and AVI DVS video files and metadata for flexible re-processing.
Baseline spiking neural networks (SNNs) using SpikingJelly illustrate dataset
usability and reveal a sim-to-real gap, motivating domain adaptation and
multimodal fusion. DVS-PedX aims to accelerate research in event-based
pedestrian safety, intention prediction, and neuromorphic perception.

*Ayan Banerjee,Josep Lladós,Umapada Pal,Anjan Dutta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TaleDiffusion是一个用于生成多角色故事可视化的新框架，通过迭代过程保持角色一致性并准确分配对话，解决了现有方法在角色一致性和对话渲染方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到故事可视化方法在多个角色跨帧交互时存在角色一致性差、生成伪影和对话渲染不准确的问题，导致故事叙述不连贯。

Method: 使用预训练LLM生成每帧描述、角色细节和对话，采用有界注意力掩码技术控制角色交互，应用身份一致自注意力机制确保跨帧角色一致性，以及区域感知交叉注意力进行精确对象放置，最后通过CLIPSeg渲染对话气泡并分配给角色。

Result: 实验结果表明，TaleDiffusion在一致性、降噪和对话渲染方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TaleDiffusion通过创新的注意力机制和后处理技术，有效解决了多角色故事可视化中的一致性和对话分配问题，为连贯的故事叙述提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-story visualization is challenging due to the need for consistent
interaction among multiple characters across frames. Existing methods struggle
with character consistency, leading to artifact generation and inaccurate
dialogue rendering, which results in disjointed storytelling. In response, we
introduce TaleDiffusion, a novel framework for generating multi-character
stories with an iterative process, maintaining character consistency, and
accurate dialogue assignment via postprocessing. Given a story, we use a
pre-trained LLM to generate per-frame descriptions, character details, and
dialogues via in-context learning, followed by a bounded attention-based
per-box mask technique to control character interactions and minimize
artifacts. We then apply an identity-consistent self-attention mechanism to
ensure character consistency across frames and region-aware cross-attention for
precise object placement. Dialogues are also rendered as bubbles and assigned
to characters via CLIPSeg. Experimental results demonstrate that TaleDiffusion
outperforms existing methods in consistency, noise reduction, and dialogue
rendering.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MEPG是一个多专家规划和生成框架，通过位置-风格感知LLM和空间语义专家模块协同工作，解决了扩散模型在复杂多元素提示和风格多样性方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到图像扩散模型在处理复杂多元素提示时表现不佳，且风格多样性有限，需要一种能够精确控制空间布局和风格的专业化解决方案。

Method: 框架包含两个核心组件：1) PSA模块使用监督微调的LLM将输入提示分解为精确空间坐标和风格编码语义指令；2) MED模块通过动态专家路由在局部区域和全局区域实现跨区域生成，使用基于注意力的门控机制选择性地激活专家模型。

Result: 实验表明MEPG在图像质量和风格多样性方面显著优于相同骨干网络的基线模型，同时支持轻量级专家模型集成和替换。

Conclusion: MEPG框架通过多专家协同生成的方式，有效提升了文本到图像生成在复杂场景下的表现，提供了强大的可扩展性和实时交互编辑能力。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have achieved remarkable image quality, but
they still struggle with complex, multiele ment prompts, and limited stylistic
diversity. To address these limitations, we propose a Multi-Expert Planning and
Gen eration Framework (MEPG) that synergistically integrates position- and
style-aware large language models (LLMs) with spatial-semantic expert modules.
The framework comprises two core components: (1) a Position-Style-Aware (PSA)
module that utilizes a supervised fine-tuned LLM to decom pose input prompts
into precise spatial coordinates and style encoded semantic instructions; and
(2) a Multi-Expert Dif fusion (MED) module that implements cross-region genera
tion through dynamic expert routing across both local regions and global areas.
During the generation process for each lo cal region, specialized models (e.g.,
realism experts, styliza tion specialists) are selectively activated for each
spatial par tition via attention-based gating mechanisms. The architec ture
supports lightweight integration and replacement of ex pert models, providing
strong extensibility. Additionally, an interactive interface enables real-time
spatial layout editing and per-region style selection from a portfolio of
experts. Ex periments show that MEPG significantly outperforms base line models
with the same backbone in both image quality
  and style diversity.

Motivation: 现有深度伪造检测器在野外测试集上表现差（61%-69%），远超商业检测器（82%），需要提升开源模型的实际性能

Method: 重新调整Ojha等人提出的基于预训练视视觉背骨网络的方法，通过优化超参数设置来提升模型在Deepfake-Eval-2024野外数据集上的表现

Conclusion: 简单的预训练视觉模型通过谨慎的调参可以在野外深度伪造检测中达到商业级性能，为实际部署提供了可行方案

Abstract: The widespread adoption of synthetic media demands accessible deepfake
detectors and realistic benchmarks. While most existing research evaluates
deepfake detectors on highly controlled datasets, we focus on the recently
released "in-the-wild" benchmark, Deepfake-Eval-2024. Initial reporting on
Deepfake-Eval-2024 showed that three finetuned open-source models achieve
accuracies between 61% and 69%, significantly lagging behind the leading
commercial deepfake detector with 82% accuracy. Our work revisits one of these
baseline approaches, originally introduced by Ojha et al., which adapts
standard pretrained vision backbones to produce generalizable deepfake
detectors. We demonstrate that with better-tuned hyperparameters, this simple
approach actually yields much higher performance -- 81% accuracy on
Deepfake-Eval-2024 -- surpassing the previously reported accuracy of this
baseline approach by 18% and competing with commercial deepfake detectors. We
discuss tradeoffs in accuracy, computational costs, and interpretability,
focusing on how practical these deepfake detectors might be when deployed in
real-world settings. Our code can be found at

Motivation: 无人机搭载先进传感器为风力发电厂监测提供了新机遇，但需要高分辨率数据和高效处理多谱图像的方法来实现可靠的缺陷检测。

Method: 提出了一种集成方法，将通用的YOLOv8模型与专门的热成像模型相结合，使用精细的绑定框融合算法来结合它们的预测结果。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法实现了0.93的平均精度(mAP@.5)和0.90的F1分数，超过了单独使用YOLOv8模型的0.91 mAP@.5。

Conclusion: 结果表明，结合多个YOLO架构和融合多谱数据提供了更可靠的解决方案，改善了可见光和热成像缺陷的检测效果。

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with advanced sensors have opened up
new opportunities for monitoring wind power plants, including blades, towers,
and other critical components. However, reliable defect detection requires
high-resolution data and efficient methods to process multispectral imagery. In
this research, we aim to enhance defect detection accuracy through the
development of an ensemble of YOLO-based deep learning models that integrate
both visible and thermal channels. We propose an ensemble approach that
integrates a general-purpose YOLOv8 model with a specialized thermal model,
using a sophisticated bounding box fusion algorithm to combine their
predictions. Our experiments show this approach achieves a mean Average
Precision (mAP@.5) of 0.93 and an F1-score of 0.90, outperforming a standalone
YOLOv8 model, which scored an mAP@.5 of 0.91. These findings demonstrate that
combining multiple YOLO architectures with fused multispectral data provides a
more reliable solution, improving the detection of both visual and thermal
defects.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图像标注工具需要大量人工输入，难以扩展到大规模数据集。为了解决这个问题，开发了VisioFirm来通过AI辅助自动化简化图像标注流程。

Method: 结合CLIP与预训练检测器（如Ultralytics模型）和零样本模型（如Grounding DINO），使用低置信度阈值生成初始标注，并通过交互式工具进行精炼。集成Segment Anything进行实时分割，支持边界框、定向边界框和多边形标注。

Result: 在COCO类数据集上测试显示，初始预测大多正确，人工工作量减少高达90%，同时通过聚类和IoU图保持高标注准确性。

Conclusion: VisioFirm通过AI辅助自动化显著提高了图像标注效率，减少了人工工作量，同时保持了高准确性，支持多种导出格式和离线操作。

Abstract: AI models rely on annotated data to learn pattern and perform prediction.
Annotation is usually a labor-intensive step that require associating labels
ranging from a simple classification label to more complex tasks such as object
detection, oriented bounding box estimation, and instance segmentation.
Traditional tools often require extensive manual input, limiting scalability
for large datasets. To address this, we introduce VisioFirm, an open-source web
application designed to streamline image labeling through AI-assisted
automation. VisioFirm integrates state-of-the-art foundation models into an
interface with a filtering pipeline to reduce human-in-the-loop efforts. This
hybrid approach employs CLIP combined with pre-trained detectors like
Ultralytics models for common classes and zero-shot models such as Grounding
DINO for custom labels, generating initial annotations with low-confidence
thresholding to maximize recall. Through this framework, when tested on
COCO-type of classes, initial prediction have been proven to be mostly correct
though the users can refine these via interactive tools supporting bounding
boxes, oriented bounding boxes, and polygons. Additionally, VisioFirm has
on-the-fly segmentation powered by Segment Anything accelerated through WebGPU
for browser-side efficiency. The tool supports multiple export formats (YOLO,
COCO, Pascal VOC, CSV) and operates offline after model caching, enhancing
accessibility. VisioFirm demonstrates up to 90\% reduction in manual effort
through benchmarks on diverse datasets, while maintaining high annotation
accuracy via clustering of connected CLIP-based disambiguate components and
IoU-graph for redundant detection suppression. VisioFirm can be accessed from

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有UCIR方法在整个图像层面进行跨域特征对齐，但对象特征常与域特定风格纠缠，导致域间差距难以克服

Method: 利用文本到图像生成模型进行特征解缠，分离对象特征和域特定风格；采用渐进式跨域互近邻对齐方法实现可靠的特征对齐

Result: 在3个基准数据集上的13个域中实现了最先进的性能

Conclusion: DUDE通过特征解缠和渐进式对齐有效解决了跨域图像检索中的域间差距问题

Abstract: Unsupervised cross-domain image retrieval (UCIR) aims to retrieve images of
the same category across diverse domains without relying on annotations.
Existing UCIR methods, which align cross-domain features for the entire image,
often struggle with the domain gap, as the object features critical for
retrieval are frequently entangled with domain-specific styles. To address this
challenge, we propose DUDE, a novel UCIR method building upon feature
disentanglement. In brief, DUDE leverages a text-to-image generative model to
disentangle object features from domain-specific styles, thus facilitating
semantical image retrieval. To further achieve reliable alignment of the
disentangled object features, DUDE aligns mutual neighbors from within domains
to across domains in a progressive manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that DUDE achieves state-of-the-art performance across three benchmark datasets
over 13 domains. The code will be released.

Conclusion: LASER框架有效提升了VLM在GUI grounding任务中的多步感知和坐标预测能力

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have recently achieved significant progress in
bridging visual perception and linguistic reasoning. Recently, OpenAI o3 model
introduced a zoom-in search strategy that effectively elicits active perception
capabilities in VLMs, improving downstream task performance. However, enabling
VLMs to reason effectively over appropriate image regions remains a core
challenge in GUI grounding, particularly under high-resolution inputs and
complex multi-element visual interactions. In this work, we propose LASER, a
self-evolving framework that progressively endows VLMs with multi-step
perception capabilities, enabling precise coordinate prediction. Specifically,
our approach integrate Monte Carlo quality estimation with
Intersection-over-Union (IoU)-based region quality evaluation to jointly
encourage both accuracy and diversity in constructing high-quality preference
data. This combination explicitly guides the model to focus on
instruction-relevant key regions while adaptively allocating reasoning steps
based on task complexity. Comprehensive experiments on the ScreenSpot Pro and
ScreenSpot-v2 benchmarks demonstrate consistent performance gains, validating
the effectiveness of our method. Furthermore, when fine-tuned on GTA1-7B, LASER
achieves a score of 55.7 on the ScreenSpot-Pro benchmark, establishing a new
state-of-the-art (SoTA) among 7B-scale models.

Method: 将DMP特征集成到三种先进的卷积和变换器语义分割架构中，使用直接输入和混合架构两种方式，并在iSAID数据集上评估了不同的DMP差分和结构元素形状。

Conclusion: 混合DMP架构能够有效提供形状信息给模型，显著提升遥感图像语义分割的性能，为遥感图像分析领域提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of overhead remote sensing imagery enables applications
in mapping, urban planning, and disaster response. State-of-the-art
segmentation networks are typically developed and tuned on ground-perspective
photographs and do not directly address remote sensing challenges such as
extreme scale variation, foreground-background imbalance, and large image
sizes. We explore the incorporation of the differential morphological profile
(DMP), a multi-scale shape extraction method based on grayscale morphology,
into modern segmentation networks. Prior studies have shown that the DMP can
provide critical shape information to Deep Neural Networks to enable superior
detection and classification performance in overhead imagery. In this work, we
extend prior DMPNet work beyond classification and object detection by
integrating DMP features into three state-of-the-art convolutional and
transformer semantic segmentation architectures. We utilize both direct input,
which adapts the input stem of feature extraction architectures to accept DMP
channels, and hybrid architectures, a dual-stream design that fuses RGB and DMP
encoders. Using the iSAID benchmark dataset, we evaluate a variety of DMP
differentials and structuring element shapes to more effectively provide shape
information to the model. Our results show that while non-DMP models generally
outperform the direct-input variants, hybrid DMP consistently outperforms
direct-input and is capable of surpassing a non-DMP model on mIoU, F1, and
Recall.

Abstract: Accurate quantification of tau pathology via tau positron emission tomography
(PET) scan is crucial for diagnosing and monitoring Alzheimer's disease (AD).
However, the high cost and limited availability of tau PET restrict its
widespread use. In contrast, structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and
plasma-based biomarkers provide non-invasive and widely available complementary
information related to brain anatomy and disease progression. In this work, we
propose a text-guided 3D diffusion model for 3D tau PET image synthesis,
leveraging multimodal conditions from both structural MRI and plasma
measurement. Specifically, the textual prompt is from the plasma p-tau217
measurement, which is a key indicator of AD progression, while MRI provides
anatomical structure constraints. The proposed framework is trained and
evaluated using clinical AV1451 tau PET data from the Alzheimer's Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Experimental results demonstrate that
our approach can generate realistic, clinically meaningful 3D tau PET across a
range of disease stages. The proposed framework can help perform tau PET data
augmentation under different settings, provide a non-invasive, cost-effective
alternative for visualizing tau pathology, and support the simulation of
disease progression under varying plasma biomarker levels and cognitive
conditions.

Abstract: Despite signi cant progress in semi-supervised medical image segmentation,
most existing segmentation networks overlook e ective methodological guidance
for feature extraction and important prior information from
  datasets. In this paper, we develop a semi-supervised medical image
segmentation framework that e ectively integrates spatial regularization
methods and volume priors. Speci cally, our approach integrates a strong
explicit volume prior at the image scale and Threshold Dynamics spatial
regularization, both derived from variational models, into the backbone
segmentation network. The target region volumes for each unlabeled image are
estimated by a regression network, which e ectively regularizes the backbone
segmentation network through an image-scale Wasserstein distance constraint,
ensuring that the class ratios in the segmentation results for each unlabeled
image match those predicted by the regression network. Additionally, we design
a dataset-scale Wasserstein distance loss function based on a weak implicit
volume prior, which enforces that the volume distribution predicted for the
unlabeled dataset is similar to that of labeled dataset. Experimental results
on the 2017 ACDC dataset, PROMISE12 dataset, and thigh muscle MR image dataset
show the superiority of the proposed method.

Conclusion: 该方法突破了传统方法对密集视角和相机位姿的依赖，为稀疏视角下的关节物体表示学习提供了有效的自监督解决方案

Abstract: We present a novel self-supervised framework for learning articulated object
representations from sparse-view, unposed images. Unlike prior methods that
require dense multi-view observations and ground-truth camera poses, our
approach operates with as few as four views per articulation and no camera
supervision. To address the inherent challenges, we first reconstruct each
articulation independently using recent advances in sparse-view 3D
reconstruction, then learn a deformation field that establishes dense
correspondences across poses. A progressive disentanglement strategy further
separates static from moving parts, enabling robust separation of camera and
object motion. Finally, we jointly optimize geometry, appearance, and
kinematics with a self-supervised loss that enforces cross-view and cross-pose
consistency. Experiments on the standard benchmark and real-world examples
demonstrate that our method produces accurate and detailed articulated object
representations under significantly weaker input assumptions than existing
approaches.

Abstract: Semantic noise in image classification datasets, where visually similar
categories are frequently mislabeled, poses a significant challenge to
conventional supervised learning approaches. In this paper, we explore the
potential of using synthetic images generated by advanced text-to-image models
to address this issue. Although these high-quality synthetic images come with
reliable labels, their direct application in training is limited by domain gaps
and diversity constraints. Unlike conventional approaches, we propose a novel
method that leverages synthetic images as reliable reference points to identify
and correct mislabeled samples in noisy datasets. Extensive experiments across
multiple benchmark datasets show that our approach significantly improves
classification accuracy under various noise conditions, especially in
challenging scenarios with semantic label noise. Additionally, since our method
is orthogonal to existing noise-robust learning techniques, when combined with
state-of-the-art noise-robust training methods, it achieves superior
performance, improving accuracy by 30% on CIFAR-10 and by 11% on CIFAR-100

Abstract: The recently introduced odd-one-out anomaly detection task involves
identifying the odd-looking instances within a multi-object scene. This problem
presents several challenges for modern deep learning models, demanding spatial
reasoning across multiple views and relational reasoning to understand context

these challenges must be addressed with efficiency in mind. To this end, we
propose a DINO-based model that reduces the number of parameters by one third
and shortens training time by a factor of three compared to the current
state-of-the-art, while maintaining competitive performance. Our experimental
evaluation also introduces a Multimodal Large Language Model baseline,
providing insights into its current limitations in structured visual reasoning

*Pengyue Jia,Yingyi Zhang,Xiangyu Zhao,Yixuan Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeoArena是一个评估大型视觉语言模型图像地理定位能力的开放平台，解决了现有评估方法的数据泄露和隐私问题，通过真实野外图像和人类判断进行更准确的评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前图像地理定位评估存在两个主要问题：1）数据泄露 - 大型视觉语言模型在测试数据集上预训练，影响评估准确性；2）现有指标依赖精确坐标，忽视推理过程且存在隐私问题。

Method: 开发GeoArena平台，允许用户上传真实野外图像构建多样化评估语料库，利用成对人类判断来确定哪个模型输出更符合人类期望。

Result: 平台上线两个月收集了数千条投票记录，基于这些数据进行了详细分析，并建立了不同LVLM在图像地理定位任务上的排行榜。

Conclusion: GeoArena为全球图像地理定位任务提供了首个开放评估平台，实现了真正野外环境和以人为中心的基准测试，解决了现有评估方法的局限性。

Abstract: Image geolocalization aims to predict the geographic location of images
captured anywhere on Earth, but its global nature presents significant
challenges. Current evaluation methodologies suffer from two major limitations.
First, data leakage: advanced approaches often rely on large vision-language
models (LVLMs) to predict image locations, yet these models are frequently
pretrained on the test datasets, compromising the accuracy of evaluating a
model's actual geolocalization capability. Second, existing metrics primarily
rely on exact geographic coordinates to assess predictions, which not only
neglects the reasoning process but also raises privacy concerns when user-level
location data is required. To address these issues, we propose GeoArena, a
first open platform for evaluating LVLMs on worldwide image geolocalization
tasks, offering true in-the-wild and human-centered benchmarking. GeoArena
enables users to upload in-the-wild images for a more diverse evaluation
corpus, and it leverages pairwise human judgments to determine which model
output better aligns with human expectations. Our platform has been deployed
online for two months, during which we collected over thousands voting records.
Based on this data, we conduct a detailed analysis and establish a leaderboard
of different LVLMs on the image geolocalization task.

TL;DR: FE2E框架首次将基于DiT架构的高级编辑模型应用于密集几何预测，通过重新制定训练目标和量化技术，在零样本深度和法线估计任务中取得了显著性能提升，甚至超越了使用100倍训练数据的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 密集预测本质上是图像到图像的任务，而图像编辑模型相比文本到图像生成模型可能更适合作为微调的基础。研究发现编辑模型具有固有的结构先验，能够更稳定地收敛并获得更高性能。

Method: 提出FE2E框架，将基于Diffusion Transformer的编辑模型适配到密集几何预测任务。重新制定编辑器的流匹配损失为"一致速度"训练目标，使用对数量化解决精度冲突，并利用DiT的全局注意力实现深度和法线的联合估计。

Result: 在不增加训练数据的情况下，FE2E在多个数据集的零样本单目深度和法线估计中取得了显著性能提升，在ETH3D数据集上获得超过35%的性能增益，超越了使用100倍训练数据的DepthAnything系列方法。

Conclusion: 图像编辑模型比生成模型更适合作为密集几何预测任务的基础，FE2E框架通过有效的适配策略展示了编辑模型在密集预测任务中的巨大潜力。

Abstract: Leveraging visual priors from pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) generative
models has shown success in dense prediction. However, dense prediction is
inherently an image-to-image task, suggesting that image editing models, rather
than T2I generative models, may be a more suitable foundation for fine-tuning.
  Motivated by this, we conduct a systematic analysis of the fine-tuning
behaviors of both editors and generators for dense geometry estimation. Our
findings show that editing models possess inherent structural priors, which
enable them to converge more stably by ``refining" their innate features, and
ultimately achieve higher performance than their generative counterparts.
  Based on these findings, we introduce \textbf{FE2E}, a framework that
pioneeringly adapts an advanced editing model based on Diffusion Transformer
(DiT) architecture for dense geometry prediction. Specifically, to tailor the
editor for this deterministic task, we reformulate the editor's original flow
matching loss into the ``consistent velocity" training objective. And we use
logarithmic quantization to resolve the precision conflict between the editor's
native BFloat16 format and the high precision demand of our tasks.
Additionally, we leverage the DiT's global attention for a cost-free joint
estimation of depth and normals in a single forward pass, enabling their
supervisory signals to mutually enhance each other.
  Without scaling up the training data, FE2E achieves impressive performance
improvements in zero-shot monocular depth and normal estimation across multiple
datasets. Notably, it achieves over 35\% performance gains on the ETH3D dataset
and outperforms the DepthAnything series, which is trained on 100$\times$ data.

TL;DR: MICACL是一个新颖的多实例学习框架，通过图增强实例交互模块和加权实例聚合网络解决动态面部表情识别中的长尾分布和时空特征建模问题，并在多个数据集上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态面部表情识别面临长尾类别分布和复杂时空特征建模的挑战，现有深度学习方法存在模型归纳偏差问题，需要新的解决方案。

Method: 提出MICACL框架，包含图增强实例交互模块(GEIIM)捕获时空依赖关系，加权实例聚合网络(WIAN)动态分配实例权重，以及多尺度类别感知对比学习策略(MCCL)平衡主次类别训练。

Result: 在DFEW和FERV39k等野外数据集上的大量实验表明，MICACL实现了最先进的性能，具有优异的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: MICACL框架有效解决了动态面部表情识别中的长尾分布和时空建模问题，为相关领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Dynamic facial expression recognition (DFER) faces significant challenges due
to long-tailed category distributions and complexity of spatio-temporal feature
modeling. While existing deep learning-based methods have improved DFER
performance, they often fail to address these issues, resulting in severe model
induction bias. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel
multi-instance learning framework called MICACL, which integrates
spatio-temporal dependency modeling and long-tailed contrastive learning
optimization. Specifically, we design the Graph-Enhanced Instance Interaction
Module (GEIIM) to capture intricate spatio-temporal between adjacent instances
relationships through adaptive adjacency matrices and multiscale convolutions.
To enhance instance-level feature aggregation, we develop the Weighted Instance
Aggregation Network (WIAN), which dynamically assigns weights based on instance
importance. Furthermore, we introduce a Multiscale Category-aware Contrastive
Learning (MCCL) strategy to balance training between major and minor
categories. Extensive experiments on in-the-wild datasets (i.e., DFEW and
FERV39k) demonstrate that MICACL achieves state-of-the-art performance with
superior robustness and generalization.

Result: 生成的全景摘要图像能够快速呈现复杂环境的综合信息，支持高效决策和事故分析。

Conclusion: 该方法为应急响应领域提供了一种高效的视觉摘要解决方案，显著提升了情况感知和决策效率。

Abstract: First responders widely adopt body-worn cameras to document incident scenes
and support post-event analysis. However, reviewing lengthy video footage is
impractical in time-critical situations. Effective situational awareness
demands a concise visual summary that can be quickly interpreted. This work
presents a computer vision pipeline that transforms body-camera footage into
informative panoramic images summarizing the incident scene. Our method
leverages monocular Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) to estimate
camera trajectories and reconstruct the spatial layout of the environment. Key
viewpoints are identified by clustering camera poses along the trajectory, and
representative frames from each cluster are selected. These frames are fused
into spatially coherent panoramic images using multi-frame stitching
techniques. The resulting summaries enable rapid understanding of complex
environments and facilitate efficient decision-making and incident review.

Method: 提出基于图像的自适应数据集构建方法，从图像出发构建配对文本和指导回应，并通过微调安全判断模型来评估数据集效果。

Result: 自动生成了35k图像-文本对，并通过多种任务的实验验证了图像导向方法的有效性和可扩展性。

Conclusion: 图像导向方法为真实多模态安全数据集的构建提供了新的视角，解决了传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are rapidly evolving, presenting
increasingly complex safety challenges. However, current dataset construction
methods, which are risk-oriented, fail to cover the growing complexity of
real-world multimodal safety scenarios (RMS). And due to the lack of a unified
evaluation metric, their overall effectiveness remains unproven. This paper
introduces a novel image-oriented self-adaptive dataset construction method for
RMS, which starts with images and end constructing paired text and guidance
responses. Using the image-oriented method, we automatically generate an RMS
dataset comprising 35k image-text pairs with guidance responses. Additionally,
we introduce a standardized safety dataset evaluation metric: fine-tuning a
safety judge model and evaluating its capabilities on other safety
datasets.Extensive experiments on various tasks demonstrate the effectiveness
of the proposed image-oriented pipeline. The results confirm the scalability
and effectiveness of the image-oriented approach, offering a new perspective
for the construction of real-world multimodal safety datasets.

Conclusion: AnomalyLMM是首个探索LMMs用于文本人员异常搜索的研究，通过创新的无训练适应策略有效解决了领域差距问题，为未来研究提供了可解释的跨模态对齐方案。

Abstract: With growing public safety demands, text-based person anomaly search has
emerged as a critical task, aiming to retrieve individuals with abnormal
behaviors via natural language descriptions. Unlike conventional person search,
this task presents two unique challenges: (1) fine-grained cross-modal
alignment between textual anomalies and visual behaviors, and (2) anomaly
recognition under sparse real-world samples. While Large Multi-modal Models
(LMMs) excel in multi-modal understanding, their potential for fine-grained
anomaly retrieval remains underexplored, hindered by: (1) a domain gap between
generative knowledge and discriminative retrieval, and (2) the absence of
efficient adaptation strategies for deployment. In this work, we propose
AnomalyLMM, the first framework that harnesses LMMs for text-based person
anomaly search. Our key contributions are: (1) A novel coarse-to-fine pipeline
integrating LMMs to bridge generative world knowledge with retrieval-centric
anomaly detection; (2) A training-free adaptation cookbook featuring masked
cross-modal prompting, behavioral saliency prediction, and knowledge-aware
re-ranking, enabling zero-shot focus on subtle anomaly cues. As the first study
to explore LMMs for this task, we conduct a rigorous evaluation on the PAB
dataset, the only publicly available benchmark for text-based person anomaly
search, with its curated real-world anomalies covering diverse scenarios (e.g.,
falling, collision, and being hit). Experiments show the effectiveness of the
proposed method, surpassing the competitive baseline by +0.96% Recall@1
accuracy. Notably, our method reveals interpretable alignment between textual
anomalies and visual behaviors, validated via qualitative analysis. Our code
and models will be released for future research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了UCF-UM框架，通过循环评估协议量化统一视觉语言模型在图像到文本和文本到图像转换中的语义漂移问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法单独考察理解和生成能力，无法揭示模型在跨模态循环转换中是否保持语义一致性

Method: 设计循环评估协议，交替进行I2T和T2I多代转换，提出三个指标：MCD（平均累积漂移）、SDR（语义漂移率）、MGG（多代GenEval）

Result: 评估7个最新模型发现显著差异：BAGEL在多代转换中保持语义稳定，而Vila-u尽管单次评估表现好但漂移迅速

Conclusion: 循环一致性评估是标准I2T和T2I评估的必要补充，为统一模型的跨模态稳定性和共享表示强度提供实用度量标准

Abstract: Employing a single, unified model (UM) for both visual understanding
(image-to-text: I2T) and and visual generation (text-to-image: T2I) has opened
a new direction in Visual Language Model (VLM) research. While UMs can also
support broader unimodal tasks (e.g., text-to-text, image-to-image), we focus
on the core cross-modal pair T2I and I2T, as consistency between understanding
and generation is critical for downstream use. Existing evaluations consider
these capabilities in isolation: FID and GenEval for T2I, and benchmarks such
as MME, MMBench for I2T. These single-pass metrics do not reveal whether a
model that understands a concept can also render it, nor whether meaning is
preserved when cycling between image and text modalities. To address this, we
introduce the Unified Consistency Framework for Unified Models (UCF-UM), a
cyclic evaluation protocol that alternates I2T and T2I over multiple
generations to quantify semantic drift. UCF formulates 3 metrics: (i) Mean
Cumulative Drift (MCD), an embedding-based measure of overall semantic loss;
(ii) Semantic Drift Rate (SDR), that summarizes semantic decay rate; and (iii)
Multi-Generation GenEval (MGG), an object-level compliance score extending
GenEval. To assess generalization beyond COCO, which is widely used in
training; we create a new benchmark ND400, sampled from NoCaps and DOCCI and
evaluate on seven recent models. UCF-UM reveals substantial variation in
cross-modal stability: some models like BAGEL maintain semantics over many
alternations, whereas others like Vila-u drift quickly despite strong
single-pass scores. Our results highlight cyclic consistency as a necessary
complement to standard I2T and T2I evaluations, and provide practical metrics
to consistently assess unified model's cross-modal stability and strength of
their shared representations. Code:

Conclusion: ASE-MLLM是首个将图像美学显著性整合到多模态大语言模型中专门用于美学图像描述任务的框架，实验证明其有效性。

Abstract: Aesthetic Image Captioning (AIC) aims to generate textual descriptions of
image aesthetics, becoming a key research direction in the field of
computational aesthetics. In recent years, pretrained Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) have advanced rapidly, leading to a significant increase in
image aesthetics research that integrates both visual and textual modalities.
However, most existing studies on image aesthetics primarily focus on
predicting aesthetic ratings and have shown limited application in AIC.
Existing AIC works leveraging MLLMs predominantly rely on fine-tuning methods
without specifically adapting MLLMs to focus on target aesthetic content. To
address this limitation, we propose the Aesthetic Saliency Enhanced Multimodal
Large Language Model (ASE-MLLM), an end-to-end framework that explicitly
incorporates aesthetic saliency into MLLMs. Within this framework, we introduce
the Image Aesthetic Saliency Module (IASM), which efficiently and effectively
extracts aesthetic saliency features from images. Additionally, we design
IAS-ViT as the image encoder for MLLMs, this module fuses aesthetic saliency
features with original image features via a cross-attention mechanism. To the
best of our knowledge, ASE-MLLM is the first framework to integrate image
aesthetic saliency into MLLMs specifically for AIC tasks. Extensive experiments
demonstrated that our approach significantly outperformed traditional methods
and generic MLLMs on current mainstream AIC benchmarks, achieving
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.

Conclusion: 该方法能够生成结构更清晰、视觉更一致、艺术性更丰富的3D风格化结果，有效解决了现有方法的限制。

Abstract: Recent advancements in neural representations, such as Neural Radiance Fields
and 3D Gaussian Splatting, have increased interest in applying style transfer
to 3D scenes. While existing methods can transfer style patterns onto
3D-consistent neural representations, they struggle to effectively extract and
transfer high-level style semantics from the reference style image.
Additionally, the stylized results often lack structural clarity and
separation, making it difficult to distinguish between different instances or
objects within the 3D scene. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
3D style transfer pipeline that effectively integrates prior knowledge from
pretrained 2D diffusion models. Our pipeline consists of two key stages: First,
we leverage diffusion priors to generate stylized renderings of key viewpoints.
Then, we transfer the stylized key views onto the 3D representation. This
process incorporates two innovative designs. The first is cross-view style
alignment, which inserts cross-view attention into the last upsampling block of
the UNet, allowing feature interactions across multiple key views. This ensures
that the diffusion model generates stylized key views that maintain both style
fidelity and instance-level consistency. The second is instance-level style
transfer, which effectively leverages instance-level consistency across
stylized key views and transfers it onto the 3D representation. This results in
a more structured, visually coherent, and artistically enriched stylization.
Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our 3D
style transfer pipeline significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods
across a wide range of scenes, from forward-facing to challenging 360-degree
environments. Visit our project page https://jm-xu.github.io/SSGaussian for

Motivation: X光高分辨率重建技术在低信号和未知探针条件下的性能受限，传统迭代方法和深度学习方法都不理想

Conclusion: PtyINR提供了一个通用的、物理信息化的框架，可应用于广泛的计算显微镜问题，为探针依赖的逆向问题提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: X-ray ptychography provides exceptional nanoscale resolution and is widely
applied in materials science, biology, and nanotechnology. However, its full
potential is constrained by the critical challenge of accurately reconstructing
images when the illuminating probe is unknown. Conventional iterative methods
and deep learning approaches are often suboptimal, particularly under the
low-signal conditions inherent to low-dose and high-speed experiments. These
limitations compromise reconstruction fidelity and restrict the broader
adoption of the technique. In this work, we introduce the Ptychographic
Implicit Neural Representation (PtyINR), a self-supervised framework that
simultaneously addresses the object and probe recovery problem. By
parameterizing both as continuous neural representations, PtyINR performs
end-to-end reconstruction directly from raw diffraction patterns without
requiring any pre-characterization of the probe. Extensive evaluations
demonstrate that PtyINR achieves superior reconstruction quality on both
simulated and experimental data, with remarkable robustness under challenging
low-signal conditions. Furthermore, PtyINR offers a generalizable,
physics-informed framework for addressing probe-dependent inverse problems,
making it applicable to a wide range of computational microscopy problems.

Conclusion: 该方法显著优于现有的CM蒸馏方法，使TRELLIS在少步3D生成中实现卓越性能，为3D生成模型的实时应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Flow-based 3D generation models typically require dozens of sampling steps
during inference. Though few-step distillation methods, particularly
Consistency Models (CMs), have achieved substantial advancements in
accelerating 2D diffusion models, they remain under-explored for more complex
3D generation tasks. In this study, we propose a novel framework, MDT-dist, for
few-step 3D flow distillation. Our approach is built upon a primary objective:
distilling the pretrained model to learn the Marginal-Data Transport. Directly
learning this objective needs to integrate the velocity fields, while this
integral is intractable to be implemented. Therefore, we propose two
optimizable objectives, Velocity Matching (VM) and Velocity Distillation (VD),
to equivalently convert the optimization target from the transport level to the
velocity and the distribution level respectively. Velocity Matching (VM) learns
to stably match the velocity fields between the student and the teacher, but
inevitably provides biased gradient estimates. Velocity Distillation (VD)
further enhances the optimization process by leveraging the learned velocity
fields to perform probability density distillation. When evaluated on the
pioneer 3D generation framework TRELLIS, our method reduces sampling steps of
each flow transformer from 25 to 1 or 2, achieving 0.68s (1 step x 2) and 0.94s
(2 steps x 2) latency with 9.0x and 6.5x speedup on A800, while preserving high
visual and geometric fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method significantly outperforms existing CM distillation methods, and enables
TRELLIS to achieve superior performance in few-step 3D generation.

Abstract: We present Durian, the first method for generating portrait animation videos
with facial attribute transfer from a given reference image to a target
portrait in a zero-shot manner. To enable high-fidelity and spatially
consistent attribute transfer across frames, we introduce dual reference
networks that inject spatial features from both the portrait and attribute
images into the denoising process of a diffusion model. We train the model
using a self-reconstruction formulation, where two frames are sampled from the
same portrait video: one is treated as the attribute reference and the other as
the target portrait, and the remaining frames are reconstructed conditioned on
these inputs and their corresponding masks. To support the transfer of
attributes with varying spatial extent, we propose a mask expansion strategy
using keypoint-conditioned image generation for training. In addition, we
further augment the attribute and portrait images with spatial and
appearance-level transformations to improve robustness to positional
misalignment between them. These strategies allow the model to effectively
generalize across diverse attributes and in-the-wild reference combinations,
despite being trained without explicit triplet supervision. Durian achieves
state-of-the-art performance on portrait animation with attribute transfer, and
notably, its dual reference design enables multi-attribute composition in a
single generation pass without additional training.

Abstract: Collimation in X-ray imaging restricts exposure to the region-of-interest
(ROI) and minimizes the radiation dose applied to the patient. The detection of
collimator shadows is an essential image-based preprocessing step in digital
radiography posing a challenge when edges get obscured by scattered X-ray
radiation. Regardless, the prior knowledge that collimation forms
polygonal-shaped shadows is evident. For this reason, we introduce a deep
learning-based segmentation that is inherently constrained to its geometry. We
achieve this by incorporating a differentiable Hough transform-based network to
detect the collimation borders and enhance its capability to extract the
information about the ROI center. During inference, we combine the information
of both tasks to enable the generation of refined, line-constrained
segmentation masks. We demonstrate robust reconstruction of collimated regions
achieving median Hausdorff distances of 4.3-5.0mm on diverse test sets of real
Xray images. While this application involves at most four shadow borders, our
method is not fundamentally limited by a specific number of edges.

TL;DR: 这篇论文是一个全景视觉技术的综述性调查，重点分析了透视图像向全景图像的域适配挑战咈解决方案，涵盖了4个主要分类和20+代表性任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全景图像(ODIs)在虚拟现实、自主驾驶等领域需求增长，但其与透视图像在几何投影、空间分布和边界连续性上存在显著差异，直接域适配面临挑战。

Method: 首先回顾全景成像流程和投影方法，分析结构差异；总结三大域适配挑战：极点附近严重几何异变、ERP投影中的非均匀采样、周期性边界连续性；从跨方法和跨任务两个维度分析代表性策略。

Result: 综述了300+篇论文，分类为四大类别：视觉质量增强与评估、视觉理解、多模态理解、视觉生成，提供了跨方法分析和跨任务比较。

Conclusion: 论文为全景视觉研究提供了新的见解和前瞻性观点，讨论了数据、模型和应用方面的开放挑战和未来方向，有助于推动全景视觉技术的发展。

Abstract: Driven by the demand for spatial intelligence and holistic scene perception,
omnidirectional images (ODIs), which provide a complete 360\textdegree{} field
of view, are receiving growing attention across diverse applications such as
virtual reality, autonomous driving, and embodied robotics. Despite their
unique characteristics, ODIs exhibit remarkable differences from perspective
images in geometric projection, spatial distribution, and boundary continuity,
making it challenging for direct domain adaption from perspective methods. This
survey reviews recent panoramic vision techniques with a particular emphasis on
the perspective-to-panorama adaptation. We first revisit the panoramic imaging
pipeline and projection methods to build the prior knowledge required for
analyzing the structural disparities. Then, we summarize three challenges of
domain adaptation: severe geometric distortions near the poles, non-uniform
sampling in Equirectangular Projection (ERP), and periodic boundary continuity.
Building on this, we cover 20+ representative tasks drawn from more than 300
research papers in two dimensions. On one hand, we present a cross-method
analysis of representative strategies for addressing panoramic specific
challenges across different tasks. On the other hand, we conduct a cross-task
comparison and classify panoramic vision into four major categories: visual
quality enhancement and assessment, visual understanding, multimodal
understanding, and visual generation. In addition, we discuss open challenges
and future directions in data, models, and applications that will drive the
advancement of panoramic vision research. We hope that our work can provide new
insight and forward looking perspectives to advance the development of
panoramic vision technologies. Our project page is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着文本到图像扩散模型在创意领域的广泛应用，需要提供增强的控制、精炼能力以及在生成后以一致方式修改图像的能力，现有方法缺乏在保持多帧视觉和叙事一致性的同时进行精细或粗略编辑的灵活性

Method: Plot'n Polish零样本框架，支持在不同细节级别上对故事可视化进行细粒度控制

Result: 该框架能够实现一致的故事生成，并提供对故事可视化的精细控制

Conclusion: Plot'n Polish为解决故事可视化中的一致性和控制问题提供了一个有效的零样本解决方案

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated significant capabilities to
generate diverse and detailed visuals in various domains, and story
visualization is emerging as a particularly promising application. However, as
their use in real-world creative domains increases, the need for providing
enhanced control, refinement, and the ability to modify images post-generation
in a consistent manner becomes an important challenge. Existing methods often
lack the flexibility to apply fine or coarse edits while maintaining visual and
narrative consistency across multiple frames, preventing creators from
seamlessly crafting and refining their visual stories. To address these
challenges, we introduce Plot'n Polish, a zero-shot framework that enables
consistent story generation and provides fine-grained control over story
visualizations at various levels of detail.

TL;DR: TRUST-VL是一个统一且可解释的视觉语言模型，用于通用多模态虚假信息检测，通过联合训练和结构化推理链实现最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态虚假信息（包含文本、视觉和跨模态扭曲）对社会构成日益严重的威胁，现有方法通常只关注单一扭曲类型且难以泛化到未见场景。

Method: 提出TRUST-VL模型，包含问题感知视觉放大器模块提取任务特定视觉特征，并构建TRUST-Instruct大规模指令数据集（198K样本）支持训练，数据集包含与人类事实核查工作流程对齐的结构化推理链。

Result: 在领域内和零样本基准测试中的广泛实验表明，TRUST-VL实现了最先进的性能，同时具有良好的泛化能力和可解释性。

Conclusion: 联合训练不同扭曲类型促进知识共享并增强模型泛化能力，TRUST-VL为多模态虚假信息检测提供了有效的统一解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal misinformation, encompassing textual, visual, and cross-modal
distortions, poses an increasing societal threat that is amplified by
generative AI. Existing methods typically focus on a single type of distortion
and struggle to generalize to unseen scenarios. In this work, we observe that
different distortion types share common reasoning capabilities while also
requiring task-specific skills. We hypothesize that joint training across
distortion types facilitates knowledge sharing and enhances the model's ability
to generalize. To this end, we introduce TRUST-VL, a unified and explainable
vision-language model for general multimodal misinformation detection. TRUST-VL
incorporates a novel Question-Aware Visual Amplifier module, designed to
extract task-specific visual features. To support training, we also construct
TRUST-Instruct, a large-scale instruction dataset containing 198K samples
featuring structured reasoning chains aligned with human fact-checking
workflows. Extensive experiments on both in-domain and zero-shot benchmarks
demonstrate that TRUST-VL achieves state-of-the-art performance, while also
offering strong generalization and interpretability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决虚拟试穿视频生成中的两大挑战：相邻分段间的局部平滑性和不同分段间的全局时间一致性。传统方法需要大量计算资源和长视频数据。

Method: 提出VFR框架，采用自回归的段落生成方式。通过前缀视频条件保证局部平滑性，使用锚点视频（360度全身视频）来维护全局时间一致性。

Result: VFR能够生成分钟级别的虚拟试穿视频，在各种不同动作下同时保持局部平滑性和全局时间一致性。

Conclusion: 该方法是长时间虚拟试穿视频生成领域的首创性工作，为该领域的研究开启了新方向。

Abstract: We introduce the Virtual Fitting Room (VFR), a novel video generative model
that produces arbitrarily long virtual try-on videos. Our VFR models long video
generation tasks as an auto-regressive, segment-by-segment generation process,
eliminating the need for resource-intensive generation and lengthy video data,
while providing the flexibility to generate videos of arbitrary length. The key
challenges of this task are twofold: ensuring local smoothness between adjacent
segments and maintaining global temporal consistency across different segments.
To address these challenges, we propose our VFR framework, which ensures
smoothness through a prefix video condition and enforces consistency with the
anchor video -- a 360-degree video that comprehensively captures the human's
wholebody appearance. Our VFR generates minute-scale virtual try-on videos with
both local smoothness and global temporal consistency under various motions,
making it a pioneering work in long virtual try-on video generation.

TL;DR: 本研究比较了多种大语言模型适应策略在痴呆症检测中的应用，发现适当的模型适应方法（包括演示选择、推理增强和微调）可以显著提升基于语音的痴呆症检测性能，开源模型经过适当调整后可以达到或超过商业系统的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 美国超过一半的阿尔茨海默病及相关痴呆症患者未被诊断，基于语音的筛查提供了一种可扩展的检测方法。研究旨在探索大语言模型的不同适应策略在痴呆症检测中的效果。

Method: 使用DementiaBank语音语料库，评估了9个纯文本模型和3个多模态音频-文本模型。适应策略包括：上下文学习（不同演示选择策略）、推理增强提示、参数高效微调以及多模态集成。

Result: 类中心演示在上下文学习中表现最佳；推理增强改善了较小模型的性能；token级微调通常产生最好的分数；添加分类头显著改善了表现不佳的模型；多模态模型表现良好但未超越最佳纯文本模型。

Conclusion: 模型适应策略（包括演示选择、推理设计和调优方法）对基于语音的痴呆症检测至关重要，经过适当调整的开源模型可以匹配或超越商业系统。

Abstract: Over half of US adults with Alzheimer disease and related dementias remain
undiagnosed, and speech-based screening offers a scalable detection approach.
We compared large language model adaptation strategies for dementia detection
using the DementiaBank speech corpus, evaluating nine text-only models and
three multimodal audio-text models on recordings from DementiaBank speech
corpus. Adaptations included in-context learning with different demonstration
selection policies, reasoning-augmented prompting, parameter-efficient
fine-tuning, and multimodal integration. Results showed that class-centroid
demonstrations achieved the highest in-context learning performance, reasoning
improved smaller models, and token-level fine-tuning generally produced the
best scores. Adding a classification head substantially improved
underperforming models. Among multimodal models, fine-tuned audio-text systems
performed well but did not surpass the top text-only models. These findings
highlight that model adaptation strategies, including demonstration selection,
reasoning design, and tuning method, critically influence speech-based dementia
detection, and that properly adapted open-weight models can match or exceed
commercial systems.

Motivation: 解决语音大语言模型(SpeechLMs)与文本基础模型在指令跟随性能上的显著差距，牵涉到语音动态性和变化性的挑战

Method: 采用自我合成方法生成大量高保真对齐数据，然后通过强化学习将SpeechLMs与强大的教师LLM行为对齐

Conclusion: RBA框架能够有效缩小语音与文本模态间的性能差距，仅使用自生成数据即可实现高性能对齐

Abstract: The recent advancements of Large Language Models (LLMs) have spurred
considerable research interest in extending their linguistic capabilities
beyond text to other modalities, which leads to emergence of speech-based LLMs
(SpeechLMs) with capability of processing user request in either speech or
textual formats. However, owing to inter-modal discrepancies, these SpeechLMs
still exhibit a significant performance gap compared to their text-based LLM
counterparts in instruction-following, particularly when confronted with the
dynamic and variable nature of user speech. To address this challenge, this
paper introduces a framework termed Reinforced Behavior Alignment (RBA),
designed to bolster the language generation proficiency of SpeechLMs. Instead
of relying on supervised fine-tuning from human annotations, RBA employs a
self-synthesis methodology to generate extensive, high-fidelity alignment data
by a powerful teacher LLM. Then SpeechLMs is aligned its behavior with that of
a teacher using a reinforcement learning-based approach. Experimental results
demonstrate that this method effectively enhances the instruction-following
capabilities of SpeechLMs that outperform conventional distillation baselines.
Crucially, we demonstrate that RBA can be seamlessly extended to tasks such
including spoken question answering and speech-to-text translation, attaining
state-of-the-art performance on open benchmarks with only self-generated data.

Abstract: In the paper, we consider multilevel multitask analysis of cryptocurrency
news using a fine-tuned Mistral 7B large language model with
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).
  On the first level of analytics, the fine-tuned model generates graph and
text summaries with sentiment scores as well as JSON representations of
summaries. Higher levels perform hierarchical stacking that consolidates sets
of graph-based and text-based summaries as well as summaries of summaries into
comprehensive reports. The combination of graph and text summaries provides
complementary views of cryptocurrency news. The model is fine-tuned with 4-bit
quantization using the PEFT/LoRA approach. The representation of cryptocurrency
news as knowledge graph can essentially eliminate problems with large language
model hallucinations.
  The obtained results demonstrate that the use of fine-tuned Mistral 7B LLM
models for multilevel cryptocurrency news analysis can conduct informative
qualitative and quantitative analytics, providing important insights.

Motivation: 现有的财务情感分析系统多依赖平面的文档级或句子级模型，无法捐描营收会议调用的层次话语结构。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅在财务报告领域有应用价值，还能扩展到医疗、教育、政治等高风险领域，提供了一种健壮可解释的多模态话语表示方法。

Abstract: Earnings calls represent a uniquely rich and semi-structured source of
financial communication, blending scripted managerial commentary with
unscripted analyst dialogue. Although recent advances in financial sentiment
analysis have integrated multi-modal signals, such as textual content and vocal
tone, most systems rely on flat document-level or sentence-level models,
failing to capture the layered discourse structure of these interactions. This
paper introduces a novel multi-modal framework designed to generate
semantically rich and structurally aware embeddings of earnings calls, by
encoding them as hierarchical discourse trees. Each node, comprising either a
monologue or a question-answer pair, is enriched with emotional signals derived
from text, audio, and video, as well as structured metadata including coherence
scores, topic labels, and answer coverage assessments. A two-stage transformer
architecture is proposed: the first encodes multi-modal content and discourse
metadata at the node level using contrastive learning, while the second
synthesizes a global embedding for the entire conference. Experimental results
reveal that the resulting embeddings form stable, semantically meaningful
representations that reflect affective tone, structural logic, and thematic
alignment. Beyond financial reporting, the proposed system generalizes to other
high-stakes unscripted communicative domains such as tele-medicine, education,
and political discourse, offering a robust and explainable approach to
multi-modal discourse representation. This approach offers practical utility
for downstream tasks such as financial forecasting and discourse evaluation,
while also providing a generalizable method applicable to other domains
involving high-stakes communication.

Motivation: 青少年自杀是主要死因之一，但预测困难。许多案例因与精神健康服务无接触而未被发现。社交媒体提供了实时分析青少年在线表达的状态和困扰的机会

Method: 提出Early-SIB模型，基于transformer结构，序列处理用户在论坛中写作和互动的帖子，预测其是否会写出自杀意念和行为(SIB)内容

Result: 在荷兰青少年论坛数据集上，模型实现了平衡准确率0.73，能够在用户明确表达自杀意念之前预测未来的SIB行为

Conclusion: Early-SIB模型证明了通过分析社交媒体内容预测自杀意念的可行性，为传统预防方法提供了有意义的补充，对青少年自杀防治具有重要价值

Abstract: Suicide is a leading cause of death among adolescents (12-18), yet predicting
it remains a significant challenge. Many cases go undetected due to a lack of
contact with mental health services. Social media, however, offers a unique
opportunity, as young people often share their thoughts and struggles online in
real time. In this work, we propose a novel task and method to approach it:
predicting suicidal ideation and behavior (SIB) from forum posts before an
adolescent explicitly expresses suicidal ideation on an online forum. This
predictive framing, where no self-disclosure is used as input at any stage,
remains largely unexplored in the suicide prediction literature. To this end,
we introduce Early-SIB, a transformer-based model that sequentially processes
the posts a user writes and engages with to predict whether they will write a
SIB post. Our model achieves a balanced accuracy of 0.73 for predicting future
SIB on a Dutch youth forum, demonstrating that such tools can offer a
meaningful addition to traditional methods.

Conclusion: 这是一种有前景的可扩展幻觉检测方法，虽然注释过程费用较高，但一个模型的注释数据可以用于训练其他模型的分类器。

Abstract: Large language models are now routinely used in high-stakes applications
where hallucinations can cause serious harm, such as medical consultations or
legal advice. Existing hallucination detection methods, however, are
impractical for real-world use, as they are either limited to short factual
queries or require costly external verification. We present a cheap, scalable
method for real-time identification of hallucinated tokens in long-form
generations, and scale it effectively to 70B parameter models. Our approach
targets \emph{entity-level hallucinations} -- e.g., fabricated names, dates,
citations -- rather than claim-level, thereby naturally mapping to token-level
labels and enabling streaming detection. We develop an annotation methodology
that leverages web search to annotate model responses with grounded labels
indicating which tokens correspond to fabricated entities. This dataset enables
us to train effective hallucination classifiers with simple and efficient
methods such as linear probes. Evaluating across four model families, our
classifiers consistently outperform baselines on long-form responses, including
more expensive methods such as semantic entropy (e.g., AUC 0.90 vs 0.71 for
Llama-3.3-70B), and are also an improvement in short-form question-answering
settings. Moreover, despite being trained only with entity-level labels, our
probes effectively detect incorrect answers in mathematical reasoning tasks,
indicating generalization beyond entities. While our annotation methodology is
expensive, we find that annotated responses from one model can be used to train
effective classifiers on other models; accordingly, we publicly release our
datasets to facilitate reuse. Overall, our work suggests a promising new
approach for scalable, real-world hallucination detection.

Conclusion: UDIB方法为检测LLM内在忠实性幻觉提供了更敏感和理论基础更强的工具，改进了语义分歧检测框架

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to critical failure modes, including
\textit{intrinsic faithfulness hallucinations} (also known as confabulations),
where a response deviates semantically from the provided context. Frameworks
designed to detect this, such as Semantic Divergence Metrics (SDM), rely on
identifying latent topics shared between prompts and responses, typically by
applying geometric clustering to their sentence embeddings. This creates a
disconnect, as the topics are optimized for spatial proximity, not for the
downstream information-theoretic analysis. In this paper, we bridge this gap by
developing a principled topic identification method grounded in the
Deterministic Information Bottleneck (DIB) for geometric clustering. Our key
contribution is to transform the DIB method into a practical algorithm for
high-dimensional data by substituting its intractable KL divergence term with a
computationally efficient upper bound. The resulting method, which we dub UDIB,
can be interpreted as an entropy-regularized and robustified version of K-means
that inherently favors a parsimonious number of informative clusters. By
applying UDIB to the joint clustering of LLM prompt and response embeddings, we
generate a shared topic representation that is not merely spatially coherent
but is fundamentally structured to be maximally informative about the
prompt-response relationship. This provides a superior foundation for the SDM
framework and offers a novel, more sensitive tool for detecting confabulations.

Motivation: 现有代码生成LLM主要关注表面模式识别，缺乏对抽象能力的显式训练，而抽象是计算机科学中识别和提炼核心计算模式的关键能力

Method: 提出AR²对抗性强化学习框架：教师模型将内核问题转化为叙述丰富的复杂描述但不改变底层逻辑，学生编码模型训练解决这些复杂叙述问题并提取底层计算内核

Result: 实验结果表明AR²显著提高了学生模型在先前未见挑战性编程任务上的准确性

Conclusion: 抽象是增强LLM泛化能力的关键技能，AR²框架有效提升了LLM的抽象推理能力

Abstract: Abstraction--the ability to recognize and distill essential computational
patterns from complex problem statements--is a foundational skill in computer
science, critical both for human problem-solvers and coding-oriented large
language models (LLMs). Despite recent advances in training LLMs for code
generation using reinforcement learning (RL), most existing approaches focus
primarily on superficial pattern recognition, overlooking explicit training for
abstraction. In this study, we propose AR$^2$ (Adversarial Reinforcement
Learning for Abstract Reasoning), a novel framework explicitly designed to
enhance the abstraction abilities of LLMs. AR$^2$ employs a teacher model to
transform kernel problems into narrative-rich, challenging descriptions without
changing their fundamental logic. Simultaneously, a student coding model is
trained to solve these complex narrative problems by extracting their
underlying computational kernels. Experimental results demonstrate that AR$^2$
substantially improves the student model's accuracy on previously unseen,
challenging programming tasks, underscoring abstraction as a key skill for
enhancing LLM generalization.

Method: 动态构建和扩展知识图：通过prompt提取种子KG，迭代扩展LLM潜在知识，通过外部检索选择性精炼图谱

Result: 在三个事实QA测试集上表现一致提升，在事实准确性、答案精确度和可解释性方面超过基线方法

Conclusion: 推理时知识图构建是提升LLM事实性的有前景方向，具有结构化、可解释性和可扩展性

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with producing factually
consistent answers due to limitations in their parametric memory.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods address this issue by
incorporating external knowledge from trusted sources at inference time.
However, such methods typically treat knowledge as unstructured text, which
limits their ability to support compositional reasoning and identify factual
inconsistencies. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel framework
that dynamically constructs and expands knowledge graphs (KGs) during
inference, integrating both internal knowledge extracted from LLMs and external
information retrieved from external sources. Our method begins by extracting a
seed KG from the question via prompting, followed by iterative expansion using
the LLM's latent knowledge. The graph is then selectively refined through
external retrieval, enhancing factual coverage and correcting inaccuracies. We
evaluate our approach on three diverse factual QA benchmarks, demonstrating
consistent improvements in factual accuracy, answer precision, and
interpretability over baseline prompting and static KG-augmented methods. Our
findings suggest that inference-time KG construction is a promising direction
for enhancing LLM factuality in a structured, interpretable, and scalable
manner.

Motivation: 理解科学思想的演变需要超越单篇论文摘要，需要进行结构化、跨文档的主题相关研究推理。

Method: 基于代理的框架，包含三个协调代理：Plan Agent进行任务分解，Mmap-Agent构建动机-方法思维导图，Lchart-Agent合成实验折线图。

Result: 实验表明，尽管使用7B规模的代理，该系统在语义对齐、结构一致性和视觉保真度方面始终优于GPT-4o等强基线。

Conclusion: 提出了ResearchPulse-Bench基准数据集，支持多文档科学推理任务，为研究发展链的重建提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Understanding how scientific ideas evolve requires more than summarizing
individual papers-it demands structured, cross-document reasoning over
thematically related research. In this work, we formalize multi-document
scientific inference, a new task that extracts and aligns motivation,
methodology, and experimental results across related papers to reconstruct
research development chains. This task introduces key challenges, including
temporally aligning loosely structured methods and standardizing heterogeneous
experimental tables. We present ResearchPulse, an agent-based framework that
integrates instruction planning, scientific content extraction, and structured
visualization. It consists of three coordinated agents: a Plan Agent for task
decomposition, a Mmap-Agent that constructs motivation-method mind maps, and a
Lchart-Agent that synthesizes experimental line charts. To support this task,
we introduce ResearchPulse-Bench, a citation-aware benchmark of annotated paper
clusters. Experiments show that our system, despite using 7B-scale agents,
consistently outperforms strong baselines like GPT-4o in semantic alignment,
structural consistency, and visual fidelity. The dataset are available in

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多语言、噪声和多样化真实世界图像中的OCR挑战，评估传统OCR系统与大型视觉语言模型在边缘部署环境中的性能差异

Method: 构建Sprinklr-Edge-OCR系统，在包含54种语言的双重人工标注数据集上比较5种LVLM和2种传统OCR系统的性能，涵盖准确性、语义一致性、语言覆盖、计算效率和部署成本等多个指标

Result: Qwen获得最高精度(0.54)，Sprinklr-Edge-OCR获得最佳F1分数(0.46)，处理速度比LVLM快35倍(平均每图0.17秒)，成本仅为LVLM的0.01(每1000张图0.006美元)

Conclusion: 在边缘部署环境中，传统OCR系统由于低计算需求、低延迟和高性价比，仍然是比大型语言模型更优的选择

Abstract: Optical Character Recognition (OCR) in multilingual, noisy, and diverse
real-world images remains a significant challenge for optical character
recognition systems. With the rise of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs),
there is growing interest in their ability to generalize and reason beyond
fixed OCR pipelines. In this work, we introduce Sprinklr-Edge-OCR, a novel OCR
system built specifically optimized for edge deployment in resource-constrained
environments. We present a large-scale comparative evaluation of five
state-of-the-art LVLMs (InternVL, Qwen, GOT OCR, LLaMA, MiniCPM) and two
traditional OCR systems (Sprinklr-Edge-OCR, SuryaOCR) on a proprietary, doubly
hand annotated dataset of multilingual (54 languages) images. Our benchmark
covers a broad range of metrics including accuracy, semantic consistency,
language coverage, computational efficiency (latency, memory, GPU usage), and
deployment cost. To better reflect real-world applicability, we also conducted
edge case deployment analysis, evaluating model performance on CPU only
environments. Among the results, Qwen achieved the highest precision (0.54),
while Sprinklr-Edge-OCR delivered the best overall F1 score (0.46) and
outperformed others in efficiency, processing images 35 faster (0.17 seconds
per image on average) and at less than 0.01 of the cost (0.006 USD per 1,000
images) compared to LVLM. Our findings demonstrate that the most optimal OCR
systems for edge deployment are the traditional ones even in the era of LLMs
due to their low compute requirements, low latency, and very high
affordability.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM作为评估器存在自偏好偏差，本文通过轻量级导向向量在推理时缓解该问题，可减少97%的不合理自偏好，但在合理自偏好和公正评估方面不稳定。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型作为自动评估器时存在自偏好偏差，倾向于偏爱自己的输出，这影响了评估的公平性和可靠性，特别是在偏好调优和模型路由等任务中。

Method: 构建区分合理和不合理自偏好的数据集，使用对比激活加法(CAA)和基于优化的方法构建导向向量，在推理时进行干预而不需要重新训练。

Result: 导向向量可将不合理自偏好偏差减少高达97%，显著优于提示和直接偏好优化基线方法，但在合理自偏好和无偏一致判断方面表现不稳定。

Conclusion: 导向向量作为LLM评估的安全措施具有潜力但也存在局限，自偏好可能涉及多个或非线性方向，需要更鲁棒的干预方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly serve as automated evaluators, yet
they suffer from "self-preference bias": a tendency to favor their own outputs
over those of other models. This bias undermines fairness and reliability in
evaluation pipelines, particularly for tasks like preference tuning and model
routing. We investigate whether lightweight steering vectors can mitigate this
problem at inference time without retraining. We introduce a curated dataset
that distinguishes self-preference bias into justified examples of
self-preference and unjustified examples of self-preference, and we construct
steering vectors using two methods: Contrastive Activation Addition (CAA) and
an optimization-based approach. Our results show that steering vectors can
reduce unjustified self-preference bias by up to 97\%, substantially
outperforming prompting and direct preference optimization baselines. Yet
steering vectors are unstable on legitimate self-preference and unbiased
agreement, implying self-preference spans multiple or nonlinear directions.
This underscores both their promise and limits as safeguards for LLM-as-judges
and motivates more robust interventions.

TL;DR: 研究探索SNOMED CT概念共现模式与嵌入语义相似度的关系，发现两者弱相关但互补，嵌入能捕获临床意义关联并辅助概念标注完善。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床笔记的非结构化格式限制了大规模分析，标准化术语如SNOMED CT提高了互操作性，但概念间的共现和语义相似性关系尚未充分探索。

Method: 利用MIMIC-IV数据库，使用标准化点互信息(NPMI)和预训练嵌入(ClinicalBERT、BioBERT)分析概念共现模式与语义相似度的关系，并研究时间演变和专科差异。

Result: 共现与语义相似度弱相关；嵌入能捕获文档频率未反映的临床关联；嵌入建议的概念常与后续文档匹配；概念嵌入聚类产生连贯临床主题；共现模式与死亡率和再入院等结局相关。

Conclusion: 共现统计和语义嵌入具有互补价值，可提高文档完整性、发现潜在临床关系，为决策支持和表型应用提供信息。

Abstract: Clinical notes contain rich clinical narratives but their unstructured format
poses challenges for large-scale analysis. Standardized terminologies such as
SNOMED CT improve interoperability, yet understanding how concepts relate
through co-occurrence and semantic similarity remains underexplored. In this
study, we leverage the MIMIC-IV database to investigate the relationship
between SNOMED CT concept co-occurrence patterns and embedding-based semantic
similarity. Using Normalized Pointwise Mutual Information (NPMI) and pretrained
embeddings (e.g., ClinicalBERT, BioBERT), we examine whether frequently
co-occurring concepts are also semantically close, whether embeddings can
suggest missing concepts, and how these relationships evolve temporally and
across specialties. Our analyses reveal that while co-occurrence and semantic
similarity are weakly correlated, embeddings capture clinically meaningful
associations not always reflected in documentation frequency. Embedding-based
suggestions frequently matched concepts later documented, supporting their
utility for augmenting clinical annotations. Clustering of concept embeddings
yielded coherent clinical themes (symptoms, labs, diagnoses, cardiovascular
conditions) that map to patient phenotypes and care patterns. Finally,
co-occurrence patterns linked to outcomes such as mortality and readmission
demonstrate the practical utility of this approach. Collectively, our findings
highlight the complementary value of co-occurrence statistics and semantic
embeddings in improving documentation completeness, uncovering latent clinical
relationships, and informing decision support and phenotyping applications.

Motivation: 解决跨目标和跨领域的立场检测问题，传统方法在新目标领域表现不佳，需要能够从新领域获取有用示例的适应性方法

Method: 使用度量学习和三元组损失来捕捉立场目标之间的语义相似性和差异，构建判别性嵌入空间以增强领域适应性

Result: 在两个数据集的多个跨目标和跨域场景中评估，在六个广泛使用的立场检测模型上显示出统计显著的性能提升

Conclusion: MLSD方法通过度量学习有效提升了跨域立场检测的性能，证明了其在领域适应方面的有效性

Abstract: We present the novel approach for stance detection across domains and
targets, Metric Learning-Based Few-Shot Learning for Cross-Target and
Cross-Domain Stance Detection (MLSD). MLSD utilizes metric learning with
triplet loss to capture semantic similarities and differences between stance
targets, enhancing domain adaptation. By constructing a discriminative
embedding space, MLSD allows a cross-target or cross-domain stance detection
model to acquire useful examples from new target domains. We evaluate MLSD in
multiple cross-target and cross-domain scenarios across two datasets, showing
statistically significant improvement in stance detection performance across
six widely used stance detection models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了SiLVERScore，一种基于语义感知嵌入的手语生成评估指标，直接在联合嵌入空间中评估手语，避免了传统回译方法的两步评估流程带来的模糊性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的手语生成评估采用回译方法，将生成的手语先识别回文本再与参考文本比较，这种方法无法捕捉手语的多模态特性（如面部表情、空间语法、韵律），且难以区分评估错误是来自生成模型还是翻译系统。

Method: 提出SiLVERScore指标，在联合嵌入空间中进行语义感知评估，能够处理语义和韵律变化，并探索跨数据集的泛化挑战。

Result: 在PHOENIX-14T和CSL-Daily数据集上，SiLVERScore在区分正确和随机对方面达到近乎完美的性能（ROC AUC = 0.99，重叠率 < 7%），显著优于传统指标。

Conclusion: SiLVERScore提供了一个更准确、更直接的手语生成评估方法，能够更好地捕捉手语的多模态特性，解决了传统回译评估方法的局限性。

Abstract: Evaluating sign language generation is often done through back-translation,
where generated signs are first recognized back to text and then compared to a
reference using text-based metrics. However, this two-step evaluation pipeline
introduces ambiguity: it not only fails to capture the multimodal nature of
sign language-such as facial expressions, spatial grammar, and prosody-but also
makes it hard to pinpoint whether evaluation errors come from sign generation
model or the translation system used to assess it. In this work, we propose
SiLVERScore, a novel semantically-aware embedding-based evaluation metric that
assesses sign language generation in a joint embedding space. Our contributions
include: (1) identifying limitations of existing metrics, (2) introducing
SiLVERScore for semantically-aware evaluation, (3) demonstrating its robustness
to semantic and prosodic variations, and (4) exploring generalization
challenges across datasets. On PHOENIX-14T and CSL-Daily datasets, SiLVERScore
achieves near-perfect discrimination between correct and random pairs (ROC AUC
= 0.99, overlap < 7%), substantially outperforming traditional metrics.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个四指标套件来评估视觉语言模型在交互式指称游戏中的表现，发现现有模型与人类模式存在显著差异，任务成功分数不能反映成功的基础建立。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基准测试主要在单轮或问答设置中评估视觉语言模型，但基础建立是一个交互过程，需要通过持续沟通逐步达成共同理解。

Method: 引入四指标套件（基础效率、内容对齐、词汇适应和人类相似度），在150个自玩交互式指称游戏会话中评估三个专有VLM，并与人类二人组进行比较。

Result: 所有三个模型至少在三个指标上与人类模式存在差异，GPT4o-mini最接近人类表现。任务成功分数不能指示成功的基础建立，高图像-话语对齐不一定预测任务成功。

Conclusion: 该指标套件为未来VLM基础建立研究提供了框架，揭示了当前模型在交互式基础建立方面的局限性。

Abstract: Large vision language models (VLMs) increasingly claim reasoning skills, yet
current benchmarks evaluate them in single-turn or question answering settings.
However, grounding is an interactive process in which people gradually develop
shared understanding through ongoing communication. We introduce a four-metric
suite (grounding efficiency, content alignment, lexical adaptation, and
human-likeness) to systematically evaluate VLM performance in interactive
grounding contexts. We deploy the suite on 150 self-play sessions of
interactive referential games between three proprietary VLMs and compare them
with human dyads. All three models diverge from human patterns on at least
three metrics, while GPT4o-mini is the closest overall. We find that (i) task
success scores do not indicate successful grounding and (ii) high
image-utterance alignment does not necessarily predict task success. Our metric
suite and findings offer a framework for future research on VLM grounding.

Motivation: 大型语言模型(LLMs)带来了文档级机器翻译的新时代，但现有的评估方法假设句子级对齐，无法有效评估整篇文档的输出质量。

Method: 1) Align阶段：自动推断句子级源-目标对应关系，重建目标文本以匹配源语句数量；2) n-Chunk滑动评估阶段：计算1-4个chunk的平均度量分数进行多粒度评估

Result: 在WMT基准测试中与专家MQM排名的Pearson相关性达到0.929；在新构建的真实测试集上与人工判断高度一致；可用于CPO训练和GRPO奖励模型，优于普通SFT基线

Conclusion: 该框架为文档级机器翻译系统提供了准确、稳健且可操作的评估工具

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have ushered in a new era for document-level
machine translation (\textit{doc}-mt), yet their whole-document outputs
challenge existing evaluation methods that assume sentence-by-sentence
alignment. We introduce \textit{\textbf{Align-then-Slide}}, a complete
evaluation framework for ultra-long doc-mt. In the Align stage, we
automatically infer sentence-level source-target correspondences and rebuild
the target to match the source sentence number, resolving omissions and
many-to-one/one-to-many mappings. In the n-Chunk Sliding Evaluate stage, we
calculate averaged metric scores under 1-, 2-, 3- and 4-chunk for
multi-granularity assessment. Experiments on the WMT benchmark show a Pearson
correlation of 0.929 between our method with expert MQM rankings. On a newly
curated real-world test set, our method again aligns closely with human
judgments. Furthermore, preference data produced by Align-then-Slide enables
effective CPO training and its direct use as a reward model for GRPO, both
yielding translations preferred over a vanilla SFT baseline. The results
validate our framework as an accurate, robust, and actionable evaluation tool
for doc-mt systems.

Motivation: 传统的句子级音频深度伪造检测无法实现帧级定位，而现有的部分音频深度伪造检测方法在利用音频语义信息（特别是命名实体）方面研究不足。

Method: 提出NE-PADD方法，包含两个并行分支：语音命名实体识别(SpeechNER)和PADD检测，采用注意力融合(AF)和注意力转移(AT)两种注意力聚合机制，通过辅助损失利用命名实体语义指导检测。

Result: 在PartialSpoof-NER数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于现有基线方法，证明了整合命名实体知识在PADD中的有效性。

Conclusion: NE-PADD通过有效利用命名实体知识，显著提升了部分音频深度伪造检测的性能，为音频伪造检测提供了新的语义增强思路。

Abstract: Different from traditional sentence-level audio deepfake detection (ADD),
partial audio deepfake detection (PADD) requires frame-level positioning of the
location of fake speech. While some progress has been made in this area,
leveraging semantic information from audio, especially named entities, remains
an underexplored aspect. To this end, we propose NE-PADD, a novel method for
Partial Audio Deepfake Detection (PADD) that leverages named entity knowledge
through two parallel branches: Speech Name Entity Recognition (SpeechNER) and
PADD. The approach incorporates two attention aggregation mechanisms: Attention
Fusion (AF) for combining attention weights and Attention Transfer (AT) for
guiding PADD with named entity semantics using an auxiliary loss. Built on the
PartialSpoof-NER dataset, experiments show our method outperforms existing
baselines, proving the effectiveness of integrating named entity knowledge in
PADD. The code is available at https://github.com/AI-S2-Lab/NE-PADD.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了Drivelology（废话学）概念，指语法连贯但语用矛盾、情感丰富或修辞颠覆的独特语言现象。研究发现当前大语言模型无法理解这种深层语义，构建了包含1200多个多语言样本的数据集进行验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型虽然在许多NLP任务上表现出色，但在理解具有深层隐含意义的Drivelological文本方面存在明显局限，需要探究这种语用理解能力的缺失。

Method: 构建包含英语、中文、西班牙语、法语、日语和韩语的1200多个精心筛选的Drivelology样本数据集，经过多轮专家评审和裁决。评估多种LLM在分类、生成和推理任务上的表现。

Result: LLM经常将Drivelology与浅层无意义内容混淆，产生不连贯的辩解，或完全忽略隐含的修辞功能，显示出在语用理解方面存在深层的表征差距。

Conclusion: 统计流畅性并不等同于认知理解能力，LLM在理解超越表面连贯性的语言深度方面存在根本性局限，需要进一步研究如何建模这种深层语言理解。

Abstract: We introduce Drivelology, a unique linguistic phenomenon characterised as
"nonsense with depth", utterances that are syntactically coherent yet
pragmatically paradoxical, emotionally loaded, or rhetorically subversive.
While such expressions may resemble surface-level nonsense, they encode
implicit meaning requiring contextual inference, moral reasoning, or emotional
interpretation. We find that current large language models (LLMs), despite
excelling at many natural language processing (NLP) tasks, consistently fail to
grasp the layered semantics of Drivelological text. To investigate this, we
construct a small but diverse benchmark dataset of over 1,200 meticulously
curated examples, with select instances in English, Mandarin, Spanish, French,
Japanese, and Korean. Annotation was especially challenging: each of the
examples required careful expert review to verify that it truly reflected
Drivelological characteristics. The process involved multiple rounds of
discussion and adjudication to address disagreements, highlighting the subtle
and subjective nature of the Drivelology. We evaluate a range of LLMs on
classification, generation, and reasoning tasks. Our results reveal clear
limitations of LLMs: models often confuse Drivelology with shallow nonsense,
produce incoherent justifications, or miss the implied rhetorical function
altogether. These findings highlight a deeper representational gap in LLMs'
pragmatic understanding and challenge the assumption that statistical fluency
implies cognitive comprehension. We release our dataset and code to facilitate
further research in modelling linguistic depth beyond surface-level coherence.

Motivation: 尽管链推理技术提升了LLM的性能，但对其如何影响模型可信过性的理解仍不充分，需要系统性评估。

Method: 采用调查研究方法，按时间序结构化分析最新的链推理研究成果，包括方法、发现和限制。

Conclusion: 该研究为AI安全社区提供了有价值的资源，帮助了解链推理可信过性的最新进展，并指出了未来研究方向。

Abstract: The development of Long-CoT reasoning has advanced LLM performance across
various tasks, including language understanding, complex problem solving, and
code generation. This paradigm enables models to generate intermediate
reasoning steps, thereby improving both accuracy and interpretability. However,
despite these advancements, a comprehensive understanding of how CoT-based
reasoning affects the trustworthiness of language models remains
underdeveloped. In this paper, we survey recent work on reasoning models and
CoT techniques, focusing on five core dimensions of trustworthy reasoning:
truthfulness, safety, robustness, fairness, and privacy. For each aspect, we
provide a clear and structured overview of recent studies in chronological
order, along with detailed analyses of their methodologies, findings, and
limitations. Future research directions are also appended at the end for
reference and discussion. Overall, while reasoning techniques hold promise for
enhancing model trustworthiness through hallucination mitigation, harmful
content detection, and robustness improvement, cutting-edge reasoning models
themselves often suffer from comparable or even greater vulnerabilities in
safety, robustness, and privacy. By synthesizing these insights, we hope this
work serves as a valuable and timely resource for the AI safety community to
stay informed on the latest progress in reasoning trustworthiness. A full list

<details>

Motivation: 大型语言模型可能遵循有害指令，尽管现有研究使用探测方法来检测恶意输入，但作者发现这些方法在分布外性能表现不佳，怀疑其学习的是表面模式而非语义有害性

Method: 通过对照实验系统验证假设：首先比较简单n-gram方法的性能，然后使用语义清理的数据集进行控制实验，最后详细分析模式依赖性

Result: 确认了假设：探测方法学习的是指令模式和触发词等表面模式，而不是真正的语义有害性，这导致了虚假的安全感

Conclusion: 当前基于探测的安全检测方法存在根本缺陷，需要重新设计模型和评估协议，为负责任的研究方向提供建议

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can comply with harmful instructions, raising
serious safety concerns despite their impressive capabilities. Recent work has
leveraged probing-based approaches to study the separability of malicious and
benign inputs in LLMs' internal representations, and researchers have proposed
using such probing methods for safety detection. We systematically re-examine
this paradigm. Motivated by poor out-of-distribution performance, we
hypothesize that probes learn superficial patterns rather than semantic
harmfulness. Through controlled experiments, we confirm this hypothesis and
identify the specific patterns learned: instructional patterns and trigger
words. Our investigation follows a systematic approach, progressing from
demonstrating comparable performance of simple n-gram methods, to controlled
experiments with semantically cleaned datasets, to detailed analysis of pattern
dependencies. These results reveal a false sense of security around current
probing-based approaches and highlight the need to redesign both models and
evaluation protocols, for which we provide further discussions in the hope of
suggesting responsible further research in this direction. We have open-sourced
the project at https://github.com/WangCheng0116/Why-Probe-Fails.

Abstract: Smartphones have become indispensable in people's daily lives, permeating
nearly every aspect of modern society. With the continuous advancement of large
language models (LLMs), numerous LLM-based mobile agents have emerged. These
agents are capable of accurately parsing diverse user queries and automatically
assisting users in completing complex or repetitive operations. However,
current agents 1) heavily rely on the comprehension ability of LLMs, which can
lead to errors caused by misoperations or omitted steps during tasks, 2) lack
interaction with the external environment, often terminating tasks when an app
cannot fulfill user queries, and 3) lack memory capabilities, requiring each
instruction to reconstruct the interface and being unable to learn from and
correct previous mistakes. To alleviate the above issues, we propose MobileRAG,
a mobile agents framework enhanced by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG),
which includes InterRAG, LocalRAG, and MemRAG. It leverages RAG to more quickly
and accurately identify user queries and accomplish complex and long-sequence
mobile tasks. Additionally, to more comprehensively assess the performance of
MobileRAG, we introduce MobileRAG-Eval, a more challenging benchmark
characterized by numerous complex, real-world mobile tasks that require
external knowledge assistance. Extensive experimental results on MobileRAG-Eval
demonstrate that MobileRAG can easily handle real-world mobile tasks, achieving
10.3\% improvement over state-of-the-art methods with fewer operational steps.

Abstract: Complex Question Answering (QA) is a fundamental and challenging task in NLP.
While large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive performance in QA, they
suffer from significant performance degradation when facing complex and
abstract QA tasks due to insufficient reasoning capabilities. Works such as
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tree-of-Thought (ToT) aim to enhance LLMs' reasoning
abilities, but they face issues such as in-layer redundancy in tree structures
and single paths in chain structures. Although some studies utilize
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods to assist LLMs in reasoning, the
challenge of effectively utilizing large amounts of information involving
multiple entities and hops remains critical. To address this, we propose the
Matrix of Thought (MoT), a novel and efficient LLM thought structure. MoT
explores the problem in both horizontal and vertical dimensions through the
"column-cell communication" mechanism, enabling LLMs to actively engage in
multi-strategy and deep-level thinking, reducing redundancy within the column
cells and enhancing reasoning capabilities. Furthermore, we develop a
fact-correction mechanism by constructing knowledge units from retrieved
knowledge graph triples and raw text to enhance the initial knowledge for LLM
reasoning and correct erroneous answers. This leads to the development of an
efficient and accurate QA framework (MTQA). Experimental results show that our
framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods on four widely-used datasets in
terms of F1 and EM scores, with reasoning time only 14.4\% of the baseline
methods, demonstrating both its efficiency and accuracy. The code for this
framework is available at https://github.com/lyfiter/mtqa.

TL;DR: KPoEM是一个新的韩国诗歌情感分析数据集，包含7,662条多标签情感注释，使用韩语模型细调后在情感分类任务上显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大语言模型在文本情感分类方面取得了显著进步，但诗歌特别是韩国诗歌因其比喻性语言和文化特定性而研究不足。

Method: 构建了7,662条多标签情感数据集，包括7,007条行级和615条作品级注释，使用44个细粒度情感类别。采用顺序细调方法：先在通用语料上细调，然后在KPoEM数据集上细调。

Result: 基于KPoEM数据集细调的韩语模型显著超过了之前的模型，F1-micro指标从0.34提升到0.60。模型能够识别时间和文化特定的情感表达，同时保留现代韩国诗歌的核心情感。

Conclusion: 该研究平求了计算方法与文学分析，通过结构化数据实现了对诗歌情感的定量探索，为保留韩国文学情感和文化细节的研究开启了新可能性。

Abstract: This study introduces KPoEM (Korean Poetry Emotion Mapping) , a novel dataset
for computational emotion analysis in modern Korean poetry. Despite remarkable
progress in text-based emotion classification using large language models,
poetry-particularly Korean poetry-remains underexplored due to its figurative
language and cultural specificity. We built a multi-label emotion dataset of
7,662 entries, including 7,007 line-level entries from 483 poems and 615
work-level entries, annotated with 44 fine-grained emotion categories from five
influential Korean poets. A state-of-the-art Korean language model fine-tuned
on this dataset significantly outperformed previous models, achieving 0.60
F1-micro compared to 0.34 from models trained on general corpora. The KPoEM
model, trained through sequential fine-tuning-first on general corpora and then
on the KPoEM dataset-demonstrates not only an enhanced ability to identify
temporally and culturally specific emotional expressions, but also a strong
capacity to preserve the core sentiments of modern Korean poetry. This study
bridges computational methods and literary analysis, presenting new
possibilities for the quantitative exploration of poetic emotions through
structured data that faithfully retains the emotional and cultural nuances of
Korean literature.

TL;DR: SelfAug是一种自分布对齐方法，通过在RAG微调中保持模型语义分布来缓解灾难性遗忘，在保持通用能力的同时提升下游任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有监督微调方法在RAG场景中虽然能提升任务特定性能，但会导致灾难性遗忘问题，使模型失去原有知识和通用能力。现有解决方案要么需要通用指令数据，要么在保持模型原始分布方面存在局限。

Method: 提出SelfAug自分布对齐方法，通过将输入序列logits对齐来保持模型的语义分布，从而缓解灾难性遗忘并改善下游性能。

Result: 大量实验表明SelfAug在下游学习和通用能力保持之间实现了优越的平衡。实证分析揭示了分布偏移与RAG场景中灾难性遗忘严重程度之间的直接相关性。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅推进了对RAG背景下灾难性遗忘的理解，还提供了一个适用于各种微调场景的实用解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized
natural language processing through their remarkable capabilities in
understanding and executing diverse tasks. While supervised fine-tuning,
particularly in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) scenarios, effectively
enhances task-specific performance, it often leads to catastrophic forgetting,
where models lose their previously acquired knowledge and general capabilities.
Existing solutions either require access to general instruction data or face
limitations in preserving the model's original distribution. To overcome these
limitations, we propose SelfAug, a self-distribution alignment method that
aligns input sequence logits to preserve the model's semantic distribution,
thereby mitigating catastrophic forgetting and improving downstream
performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SelfAug achieves a superior
balance between downstream learning and general capability retention. Our
comprehensive empirical analysis reveals a direct correlation between
distribution shifts and the severity of catastrophic forgetting in RAG
scenarios, highlighting how the absence of RAG capabilities in general
instruction tuning leads to significant distribution shifts during fine-tuning.
Our findings not only advance the understanding of catastrophic forgetting in
RAG contexts but also provide a practical solution applicable across diverse
fine-tuning scenarios. Our code is publicly available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SPFT-SQL是一种针对Text-to-SQL任务的自博弈微调方法，通过验证驱动的迭代微调和错误驱动损失机制，解决了传统SPIN方法在SQL生成中的局限性，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自博弈微调(SPIN)在Text-to-SQL任务中存在局限性：无法生成新信息，且对手模型产生的大量正确SQL查询会降低主模型生成准确SQL的能力。

Method: 提出SPFT-SQL方法：1）自博弈前采用基于验证的迭代微调，根据数据库模式和验证反馈迭代合成高质量微调数据；2）自博弈阶段引入错误驱动损失机制，激励对手模型的错误输出，帮助主模型区分正确和错误SQL。

Result: 在6个开源大语言模型和5个广泛使用的基准测试上的实验表明，该方法优于现有的最先进方法。

Conclusion: SPFT-SQL方法有效解决了Text-to-SQL任务中自博弈微调的挑战，通过创新的验证迭代机制和错误驱动策略显著提升了SQL生成准确性。

Abstract: Despite the significant advancements of self-play fine-tuning (SPIN), which
can transform a weak large language model (LLM) into a strong one through
competitive interactions between models of varying capabilities, it still faces
challenges in the Text-to-SQL task. SPIN does not generate new information, and
the large number of correct SQL queries produced by the opponent model during
self-play reduces the main model's ability to generate accurate SQL queries. To
address this challenge, we propose a new self-play fine-tuning method tailored
for the Text-to-SQL task, called SPFT-SQL. Prior to self-play, we introduce a
verification-based iterative fine-tuning approach, which synthesizes
high-quality fine-tuning data iteratively based on the database schema and
validation feedback to enhance model performance, while building a model base
with varying capabilities. During the self-play fine-tuning phase, we propose
an error-driven loss method that incentivizes incorrect outputs from the
opponent model, enabling the main model to distinguish between correct SQL and
erroneous SQL generated by the opponent model, thereby improving its ability to
generate correct SQL. Extensive experiments and in-depth analyses on six
open-source LLMs and five widely used benchmarks demonstrate that our approach
outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前角色扮演对话代理研究主要关注文本模态，忽视了语音中的副语言特征（语调、韵律、节奏），且缺乏标准化的评估基准，现有数据集无法有效量化模型在长期角色一致性等核心能力上的表现。

Method: 提出了一个新颖的两阶段自动化流程：首先将电影音频与剧本对齐，然后使用LLM为每个角色系统性地构建多维角色档案，从而创建VoxRole基准数据集。

Result: 构建了包含13335个多轮对话、65.6小时语音、1228个独特角色的综合基准，并利用该基准对当代语音对话模型进行了多维评估，揭示了它们在保持角色一致性方面的优势和局限。

Conclusion: VoxRole填补了语音角色扮演领域长期缺乏标准化评估基准的关键空白，为评估基于语音的角色扮演对话代理提供了首个全面资源，有助于推动该领域的发展。

Abstract: Recent significant advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have greatly
propelled the development of Role-Playing Conversational Agents (RPCAs). These
systems aim to create immersive user experiences through consistent persona
adoption. However, current RPCA research faces dual limitations. First,
existing work predominantly focuses on the textual modality, entirely
overlooking critical paralinguistic features including intonation, prosody, and
rhythm in speech, which are essential for conveying character emotions and
shaping vivid identities. Second, the speech-based role-playing domain suffers
from a long-standing lack of standardized evaluation benchmarks. Most current
spoken dialogue datasets target only fundamental capability assessments,
featuring thinly sketched or ill-defined character profiles. Consequently, they
fail to effectively quantify model performance on core competencies like
long-term persona consistency. To address this critical gap, we introduce
VoxRole, the first comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for the
evaluation of speech-based RPCAs. The benchmark comprises 13335 multi-turn
dialogues, totaling 65.6 hours of speech from 1228 unique characters across 261
movies. To construct this resource, we propose a novel two-stage automated
pipeline that first aligns movie audio with scripts and subsequently employs an
LLM to systematically build multi-dimensional profiles for each character.
Leveraging VoxRole, we conduct a multi-dimensional evaluation of contemporary
spoken dialogue models, revealing crucial insights into their respective
strengths and limitations in maintaining persona consistency.

Motivation: 评估大型语言模型在中文虚假信息事实核查方面的能力和局限性，尽管LLMs使用日益广泛但其事实核查效果仍不确定

Method: 构建CANDY基准数据集（约20k标注实例），使用思维链推理和少样本提示技术评估LLMs，开发分类法分析错误解释

Result: 当前LLMs在生成准确事实核查结论方面存在局限，即使使用增强技术；事实捏造是最常见的失败模式；LLMs作为辅助工具可显著提升人类表现

Conclusion: LLMs单独用于事实核查不可靠，但作为人类辅助工具具有巨大潜力；提供了公开数据集和代码供进一步研究

Abstract: The effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) to fact-check
misinformation remains uncertain, despite their growing use. To this end, we
present CANDY, a benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the capabilities
and limitations of LLMs in fact-checking Chinese misinformation. Specifically,
we curate a carefully annotated dataset of ~20k instances. Our analysis shows
that current LLMs exhibit limitations in generating accurate fact-checking
conclusions, even when enhanced with chain-of-thought reasoning and few-shot
prompting. To understand these limitations, we develop a taxonomy to categorize
flawed LLM-generated explanations for their conclusions and identify factual
fabrication as the most common failure mode. Although LLMs alone are unreliable
for fact-checking, our findings indicate their considerable potential to
augment human performance when deployed as assistive tools in scenarios. Our
dataset and code can be accessed at https://github.com/SCUNLP/CANDY

Motivation: 大语言模型在极低资源语言上效果差，特别是缘于危险语言如拉丁语，缺乏高质量NLP数据集，影响语言技术发展

Method: 利用少量并行拉丁语-意大利语句对，通过翻译单语意大利语数据制造合成数据集，应用严格过滤和反向翻译确保语言质量

Result: 制造出首个公开的拉丁语情感分析和多选题答案数据集，并在意大利语-拉丁语机器翻译中实现了显著攻改

Conclusion: 为不充分代表的拉丁语建立了基础资源，支持更广泛的NLP研究和下游应用，为极低资源语言提供了数据集制造的有效方法

Abstract: The effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) diminishes for extremely
low-resource languages, such as indigenous languages, primarily due to the lack
of labeled data. Despite growing interest, the availability of high-quality
natural language processing (NLP) datasets for these languages remains limited,
making it difficult to develop robust language technologies. This paper
addresses such gap by focusing on Ladin, an endangered Romance language,
specifically targeting the Val Badia variant. Leveraging a small set of
parallel Ladin-Italian sentence pairs, we create synthetic datasets for
sentiment analysis and multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) by translating
monolingual Italian data. To ensure linguistic quality and reliability, we
apply rigorous filtering and back-translation procedures in our method. We
further demonstrate that incorporating these synthetic datasets into machine
translation training leads to substantial improvements over existing
Italian-Ladin translation baselines. Our contributions include the first
publicly available sentiment analysis and MCQA datasets for Ladin, establishing
foundational resources that can support broader NLP research and downstream
applications for this underrepresented language.

TL;DR: RTQA是一个新颖的时序知识图谱问答框架，通过递归分解问题、自底向上求解和多路径答案聚合，显著提升了复杂时序查询的处理能力，在多个基准测试中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有TKGQA方法主要关注隐式时序约束，缺乏处理复杂时序查询的能力，且在分解框架中存在推理能力有限和错误传播问题。

Method: RTQA包含三个核心组件：时序问题分解器、递归求解器和答案聚合器。采用递归思维将问题分解为子问题，使用LLMs和TKG知识自底向上求解，并通过多路径聚合提高容错性。

Result: 在MultiTQ和TimelineKGQA基准测试中，RTQA在"Multiple"和"Complex"类别上实现了显著的Hits@1提升，优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: RTQA框架无需训练即可增强时序知识图谱的推理能力，有效解决了复杂时序查询处理的挑战，为TKGQA领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Current temporal knowledge graph question answering (TKGQA) methods primarily
focus on implicit temporal constraints, lacking the capability of handling more
complex temporal queries, and struggle with limited reasoning abilities and
error propagation in decomposition frameworks. We propose RTQA, a novel
framework to address these challenges by enhancing reasoning over TKGs without
requiring training. Following recursive thinking, RTQA recursively decomposes
questions into sub-problems, solves them bottom-up using LLMs and TKG
knowledge, and employs multi-path answer aggregation to improve fault
tolerance. RTQA consists of three core components: the Temporal Question
Decomposer, the Recursive Solver, and the Answer Aggregator. Experiments on
MultiTQ and TimelineKGQA benchmarks demonstrate significant Hits@1 improvements
in "Multiple" and "Complex" categories, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 评估大型语言模型在真实世界应用中面对语言变异性时的鲁棒性，检验基准测试是否能可靠衡量模型能力。

Method: 系统性地为6个常见基准测试的所有问题生成多种重述版本，测试34个不同规模和性能的最先进LLM在这些重述输入下的表现变化。

Result: LLM排名相对稳定，但绝对性能分数显著下降，表明模型对语言变异性处理能力不足。

Conclusion: 基准测试分数不能完全反映模型对真实世界输入变化的鲁棒性，需要开发更能反映实际部署场景的鲁棒性感知基准测试。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) effectiveness is usually evaluated by means of
benchmarks such as MMLU, ARC-C, or HellaSwag, where questions are presented in
their original wording, thus in a fixed, standardized format. However,
real-world applications involve linguistic variability, requiring models to
maintain their effectiveness across diverse rewordings of the same question or
query. In this study, we systematically assess the robustness of LLMs to
paraphrased benchmark questions and investigate whether benchmark-based
evaluations provide a reliable measure of model capabilities. We systematically
generate various paraphrases of all the questions across six different common
benchmarks, and measure the resulting variations in effectiveness of 34
state-of-the-art LLMs, of different size and effectiveness. Our findings reveal
that while LLM rankings remain relatively stable across paraphrased inputs,
absolute effectiveness scores change, and decline significantly. This suggests
that LLMs struggle with linguistic variability, raising concerns about their
generalization abilities and evaluation methodologies. Furthermore, the
observed performance drop challenges the reliability of benchmark-based
evaluations, indicating that high benchmark scores may not fully capture a
model's robustness to real-world input variations. We discuss the implications
of these findings for LLM evaluation methodologies, emphasizing the need for
robustness-aware benchmarks that better reflect practical deployment scenarios.

Abstract: Systemic Functional Grammar and its branch, Cardiff Grammar, have been widely
applied to discourse analysis, semantic function research, and other tasks
across various languages and texts. However, an automatic annotation system
based on this theory for Chinese texts has not yet been developed, which
significantly constrains the application and promotion of relevant theories. To
fill this gap, this research introduces a functional syntax annotation model
for Chinese based on RoBERTa (Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach).
The study randomly selected 4,100 sentences from the People's Daily 2014 corpus
and annotated them according to functional syntax theory to establish a dataset
for training. The study then fine-tuned the RoBERTa-Chinese wwm-ext model based
on the dataset to implement the named entity recognition task, achieving an F1
score of 0.852 on the test set that significantly outperforms other comparative
models. The model demonstrated excellent performance in identifying core
syntactic elements such as Subject (S), Main Verb (M), and Complement (C).
Nevertheless, there remains room for improvement in recognizing entities with
imbalanced label samples. As the first integration of functional syntax with
attention-based NLP models, this research provides a new method for automated
Chinese functional syntax analysis and lays a solid foundation for subsequent
studies.

Abstract: Enhancing the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) to interpret sheet music is a crucial step toward
building AI musicians. However, current research lacks both evaluation
benchmarks and training data for sheet music reasoning. To address this, we
propose the idea of synthesizing sheet music problems grounded in music theory,
which can serve both as evaluation benchmarks and as training data for
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). We introduce a data
synthesis framework that generates verifiable sheet music questions in both
textual and visual modalities, leading to the Synthetic Sheet Music Reasoning
Benchmark (SSMR-Bench) and a complementary training set. Evaluation results on
SSMR-Bench show the importance of models' reasoning abilities in interpreting
sheet music. At the same time, the poor performance of Gemini 2.5-Pro
highlights the challenges that MLLMs still face in interpreting sheet music in
a visual format. By leveraging synthetic data for RLVR, Qwen3-8B-Base and
Qwen2.5-VL-Instruct achieve improvements on the SSMR-Bench. Besides, the
trained Qwen3-8B-Base surpasses GPT-4 in overall performance on
MusicTheoryBench and achieves reasoning performance comparable to GPT-4 with
the strategies of Role play and Chain-of-Thought. Notably, its performance on
math problems also improves relative to the original Qwen3-8B-Base.
Furthermore, our results show that the enhanced reasoning ability can also
facilitate music composition. In conclusion, we are the first to propose the
idea of synthesizing sheet music problems based on music theory rules, and
demonstrate its effectiveness not only in advancing model reasoning for sheet
music understanding but also in unlocking new possibilities for AI-assisted

TL;DR: 对阿拉伯语教育聊天机器人的现状调查，发现相比英语等其他语言，阿拉伯语教育聊天机器人采用现代技术较少，存在研究空白


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI和NLP技术的发展，聊天机器人在教育等领域应用日益广泛，特别是在COVID-19疫情后远程教育需求增加。但阿拉伯语教育聊天机器人的发展相对滞后

Method: 采用文献调查方法，分析现有阿拉伯语教育聊天机器人的特点，包括采用的方法、语言变体和性能评估指标

Result: 发现尽管聊天机器人在其他语言中取得成功，但阿拉伯语教育聊天机器人使用现代技术（如BERT、GPT等大语言模型）的案例很少

Conclusion: 指出了该领域的研究空白，并讨论了未来的研究方向，建议加强阿拉伯语教育聊天机器人的现代技术应用研究

Abstract: The recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) in general, and in
Natural Language Processing (NLP) in particular, and some of its applications
such as chatbots, have led to their implementation in different domains like
education, healthcare, tourism, and customer service. Since the COVID-19
pandemic, there has been an increasing interest in these digital technologies
to allow and enhance remote access. In education, e-learning systems have been
massively adopted worldwide. The emergence of Large Language Models (LLM) such
as BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and GPT
(Generative Pre-trained Transformers) made chatbots even more popular. In this
study, we present a survey on existing Arabic chatbots in education and their
different characteristics such as the adopted approaches, language variety, and
metrics used to measure their performance. We were able to identified some
research gaps when we discovered that, despite the success of chatbots in other
languages such as English, only a few educational Arabic chatbots used modern
techniques. Finally, we discuss future directions of research in this field.

*Rishit Tyagi,Rahul Bouri,Mohit Gupta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究提出基于BERT和GPT-4o的框架，用于新闻文章的多标签叙事分类和证据性解释生成，通过辅助知识库提高准确性和可靠性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统NLP方法难以检测微妙措辞和隐藏议程，需要解决叙事多标签分类和生成基于证据的解释这两个关键挑战

Method: 使用召回导向的BERT模型进行叙事检测，GPT-4o管道优化预测一致性，ReACT框架结合语义检索进行少样本提示，并引入结构化分类表作为辅助知识库

Result: 集成辅助知识的提示方法提高了分类准确性和解释可靠性

Conclusion: 该方法在媒体分析、教育和情报收集等领域具有应用价值，通过知识增强提高了叙事分析的准确性和可解释性

Abstract: Understanding covert narratives and implicit messaging is essential for
analyzing bias and sentiment. Traditional NLP methods struggle with detecting
subtle phrasing and hidden agendas. This study tackles two key challenges: (1)
multi-label classification of narratives and sub-narratives in news articles,
and (2) generating concise, evidence-based explanations for dominant
narratives. We fine-tune a BERT model with a recall-oriented approach for
comprehensive narrative detection, refining predictions using a GPT-4o pipeline
for consistency. For narrative explanation, we propose a ReACT (Reasoning +
Acting) framework with semantic retrieval-based few-shot prompting, ensuring
grounded and relevant justifications. To enhance factual accuracy and reduce
hallucinations, we incorporate a structured taxonomy table as an auxiliary
knowledge base. Our results show that integrating auxiliary knowledge in
prompts improves classification accuracy and justification reliability, with
applications in media analysis, education, and intelligence gathering.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究探索了如何构建稳定的个性化词汇配置文件，作为实现人机对话中词汇对齐的基础，发现使用10分钟转录语音数据构建的紧凑配置文件在性能和效率方面表现最佳


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 词汇对齐有助于成功沟通，但在对话代理中的实现仍未充分探索，特别是在大型语言模型发展的背景下，需要建立个性化的词汇配置文件作为词汇对齐的基础

Method: 通过变化转录语音数据量和词性类别中的项目数量来构建个性化词汇配置文件，并使用召回率、覆盖率和余弦相似度指标评估配置文件在不同时间段的性能

Result: 较小且更紧凑的配置文件（10分钟转录语音，包含5个形容词、5个连词，以及各10个副词、名词、代词和动词）在性能和数据处理效率方面提供了最佳平衡

Conclusion: 本研究为构建稳定的个性化词汇配置文件提供了实用见解，考虑了最小数据需求，是开发对话代理词汇对齐策略的基础步骤

Abstract: Lexical alignment, where speakers start to use similar words across
conversation, is known to contribute to successful communication. However, its
implementation in conversational agents remains underexplored, particularly
considering the recent advancements in large language models (LLMs). As a first
step towards enabling lexical alignment in human-agent dialogue, this study
draws on strategies for personalising conversational agents and investigates
the construction of stable, personalised lexical profiles as a basis for
lexical alignment. Specifically, we varied the amounts of transcribed spoken
data used for construction as well as the number of items included in the
profiles per part-of-speech (POS) category and evaluated profile performance
across time using recall, coverage, and cosine similarity metrics. It was shown
that smaller and more compact profiles, created after 10 min of transcribed
speech containing 5 items for adjectives, 5 items for conjunctions, and 10
items for adverbs, nouns, pronouns, and verbs each, offered the best balance in
both performance and data efficiency. In conclusion, this study offers
practical insights into constructing stable, personalised lexical profiles,
taking into account minimal data requirements, serving as a foundational step
toward lexical alignment strategies in conversational agents.

both decoder and encoder models of varying sizes, showing that the benchmark is
sufficiently difficult and that there is a large performance discrepancy
amongst the languages. The dataset and survey evaluations are freely available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有连贯性建模研究大多单独关注实体特征或篇章关系特征，很少将两者结合，本文旨在探索同时建模这两种特征的方法。

Method: 提出了两种联合建模实体和篇章关系的方法，在三个基准数据集上进行实验验证。

Result: 实验结果显示，整合实体和篇章关系特征显著提高了连贯性模型的性能表现。

Conclusion: 同时建模实体和篇章关系特征对于连贯性评估具有重要价值，联合建模方法能有效提升模型效果。

Abstract: In linguistics, coherence can be achieved by different means, such as by
maintaining reference to the same set of entities across sentences and by
establishing discourse relations between them. However, most existing work on
coherence modeling focuses exclusively on either entity features or discourse
relation features, with little attention given to combining the two. In this
study, we explore two methods for jointly modeling entities and discourse
relations for coherence assessment. Experiments on three benchmark datasets
show that integrating both types of features significantly enhances the
performance of coherence models, highlighting the benefits of modeling both
simultaneously for coherence evaluation.

TL;DR: MAGneT是一个新颖的多智能体框架，用于生成合成心理咨询会话，通过分解咨询师响应生成任务到专门的LLM智能体来模拟真实咨询结构，显著提升了生成会话的质量和多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着对可扩展心理咨询需求的增长，需要高质量、隐私合规的数据来微调开源大语言模型，但此类数据稀缺。

Method: 提出MAGneT多智能体框架，将咨询师响应生成分解为协调的子任务，由专门模拟关键心理技术的LLM智能体处理，并提出了统一的评估框架整合多种自动和专家指标。

Result: MAGneT在生成咨询会话的质量、多样性和治疗对齐方面显著优于现有方法，平均提升一般咨询技能3.2%和CBT特定技能4.3%，专家在77.2%的情况下偏好MAGneT生成的会话。

Conclusion: MAGneT框架能有效生成高质量的心理咨询数据，微调开源模型后性能更好，为心理咨询领域提供了有价值的数据生成解决方案。

Abstract: The growing demand for scalable psychological counseling highlights the need
for fine-tuning open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) with high-quality,
privacy-compliant data, yet such data remains scarce. Here we introduce MAGneT,
a novel multi-agent framework for synthetic psychological counseling session
generation that decomposes counselor response generation into coordinated
sub-tasks handled by specialized LLM agents, each modeling a key psychological
technique. Unlike prior single-agent approaches, MAGneT better captures the
structure and nuance of real counseling. In addition, we address
inconsistencies in prior evaluation protocols by proposing a unified evaluation
framework integrating diverse automatic and expert metrics. Furthermore, we
expand the expert evaluations from four aspects of counseling in previous works
to nine aspects, enabling a more thorough and robust assessment of data
quality. Empirical results show that MAGneT significantly outperforms existing
methods in quality, diversity, and therapeutic alignment of the generated
counseling sessions, improving general counseling skills by 3.2% and
CBT-specific skills by 4.3% on average on cognitive therapy rating scale
(CTRS). Crucially, experts prefer MAGneT-generated sessions in 77.2% of cases
on average across all aspects. Moreover, fine-tuning an open-source model on
MAGneT-generated sessions shows better performance, with improvements of 6.3%
on general counseling skills and 7.3% on CBT-specific skills on average on CTRS
over those fine-tuned with sessions generated by baseline methods. We also make
our code and data public.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体事件检测依赖标注数据，但人工标注成本高且耗时，需要一种能够增强数据多样性和模型鲁棒性的方法

Method: 提出双重增强框架：显式增强使用大语言模型通过5种生成策略增强文本信息；隐式增强设计5种新颖的扰动技术在特征空间操作结构融合嵌入

Result: 在Twitter2012数据集上平均F1分数比最佳基线模型提升约17.67%，在Twitter2018数据集上提升约15.57%

Conclusion: SED-Aug框架有效解决了社交媒体事件检测中标注数据稀缺的问题，通过双重增强显著提升了模型性能

Abstract: Social event detection involves identifying and categorizing important events
from social media, which relies on labeled data, but annotation is costly and
labor-intensive. To address this problem, we propose Augmentation framework for
Social Event Detection (SED-Aug), a plug-and-play dual augmentation framework,
which combines explicit text-based and implicit feature-space augmentation to
enhance data diversity and model robustness. The explicit augmentation utilizes
large language models to enhance textual information through five diverse
generation strategies. For implicit augmentation, we design five novel
perturbation techniques that operate in the feature space on structural fused
embeddings. These perturbations are crafted to keep the semantic and relational
properties of the embeddings and make them more diverse. Specifically, SED-Aug
outperforms the best baseline model by approximately 17.67% on the Twitter2012
dataset and by about 15.57% on the Twitter2018 dataset in terms of the average
F1 score. The code is available at GitHub: https://github.com/congboma/SED-Aug.

TL;DR: 提出了Inverse IFEval基准测试，用于评估大语言模型在对抗性指令下的反直觉能力，发现现有模型存在认知惯性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在监督微调后往往表现出认知惯性，难以遵循与训练模式相冲突的指令，需要评估这种局限性。

Method: 构建包含1012个中英文问题的数据集，涵盖8种反直觉挑战类型，采用人机协作流程和优化的LLM-as-a-Judge评估框架。

Result: 实验表明现有领先LLMs在对抗性指令下表现不佳，验证了Inverse IFEval基准的必要性。

Conclusion: 未来对齐工作不仅要追求流畅性和事实正确性，还应考虑非常规情境下的适应性，Inverse IFEval可作为诊断工具和开发方法的基础。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve strong performance on diverse tasks but
often exhibit cognitive inertia, struggling to follow instructions that
conflict with the standardized patterns learned during supervised fine-tuning
(SFT). To evaluate this limitation, we propose Inverse IFEval, a benchmark that
measures models Counter-intuitive Abilitytheir capacity to override
training-induced biases and comply with adversarial instructions. Inverse
IFEval introduces eight types of such challenges, including Question
Correction, Intentional Textual Flaws, Code without Comments, and
Counterfactual Answering. Using a human-in-the-loop pipeline, we construct a
dataset of 1012 high-quality Chinese and English questions across 23 domains,
evaluated under an optimized LLM-as-a-Judge framework. Experiments on existing
leading LLMs demonstrate the necessity of our proposed Inverse IFEval
benchmark. Our findings emphasize that future alignment efforts should not only
pursue fluency and factual correctness but also account for adaptability under
unconventional contexts. We hope that Inverse IFEval serves as both a
diagnostic tool and a foundation for developing methods that mitigate cognitive
inertia, reduce overfitting to narrow patterns, and ultimately enhance the
instruction-following reliability of LLMs in diverse and unpredictable
real-world scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在医疗领域的应用潜力巨大，但其依赖静态训练数据的特性存在风险，当医学知识更新时，模型可能提供有害建议或临床推理失败。

Method: 引入了两个基于系统评价的新问答数据集：MedRevQA（16,501个QA对，涵盖一般生物医学知识）和MedChangeQA（512个QA对，医学共识随时间变化）。评估了8个主流LLM在这些数据集上的表现。

Result: 所有评估的LLM都表现出对过时知识的一致依赖，模型会记忆并使用过时的医学知识。

Conclusion: 分析了过时预训练数据和训练策略的影响，提出了未来缓解这一问题的方向，为开发更及时可靠的医疗AI系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: The growing capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) show significant
potential to enhance healthcare by assisting medical researchers and
physicians. However, their reliance on static training data is a major risk
when medical recommendations evolve with new research and developments. When
LLMs memorize outdated medical knowledge, they can provide harmful advice or
fail at clinical reasoning tasks. To investigate this problem, we introduce two
novel question-answering (QA) datasets derived from systematic reviews:
MedRevQA (16,501 QA pairs covering general biomedical knowledge) and
MedChangeQA (a subset of 512 QA pairs where medical consensus has changed over
time). Our evaluation of eight prominent LLMs on the datasets reveals
consistent reliance on outdated knowledge across all models. We additionally
analyze the influence of obsolete pre-training data and training strategies to
explain this phenomenon and propose future directions for mitigation, laying
the groundwork for developing more current and reliable medical AI systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PARCO提出了一种增强的上下文ASR方法，通过音素感知编码、对比实体消歧、实体级监督和分层实体过滤，显著提升了特定领域命名实体（特别是同音词）的识别准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ASR系统在处理领域特定命名实体（尤其是同音词）时表现不佳，上下文ASR方法由于实体多样性有限和将实体视为独立标记，导致无法捕捉细粒度音素变化和完整的多标记偏置。

Method: PARCO方法集成了四个关键组件：音素感知编码、对比实体消歧、实体级监督和分层实体过滤，以增强音素区分能力、确保完整实体检索并减少不确定性下的误报。

Result: 在中文AISHELL-1上达到4.22%的CER，在英文DATA2上达到11.14%的WER（1000个干扰项条件下），显著优于基线方法，并在THCHS-30和LibriSpeech等域外数据集上表现出稳健的性能提升。

Conclusion: PARCO通过综合的音素增强和实体处理机制，有效解决了上下文ASR中的关键挑战，为领域特定命名实体识别提供了强有力的解决方案。

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems struggle with domain-specific
named entities, especially homophones. Contextual ASR improves recognition but
often fails to capture fine-grained phoneme variations due to limited entity
diversity. Moreover, prior methods treat entities as independent tokens,
leading to incomplete multi-token biasing. To address these issues, we propose
Phoneme-Augmented Robust Contextual ASR via COntrastive entity disambiguation
(PARCO), which integrates phoneme-aware encoding, contrastive entity
disambiguation, entity-level supervision, and hierarchical entity filtering.
These components enhance phonetic discrimination, ensure complete entity
retrieval, and reduce false positives under uncertainty. Experiments show that
PARCO achieves CER of 4.22% on Chinese AISHELL-1 and WER of 11.14% on English
DATA2 under 1,000 distractors, significantly outperforming baselines. PARCO
also demonstrates robust gains on out-of-domain datasets like THCHS-30 and
LibriSpeech.

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了LLM性别偏见评估中提示语的影响，发现即使微小的提示变化也能实质改变偏见测量结果，甚至反转偏见方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在社会影响力领域的应用增多，对性别偏见的关注也在增长。但现有的评估任务多与自然语言分布不同，常包含明显或隐蕴的性别偏见信号。研究者想要了解评估任务的目的信号如何影响LLM的性别偏见测量。

Method: 研究者在两种提示条件下测试模型：(1)使测试上下文显著的提示，(2)使性别相关内容显著的提示。使用四种任务格式，采用令牌概率和离散选择两种指标进行评估。

Result: 研究发现：即使微小的提示变化也能实质改变偏见测量结果，甚至反转偏见方向。离散选择指标通常比概率测量更能放大偏见。

Conclusion: 这些发现不仅显示了LLM性别偏见评估的脆弱性，也为NLP基准测试和开发社区提出了新的问题：严格控制的测试设计在何种程度上会触发LLM的"测试模式"表现，这对未来基准测试的生态有效性意味着什么。

Abstract: As LLMs are increasingly applied in socially impactful settings, concerns
about gender bias have prompted growing efforts both to measure and mitigate
such bias. These efforts often rely on evaluation tasks that differ from
natural language distributions, as they typically involve carefully constructed
task prompts that overtly or covertly signal the presence of gender
bias-related content. In this paper, we examine how signaling the evaluative
purpose of a task impacts measured gender bias in LLMs. Concretely, we test
models under prompt conditions that (1) make the testing context salient, and
(2) make gender-focused content salient. We then assess prompt sensitivity
across four task formats with both token-probability and discrete-choice
metrics. We find that even minor prompt changes can substantially alter bias
outcomes, sometimes reversing their direction entirely. Discrete-choice metrics
further tend to amplify bias relative to probabilistic measures. These findings
do not only highlight the brittleness of LLM gender bias evaluations but open a
new puzzle for the NLP benchmarking and development community: To what extent
can well-controlled testing designs trigger LLM ``testing mode'' performance,
and what does this mean for the ecological validity of future benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语言模型的时间推理研究主要集中在公历，而但许多非公历系统(如日本历、伊斯兰历、希伯来历)仍在活跃使用且反映文化特征，需要评估模型对这类非公历的处理能力

Method: 创建包含四个任务的日本历数据集，评估一系列英语和日语中心的开源语言模型，测试其日本历法的知识和推理能力

Result: 部分模型能够进行历法转换，但即使是日语中心模型也在日历运算和多历法一致性维持方面表现差强

Conclusion: 结果强调了开发更好处理文化特定历法知识的语言模型的重要性

Abstract: Temporal reasoning and knowledge are essential capabilities for language
models (LMs). While much prior work has analyzed and improved temporal
reasoning in LMs, most studies have focused solely on the Gregorian calendar.
However, many non-Gregorian systems, such as the Japanese, Hijri, and Hebrew
calendars, are in active use and reflect culturally grounded conceptions of
time. If and how well current LMs can accurately handle such non-Gregorian
calendars has not been evaluated so far. Here, we present a systematic
evaluation of how well open-source LMs handle one such non-Gregorian system:
the Japanese calendar. For our evaluation, we create datasets for four tasks
that require both temporal knowledge and temporal reasoning. Evaluating a range
of English-centric and Japanese-centric LMs, we find that some models can
perform calendar conversions, but even Japanese-centric models struggle with
Japanese-calendar arithmetic and with maintaining consistency across calendars.
Our results highlight the importance of developing LMs that are better equipped
for culture-specific calendar understanding.

Motivation: 现有GUI代理使用序列操作作为知识，无法抓取页面间复杂的迁移关系，导致代理难以深度感知GUI环境并法适应新场景。

Method: 设计自动化流水线将序列操作转换为显式模型图结构的页面图，结合RAG技术从图中检索GUI感知指南，并提出任务分解策略的多代理框架PG-Agent。

Result: 在多个标准测试集上进行了广泛实验，证明了PG-Agent的有效性，即使在页面图构建使用有限操作情境时也能获得良好效果。

Conclusion: 通过页面图模型和RAG技术的结合，PG-Agent框架能够有效提升GUI代理的适应性和演示了在新场景中的良好性能。

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents possess significant commercial and
social value, and GUI agents powered by advanced multimodal large language
models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential. Currently, existing GUI
agents usually utilize sequential episodes of multi-step operations across
pages as the prior GUI knowledge, which fails to capture the complex transition
relationship between pages, making it challenging for the agents to deeply
perceive the GUI environment and generalize to new scenarios. Therefore, we
design an automated pipeline to transform the sequential episodes into page
graphs, which explicitly model the graph structure of the pages that are
naturally connected by actions. To fully utilize the page graphs, we further
introduce Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology to effectively
retrieve reliable perception guidelines of GUI from them, and a tailored
multi-agent framework PG-Agent with task decomposition strategy is proposed to
be injected with the guidelines so that it can generalize to unseen scenarios.
Extensive experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of
PG-Agent, even with limited episodes for page graph construction.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在准马尔可夫因果模型中，当外生变量未完全指定时，可能无法精确计算感兴趣的概率值。因此需要研究如何计算紧致的概率边界。

Method: 提出新算法利用内生变量的输入概率简化多线性规划构造。对于单干预场景，应用列生成技术通过一系列辅助线性整数程序计算概率边界，证明了外生变量的多项式基数表示是可能的。

Result: 实验表明列生成技术优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该研究为准马尔可夫因果模型中的部分可识别查询提供了有效的概率边界计算方法，列生成技术在处理单干预场景时表现出优越性能。

Abstract: We investigate partially identifiable queries in a class of causal models. We
focus on acyclic Structural Causal Models that are quasi-Markovian (that is,
each endogenous variable is connected with at most one exogenous confounder).
We look into scenarios where endogenous variables are observed (and a
distribution over them is known), while exogenous variables are not fully
specified. This leads to a representation that is in essence a Bayesian network
where the distribution of root variables is not uniquely determined. In such
circumstances, it may not be possible to precisely compute a probability value
of interest. We thus study the computation of tight probability bounds, a
problem that has been solved by multilinear programming in general, and by
linear programming when a single confounded component is intervened upon. We
present a new algorithm to simplify the construction of such programs by
exploiting input probabilities over endogenous variables. For scenarios with a
single intervention, we apply column generation to compute a probability bound
through a sequence of auxiliary linear integer programs, thus showing that a
representation with polynomial cardinality for exogenous variables is possible.
Experiments show column generation techniques to be superior to existing
methods.

Motivation: 现有深度强化学习方法存在"单模态偏差"，在复杂动态约束下缺乏决策灵活性，容易导致"决策死锁"，需要新的方法来解决这一问题

Method: 提出Diffusion-AC框架，将策略建模为由价值函数引导的反向去噪过程，生成丰富的高质量多模态动作分布；并采用密度递进安全课程(DPSC)训练机制

Result: 在最具挑战性的高密度场景中，成功率高达94.1%，近空中碰撞事件减少约59%，显著优于现有最先进的DRL基准方法

Conclusion: 扩散概率模型为安全关键任务的冲突解决提供了新途径，多模态决策能力使系统能够灵活切换到有效的替代机动策略，大幅提升安全边际

Abstract: In the context of continuously rising global air traffic, efficient and safe
Conflict Detection and Resolution (CD&R) is paramount for air traffic
management. Although Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) offers a promising
pathway for CD&R automation, existing approaches commonly suffer from a
"unimodal bias" in their policies. This leads to a critical lack of
decision-making flexibility when confronted with complex and dynamic
constraints, often resulting in "decision deadlocks." To overcome this
limitation, this paper pioneers the integration of diffusion probabilistic
models into the safety-critical task of CD&R, proposing a novel autonomous
conflict resolution framework named Diffusion-AC. Diverging from conventional
methods that converge to a single optimal solution, our framework models its
policy as a reverse denoising process guided by a value function, enabling it
to generate a rich, high-quality, and multimodal action distribution. This core
architecture is complemented by a Density-Progressive Safety Curriculum (DPSC),
a training mechanism that ensures stable and efficient learning as the agent
progresses from sparse to high-density traffic environments. Extensive
simulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed method significantly
outperforms a suite of state-of-the-art DRL benchmarks. Most critically, in the
most challenging high-density scenarios, Diffusion-AC not only maintains a high
success rate of 94.1% but also reduces the incidence of Near Mid-Air Collisions
(NMACs) by approximately 59% compared to the next-best-performing baseline,
significantly enhancing the system's safety margin. This performance leap stems
from its unique multimodal decision-making capability, which allows the agent
to flexibly switch to effective alternative maneuvers.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种动态规划框架，让LLM智能体能够灵活决定何时进行规划，通过监督微调和强化学习两阶段训练，在长时程任务中实现更高效的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如ReAct要求LLM在每个动作前都进行规划，这在计算上昂贵且在长时程任务中性能下降，而完全不规划又会限制性能，因此需要动态规划能力。

Method: 提出两阶段训练流程：1）在多样化合成数据上进行监督微调，为动态规划做准备；2）在长时程环境中使用强化学习来精炼这种能力。

Result: 在Crafter环境中的实验表明，动态规划智能体更样本高效，能持续实现更复杂的目标，并且能够有效利用人类编写的规划来超越其独立能力。

Conclusion: 这是首个探索训练LLM智能体进行动态测试时计算分配的研究，为更高效、自适应和可控的智能体系统铺平了道路。

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) to reason via reinforcement learning
(RL) significantly improves their problem-solving capabilities. In agentic
settings, existing methods like ReAct prompt LLMs to explicitly plan before
every action; however, we demonstrate that always planning is computationally
expensive and degrades performance on long-horizon tasks, while never planning
further limits performance. To address this, we introduce a conceptual
framework formalizing dynamic planning for LLM agents, enabling them to
flexibly decide when to allocate test-time compute for planning. We propose a
simple two-stage training pipeline: (1) supervised fine-tuning on diverse
synthetic data to prime models for dynamic planning, and (2) RL to refine this
capability in long-horizon environments. Experiments on the Crafter environment
show that dynamic planning agents trained with this approach are more
sample-efficient and consistently achieve more complex objectives.
Additionally, we demonstrate that these agents can be effectively steered by
human-written plans, surpassing their independent capabilities. To our
knowledge, this work is the first to explore training LLM agents for dynamic
test-time compute allocation in sequential decision-making tasks, paving the
way for more efficient, adaptive, and controllable agentic systems.

TL;DR: 提出了KG-SMILE框架，通过扰动方法和加权线性代理模型为Graph RAG提供token和组件级别的可解释性，提高生成式AI在敏感领域的透明度和可信度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型产生幻觉和不可验证声明的问题，特别是在医疗等敏感领域需要高精度的场景下，RAG方法虽然能提高准确性但仍缺乏透明度。

Method: 开发了方法无关的基于扰动的框架，通过应用受控扰动、计算相似性并训练加权线性代理模型，识别对生成输出影响最大的图实体和关系。

Result: KG-SMILE能够产生稳定且与人类认知一致的解释，在保真度、忠实度、一致性、稳定性和准确性等综合归因指标上表现良好。

Conclusion: KG-SMILE框架成功平衡了模型有效性和可解释性，为机器学习技术提供了更大的透明度和可信度，特别是在Graph RAG系统中。

Abstract: Generative AI, such as Large Language Models (LLMs), has achieved impressive
progress but still produces hallucinations and unverifiable claims, limiting
reliability in sensitive domains. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) improves
accuracy by grounding outputs in external knowledge, especially in domains like
healthcare, where precision is vital. However, RAG remains opaque and
essentially a black box, heavily dependent on data quality. We developed a
method-agnostic, perturbation-based framework that provides token and
component-level interoperability for Graph RAG using SMILE and named it as
Knowledge-Graph (KG)-SMILE. By applying controlled perturbations, computing
similarities, and training weighted linear surrogates, KG-SMILE identifies the
graph entities and relations most influential to generated outputs, thereby
making RAG more transparent. We evaluate KG-SMILE using comprehensive
attribution metrics, including fidelity, faithfulness, consistency, stability,
and accuracy. Our findings show that KG-SMILE produces stable, human-aligned
explanations, demonstrating its capacity to balance model effectiveness with
interpretability and thereby fostering greater transparency and trust in
machine learning technologies.

Conclusion: CausalARC为评估AI系统在因果推理能力方面提供了一个系统性的测试框架，特别是在低数据和分布外场景下的表现。

Abstract: Reasoning requires adaptation to novel problem settings under limited data
and distribution shift. This work introduces CausalARC: an experimental testbed
for AI reasoning in low-data and out-of-distribution regimes, modeled after the
Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC). Each CausalARC reasoning task is
sampled from a fully specified causal world model, formally expressed as a
structural causal model. Principled data augmentations provide observational,
interventional, and counterfactual feedback about the world model in the form
of few-shot, in-context learning demonstrations. As a proof-of-concept, we
illustrate the use of CausalARC for four language model evaluation settings:
(1) abstract reasoning with test-time training, (2) counterfactual reasoning
with in-context learning, (3) program synthesis, and (4) causal discovery with
logical reasoning.

Conclusion: 虽然当前实现专注于空间原语，但为整合更复杂动态的表征奠定了计算基础，展示了神经符号方法在提升LLM推理能力方面的潜力。

Abstract: Despite significant progress in natural language understanding, Large
Language Models (LLMs) remain error-prone when performing logical reasoning,
often lacking the robust mental representations that enable human-like
comprehension. We introduce a prototype neurosymbolic system, Embodied-LM, that
grounds understanding and logical reasoning in schematic representations based
on image schemas-recurring patterns derived from sensorimotor experience that
structure human cognition. Our system operationalizes the spatial foundations
of these cognitive structures using declarative spatial reasoning within Answer
Set Programming. Through evaluation on logical deduction problems, we
demonstrate that LLMs can be guided to interpret scenarios through embodied
cognitive structures, that these structures can be formalized as executable
programs, and that the resulting representations support effective logical
reasoning with enhanced interpretability. While our current implementation
focuses on spatial primitives, it establishes the computational foundation for
incorporating more complex and dynamic representations.

Result: HICRA算法显著优于现有基线方法，验证语义熵是衡量战略探索的更好指标

Conclusion: 聚焦战略瓶颈是解锁高级推理的关键，层次化信用分配机制能更高效地提升模型推理能力

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has proven highly effective at enhancing the
complex reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet underlying
mechanisms driving this success remain largely opaque. Our analysis reveals
that puzzling phenomena like ``aha moments", ``length-scaling'' and entropy
dynamics are not disparate occurrences but hallmarks of an emergent reasoning
hierarchy, akin to the separation of high-level strategic planning from
low-level procedural execution in human cognition. We uncover a compelling
two-phase dynamic: initially, a model is constrained by procedural correctness
and must improve its low-level skills. The learning bottleneck then decisively
shifts, with performance gains being driven by the exploration and mastery of
high-level strategic planning. This insight exposes a core inefficiency in
prevailing RL algorithms like GRPO, which apply optimization pressure
agnostically and dilute the learning signal across all tokens. To address this,
we propose HIerarchy-Aware Credit Assignment (HICRA), an algorithm that
concentrates optimization efforts on high-impact planning tokens. HICRA
significantly outperforms strong baselines, demonstrating that focusing on this
strategic bottleneck is key to unlocking advanced reasoning. Furthermore, we
validate semantic entropy as a superior compass for measuring strategic
exploration over misleading metrics such as token-level entropy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解释性AI在时间序列分类中很重要，但SHAP方法的计算复杂度在长时间序列上很高。虽然通过分段简化可以提高效率，但最佳分段策略仍是个开放问题。

Method: 研究了八种不同的时间序列分段算法，使用InterpretTime和AUC Difference两种评估方法来分析分段组成对解释质量的影响。在多元和一元时间序列上进行实验。

Result: 发现分段数量对解释质量的影响比分段算法更大，等长分段在大多数情况下表现更好。提出的新归因归一化技术能持续改善归因质量。

Conclusion: 对于时间序列SHAP解释，简单的等长分段策略通常已经足够，而新的归因归一化方法可以进一步提高解释质量。

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) has become an increasingly important topic for
understanding and attributing the predictions made by complex Time Series
Classification (TSC) models. Among attribution methods, SHapley Additive
exPlanations (SHAP) is widely regarded as an excellent attribution method; but
its computational complexity, which scales exponentially with the number of
features, limits its practicality for long time series. To address this, recent
studies have shown that aggregating features via segmentation, to compute a
single attribution value for a group of consecutive time points, drastically
reduces SHAP running time. However, the choice of the optimal segmentation
strategy remains an open question. In this work, we investigated eight
different Time Series Segmentation algorithms to understand how segment
compositions affect the explanation quality. We evaluate these approaches using
two established XAI evaluation methodologies: InterpretTime and AUC Difference.
Through experiments on both Multivariate (MTS) and Univariate Time Series
(UTS), we find that the number of segments has a greater impact on explanation
quality than the specific segmentation method. Notably, equal-length
segmentation consistently outperforms most of the custom time series
segmentation algorithms. Furthermore, we introduce a novel attribution
normalisation technique that weights segments by their length and we show that
it consistently improves attribution quality.

Conclusion: 角色变异方法有效提升了自动红队效果，为探索自动与人工红队方法的互补性提供了新方向

Abstract: Recent developments in AI governance and safety research have called for
red-teaming methods that can effectively surface potential risks posed by AI
models. Many of these calls have emphasized how the identities and backgrounds
of red-teamers can shape their red-teaming strategies, and thus the kinds of
risks they are likely to uncover. While automated red-teaming approaches
promise to complement human red-teaming by enabling larger-scale exploration of
model behavior, current approaches do not consider the role of identity. As an
initial step towards incorporating people's background and identities in
automated red-teaming, we develop and evaluate a novel method, PersonaTeaming,
that introduces personas in the adversarial prompt generation process to
explore a wider spectrum of adversarial strategies. In particular, we first
introduce a methodology for mutating prompts based on either "red-teaming
expert" personas or "regular AI user" personas. We then develop a dynamic
persona-generating algorithm that automatically generates various persona types
adaptive to different seed prompts. In addition, we develop a set of new
metrics to explicitly measure the "mutation distance" to complement existing
diversity measurements of adversarial prompts. Our experiments show promising
improvements (up to 144.1%) in the attack success rates of adversarial prompts
through persona mutation, while maintaining prompt diversity, compared to
RainbowPlus, a state-of-the-art automated red-teaming method. We discuss the
strengths and limitations of different persona types and mutation methods,
shedding light on future opportunities to explore complementarities between
automated and human red-teaming approaches.

Conclusion: 需要区分表面特质表达和行为一致性，挑战了LLM人格的假设，强调了对齐和可解释性需要更深层次评估

Abstract: Personality traits have long been studied as predictors of human
behavior.Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) suggest similar
patterns may emerge in artificial systems, with advanced LLMs displaying
consistent behavioral tendencies resembling human traits like agreeableness and
self-regulation. Understanding these patterns is crucial, yet prior work
primarily relied on simplified self-reports and heuristic prompting, with
little behavioral validation. In this study, we systematically characterize LLM
personality across three dimensions: (1) the dynamic emergence and evolution of
trait profiles throughout training stages; (2) the predictive validity of
self-reported traits in behavioral tasks; and (3) the impact of targeted
interventions, such as persona injection, on both self-reports and behavior.
Our findings reveal that instructional alignment (e.g., RLHF, instruction
tuning) significantly stabilizes trait expression and strengthens trait
correlations in ways that mirror human data. However, these self-reported
traits do not reliably predict behavior, and observed associations often
diverge from human patterns. While persona injection successfully steers
self-reports in the intended direction, it exerts little or inconsistent effect
on actual behavior. By distinguishing surface-level trait expression from
behavioral consistency, our findings challenge assumptions about LLM
personality and underscore the need for deeper evaluation in alignment and
interpretability.

Conclusion: 大语言模型在人类实验研究中作为代理人的能力存在关键缺陷，不能保持内部一致性，不能准确代替真实参与者

Abstract: The impressive capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have fueled the
notion that synthetic agents can serve as substitutes for real participants in
human-subject research. In an effort to evaluate the merits of this claim,
social science researchers have largely focused on whether LLM-generated survey
data corresponds to that of a human counterpart whom the LLM is prompted to
represent. In contrast, we address a more fundamental question: Do agents
maintain internal consistency, retaining similar behaviors when examined under
different experimental settings? To this end, we develop a study designed to
(a) reveal the agent's internal state and (b) examine agent behavior in a basic
dialogue setting. This design enables us to explore a set of behavioral
hypotheses to assess whether an agent's conversation behavior is consistent
with what we would expect from their revealed internal state. Our findings on
these hypotheses show significant internal inconsistencies in LLMs across model
families and at differing model sizes. Most importantly, we find that, although
agents may generate responses matching those of their human counterparts, they
fail to be internally consistent, representing a critical gap in their
capabilities to accurately substitute for real participants in human-subject
research. Our simulation code and data are publicly accessible.

Result: 在稀疏(BM25)、密集(Dense Passage Retrieval)和混合检索范式下，安全召回率从RAG的几乎0%提升到RAGuard的50%以上，技术召回率保持在60%以上。

Conclusion: RAGuard和SafetyClamp有潜力为关键维护场景中的LLM决策支持建立安全保证的新标准。

Abstract: Accuracy and safety are paramount in Offshore Wind (OSW) maintenance, yet
conventional Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail when confronted with
highly specialised or unexpected scenarios. We introduce RAGuard, an enhanced
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework that explicitly integrates
safety-critical documents alongside technical manuals.By issuing parallel
queries to two indices and allocating separate retrieval budgets for knowledge
and safety, RAGuard guarantees both technical depth and safety coverage. We
further develop a SafetyClamp extension that fetches a larger candidate pool,
"hard-clamping" exact slot guarantees to safety. We evaluate across sparse
(BM25), dense (Dense Passage Retrieval) and hybrid retrieval paradigms,
measuring Technical Recall@K and Safety Recall@K. Both proposed extensions of
RAG show an increase in Safety Recall@K from almost 0\% in RAG to more than
50\% in RAGuard, while maintaining Technical Recall above 60\%. These results
demonstrate that RAGuard and SafetyClamp have the potential to establish a new
standard for integrating safety assurance into LLM-powered decision support in
critical maintenance contexts.

Abstract: In supply chain management, planning is a critical concept. The movement of
physical products across different categories, from suppliers to warehouse
management, to sales, and logistics transporting them to customers, entails the
involvement of many entities. It covers various aspects such as demand
forecasting, inventory management, sales operations, and replenishment. How to
collect relevant data from an e-commerce platform's perspective, formulate
long-term plans, and dynamically adjust them based on environmental changes,
while ensuring interpretability, efficiency, and reliability, is a practical
and challenging problem. In recent years, the development of AI technologies,
especially the rapid progress of large language models, has provided new tools
to address real-world issues. In this work, we construct a Supply Chain
Planning Agent (SCPA) framework that can understand domain knowledge,
comprehend the operator's needs, decompose tasks, leverage or create new tools,
and return evidence-based planning reports. We deploy this framework in
JD.com's real-world scenario, demonstrating the feasibility of LLM-agent
applications in the supply chain. It effectively reduced labor and improved
accuracy, stock availability, and other key metrics.

Conclusion: 该工作提出了学习自适应元认知策略的新范式，将重点从设计固定协议转向学习动态审议策略

Abstract: Multi-agent systems of large language models (LLMs) show promise for complex
reasoning, but their effectiveness is often limited by fixed collaboration
protocols. These frameworks typically focus on macro-level orchestration while
overlooking agents' internal deliberative capabilities. This critical
meta-cognitive blindspot treats agents as passive executors unable to adapt
their strategy based on internal cognitive states like uncertainty or
confidence. We introduce the Meta-Policy Deliberation Framework (MPDF), where
agents learn a decentralized policy over a set of high-level meta-cognitive
actions: Persist, Refine, and Concede. To overcome the instability of
traditional policy gradients in this setting, we develop SoftRankPO, a novel
reinforcement learning algorithm. SoftRankPO stabilizes training by shaping
advantages based on the rank of rewards mapped through smooth normal quantiles,
making the learning process robust to reward variance. Experiments show that
MPDF with SoftRankPO achieves a a 4-5% absolute gain in average accuracy across
five mathematical and general reasoning benchmarks compared to six
state-of-the-art heuristic and learning-based multi-agent reasoning algorithms.
Our work presents a paradigm for learning adaptive, meta-cognitive policies for
multi-agent LLM systems, shifting the focus from designing fixed protocols to
learning dynamic, deliberative strategies.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being adopted in high-stakes
domains. Their capacity to process vast amounts of unstructured data, explore
flexible scenarios, and handle a diversity of contextual factors can make them
uniquely suited to provide new insights for the complexity of social
policymaking. This article evaluates whether LLMs' are aligned with domain
experts (and among themselves) to inform social policymaking on the subject of
homelessness alleviation - a challenge affecting over 150 million people
worldwide. We develop a novel benchmark comprised of decision scenarios with
policy choices across four geographies (South Bend, USA; Barcelona, Spain;
Johannesburg, South Africa; Macau SAR, China). The policies in scope are
grounded in the conceptual framework of the Capability Approach for human
development. We also present an automated pipeline that connects the
benchmarked policies to an agent-based model, and we explore the social impact
of the recommended policies through simulated social scenarios. The paper
results reveal promising potential to leverage LLMs for social policy making.
If responsible guardrails and contextual calibrations are introduced in
collaboration with local domain experts, LLMs can provide humans with valuable
insights, in the form of alternative policies at scale.

Conclusion: 该无训练、防幽灵的映射系统通过MCP框架有效解决了医学数据标准化中的关键挑战，为大规模健康数据研究提供了高效、可靠的解决方案

Abstract: The Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) common data model (CDM)
provides a standardized representation of heterogeneous health data to support
large-scale, multi-institutional research. One critical step in data
standardization using OMOP CDM is the mapping of source medical terms to OMOP
standard concepts, a procedure that is resource-intensive and error-prone.
While large language models (LLMs) have the potential to facilitate this
process, their tendency toward hallucination makes them unsuitable for clinical
deployment without training and expert validation. Here, we developed a
zero-training, hallucination-preventive mapping system based on the Model
Context Protocol (MCP), a standardized and secure framework allowing LLMs to
interact with external resources and tools. The system enables explainable
mapping and significantly improves efficiency and accuracy with minimal effort.
It provides real-time vocabulary lookups and structured reasoning outputs
suitable for immediate use in both exploratory and production environments.

Abstract: Historic urban quarters play a vital role in preserving cultural heritage
while serving as vibrant spaces for tourism and everyday life. Understanding
how tourists perceive these environments is essential for sustainable,
human-centered urban planning. This study proposes a multidimensional
AI-powered framework for analyzing tourist perception in historic urban
quarters using multimodal data from social media. Applied to twelve historic
quarters in central Shanghai, the framework integrates focal point extraction,
color theme analysis, and sentiment mining. Visual focus areas are identified
from tourist-shared photos using a fine-tuned semantic segmentation model. To
assess aesthetic preferences, dominant colors are extracted using a clustering
method, and their spatial distribution across quarters is analyzed. Color
themes are further compared between social media photos and real-world street
views, revealing notable shifts. This divergence highlights potential gaps
between visual expectations and the built environment, reflecting both
stylistic preferences and perceptual bias. Tourist reviews are evaluated
through a hybrid sentiment analysis approach combining a rule-based method and
a multi-task BERT model. Satisfaction is assessed across four dimensions:
tourist activities, built environment, service facilities, and business
formats. The results reveal spatial variations in aesthetic appeal and
emotional response. Rather than focusing on a single technical innovation, this
framework offers an integrated, data-driven approach to decoding tourist
perception and contributes to informed decision-making in tourism, heritage
conservation, and the design of aesthetically engaging public spaces.

Conclusion: 通过结构化、指标驱动的矢量数据库对比方法，建立了一个健壮且可扩展的生成式AI可靠性评估框架，充当了主观人工评估的限制

Abstract: Generative AI (GEN AI) models have revolutionized diverse application domains
but present substantial challenges due to reliability concerns, including
hallucinations, semantic drift, and inherent biases. These models typically
operate as black-boxes, complicating transparent and objective evaluation.
Current evaluation methods primarily depend on subjective human assessment,
limiting scalability, transparency, and effectiveness. This research proposes a
systematic methodology using deterministic and Large Language Model
(LLM)-generated Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to continuously monitor and evaluate GEN
AI reliability. We construct two parallel KGs: (i) a deterministic KG built
using explicit rule-based methods, predefined ontologies, domain-specific
dictionaries, and structured entity-relation extraction rules, and (ii) an
LLM-generated KG dynamically derived from real-time textual data streams such
as live news articles. Utilizing real-time news streams ensures authenticity,
mitigates biases from repetitive training, and prevents adaptive LLMs from
bypassing predefined benchmarks through feedback memorization. To quantify
structural deviations and semantic discrepancies, we employ several established
KG metrics, including Instantiated Class Ratio (ICR), Instantiated Property
Ratio (IPR), and Class Instantiation (CI). An automated real-time monitoring
framework continuously computes deviations between deterministic and
LLM-generated KGs. By establishing dynamic anomaly thresholds based on
historical structural metric distributions, our method proactively identifies
and flags significant deviations, thus promptly detecting semantic anomalies or
hallucinations. This structured, metric-driven comparison between deterministic
and dynamically generated KGs delivers a robust and scalable evaluation
framework.

Method: E&E策略交替进行局部新颖性扩展和基于视觉语言模型生成语言目标的目标导向探索

Result: 在Flow Lenia连续细胞自动机上，E&E比现有方法发现更多样化的解决方案，远征产生的解决方案对长期探索有重要影响

Conclusion: E&E能够突破局部新颖性边界，以人类可理解的方式探索行为空间，为人工生命等领域的开放式探索提供了有前景的模板

Abstract: Discovering diverse visual patterns in continuous cellular automata (CA) is
challenging due to the vastness and redundancy of high-dimensional behavioral
spaces. Traditional exploration methods like Novelty Search (NS) expand locally
by mutating known novel solutions but often plateau when local novelty is
exhausted, failing to reach distant, unexplored regions. We introduce
Expedition and Expansion (E&E), a hybrid strategy where exploration alternates
between local novelty-driven expansions and goal-directed expeditions. During
expeditions, E&E leverages a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to generate linguistic
goals--descriptions of interesting but hypothetical patterns that drive
exploration toward uncharted regions. By operating in semantic spaces that
align with human perception, E&E both evaluates novelty and generates goals in
conceptually meaningful ways, enhancing the interpretability and relevance of
discovered behaviors. Tested on Flow Lenia, a continuous CA known for its rich,
emergent behaviors, E&E consistently uncovers more diverse solutions than
existing exploration methods. A genealogical analysis further reveals that
solutions originating from expeditions disproportionately influence long-term
exploration, unlocking new behavioral niches that serve as stepping stones for
subsequent search. These findings highlight E&E's capacity to break through
local novelty boundaries and explore behavioral landscapes in human-aligned,
interpretable ways, offering a promising template for open-ended exploration in
artificial life and beyond.

Abstract: The emergence of agentic AI, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), marks a
paradigm shift from reactive generative systems to proactive, goal-oriented
autonomous agents capable of sophisticated planning, memory, and tool use. This
evolution presents a novel opportunity to address long-standing challenges in
complex digital environments. Core tasks on Consumer-to-Consumer (C2C)
e-commerce platforms often require users to navigate complex Graphical User
Interfaces (GUIs), making the experience time-consuming for both buyers and
sellers. This paper introduces a novel approach to simplify these interactions
through an LLM-powered agentic assistant. This agent functions as a new,
conversational entry point to the marketplace, shifting the primary interaction
model from a complex GUI to an intuitive AI agent. By interpreting natural
language commands, the agent automates key high-friction workflows. For
sellers, this includes simplified updating and renewal of listings, and the
ability to send bulk messages. For buyers, the agent facilitates a more
efficient product discovery process through conversational search. We present
the architecture for Facebook Marketplace Assistant (FaMA), arguing that this
agentic, conversational paradigm provides a lightweight and more accessible
alternative to traditional app interfaces, allowing users to manage their
marketplace activities with greater efficiency. Experiments show FaMA achieves
a 98% task success rate on solving complex tasks on the marketplace and enables
up to a 2x speedup on interaction time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医疗基础模型通常以黑盒方式生成答案，缺乏透明的推理过程和局部可解释性，这阻碍了其在临床实践中的部署应用。

Method: 采用顺序训练流程：1）在精选的CXR指令数据上微调获得基础解读能力；2）通过高质量合成推理样本实现冷启动推理；3）通过在线强化学习提升推理质量和生成性能，生成与图像局部区域关联的答案和推理步骤。

Result: 在报告生成任务上分别比LLaVA-Rad和MedGemma提升14.54%和31.32%，在视觉问答任务上分别比MedGemma和CheXagent提升57.75%和23.06%。专家评审显示推理步骤的可解释性和临床合理性显著优于Qwen2.5-VL-7B模型（0.7416 vs 0.2584总体偏好）。

Conclusion: 该研究推动了医疗基础模型向整体性、透明性和临床可操作性方向发展，为CXR解读提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Medical foundation models (FMs) have shown tremendous promise amid the rapid
advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. However, current
medical FMs typically generate answers in a black-box manner, lacking
transparent reasoning processes and locally grounded interpretability, which
hinders their practical clinical deployments. To this end, we introduce
DeepMedix-R1, a holistic medical FM for chest X-ray (CXR) interpretation. It
leverages a sequential training pipeline: initially fine-tuned on curated CXR
instruction data to equip with fundamental CXR interpretation capabilities,
then exposed to high-quality synthetic reasoning samples to enable cold-start
reasoning, and finally refined via online reinforcement learning to enhance
both grounded reasoning quality and generation performance. Thus, the model
produces both an answer and reasoning steps tied to the image's local regions
for each query. Quantitative evaluation demonstrates substantial improvements
in report generation (e.g., 14.54% and 31.32% over LLaVA-Rad and MedGemma) and
visual question answering (e.g., 57.75% and 23.06% over MedGemma and CheXagent)
tasks. To facilitate robust assessment, we propose Report Arena, a benchmarking
framework using advanced language models to evaluate answer quality, further
highlighting the superiority of DeepMedix-R1. Expert review of generated
reasoning steps reveals greater interpretability and clinical plausibility
compared to the established Qwen2.5-VL-7B model (0.7416 vs. 0.2584 overall
preference). Collectively, our work advances medical FM development toward
holistic, transparent, and clinically actionable modeling for CXR
interpretation.

Motivation: 现有方法将控制参数隐式处理为附加约束，而不是将其作为搜索空间中的真正决策点

Method: 开发了一种最优优先的质量搜索算法，在无限的控制参数决策空间中运行，利用延迟部分扩展的概念

Result: 证明了在某些条件下的极限完备性，并显示该算法在解决涉及控制参数的规划问题时是现有方法的竞争对手

Conclusion: 显式处理控制参数作为决策点的方法是一种高效的替代方案，在自动化规划领域具有竞争力

Abstract: In automated planning, control parameters extend standard action
representations through the introduction of continuous numeric decision
variables. Existing state-of-the-art approaches have primarily handled control
parameters as embedded constraints alongside other temporal and numeric
restrictions, and thus have implicitly treated them as additional constraints
rather than as decision points in the search space. In this paper, we propose
an efficient alternative that explicitly handles control parameters as true
decision points within a systematic search scheme. We develop a best-first,
heuristic search algorithm that operates over infinite decision spaces defined
by control parameters and prove a notion of completeness in the limit under
certain conditions. Our algorithm leverages the concept of delayed partial
expansion, where a state is not fully expanded but instead incrementally
expands a subset of its successors. Our results demonstrate that this novel
search algorithm is a competitive alternative to existing approaches for
solving planning problems involving control parameters.

Conclusion: 该框架在需要适应性和数据效率的具身智能体场景中具有可扩展的实际部署潜力

Abstract: In embodied AI, a persistent challenge is enabling agents to robustly adapt
to novel domains without requiring extensive data collection or retraining. To
address this, we present a world model implanting framework (WorMI) that
combines the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) with
independently learned, domain-specific world models through test-time
composition. By allowing seamless implantation and removal of the world models,
the embodied agent's policy achieves and maintains cross-domain adaptability.
In the WorMI framework, we employ a prototype-based world model retrieval
approach, utilizing efficient trajectory-based abstract representation
matching, to incorporate relevant models into test-time composition. We also
develop a world-wise compound attention method that not only integrates the
knowledge from the retrieved world models but also aligns their intermediate
representations with the reasoning model's representation within the agent's
policy. This framework design effectively fuses domain-specific knowledge from
multiple world models, ensuring robust adaptation to unseen domains. We
evaluate our WorMI on the VirtualHome and ALFWorld benchmarks, demonstrating
superior zero-shot and few-shot performance compared to several LLM-based
approaches across a range of unseen domains. These results highlight the
frameworks potential for scalable, real-world deployment in embodied agent
scenarios where adaptability and data efficiency are essential.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有反射策略产生短暂的任务特定痕迹无法跨任务重用，而基于强化学习的方法需要大量参数更新和计算资源。需要一种既能重用纠正知识又保持语言反射适应性的方法。

Method: MPR框架将LLM生成的反思整合为结构化谓词式元策略记忆(MPM)，通过软内存引导解码和硬规则可接受性检查两种机制在推理时应用。

Result: 实验结果显示相比Reflexion基线，在执行准确性和鲁棒性方面获得一致提升，规则可接受性检查进一步提高了稳定性。

Conclusion: MPR能够在不更新模型权重的情况下外部化可重用纠正知识，强制执行领域约束减少不安全行为，同时保持基于语言反射的适应性。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents achieve impressive single-task performance
but commonly exhibit repeated failures, inefficient exploration, and limited
cross-task adaptability. Existing reflective strategies (e.g., Reflexion,
ReAct) improve per-episode behavior but typically produce ephemeral,
task-specific traces that are not reused across tasks. Reinforcement-learning
based alternatives can produce transferable policies but require substantial
parameter updates and compute. In this work we introduce Meta-Policy Reflexion
(MPR): a hybrid framework that consolidates LLM-generated reflections into a
structured, predicate-like Meta-Policy Memory (MPM) and applies that memory at
inference time through two complementary mechanisms soft memory-guided decoding
and hard rule admissibility checks(HAC). MPR (i) externalizes reusable
corrective knowledge without model weight updates, (ii) enforces domain
constraints to reduce unsafe or invalid actions, and (iii) retains the
adaptability of language-based reflection. We formalize the MPM representation,
present algorithms for update and decoding, and validate the approach in a
text-based agent environment following the experimental protocol described in
the provided implementation (AlfWorld-based). Empirical results reported in the
supplied material indicate consistent gains in execution accuracy and
robustness when compared to Reflexion baselines; rule admissibility further
improves stability. We analyze mechanisms that explain these gains, discuss
scalability and failure modes, and outline future directions for multimodal and
multi?agent extensions.

TL;DR: AutoPBO是一个基于大语言模型的框架，用于自动优化伪布尔优化(PBO)局部搜索求解器，在多个基准测试中显著优于现有局部搜索方法，并与最先进求解器保持竞争力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 伪布尔优化(PBO)局部搜索求解器的性能高度依赖内部启发式设计，但传统设计需要大量专家努力和手动调优。虽然大语言模型(LLMs)在算法设计自动化方面展现出潜力，但在优化PBO求解器方面的应用尚未探索。

Method: 提出了AutoPBO框架，利用大语言模型自动增强PBO局部搜索求解器。在四个公共基准测试上进行实验评估，包括真实世界基准、PB竞赛基准、整数线性规划优化基准和手工组合基准。

Result: AutoPBO相比之前的局部搜索方法取得了显著改进，同时与六种最先进竞争对手(包括NuPBO、OraSLS、PBO-IHS、RoundingSat、Gurobi和SCIP)保持有竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: AutoPBO为自动化局部搜索求解器设计提供了一种有前景的方法，证明了LLMs在优化PBO求解器方面的有效性。

Abstract: Pseudo-Boolean Optimization (PBO) provides a powerful framework for modeling
combinatorial problems through pseudo-Boolean (PB) constraints. Local search
solvers have shown excellent performance in PBO solving, and their efficiency
is highly dependent on their internal heuristics to guide the search. Still,
their design often requires significant expert effort and manual tuning in
practice. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in
automating algorithm design, their application to optimizing PBO solvers
remains unexplored. In this work, we introduce AutoPBO, a novel LLM-powered
framework to automatically enhance PBO local search solvers. We conduct
experiments on a broad range of four public benchmarks, including one
real-world benchmark, a benchmark from PB competition, an integer linear
programming optimization benchmark, and a crafted combinatorial benchmark, to
evaluate the performance improvement achieved by AutoPBO and compare it with
six state-of-the-art competitors, including two local search PBO solvers NuPBO
and OraSLS, two complete PB solvers PBO-IHS and RoundingSat, and two mixed
integer programming (MIP) solvers Gurobi and SCIP. AutoPBO demonstrates
significant improvements over previous local search approaches, while
maintaining competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art competitors.
The results suggest that AutoPBO offers a promising approach to automating
local search solver design.

Conclusion: 该框架不仅为过度思考等经验现象提供了连贯解释，还为开发更有效和可泛化的推理智能体奠定了坚实的理论基础

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become a pivotal approach for enhancing the
reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, a significant
theoretical gap persists, as traditional token-level RL frameworks fail to
align with the reasoning-level nature of complex, multi-step thought processes
like Chain-of-Thought (CoT). To address this challenge, we introduce CoT-Space,
a novel theoretical framework that recasts LLM reasoning from a discrete
token-prediction task to an optimization process within a continuous,
reasoning-level semantic space. By analyzing this process from both a noise
perspective and a risk perspective, we demonstrate that the convergence to an
optimal CoT length is a natural consequence of the fundamental trade-off
between underfitting and overfitting. Furthermore, extensive experiments
provide strong empirical validation for our theoretical findings. Our framework
not only provides a coherent explanation for empirical phenomena such as
overthinking but also offers a solid theoretical foundation to guide the future
development of more effective and generalizable reasoning agents.

structures corresponding to concepts in RST, a language for communicating with
the core, and an engine for producing transformations using a method we call

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve astonishing results on a wide range of
tasks. However, their formal reasoning ability still lags behind. A promising
approach is Neurosymbolic LLM reasoning. It works by using LLMs as translators
from natural to formal languages and symbolic solvers for deriving correct
results. Still, the contributing factors to the success of Neurosymbolic LLM
reasoning remain unclear. This paper demonstrates that one previously
overlooked factor is the choice of the formal language. We introduce the
intermediate language challenge: selecting a suitable formal language for
neurosymbolic reasoning. By comparing four formal languages across three
datasets and seven LLMs, we show that the choice of formal language affects
both syntactic and semantic reasoning capabilities. We also discuss the varying
effects across different LLMs.

Result: 燃油消耗与传统无约束求解器几乎相同（偏差通常在1%以内），计算速度相比传统求解器单独使用提升高达50%

Conclusion: 该方法通过RL预计算有效减少求解器搜索空间，显著加速路径优化，在保持接近最优解性能的同时大幅提升计算效率

Abstract: This paper explores the combination of Reinforcement Learning (RL) and
search-based path planners to speed up the optimization of flight paths for
airliners, where in case of emergency a fast route re-calculation can be
crucial. The fundamental idea is to train an RL Agent to pre-compute
near-optimal paths based on location and atmospheric data and use those at
runtime to constrain the underlying path planning solver and find a solution
within a certain distance from the initial guess. The approach effectively
reduces the size of the solver's search space, significantly speeding up route
optimization. Although global optimality is not guaranteed, empirical results
conducted with Airbus aircraft's performance models show that fuel consumption
remains nearly identical to that of an unconstrained solver, with deviations
typically within 1%. At the same time, computation speed can be improved by up
to 50% as compared to using a conventional solver alone.

computer-poker focus on performance metrics such as win rates, while bluffing
is overlooked. In this paper we study whether two popular algorithms, DQN
(based on reinforcement learning) and CFR (based on game theory), exhibit
bluffing behavior in Leduc Hold'em, a simplified version of poker. We designed
an experiment where we let the DQN and CFR agent play against each other while
we log their actions. We find that both DQN and CFR exhibit bluffing behavior,
but they do so in different ways. Although both attempt to perform bluffs at
different rates, the percentage of successful bluffs (where the opponent folds)
is roughly the same. This suggests that bluffing is an essential aspect of the
game, not of the algorithm. Future work should look at different bluffing
styles and at the full game of poker. Code at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨AI是否能够真正超越人类成为宇宙的领导者，分析人类与AI的根本区别

Method: 通过比较人类中枢神经系统与AI系统的本质差异，论证情感体验和道德理解的重要性

Result: 发现AI虽然可能在能力上超越人类，但缺乏中枢神经系统带来的情感体验，无法真正理解行为后果和建立可持续的伦理体系

Conclusion: 人类DNA而非硅基技术才是宇宙领导权的最佳基础，AI无法真正取代人类成为宇宙领导者

Abstract: Recent advances in AI raise the possibility that AI systems will one day be
able to do anything humans can do, only better. If artificial general
intelligence (AGI) is achieved, AI systems may be able to understand, reason,
problem solve, create, and evolve at a level and speed that humans will
increasingly be unable to match, or even understand. These possibilities raise
a natural question as to whether AI will eventually become superior to humans,
a successor "digital species", with a rightful claim to assume leadership of
the universe. However, a deeper consideration suggests the overlooked
differentiator between human beings and AI is not the brain, but the central
nervous system (CNS), providing us with an immersive integration with physical
reality. It is our CNS that enables us to experience emotion including pain,
joy, suffering, and love, and therefore to fully appreciate the consequences of
our actions on the world around us. And that emotional understanding of the
consequences of our actions is what is required to be able to develop
sustainable ethical systems, and so be fully qualified to be the leaders of the
universe. A CNS cannot be manufactured or simulated; it must be grown as a
biological construct. And so, even the development of consciousness will not be
sufficient to make AI systems superior to humans. AI systems may become more
capable than humans on almost every measure and transform our society. However,
the best foundation for leadership of our universe will always be DNA, not
silicon.

Abstract: Formalizing cooking procedures remains a challenging task due to their
inherent complexity and ambiguity. We introduce an extensible domain-specific
language for representing recipes as directed action graphs, capturing
processes, transfers, environments, concurrency, and compositional structure.
Our approach enables precise, modular modeling of complex culinary workflows.
Initial manual evaluation on a full English breakfast recipe demonstrates the
DSL's expressiveness and suitability for future automated recipe analysis and
execution. This work represents initial steps towards an action-centric
ontology for cooking, using temporal graphs to enable structured machine
understanding, precise interpretation, and scalable automation of culinary
processes - both in home kitchens and professional culinary settings.

TL;DR: 该论文研究马尔可夫逻辑网络(MLN)在无限大域上的渐近行为，分析了三种具体MLN示例的随机结构极限特性，并展示了MLN与提升贝叶斯网络在渐近意义上的不可比性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究MLN在域大小趋于无穷时的分布特性，探索不同软约束对随机结构极限行为的影响，以及比较MLN与其他概率图模型在渐近表达能力上的差异。

Method: 通过分析三种具体MLN示例：(1)单一元关系符号的无量词MLN；(2)偏好较少三角形的图MLN；(3)偏好较少高度数顶点的图MLN，研究其随机结构在域大小趋于无穷时的极限行为。

Result: 发现不同软约束会导致完全不同的极限行为，权重参数可能影响也可能不影响极限特性；证明了无量词MLN与提升贝叶斯网络在渐近意义上不可比；显示MLN在大域上几乎将所有概率质量集中在与均匀分布完全不同的可能世界区域。

Conclusion: MLN的软约束选择对渐近行为有重要影响，不同形式的MLN表现出多样化的极限特性，且MLN在渐近表达能力上与提升贝叶斯网络存在本质差异。

Abstract: A Markov logic network (MLN) determines a probability distribution on the set
of structures, or ``possible worlds'', with an arbitrary finite domain. We
study the properties of such distributions as the domain size tends to
infinity. Three types of concrete examples of MLNs will be considered, and the
properties of random structures with domain sizes tending to infinity will be
studied: (1) Arbitrary quantifier-free MLNs over a language with only one
relation symbol which has arity 1. In this case we give a pretty complete
characterization of the possible limit behaviours of random structures. (2) An
MLN that favours graphs with fewer triangles (or more generally, fewer
k-cliques). As a corollary of the analysis a ``$\delta$-approximate 0-1 law''
for first-order logic is obtained. (3) An MLN that favours graphs with fewer
vertices with degree higher than a fixed (but arbitrary) number. The analysis
shows that depending on which ``soft constraints'' an MLN uses the limit
behaviour of random structures can be quite different, and the weights of the
soft constraints may, or may not, have influence on the limit behaviour. It
will also be demonstrated, using (1), that quantifier-free MLNs and lifted
Bayesian networks (in a broad sense) are asymptotically incomparable, roughly
meaning that there is a sequence of distributions on possible worlds with
increasing domain sizes that can be defined by one of the formalisms but not
even approximated by the other. In a rather general context it is also shown
that on large domains the distribution determined by an MLN concentrates almost
all its probability mass on a totally different part of the space of possible
worlds than the uniform distribution does.

TL;DR: EvoEmo是一个进化强化学习框架，通过优化动态情绪表达来提升LLM在复杂多轮谈判中的表现，相比传统策略获得更高成功率和效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM代理在谈判中忽视了情绪的功能性作用，仅生成被动、偏好驱动的情绪响应，使其容易受到对手操纵和战略利用

Method: 将情绪状态转换建模为马尔可夫决策过程，采用基于种群的遗传优化算法，在不同谈判场景中演化高奖励的情绪策略

Result: EvoEmo consistently outperforms both baselines, achieving higher success rates, higher efficiency, and increased buyer savings

Conclusion: 自适应情绪表达对于实现更有效的多轮谈判LLM代理至关重要

Abstract: Recent research on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in Large Language Models
(LLMs) has demonstrated that agents can engage in \textit{complex},
\textit{multi-turn} negotiations, opening new avenues for agentic AI. However,
existing LLM agents largely overlook the functional role of emotions in such
negotiations, instead generating passive, preference-driven emotional responses
that make them vulnerable to manipulation and strategic exploitation by
adversarial counterparts. To address this gap, we present EvoEmo, an
evolutionary reinforcement learning framework that optimizes dynamic emotional
expression in negotiations. EvoEmo models emotional state transitions as a
Markov Decision Process and employs population-based genetic optimization to
evolve high-reward emotion policies across diverse negotiation scenarios. We
further propose an evaluation framework with two baselines -- vanilla
strategies and fixed-emotion strategies -- for benchmarking emotion-aware
negotiation. Extensive experiments and ablation studies show that EvoEmo
consistently outperforms both baselines, achieving higher success rates, higher
efficiency, and increased buyer savings. This findings highlight the importance
of adaptive emotional expression in enabling more effective LLM agents for
multi-turn negotiation.

TL;DR: AlphaZero框架在测试环境变化时的性能提升方法分析


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AlphaZero通常假设训练和测试环境相同，这限制了其在实际应用中的适用性。本文旨在解决AlphaZero代理在可能变化的测试环境中的部署问题。

Method: 通过对标准框架进行简单修改的组合，包括调整蒙特卡洛规划和策略价值神经网络的使用方式，以适应环境变化。

Result: 即使在规划预算较低的情况下，这些修改也能显著提升AlphaZero在变化环境中的性能表现。

Conclusion: 通过简单的框架修改，可以有效增强AlphaZero在动态测试环境中的适应能力和性能，代码已在GitHub上公开。

Abstract: The AlphaZero framework provides a standard way of combining Monte Carlo
planning with prior knowledge provided by a previously trained policy-value
neural network. AlphaZero usually assumes that the environment on which the
neural network was trained will not change at test time, which constrains its
applicability. In this paper, we analyze the problem of deploying AlphaZero
agents in potentially changed test environments and demonstrate how the
combination of simple modifications to the standard framework can significantly
boost performance, even in settings with a low planning budget available. The
code is publicly available on GitHub.

Motivation: 将心理学人格理论（如MBTI）与LLM智能体行为设计相结合，通过人格条件化提升智能体在不同任务中的表现一致性和可解释性。

Method: 使用MBTI人格原型通过提示工程对LLM智能体进行人格条件化，并整合16Personalities测试进行自动化特质验证，支持扩展到其他心理学框架。

Conclusion: 该框架为无需微调的心理学增强AI智能体奠定了基础，成功将心理学理论与LLM行为设计相融合，支持结构化多智能体通信协议实验。

Abstract: We introduce MBTI-in-Thoughts, a framework for enhancing the effectiveness of
Large Language Model (LLM) agents through psychologically grounded personality
conditioning. Drawing on the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), our method
primes agents with distinct personality archetypes via prompt engineering,
enabling control over behavior along two foundational axes of human psychology,
cognition and affect. We show that such personality priming yields consistent,
interpretable behavioral biases across diverse tasks: emotionally expressive
agents excel in narrative generation, while analytically primed agents adopt
more stable strategies in game-theoretic settings. Our framework supports
experimenting with structured multi-agent communication protocols and reveals
that self-reflection prior to interaction improves cooperation and reasoning
quality. To ensure trait persistence, we integrate the official 16Personalities
test for automated verification. While our focus is on MBTI, we show that our
approach generalizes seamlessly to other psychological frameworks such as Big
Five, HEXACO, or Enneagram. By bridging psychological theory and LLM behavior
design, we establish a foundation for psychologically enhanced AI agents
without any fine-tuning.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种概念级外部记忆方法，通过从推理轨迹中提取可重用的模块化抽象概念，使LLM能够在测试时持续学习而无需权重更新，在ARC-AGI基准上实现了7.5%的相对性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的推理时扩展虽然使LLM能够进行更长的推理，但这些推理过程中发现的模式和见解在上下文窗口重置后就被丢弃。外部记忆可以持久化这些发现，但现有方法主要基于实例级记忆，缺乏可重用性和扩展性。

Method: 提出概念级记忆方法：从解决方案轨迹中提取可重用、模块化的自然语言抽象概念；引入新的抽象策略从推理轨迹中提取要点；为新的查询选择性地检索和整合相关概念到提示中。

Result: 在挑战性的ARC-AGI基准上，相比无记忆的强基线获得了7.5%的相对性能提升，性能随着推理计算量的增加而持续扩展；抽象概念在所有测试的推理计算规模上都优于基线。

Conclusion: 概念级记忆是最一致的内存设计，动态更新内存比固定内存设置表现更好，支持了通过解决更多问题并向内存抽象更多模式来实现自我改进的假设。

Abstract: While inference-time scaling enables LLMs to carry out increasingly long and
capable reasoning traces, the patterns and insights uncovered during these
traces are immediately discarded once the context window is reset for a new
query. External memory is a natural way to persist these discoveries, and
recent work has shown clear benefits for reasoning-intensive tasks. We see an
opportunity to make such memories more broadly reusable and scalable by moving
beyond instance-based memory entries (e.g. exact query/response pairs, or
summaries tightly coupled with the original problem context) toward
concept-level memory: reusable, modular abstractions distilled from solution
traces and stored in natural language. For future queries, relevant concepts
are selectively retrieved and integrated into the prompt, enabling test-time
continual learning without weight updates. Our design introduces new strategies
for abstracting takeaways from rollouts and retrieving entries for new queries,
promoting reuse and allowing memory to expand with additional experiences. On
the challenging ARC-AGI benchmark, our method yields a 7.5% relative gain over
a strong no-memory baseline with performance continuing to scale with inference
compute. We find abstract concepts to be the most consistent memory design,
outscoring the baseline at all tested inference compute scales. Moreover, we
confirm that dynamically updating memory during test-time outperforms an
otherwise identical fixed memory setting with additional attempts, supporting
the hypothesis that solving more problems and abstracting more patterns to
memory enables further solutions in a form of self-improvement. Code available
at https://github.com/matt-seb-ho/arc_memo.
