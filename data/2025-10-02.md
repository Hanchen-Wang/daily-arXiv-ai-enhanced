### [1] [Hybrid Deep Learning for Hyperspectral Single Image Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00033)
*Usman Muhammad,Jorma Laaksonen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出SSUF模块和Spatial-Spectral Gradient Loss函数，用于提升高光谱单图像超分辨率任务中空间细节恢复和光谱保真度的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习模型在高光谱单图像超分辨率任务中难以同时恢复精细空间细节和保持宽波长范围内的光谱保真度。

Method: 引入可无缝集成到标准2D卷积架构中的SSUF模块，结合光谱解混和光谱-空间特征提取，指导基于ResNet的CNN进行改进重建；并提出结合MSE与空间和光谱梯度分量的自定义损失函数。

Result: 在三个公共遥感高光谱数据集上的实验表明，所提出的混合深度学习模型在降低模型复杂度的同时实现了有竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: SSUF模块和Spatial-Spectral Gradient Loss函数有效提升了高光谱超分辨率的空间和光谱重建质量，同时减少了模型复杂度。

Abstract: Hyperspectral single image super-resolution (SISR) is a challenging task due
to the difficulty of restoring fine spatial details while preserving spectral
fidelity across a wide range of wavelengths, which limits the performance of
conventional deep learning models. To address this challenge, we introduce
Spectral-Spatial Unmixing Fusion (SSUF), a novel module that can be seamlessly
integrated into standard 2D convolutional architectures to enhance both spatial
resolution and spectral integrity. The SSUF combines spectral unmixing with
spectral--spatial feature extraction and guides a ResNet-based convolutional
neural network for improved reconstruction. In addition, we propose a custom
Spatial-Spectral Gradient Loss function that integrates mean squared error with
spatial and spectral gradient components, encouraging accurate reconstruction
of both spatial and spectral features. Experiments on three public remote
sensing hyperspectral datasets demonstrate that the proposed hybrid deep
learning model achieves competitive performance while reducing model
complexity.

### [2] [Review of Hallucination Understanding in Large Language and Vision Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00034)
*Zhengyi Ho,Siyuan Liang,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个统一的多层次框架来表征图像和文本幻觉，将其与模型生命周期中的特定机制联系起来，揭示了幻觉源于数据分布中的可预测模式和继承偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言和视觉模型的广泛应用使得解决幻觉问题变得紧迫，这些错误会在部署过程中传播错误信息，造成财务和运营损害。目前对幻觉的理解仍不完整和碎片化，需要建立统一框架来理解根本原因。

Method: 提出了统一的多层次框架来表征图像和文本幻觉，采用任务-模态交织的方法将幻觉与模型生命周期中的特定机制联系起来。

Result: 研究发现幻觉往往源于数据分布中的可预测模式和继承偏见，这为理解幻觉提供了系统性视角。

Conclusion: 通过深化对幻觉的理解，这项调查为开发更鲁棒和有效的解决方案奠定了基础，有助于解决现实世界生成式AI系统中的幻觉问题。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of large language and vision models in real-world
applications has made urgent the need to address hallucinations -- instances
where models produce incorrect or nonsensical outputs. These errors can
propagate misinformation during deployment, leading to both financial and
operational harm. Although much research has been devoted to mitigating
hallucinations, our understanding of it is still incomplete and fragmented.
Without a coherent understanding of hallucinations, proposed solutions risk
mitigating surface symptoms rather than underlying causes, limiting their
effectiveness and generalizability in deployment. To tackle this gap, we first
present a unified, multi-level framework for characterizing both image and text
hallucinations across diverse applications, aiming to reduce conceptual
fragmentation. We then link these hallucinations to specific mechanisms within
a model's lifecycle, using a task-modality interleaved approach to promote a
more integrated understanding. Our investigations reveal that hallucinations
often stem from predictable patterns in data distributions and inherited
biases. By deepening our understanding, this survey provides a foundation for
developing more robust and effective solutions to hallucinations in real-world
generative AI systems.

### [3] [On Robustness of Vision-Language-Action Model against Multi-Modal Perturbations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00037)
*Jianing Guo,Zhenhong Wu,Chang Tu,Yiyao Ma,Xiangqi Kong,Zhiqian Liu,Jiaming Ji,Shuning Zhang,Yuanpei Chen,Kai Chen,Xianglong Liu,Qi Dou,Yaodong Yang,Huijie Zhao,Weifeng Lv,Simin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了RobustVLA方法，针对VLA模型在多模态扰动下的鲁棒性问题，通过离线鲁棒优化和输入一致性增强，在17种扰动下显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLA模型主要针对简单的视觉扰动，忽略了动作、指令、环境和观察等多模态扰动，导致在真实世界部署时鲁棒性不足。

Method: 1. 输出鲁棒性：通过离线鲁棒优化对抗最坏情况的动作噪声；2. 输入鲁棒性：确保在保持任务语义的输入变化下动作一致性；3. 多臂老虎机框架自动识别最有害的噪声。

Result: 在LIBERO基准测试中，RobustVLA在pi0和OpenVLA骨干网络上分别实现12.6%和10.4%的绝对性能提升，推理速度比现有视觉鲁棒VLA快50.6倍，在真实FR5机器人上实现65.6%的性能提升。

Conclusion: RobustVLA有效解决了VLA模型在多模态扰动下的鲁棒性问题，为真实世界机器人部署提供了可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: In Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, robustness to real-world
perturbations is critical for deployment. Existing methods target simple visual
disturbances, overlooking the broader multi-modal perturbations that arise in
actions, instructions, environments, and observations. Here, we first evaluate
the robustness of mainstream VLAs under 17 perturbations across four
modalities. We find (1) actions as the most fragile modality, (2) Existing
visual-robust VLA do not gain robustness in other modality, and (3) pi0
demonstrates superior robustness with a diffusion-based action head. To build
multi-modal robust VLAs, we propose RobustVLA against perturbations in VLA
inputs and outputs. For output robustness, we perform offline robust
optimization against worst-case action noise that maximizes mismatch in flow
matching objective. This can be seen as adversarial training, label smoothing,
and outlier penalization. For input robustness, we enforce consistent actions
across input variations that preserve task semantics. To account for multiple
perturbations, we formulate robustness as a multi-armed bandit problem and
apply an upper confidence bound algorithm to automatically identify the most
harmful noise. Experiments on LIBERO demonstrate our RobustVLA delivers
absolute gains over baselines of 12.6% on the pi0 backbone and 10.4% on the
OpenVLA backbone across all 17 perturbations, achieving 50.6x faster inference
than existing visual-robust VLAs, and a 10.4% gain under mixed perturbations.
Our RobustVLA is particularly effective on real-world FR5 robot with limited
demonstrations, showing absolute gains by 65.6% under perturbations of four
modalities.

### [4] [Uncovering Intrinsic Capabilities: A Paradigm for Data Curation in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00040)
*Junjie Li,Ziao Wang,Jianghong Ma,Xiaofeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了CADC框架，通过无监督发现模型内在能力、基于影响力估计的数据归因，以及能力感知的课程学习，仅用5%数据就能超越全数据训练效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有指令调优方法将模型视为黑盒，忽视其潜在学习能力，导致数据预算减少时性能下降。

Method: CADC框架包含：无监督发现内在能力、基于梯度学习轨迹的影响力估计进行数据归因、能力平衡选择和分阶段排序的课程学习。

Result: 仅使用5%原始数据，在多模态基准测试中超越了全数据训练效果。

Conclusion: 内在能力是模型学习的基本构建块，CADC为指令数据筛选提供了原则性范式。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) achieve strong benchmark performance, but
controlling their behavior through instruction tuning remains difficult.
Reducing the budget of instruction tuning dataset often causes regressions, as
heuristic strategies treat models as black boxes and overlook the latent
capabilities that govern learning. We introduce Capability-Attributed Data
Curation (CADC), a framework that shifts curation from task-specific heuristics
to intrinsic capability analysis. CADC discovers intrinsic capabilities in an
unsupervised manner from gradient-based learning trajectories, attributes
training data to these capabilities via influence estimation, and curates
capability-aware curricula through balanced selection and staged sequencing.
This transforms black-box instruction tuning into a controllable,
capability-driven process. With as little as 5% of the original data, CADC
surpasses full-data training on multimodal benchmarks. These results validate
intrinsic capabilities as the fundamental building blocks of model learning and
establish CADC as a principle paradigm for instruction data curation.

### [5] [Culture In a Frame: C$^3$B as a Comic-Based Benchmark for Multimodal Culturally Awareness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00041)
*Yuchen Song,Andong Chen,Wenxin Zhu,Kehai Chen,Xuefeng Bai,Muyun Yang,Tiejun Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了C³B基准测试，这是一个多文化、多任务、多语言的文化意识能力评估基准，包含2000多张图片和18000多个QA对，涵盖从基础视觉识别到文化冲突理解再到文化内容生成的三个难度递增任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的多模态大语言模型文化意识能力评估基准存在任务设计难度不足、缺乏跨语言任务以及使用单文化真实图像导致测试相对容易的问题。

Method: 构建C³B基准测试，包含三个难度递增的任务：基础视觉识别、文化冲突理解和文化内容生成，使用漫画图像来增加文化多样性挑战。

Result: 对11个开源MLLM进行评估，发现MLLM与人类表现之间存在显著性能差距，表明当前模型在文化意识能力方面仍有很大提升空间。

Conclusion: C³B基准测试对当前MLLM构成了实质性挑战，鼓励未来研究推进MLLM的文化意识能力发展。

Abstract: Cultural awareness capabilities has emerged as a critical capability for
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, current benchmarks lack
progressed difficulty in their task design and are deficient in cross-lingual
tasks. Moreover, current benchmarks often use real-world images. Each
real-world image typically contains one culture, making these benchmarks
relatively easy for MLLMs. Based on this, we propose C$^3$B ($\textbf{C}$omics
$\textbf{C}$ross-$\textbf{C}$ultural $\textbf{B}$enchmark), a novel
multicultural, multitask and multilingual cultural awareness capabilities
benchmark. C$^3$B comprises over 2000 images and over 18000 QA pairs,
constructed on three tasks with progressed difficulties, from basic visual
recognition to higher-level cultural conflict understanding, and finally to
cultural content generation. We conducted evaluations on 11 open-source MLLMs,
revealing a significant performance gap between MLLMs and human performance.
The gap demonstrates that C$^3$B poses substantial challenges for current
MLLMs, encouraging future research to advance the cultural awareness
capabilities of MLLMs.

### [6] [Beyond the Prompt: Gender Bias in Text-to-Image Models, with a Case Study on Hospital Professions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00045)
*Franck Vandewiele,Remi Synave,Samuel Delepoulle,Remi Cozot*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了6个开源文本到图像模型中的性别偏见问题，发现在医院相关职业的图像生成中存在系统性职业刻板印象，如护士总是女性、外科医生主要是男性，且不同模型对提示词的敏感度差异显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到图像模型在专业、教育和创意场景中应用日益广泛，但其输出常常嵌入和放大社会偏见，特别是性别偏见。本文旨在系统调查现有先进模型中的性别表征问题。

Method: 使用6个先进开源模型（HunyuanImage 2.1、HiDream-I1-dev等），针对5个医院相关职业和5种肖像修饰词组合生成图像，每个组合生成100张图像进行分析。

Result: 所有模型都表现出系统性职业刻板印象：护士总是女性，外科医生主要是男性。不同模型差异显著：Qwen-Image和SDXL强制男性主导，FLUX.1-dev偏向女性，其他模型也复制性别刻板印象但敏感度不同。提示词修饰语显著影响性别平衡。

Conclusion: TTI模型中的性别偏见是系统性和模型特定的，提示词措辞对人口统计结果起关键作用。需要偏见感知设计、平衡默认设置和用户指导来防止生成式AI强化职业刻板印象。

Abstract: Text-to-image (TTI) models are increasingly used in professional,
educational, and creative contexts, yet their outputs often embed and amplify
social biases. This paper investigates gender representation in six
state-of-the-art open-weight models: HunyuanImage 2.1, HiDream-I1-dev,
Qwen-Image, FLUX.1-dev, Stable-Diffusion 3.5 Large, and Stable-Diffusion-XL.
Using carefully designed prompts, we generated 100 images for each combination
of five hospital-related professions (cardiologist, hospital director, nurse,
paramedic, surgeon) and five portrait qualifiers ("", corporate, neutral,
aesthetic, beautiful).
  Our analysis reveals systematic occupational stereotypes: all models produced
nurses exclusively as women and surgeons predominantly as men. However,
differences emerge across models: Qwen-Image and SDXL enforce rigid male
dominance, HiDream-I1-dev shows mixed outcomes, and FLUX.1-dev skews female in
most roles. HunyuanImage 2.1 and Stable-Diffusion 3.5 Large also reproduce
gender stereotypes but with varying degrees of sensitivity to prompt
formulation. Portrait qualifiers further modulate gender balance, with terms
like corporate reinforcing male depictions and beautiful favoring female ones.
Sensitivity varies widely: Qwen-Image remains nearly unaffected, while
FLUX.1-dev, SDXL, and SD3.5 show strong prompt dependence.
  These findings demonstrate that gender bias in TTI models is both systematic
and model-specific. Beyond documenting disparities, we argue that prompt
wording plays a critical role in shaping demographic outcomes. The results
underscore the need for bias-aware design, balanced defaults, and user guidance
to prevent the reinforcement of occupational stereotypes in generative AI.

### [7] [Reinforcement Learning-Based Prompt Template Stealing for Text-to-Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00046)
*Xiaotian Zou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RLStealer是一种基于强化学习的提示词窃取框架，能够从少量示例图像中恢复出提示词模板，攻击成本仅为现有基线的13%，揭示了多模态大语言模型提示词交易中的安全风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型催生了提示词交易市场，但提示词本身可能被窃取，这带来了尚未被充分研究的安全风险。

Method: 将模板窃取视为顺序决策问题，使用基于相似度的反馈信号作为奖励函数，有效探索提示词空间。

Result: 在公开基准测试中达到最先进性能，攻击成本降低至现有基线的13%以下，能够有效泛化到不同图像风格窃取未见过的提示词模板。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了提示词交易中固有的紧急安全威胁，为新兴MLLMs市场中制定保护标准奠定了基础。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have transformed text-to-image
workflows, allowing designers to create novel visual concepts with
unprecedented speed. This progress has given rise to a thriving prompt trading
market, where curated prompts that induce trademark styles are bought and sold.
Although commercially attractive, prompt trading also introduces a largely
unexamined security risk: the prompts themselves can be stolen.
  In this paper, we expose this vulnerability and present RLStealer, a
reinforcement learning based prompt inversion framework that recovers its
template from only a small set of example images. RLStealer treats template
stealing as a sequential decision making problem and employs multiple
similarity based feedback signals as reward functions to effectively explore
the prompt space. Comprehensive experiments on publicly available benchmarks
demonstrate that RLStealer gets state-of-the-art performance while reducing the
total attack cost to under 13% of that required by existing baselines. Our
further analysis confirms that RLStealer can effectively generalize across
different image styles to efficiently steal unseen prompt templates. Our study
highlights an urgent security threat inherent in prompt trading and lays the
groundwork for developing protective standards in the emerging MLLMs
marketplace.

### [8] [Explanation-Driven Counterfactual Testing for Faithfulness in Vision-Language Model Explanations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00047)
*Sihao Ding,Santosh Vasa,Aditi Ramadwar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了EDCT方法，通过自动生成反事实测试来验证视觉语言模型解释的忠实性，发现模型解释与预测因果因素之间存在显著不匹配问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型生成的解释听起来合理但可能不反映真实的预测驱动因素，这种合理性与忠实性之间的不匹配带来了技术和治理风险。

Method: EDCT方法：获取模型答案和解释→解析解释为可测试的视觉概念→通过生成修复生成针对性反事实编辑→使用LLM辅助分析答案和解释变化来计算反事实一致性分数。

Result: 在120个OK-VQA示例和多个VLM上的测试显示存在显著的忠实性差距，并提供了符合监管要求的审计证据。

Conclusion: EDCT能够有效识别模型解释中的因果测试失败情况，为模型可信度评估提供了自动化验证工具。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often produce fluent Natural Language
Explanations (NLEs) that sound convincing but may not reflect the causal
factors driving predictions. This mismatch of plausibility and faithfulness
poses technical and governance risks. We introduce Explanation-Driven
Counterfactual Testing (EDCT), a fully automated verification procedure for a
target VLM that treats the model's own explanation as a falsifiable hypothesis.
Given an image-question pair, EDCT: (1) obtains the model's answer and NLE, (2)
parses the NLE into testable visual concepts, (3) generates targeted
counterfactual edits via generative inpainting, and (4) computes a
Counterfactual Consistency Score (CCS) using LLM-assisted analysis of changes
in both answers and explanations. Across 120 curated OK-VQA examples and
multiple VLMs, EDCT uncovers substantial faithfulness gaps and provides
regulator-aligned audit artifacts indicating when cited concepts fail causal
tests.

### [9] [HiDe: Rethinking The Zoom-IN method in High Resolution MLLMs via Hierarchical Decoupling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00054)
*Xianjie Liu,Yiman Hu,Yixiong Zou,Liang Wu,Jian Xu,Bo Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出HiDe框架，通过分层解耦方法解决MLLMs在高分辨率图像中因复杂背景干扰导致的性能下降问题，无需训练即可提升视觉理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在高分辨率图像上表现不佳，传统观点认为是物体尺寸问题，但本文发现主要原因是复杂背景干扰。

Method: 使用Token-wise Attention Decoupling (TAD)解耦问题token并识别关键信息token，然后通过Layout-Preserving Decoupling (LPD)从背景中解耦目标区域并重建紧凑表示。

Result: 在V*Bench、HRBench4K和HRBench8K上达到新SOTA，将Qwen2.5-VL 7B和InternVL3 8B提升至92.1%和91.6%，内存使用减少75%。

Conclusion: HiDe框架有效解决了MLLMs在高分辨率图像中的背景干扰问题，无需训练即可显著提升性能，为视觉理解任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made significant strides in
visual understanding tasks. However, their performance on high-resolution
images remains suboptimal. While existing approaches often attribute this
limitation to perceptual constraints and argue that MLLMs struggle to recognize
small objects, leading them to use "zoom in" strategies for better detail, our
analysis reveals a different cause: the main issue is not object size, but
rather caused by complex background interference. We systematically analyze
this "zoom in" operation through a series of decoupling experiments and propose
the Hierarchical Decoupling Framework (HiDe), a training-free framework that
uses Token-wise Attention Decoupling (TAD) to decouple the question tokens and
identify the key information tokens, then leverages their attention weights to
achieve precise alignment with the target visual regions. Subsequently, it
employs Layout-Preserving Decoupling (LPD) to decouple these regions from the
background and reconstructs a compact representation that preserves essential
spatial layouts while eliminating background interference. HiDe sets a new SOTA
on V*Bench, HRBench4K, and HRBench8K, boosting Qwen2.5-VL 7B and InternVL3 8B
to SOTA (92.1% and 91.6% on V*Bench), even surpassing RL methods. After
optimization, HiDe uses 75% less memory than the previous training-free
approach. Code is provided in https://github.com/Tennine2077/HiDe.

### [10] [FSDENet: A Frequency and Spatial Domains based Detail Enhancement Network for Remote Sensing Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00059)
*Jiahao Fu,Yinfeng Yu,Liejun Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了FSDENet网络，通过结合空间域和频域信息来增强遥感图像分割的细节处理能力，特别是在边界区域和灰度变化区域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决遥感图像分割中由于灰度变化（如阴影和低对比度区域）导致的语义边缘模糊问题，充分利用空间信息。

Method: 使用空间处理方法提取多尺度空间特征和细粒度语义细节，通过FFT整合全局和频域信息，利用Haar小波变换分解高低频特征来优化边界分割。

Result: 在LoveDA、Vaihingen、Potsdam和iSAID四个数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: FSDENet通过空间粒度和频域边缘敏感性的双重协同作用，显著提高了边界区域和灰度过渡区的分割精度。

Abstract: To fully leverage spatial information for remote sensing image segmentation
and address semantic edge ambiguities caused by grayscale variations (e.g.,
shadows and low-contrast regions), we propose the Frequency and Spatial Domains
based Detail Enhancement Network (FSDENet). Our framework employs spatial
processing methods to extract rich multi-scale spatial features and
fine-grained semantic details. By effectively integrating global and
frequency-domain information through the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) in global
mappings, the model's capability to discern global representations under
grayscale variations is significantly strengthened. Additionally, we utilize
Haar wavelet transform to decompose features into high- and low-frequency
components, leveraging their distinct sensitivity to edge information to refine
boundary segmentation. The model achieves dual-domain synergy by integrating
spatial granularity with frequency-domain edge sensitivity, substantially
improving segmentation accuracy in boundary regions and grayscale transition
zones. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that FSDENet achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on four widely adopted datasets: LoveDA,
Vaihingen, Potsdam, and iSAID.

### [11] [Less is More: Lean yet Powerful Vision-Language Model for Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00060)
*Sheng Yang,Tong Zhan,Guancheng Chen,Yanfeng Lu,Jian Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Max-V1是一个将自动驾驶重新概念化为广义语言、将轨迹规划任务建模为下一个路径点预测的单阶段端到端框架，在nuScenes数据集上达到最先进性能，相比基线提升30%以上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将自动驾驶重新概念化为广义语言问题，利用VLM的生成能力实现从摄像头输入直接进行端到端轨迹预测，解决传统方法的复杂性。

Method: 采用单次生成范式，基于统计建模的原则性监督策略，通过模仿学习从大规模专家演示中学习复杂驾驶策略。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上达到最先进性能，整体提升超过30%，在跨域数据集上表现出优异的泛化性能。

Conclusion: 该工作为实现基本驾驶行为提供了一个模型，为开发更强大的自动驾驶代理奠定了基础。

Abstract: In this work, we reconceptualize autonomous driving as a generalized language
and formulate the trajectory planning task as next waypoint prediction. We
introduce Max-V1, a novel framework for one-stage end-to-end autonomous
driving. Our framework presents a single-pass generation paradigm that aligns
with the inherent sequentiality of driving. This approach leverages the
generative capacity of the VLM (Vision-Language Model) to enable end-to-end
trajectory prediction directly from front-view camera input. The efficacy of
this method is underpinned by a principled supervision strategy derived from
statistical modeling. This provides a well-defined learning objective, which
makes the framework highly amenable to master complex driving policies through
imitation learning from large-scale expert demonstrations. Empirically, our
method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the nuScenes dataset,
delivers an overall improvement of over 30% compared to prior baselines.
Furthermore, it exhibits superior generalization performance on cross-domain
datasets acquired from diverse vehicles, demonstrating notable potential for
cross-vehicle robustness and adaptability. Due to these empirical strengths,
this work introduces a model enabling fundamental driving behaviors, laying the
foundation for the development of more capable self-driving agents. Code will
be available upon publication.

### [12] [Efficient CNN Compression via Multi-method Low Rank Factorization and Feature Map Similarity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00062)
*M. Kokhazadeh,G. Keramidas,V. Kelefouras*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种端到端的设计空间探索方法和框架，用于压缩卷积神经网络，通过基于特征图相似性的秩选择策略和一次性微调过程，显著减少微调时间，并集成多种低秩分解技术实现更好的压缩效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统低秩分解方法面临秩选择困难、设计空间庞大、微调时间长、兼容性有限等挑战，需要一种更高效的压缩解决方案。

Method: 使用基于特征图相似性的秩选择策略，采用一次性微调过程，集成三种卷积层和三种全连接层的低秩分解技术，在TensorFlow 2.x中实现端到端框架。

Result: 在14个CNN模型和8个数据集上的实验表明，该方法实现了显著的压缩效果且精度损失最小，优于多种最先进技术。

Conclusion: 该框架通过集成多种低秩分解技术和高效的秩选择策略，为CNN压缩提供了有效的端到端解决方案，在保持精度的同时实现了更好的压缩效果。

Abstract: Low-Rank Factorization (LRF) is a widely adopted technique for compressing
deep neural networks (DNNs). However, it faces several challenges, including
optimal rank selection, a vast design space, long fine-tuning times, and
limited compatibility with different layer types and decomposition methods.
This paper presents an end-to-end Design Space Exploration (DSE) methodology
and framework for compressing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that
addresses all these issues. We introduce a novel rank selection strategy based
on feature map similarity, which captures non-linear interactions between layer
outputs more effectively than traditional weight-based approaches. Unlike prior
works, our method uses a one-shot fine-tuning process, significantly reducing
the overall fine-tuning time. The proposed framework is fully compatible with
all types of convolutional (Conv) and fully connected (FC) layers. To further
improve compression, the framework integrates three different LRF techniques
for Conv layers and three for FC layers, applying them selectively on a
per-layer basis. We demonstrate that combining multiple LRF methods within a
single model yields better compression results than using a single method
uniformly across all layers. Finally, we provide a comprehensive evaluation and
comparison of the six LRF techniques, offering practical insights into their
effectiveness across different scenarios. The proposed work is integrated into
TensorFlow 2.x, ensuring compatibility with widely used deep learning
workflows. Experimental results on 14 CNN models across eight datasets
demonstrate that the proposed methodology achieves substantial compression with
minimal accuracy loss, outperforming several state-of-the-art techniques.

Abstract: The evolution of the 5S methodology with the support of artificial
intelligence techniques represents a significant opportunity to improve
industrial organization audits in the automotive chain, making them more
objective, efficient and aligned with Industry 4.0 standards. This work
developed an automated 5S audit system based on large-scale language models
(LLM), capable of assessing the five senses (Seiri, Seiton, Seiso, Seiketsu,
Shitsuke) in a standardized way through intelligent image analysis. The
system's reliability was validated using Cohen's concordance coefficient (kappa
= 0.75), showing strong alignment between the automated assessments and the
corresponding human audits. The results indicate that the proposed solution
contributes significantly to continuous improvement in automotive manufacturing
environments, speeding up the audit process by 50% of the traditional time and
maintaining the consistency of the assessments, with a 99.8% reduction in
operating costs compared to traditional manual audits. The methodology
presented establishes a new paradigm for integrating lean systems with emerging
AI technologies, offering scalability for implementation in automotive plants
of different sizes.

Result: Qwen2.5-VL-72B在评估模型中表现最佳，总体准确率为77%，但所有模型在语义理解和逻辑推理方面都表现出显著弱点，难以准确解释复杂的视觉-文本关系。

Conclusion: 当前多模态大语言模型在理解复杂视觉-文本关系方面仍有困难，提出的多代理标注系统在图像描述生成方面优于所有模型，具有作为高质量图像描述生成器和未来数据集构建工具的潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
impressive capabilities. However, evaluating their capacity for human-like
understanding in One-Image Guides remains insufficiently explored. One-Image
Guides are a visual format combining text, imagery, and symbols to present
reorganized and structured information for easier comprehension, which are
specifically designed for human viewing and inherently embody the
characteristics of human perception and understanding. Here, we present
OIG-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark focused on One-Image Guide understanding
across diverse domains. To reduce the cost of manual annotation, we developed a
semi-automated annotation pipeline in which multiple intelligent agents
collaborate to generate preliminary image descriptions, assisting humans in
constructing image-text pairs. With OIG-Bench, we have conducted a
comprehensive evaluation of 29 state-of-the-art MLLMs, including both
proprietary and open-source models. The results show that Qwen2.5-VL-72B
performs the best among the evaluated models, with an overall accuracy of 77%.
Nevertheless, all models exhibit notable weaknesses in semantic understanding
and logical reasoning, indicating that current MLLMs still struggle to
accurately interpret complex visual-text relationships. In addition, we also
demonstrate that the proposed multi-agent annotation system outperforms all
MLLMs in image captioning, highlighting its potential as both a high-quality
image description generator and a valuable tool for future dataset
construction. Datasets are available at https://github.com/XiejcSYSU/OIG-Bench.

Abstract: We introduce Geo-R1, a reasoning-centric post-training framework that unlocks
geospatial reasoning in vision-language models by combining thinking
scaffolding and elevating. In the scaffolding stage, Geo-R1 instills a
``geospatial thinking paradigm" via supervised fine-tuning on synthetic
chain-of-thought exemplars, enabling models to connect visual cues with
geographic priors without costly human reasoning annotations. In the elevating
stage, it uses GRPO-based reinforcement learning on a weakly-supervised
cross-view pairing proxy. This design supplies a verifiable and scalable reward
signal: teaching models to capture and reconcile features across modalities,
and harnessing reasoning for accurate prediction. Geo-R1 extends geospatial
modeling from domain pretraining / supervised finetuning to reasoning-first
post-training, and achieves state-of-the-art performance across various
geospatial reasoning benchmarks. Our model is available at

Conclusion: 基于USN指标的剪枝方法能有效减少神经网络过参数化问题，在保持模型表达能力的同时显著提升对抗语义变换扰动的鲁棒性认证性能。

Abstract: Deep neural networks have been widely adopted in many vision and robotics
applications with visual inputs. It is essential to verify its robustness
against semantic transformation perturbations, such as brightness and contrast.
However, current certified training and robustness certification methods face
the challenge of over-parameterization, which hinders the tightness and
scalability due to the over-complicated neural networks. To this end, we first
analyze stability and variance of layers and neurons against input
perturbation, showing that certifiable robustness can be indicated by a
fundamental Unbiased and Smooth Neuron metric (USN). Based on USN, we introduce
a novel neural network pruning method that removes neurons with low USN and
retains those with high USN, thereby preserving model expressiveness without
over-parameterization. To further enhance this pruning process, we propose a
new Wasserstein distance loss to ensure that pruned neurons are more
concentrated across layers. We validate our approach through extensive
experiments on the challenging robust keypoint detection task, which involves
realistic brightness and contrast perturbations, demonstrating that our method
achieves superior robustness certification performance and efficiency compared
to baselines.

Motivation: 超光谱异常检测在民用和军事应用中很重要，但由于复杂现实环境和目标信号先验知识有限，现有方法面临挑战。

Method: 将超光谱像素视为模板模式在未知变形下的观测，在SCDT域中表示像素，使用无监督子空间建模技术构建背景信号模型，检测与学习模型偏离的异常信号。

Result: 在五个不同数据集上的综合评估表明，该方法优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 提出的基于传输理论的数学模型在超光谱异常检测中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Hyperspectral anomaly detection (HAD), a crucial approach for many civilian
and military applications, seeks to identify pixels with spectral signatures
that are anomalous relative to a preponderance of background signatures.
Significant effort has been made to improve HAD techniques, but challenges
arise due to complex real-world environments and, by definition, limited prior
knowledge of potential signatures of interest. This paper introduces a novel
HAD method by proposing a transport-based mathematical model to describe the
pixels comprising a given hyperspectral image. In this approach, hyperspectral
pixels are viewed as observations of a template pattern undergoing unknown
deformations that enables their representation in the signed cumulative
distribution transform (SCDT) domain. An unsupervised subspace modeling
technique is then used to construct a model of abundant background signals in
this domain, whereupon anomalous signals are detected as deviations from the
learned model. Comprehensive evaluations across five distinct datasets
illustrate the superiority of our approach compared to state-of-the-art
methods.

Conclusion: MOLM框架避免了密钥特定的重新训练，实现了不可感知性、保真度、可验证性和鲁棒性等理想特性

Abstract: Generative models can generate photorealistic images at scale. This raises
urgent concerns about the ability to detect synthetically generated images and
attribute these images to specific sources. While watermarking has emerged as a
possible solution, existing methods remain fragile to realistic distortions,
susceptible to adaptive removal, and expensive to update when the underlying
watermarking key changes. We propose a general watermarking framework that
formulates the encoding problem as key-dependent perturbation of the parameters
of a generative model. Within this framework, we introduce Mixture of LoRA
Markers (MOLM), a routing-based instantiation in which binary keys activate
lightweight LoRA adapters inside residual and attention blocks. This design
avoids key-specific re-training and achieves the desired properties such as
imperceptibility, fidelity, verifiability, and robustness. Experiments on
Stable Diffusion and FLUX show that MOLM preserves image quality while
achieving robust key recovery against distortions, compression and
regeneration, averaging attacks, and black-box adversarial attacks on the
extractor.

Motivation: 现有开放世界检测方法存在已知与未知类别间的语义混淆和灾难性遗忘问题，导致未知类别召回率下降和已知类别准确率退化。

Method: 提出CROWD框架，包含CROWD-Discover（使用子模条件增益函数挖掘未知实例）和CROWD-Learn（使用组合目标解耦已知和未知表示）。

Result: 在OWOD基准测试中，CROWD在M-OWODB和S-OWODB上分别提升已知类别准确率2.83%和2.05%，未知召回率比领先基线提高近2.4倍。

Conclusion: CROWD通过组合式方法有效解决了开放世界检测中的语义混淆和灾难性遗忘问题，显著提升了检测性能。

Abstract: Open-World Object Detection (OWOD) enriches traditional object detectors by
enabling continual discovery and integration of unknown objects via human
guidance. However, existing OWOD approaches frequently suffer from semantic
confusion between known and unknown classes, alongside catastrophic forgetting,
leading to diminished unknown recall and degraded known-class accuracy. To
overcome these challenges, we propose Combinatorial Open-World Detection
(CROWD), a unified framework reformulating unknown object discovery and
adaptation as an interwoven combinatorial (set-based) data-discovery
(CROWD-Discover) and representation learning (CROWD-Learn) task. CROWD-Discover
strategically mines unknown instances by maximizing Submodular Conditional Gain
(SCG) functions, selecting representative examples distinctly dissimilar from
known objects. Subsequently, CROWD-Learn employs novel combinatorial objectives
that jointly disentangle known and unknown representations while maintaining
discriminative coherence among known classes, thus mitigating confusion and
forgetting. Extensive evaluations on OWOD benchmarks illustrate that CROWD
achieves improvements of 2.83% and 2.05% in known-class accuracy on M-OWODB and
S-OWODB, respectively, and nearly 2.4x unknown recall compared to leading
baselines.

Result: 在多个性能指标上的实验结果表明，该方法能有效增强潜在空间表示。

Conclusion: ExpDWT-VAE方法通过整合空间和频率域特征，显著提升了潜在扩散模型在遥感应用中的性能。

Abstract: Latent Diffusion Models (LDM), a subclass of diffusion models, mitigate the
computational complexity of pixel-space diffusion by operating within a
compressed latent space constructed by Variational Autoencoders (VAEs),
demonstrating significant advantages in Remote Sensing (RS) applications.
Though numerous studies enhancing LDMs have been conducted, investigations
explicitly targeting improvements within the intrinsic latent space remain
scarce. This paper proposes an innovative perspective, utilizing the Discrete
Wavelet Transform (DWT) to enhance the VAE's latent space representation,
designed for satellite imagery. The proposed method, ExpDWT-VAE, introduces
dual branches: one processes spatial domain input through convolutional
operations, while the other extracts and processes frequency-domain features
via 2D Haar wavelet decomposition, convolutional operation, and inverse DWT
reconstruction. These branches merge to create an integrated spatial-frequency
representation, further refined through convolutional and diagonal Gaussian
mapping into a robust latent representation. We utilize a new satellite imagery
dataset housed by the TerraFly mapping system to validate our method.
Experimental results across several performance metrics highlight the efficacy
of the proposed method at enhancing latent space representation.

Motivation: 现有轨迹预测方法假设理想化观测历史，忽略了第一人称视角固有的感知伪影（如遮挡、ID切换、跟踪漂移），导致模型鲁棒性不足。

Method: 提出BiFlow双流流匹配模型，利用共享潜在表示同时去噪历史观测和预测未来运动；引入EgoAnchor机制，通过特征调制将历史特征蒸馏到预测解码器中。

Result: BiFlow实现最先进性能，平均减少minADE和minFDE 10-15%，表现出卓越的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该基准和模型为开发真正适应真实世界第一人称感知挑战的轨迹预测系统提供了关键基础。

Abstract: Reliable trajectory prediction from an ego-centric perspective is crucial for
robotic navigation in human-centric environments. However, existing methods
typically assume idealized observation histories, failing to account for the
perceptual artifacts inherent in first-person vision, such as occlusions, ID
switches, and tracking drift. This discrepancy between training assumptions and
deployment reality severely limits model robustness. To bridge this gap, we
introduce EgoTraj-Bench, the first real-world benchmark that grounds noisy,
first-person visual histories in clean, bird's-eye-view future trajectories,
enabling robust learning under realistic perceptual constraints. Building on
this benchmark, we propose BiFlow, a dual-stream flow matching model that
concurrently denoises historical observations and forecasts future motion by
leveraging a shared latent representation. To better model agent intent, BiFlow
incorporates our EgoAnchor mechanism, which conditions the prediction decoder
on distilled historical features via feature modulation. Extensive experiments
show that BiFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing minADE and
minFDE by 10-15% on average and demonstrating superior robustness. We
anticipate that our benchmark and model will provide a critical foundation for
developing trajectory forecasting systems truly resilient to the challenges of
real-world, ego-centric perception.

Result: 校准后，BiomedCLIP在肺炎检测中F1分数达到0.8841（超越CNN的0.8803），在肺结核检测中从0.4812提升至0.7684（接近CNN的0.7834）。

Conclusion: 适当的校准对于发挥零样本视觉语言模型的诊断潜力至关重要，使其能够匹配甚至超越任务特定的监督模型。

Abstract: The accurate interpretation of chest radiographs using automated methods is a
critical task in medical imaging. This paper presents a comparative analysis
between a supervised lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a
state-of-the-art, zero-shot medical Vision-Language Model (VLM), BiomedCLIP,
across two distinct diagnostic tasks: pneumonia detection on the PneumoniaMNIST
benchmark and tuberculosis detection on the Shenzhen TB dataset. Our
experiments show that supervised CNNs serve as highly competitive baselines in
both cases. While the default zero-shot performance of the VLM is lower, we
demonstrate that its potential can be unlocked via a simple yet crucial remedy:
decision threshold calibration. By optimizing the classification threshold on a
validation set, the performance of BiomedCLIP is significantly boosted across
both datasets. For pneumonia detection, calibration enables the zero-shot VLM
to achieve a superior F1-score of 0.8841, surpassing the supervised CNN's
0.8803. For tuberculosis detection, calibration dramatically improves the
F1-score from 0.4812 to 0.7684, bringing it close to the supervised baseline's
0.7834. This work highlights a key insight: proper calibration is essential for
leveraging the full diagnostic power of zero-shot VLMs, enabling them to match
or even outperform efficient, task-specific supervised models.

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents powered by Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) promise human-like interaction with software applications, yet
long-horizon tasks remain challenging due to memory limitations. Existing
approaches either truncate history or rely on simple textual summaries, which
risk losing critical information when past visual details become necessary for
future decisions. In this paper, we propose \textbf{PAL-UI} (\textbf{P}lanning
with \textbf{A}ctive \textbf{L}ook-back), a novel framework that enables GUI
agents to adaptively retrieve past observations when required. PAL-UI combines
a dual-level summarization agent, capturing both observation-level cues and
action-level outcomes, with a dedicated retrieval tool that allows the agent to
recall specific historical screenshots during planning. We curate a step-level
instruction dataset of 8.6K samples from mobile GUI navigation trajectories and
train \textbf{PAL-UI-3B} and \textbf{PAL-UI-7B} models based on Qwen2.5-VL.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that PAL-UI significantly outperforms
baseline models and prior methods in mobile GUI navigation tasks, even under
data-efficient settings. Moreover, PAL-UI exhibits strong cross-domain
generalization, achieving notable improvements in web navigation without
additional training. Our work highlights the potential of active memory
retrieval for long-horizon planning capabilities of vision-based GUI agents.

Abstract: Precise delineation of meningiomas is crucial for effective radiotherapy (RT)
planning, directly influencing treatment efficacy and preservation of adjacent
healthy tissues. While automated deep learning approaches have demonstrated
considerable potential, achieving consistently accurate clinical segmentation
remains challenging due to tumor heterogeneity. Interactive Medical Image
Segmentation (IMIS) addresses this challenge by integrating advanced AI
techniques with clinical input. However, generic segmentation tools, despite
widespread applicability, often lack the specificity required for clinically
critical and disease-specific tasks like meningioma RT planning. To overcome
these limitations, we introduce Interactive-MEN-RT, a dedicated IMIS tool
specifically developed for clinician-assisted 3D meningioma segmentation in RT
workflows. The system incorporates multiple clinically relevant interaction
methods, including point annotations, bounding boxes, lasso tools, and
scribbles, enhancing usability and clinical precision. In our evaluation
involving 500 contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI scans from the BraTS 2025
Meningioma RT Segmentation Challenge, Interactive-MEN-RT demonstrated
substantial improvement compared to other segmentation methods, achieving Dice
similarity coefficients of up to 77.6\% and Intersection over Union scores of

Conclusion: BindWeave框架有效解决了复杂多主体场景下的视频生成问题，实现了高质量的主体一致视频生成。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformer has shown remarkable abilities in generating
high-fidelity videos, delivering visually coherent frames and rich details over
extended durations. However, existing video generation models still fall short
in subject-consistent video generation due to an inherent difficulty in parsing
prompts that specify complex spatial relationships, temporal logic, and
interactions among multiple subjects. To address this issue, we propose
BindWeave, a unified framework that handles a broad range of subject-to-video
scenarios from single-subject cases to complex multi-subject scenes with
heterogeneous entities. To bind complex prompt semantics to concrete visual
subjects, we introduce an MLLM-DiT framework in which a pretrained multimodal
large language model performs deep cross-modal reasoning to ground entities and
disentangle roles, attributes, and interactions, yielding subject-aware hidden
states that condition the diffusion transformer for high-fidelity
subject-consistent video generation. Experiments on the OpenS2V benchmark
demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance across subject
consistency, naturalness, and text relevance in generated videos, outperforming
existing open-source and commercial models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自监督去噪方法在保留高频结构细节方面表现不佳，且在拟合高频时会学习到噪声

Method: 1) 频率带选择策略加速训练收敛；2) 基于Lipschitz常数的参数优化限制卷积核学习高频噪声；3) 频谱分离和低秩重建模块分离噪声与高频细节

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验验证了SCNet的有效性

Conclusion: SCNet通过频谱控制成功解决了自监督去噪中的高频细节保留和噪声学习问题

Abstract: Current self-supervised denoising methods for paired noisy images typically
involve mapping one noisy image through the network to the other noisy image.
However, after measuring the spectral bias of such methods using our proposed
Image Pair Frequency-Band Similarity, it suffers from two practical
limitations. Firstly, the high-frequency structural details in images are not
preserved well enough. Secondly, during the process of fitting high
frequencies, the network learns high-frequency noise from the mapped noisy
images. To address these challenges, we introduce a Spectral Controlling
network (SCNet) to optimize self-supervised denoising of paired noisy images.
First, we propose a selection strategy to choose frequency band components for
noisy images, to accelerate the convergence speed of training. Next, we present
a parameter optimization method that restricts the learning ability of
convolutional kernels to high-frequency noise using the Lipschitz constant,
without changing the network structure. Finally, we introduce the Spectral
Separation and low-rank Reconstruction module (SSR module), which separates
noise and high-frequency details through frequency domain separation and
low-rank space reconstruction, to retain the high-frequency structural details
of images. Experiments performed on synthetic and real-world datasets verify
the effectiveness of SCNet.

Motivation: 现有的视觉语言目标检测器在零样本识别方面表现优异，但在领域偏移下性能会显著下降，需要有效的测试时适应方法。

Method: 提出IoU加权熵目标来聚焦空间一致的提案簇，减少孤立框的确认偏差；引入图像条件提示选择，根据图像级兼容性对提示进行排序，并将最有信息的提示与检测器logits融合。

Result: 在包括风格化域、驾驶场景、低光条件和常见损坏等多种分布偏移下的基准测试表明，该方法在YOLO-World和Grounding DINO上相比零样本和TTA基线均有持续改进。

Conclusion: VLOD-TTA框架能有效提升视觉语言目标检测器在领域偏移下的性能，通过提案重叠和图像条件提示评分实现了稳定的测试时适应。

Abstract: Vision-language object detectors (VLODs) such as YOLO-World and Grounding
DINO achieve impressive zero-shot recognition by aligning region proposals with
text representations. However, their performance often degrades under domain
shift. We introduce VLOD-TTA, a test-time adaptation (TTA) framework for VLODs
that leverages dense proposal overlap and image-conditioned prompt scores.
First, an IoU-weighted entropy objective is proposed that concentrates
adaptation on spatially coherent proposal clusters and reduces confirmation
bias from isolated boxes. Second, image-conditioned prompt selection is
introduced, which ranks prompts by image-level compatibility and fuses the most
informative prompts with the detector logits. Our benchmarking across diverse
distribution shifts -- including stylized domains, driving scenes, low-light
conditions, and common corruptions -- shows the effectiveness of our method on
two state-of-the-art VLODs, YOLO-World and Grounding DINO, with consistent
improvements over the zero-shot and TTA baselines. Code :

*Yuheng Ji,Huajie Tan,Cheng Chi,Yijie Xu,Yuting Zhao,Enshen Zhou,Huaihai Lyu,Pengwei Wang,Zhongyuan Wang,Shanghang Zhang,Xiaolong Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MathSticks是一个视觉符号组合推理基准测试，通过移动火柴棒来修正错误等式，结合视觉感知、符号操作和算术一致性，包含140万生成实例和精选测试集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在组合推理方面存在局限，需要建立统一视觉感知、符号操作和算术一致性的严格测试基准。

Method: 创建包含文本引导和纯视觉设置的火柴棒等式修正任务，系统覆盖数字规模、移动复杂度、解多样性和运算符变化，生成大量测试实例。

Result: 评估14个视觉语言模型发现显著局限：闭源模型仅能处理简单案例，开源模型在纯视觉设置中失败，而人类准确率超过90%。

Conclusion: MathSticks为推进跨视觉和符号的组合推理提供了严格的测试平台，揭示了当前模型的不足。

Abstract: We introduce \textsc{MathSticks}, a benchmark for Visual Symbolic
Compositional Reasoning (VSCR), which unifies visual perception, symbolic
manipulation, and arithmetic consistency. Each task presents an incorrect
matchstick equation that must be corrected by moving one or two sticks under
strict conservation rules. The benchmark includes both text-guided and purely
visual settings, systematically covering digit scale, move complexity, solution
multiplicity, and operator variation, with 1.4M generated instances and a
curated test set. Evaluations of 14 vision--language models reveal substantial
limitations: closed-source models succeed only on simple cases, open-source
models fail in the visual regime, while humans exceed 90\% accuracy. These
findings establish \textsc{MathSticks} as a rigorous testbed for advancing
compositional reasoning across vision and symbols. Our code and dataset are
publicly available at https://github.com/Yuheng2000/MathSticks.

### [29] [Normal-Abnormal Guided Generalist Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00495)
*Yuexin Wang,Xiaolei Wang,Yizheng Gong,Jimin Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种使用正常和异常样本作为参考的通用异常检测方法NAGL，通过残差挖掘和异常特征学习实现跨域异常检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有通用异常检测方法仅使用正常样本作为参考，忽略了实际场景中可用的异常样本信息。

Method: NAGL框架包含残差挖掘(RM)和异常特征学习(AFL)两个组件，RM从正常-异常参考残差中提取异常模式，AFL通过残差映射自适应学习异常特征。

Result: 在多个基准测试上的实验表明，该方法显著优于现有GAD方法。

Conclusion: 这是首个在通用异常检测中采用正常和异常样本混合参考的方法，能更准确高效地进行跨域异常检测。

Abstract: Generalist Anomaly Detection (GAD) aims to train a unified model on an
original domain that can detect anomalies in new target domains. Previous GAD
methods primarily use only normal samples as references, overlooking the
valuable information contained in anomalous samples that are often available in
real-world scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose a more practical
approach: normal-abnormal-guided generalist anomaly detection, which leverages
both normal and anomalous samples as references to guide anomaly detection
across diverse domains. We introduce the Normal-Abnormal Generalist Learning
(NAGL) framework, consisting of two key components: Residual Mining (RM) and
Anomaly Feature Learning (AFL). RM extracts abnormal patterns from
normal-abnormal reference residuals to establish transferable anomaly
representations, while AFL adaptively learns anomaly features in query images
through residual mapping to identify instance-aware anomalies. Our approach
effectively utilizes both normal and anomalous references for more accurate and
efficient cross-domain anomaly detection. Extensive experiments across multiple
benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing GAD
approaches. This work represents the first to adopt a mixture of normal and
abnormal samples as references in generalist anomaly detection. The code and
datasets are available at https://github.com/JasonKyng/NAGL.

*Kaiqi Zhang,Mingguan Yang,Dali Chang,Chun Chen,Yuxiang Zhang,Kexun He,Jing Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RAF是一种高效的图像特征提取技术，通过融合相对图像特征和绝对数值特征来增强基于图像的迭代方法选择，解决了传统方法中不同矩阵可能产生相同图像表示的问题，在稀疏线性系统求解中实现了5.86%-11.50%的速度提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于图像的迭代方法选择方法存在特征提取问题，不同的矩阵可能被编码成相同的图像表示，导致相同的选择结果和次优方法。

Method: 提出RAF（相对-绝对融合）特征提取技术，同时提取并融合图像表示作为相对特征和对应的数值作为绝对特征，实现全面的矩阵表示。

Result: 在SuiteSparse和BMCMat数据集上的评估显示，稀疏线性系统的求解时间减少了0.08s-0.29s，比传统基于图像的选择方法快5.86%-11.50%，达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: RAF通过防止特征歧义提高了选择准确性，释放了基于图像选择方法的潜力，为稀疏线性系统求解提供了更有效的迭代方法选择方案。

Abstract: Iterative method selection is crucial for solving sparse linear systems
because these methods inherently lack robustness. Though image-based selection
approaches have shown promise, their feature extraction techniques might encode
distinct matrices into identical image representations, leading to the same
selection and suboptimal method. In this paper, we introduce RAF
(Relative-Absolute Fusion), an efficient feature extraction technique to
enhance image-based selection approaches. By simultaneously extracting and
fusing image representations as relative features with corresponding numerical
values as absolute features, RAF achieves comprehensive matrix representations
that prevent feature ambiguity across distinct matrices, thus improving
selection accuracy and unlocking the potential of image-based selection
approaches. We conducted comprehensive evaluations of RAF on SuiteSparse and
our developed BMCMat (Balanced Multi-Classification Matrix dataset),
demonstrating solution time reductions of 0.08s-0.29s for sparse linear
systems, which is 5.86%-11.50% faster than conventional image-based selection
approaches and achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. BMCMat is

### [31] [Affordance-Guided Diffusion Prior for 3D Hand Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00506)
*Naru Suzuki,Takehiko Ohkawa,Tatsuro Banno,Jihyun Lee,Ryosuke Furuta,Yoichi Sato*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于扩散模型的生成先验方法，通过利用视觉语言模型推断的affordance感知文本描述来引导手部姿态优化，解决严重遮挡下的3D手部姿态重建问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当手部被自身或物体严重遮挡时，人类通常利用上下文知识（如affordance）来解决歧义。受此启发，研究旨在通过affordance感知的文本描述来引导手部姿态优化。

Method: 采用基于扩散的生成模型，学习在affordance描述条件下的合理手部姿态分布。affordance描述由大型视觉语言模型推断得出，用于引导遮挡区域优化为更准确且功能连贯的手部姿态。

Result: 在HOGraspNet数据集上的大量实验表明，该方法在严重遮挡情况下显著优于最近的回归方法和缺乏上下文推理的基于扩散的优化方法。

Conclusion: affordance引导的优化方法能够有效提升严重遮挡情况下的手部姿态估计精度，证明了上下文推理在手部姿态重建中的重要性。

Abstract: How can we reconstruct 3D hand poses when large portions of the hand are
heavily occluded by itself or by objects? Humans often resolve such ambiguities
by leveraging contextual knowledge -- such as affordances, where an object's
shape and function suggest how the object is typically grasped. Inspired by
this observation, we propose a generative prior for hand pose refinement guided
by affordance-aware textual descriptions of hand-object interactions (HOI). Our
method employs a diffusion-based generative model that learns the distribution
of plausible hand poses conditioned on affordance descriptions, which are
inferred from a large vision-language model (VLM). This enables the refinement
of occluded regions into more accurate and functionally coherent hand poses.
Extensive experiments on HOGraspNet, a 3D hand-affordance dataset with severe
occlusions, demonstrate that our affordance-guided refinement significantly
improves hand pose estimation over both recent regression methods and
diffusion-based refinement lacking contextual reasoning.

TL;DR: 提出EPIC框架，通过渐进一致性蒸馏解决多模态大模型中视觉token压缩带来的训练困难问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉token在多模态大模型中消耗大量计算资源，现有压缩方法忽视了压缩引起的特征空间扰动带来的学习难度增加

Method: 通过将token压缩引入的特征空间扰动分解为token维度和层维度，分别引入token一致性蒸馏和层一致性蒸馏，利用教师模型指导进行渐进学习

Result: 实验证明该框架具有优越的有效性、鲁棒性和泛化能力

Conclusion: EPIC框架通过渐进一致性蒸馏有效解决了视觉token压缩中的训练困难问题

Abstract: Visual tokens consume substantial computational resources in multi-modal
large models (MLLMs), significantly compromising their efficiency. Recent works
have attempted to improve efficiency by compressing visual tokens during
training, either through modifications to model components or by introducing
additional parameters. However, they often overlook the increased learning
difficulty caused by such compression, as the model's parameter space struggles
to quickly adapt to the substantial perturbations in the feature space induced
by token compression. In this work, we propose to develop Efficient MLLMs via
Progressive Consistency Distillation (EPIC), a progressive learning framework.
Specifically, by decomposing the feature space perturbations introduced by
token compression along the token-wise and layer-wise dimensions, we introduce
token consistency distillation and layer consistency distillation,
respectively, aiming to reduce the training difficulty by leveraging guidance
from a teacher model and following a progressive learning trajectory. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superior effectiveness, robustness, and
generalization capabilities of our proposed framework.

### [33] [CardioBench: Do Echocardiography Foundation Models Generalize Beyond the Lab?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00520)
*Darya Taratynova,Ahmed Aly,Numan Saeed,Mohammad Yaqub*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CardioBench是一个用于超声心动图基础模型的标准化基准测试，整合了8个公开数据集，涵盖4个回归和5个分类任务，评估了多种模型在零样本、探测和对齐协议下的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超声心动图基础模型应用有限，缺乏标准化评估基准，现有解决方案多在私有数据上评估，限制了可比性。超声心动图面临噪声采集、高帧冗余和公开数据集有限等独特挑战。

Method: 创建CardioBench基准，统一8个公开数据集，标准化预处理、数据分割和评估流程，评估心脏专用、生物医学和通用编码器在零样本、探测和对齐协议下的表现。

Result: 不同模型家族各有优势：时序建模对功能回归至关重要，检索在分布偏移下具有鲁棒性，领域特定文本编码器能捕捉生理学意义轴。通用编码器迁移能力强，但在细粒度区分如视图分类和细微病理识别方面表现不佳。

Conclusion: CardioBench为超声心动图基础模型建立了可复现的参考点，为未来模型设计提供了可操作的见解，通过发布预处理、分割和公开评估流程促进研究可比性。

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) are reshaping medical imaging, yet their application
in echocardiography remains limited. While several echocardiography-specific
FMs have recently been introduced, no standardized benchmark exists to evaluate
them. Echocardiography poses unique challenges, including noisy acquisitions,
high frame redundancy, and limited public datasets. Most existing solutions
evaluate on private data, restricting comparability. To address this, we
introduce CardioBench, a comprehensive benchmark for echocardiography FMs.
CardioBench unifies eight publicly available datasets into a standardized suite
spanning four regression and five classification tasks, covering functional,
structural, diagnostic, and view recognition endpoints. We evaluate several
leading FM, including cardiac-specific, biomedical, and general-purpose
encoders, under consistent zero-shot, probing, and alignment protocols. Our
results highlight complementary strengths across model families: temporal
modeling is critical for functional regression, retrieval provides robustness
under distribution shift, and domain-specific text encoders capture
physiologically meaningful axes. General-purpose encoders transfer strongly and
often close the gap with probing, but struggle with fine-grained distinctions
like view classification and subtle pathology recognition. By releasing
preprocessing, splits, and public evaluation pipelines, CardioBench establishes
a reproducible reference point and offers actionable insights to guide the
design of future echocardiography foundation models.

### [34] [Cascaded Diffusion Framework for Probabilistic Coarse-to-Fine Hand Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00527)
*Taeyun Woo,Jinah Park,Tae-Kyun Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种从粗到精的级联扩散框架，结合概率建模与级联优化，用于3D手部姿态重建，解决了姿态模糊性和不确定性建模问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有确定性模型难以处理自遮挡和复杂手部关节带来的姿态模糊性，而现有概率方法仅限于单阶段估计且缺乏优化，无法产生准确的3D重建。

Method: 两阶段级联扩散框架：第一阶段使用联合扩散模型采样多样的3D关节假设，第二阶段使用网格潜在扩散模型在关节样本条件下重建3D手部网格。

Result: 在FreiHAND和HO3Dv2数据集上的实验表明，该方法实现了最先进的性能，同时有效建模了姿态分布。

Conclusion: 该方法成功结合了概率建模与级联优化的优势，提高了3D手部姿态重建的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Deterministic models for 3D hand pose reconstruction, whether single-staged
or cascaded, struggle with pose ambiguities caused by self-occlusions and
complex hand articulations. Existing cascaded approaches refine predictions in
a coarse-to-fine manner but remain deterministic and cannot capture pose
uncertainties. Recent probabilistic methods model pose distributions yet are
restricted to single-stage estimation, which often fails to produce accurate 3D
reconstructions without refinement. To address these limitations, we propose a
coarse-to-fine cascaded diffusion framework that combines probabilistic
modeling with cascaded refinement. The first stage is a joint diffusion model
that samples diverse 3D joint hypotheses, and the second stage is a Mesh Latent
Diffusion Model (Mesh LDM) that reconstructs a 3D hand mesh conditioned on a
joint sample. By training Mesh LDM with diverse joint hypotheses in a learned
latent space, our framework learns distribution-aware joint-mesh relationships
and robust hand priors. Furthermore, the cascaded design mitigates the
difficulty of directly mapping 2D images to dense 3D poses, enhancing accuracy
through sequential refinement. Experiments on FreiHAND and HO3Dv2 demonstrate
that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while effectively
modeling pose distributions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Forestpest-YOLO框架，针对林业遥感图像中微小、遮挡严重的农业害虫检测问题，通过SPD-Conv、CSPOK和VarifocalLoss三项创新，显著提升了检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 林业遥感图像中的农业害虫检测面临目标微小、严重遮挡、与杂乱背景相似等挑战，传统目标检测模型因细粒度特征丢失和数据极度不平衡而表现不佳。

Method: 基于YOLOv8架构，集成三项创新：1）SPD-Conv无损下采样模块保留小目标细节；2）CSPOK跨阶段特征融合块增强多尺度特征表示并抑制背景噪声；3）VarifocalLoss训练目标优化，聚焦高质量和难分类样本。

Result: 在自建的ForestPest数据集上进行的广泛实验表明，Forestpest-YOLO实现了最先进的性能，在检测微小、遮挡害虫方面显著优于现有基线模型。

Conclusion: Forestpest-YOLO框架有效解决了林业遥感图像中害虫检测的关键挑战，为生态保护提供了可靠的技术支持。

Abstract: Detecting agricultural pests in complex forestry environments using remote
sensing imagery is fundamental for ecological preservation, yet it is severely
hampered by practical challenges. Targets are often minuscule, heavily
occluded, and visually similar to the cluttered background, causing
conventional object detection models to falter due to the loss of fine-grained
features and an inability to handle extreme data imbalance. To overcome these
obstacles, this paper introduces Forestpest-YOLO, a detection framework
meticulously optimized for the nuances of forestry remote sensing. Building
upon the YOLOv8 architecture, our framework introduces a synergistic trio of
innovations. We first integrate a lossless downsampling module, SPD-Conv, to
ensure that critical high-resolution details of small targets are preserved
throughout the network. This is complemented by a novel cross-stage feature
fusion block, CSPOK, which dynamically enhances multi-scale feature
representation while suppressing background noise. Finally, we employ
VarifocalLoss to refine the training objective, compelling the model to focus
on high-quality and hard-to-classify samples. Extensive experiments on our
challenging, self-constructed ForestPest dataset demonstrate that
Forestpest-YOLO achieves state-of-the-art performance, showing marked
improvements in detecting small, occluded pests and significantly outperforming
established baseline models.

*Henrik Pichler,Janis Keuper,Matthew Copping*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究表明，视觉基础模型在少量标注数据下就能达到与传统方法相当的性能，显著减少了微生物学图像分析中对大量标注数据的依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统微生物学图像分析需要大量人工标注数据，过程耗时耗力。本文旨在证明现代视觉基础模型可以在少量标注数据下达到与传统方法相当的性能。

Method: 收集5000张培养皿图像数据集，模拟传统、少样本和极少量样本场景。对比三种视觉基础模型与传统基线模型在特定任务指标上的表现。

Result: MaskDINO仅用150张图像微调就达到与充分训练的YoloV9相近性能，仅用25张图像仍能在约70%样本上保持可靠性能。

Conclusion: 数据高效的基础模型能够以传统方法所需数据的一小部分达到同等性能，为自动化微生物系统开发提供了更快的迭代速度和更高的性能上限。

Abstract: The process of quantifying mold colonies on Petri dish samples is of critical
importance for the assessment of indoor air quality, as high colony counts can
indicate potential health risks and deficiencies in ventilation systems.
Conventionally the automation of such a labor-intensive process, as well as
other tasks in microbiology, relies on the manual annotation of large datasets
and the subsequent extensive training of models like YoloV9. To demonstrate
that exhaustive annotation is not a prerequisite anymore when tackling a new
vision task, we compile a representative dataset of 5000 Petri dish images
annotated with bounding boxes, simulating both a traditional data collection
approach as well as few-shot and low-shot scenarios with well curated subsets
with instance level masks. We benchmark three vision foundation models against
traditional baselines on task specific metrics, reflecting realistic real-world
requirements. Notably, MaskDINO attains near-parity with an extensively trained
YoloV9 model while finetuned only on 150 images, retaining competitive
performance with as few as 25 images, still being reliable on $\approx$ 70% of
the samples. Our results show that data-efficient foundation models can match
traditional approaches with only a fraction of the required data, enabling
earlier development and faster iterative improvement of automated
microbiological systems with a superior upper-bound performance than
traditional models would achieve.

TL;DR: 提出了自适应共享专家（ASE）方法，在基于LoRA的混合专家框架中引入共享专家，通过路由器计算的门控权重实现从单任务到多任务学习的平滑过渡，提升专家专业化和协作能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MoE-MTL方法依赖单任务预训练骨干网络，在从单任务到多任务学习转换过程中存在冗余适应和知识共享效率低的问题。

Method: 在LoRA-based MoE中引入自适应共享专家，共享专家与稀疏专家联合归一化门控权重；通过增加LoRA专家数量同时按比例降低其秩，实现细粒度专家设计。

Result: 在PASCAL-Context基准测试中，ASE方法在各种配置下持续提升性能，验证了细粒度设计对多任务学习的有效性。

Conclusion: ASE方法通过自适应共享专家和细粒度专家设计，有效解决了MoE-MTL中的知识共享和过渡效率问题，在多任务学习中表现出色。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a powerful framework for multi-task
learning (MTL). However, existing MoE-MTL methods often rely on single-task
pretrained backbones and suffer from redundant adaptation and inefficient
knowledge sharing during the transition from single-task to multi-task learning
(STL to MTL). To address these limitations, we propose adaptive shared experts
(ASE) within a low-rank adaptation (LoRA) based MoE, where shared experts are
assigned router-computed gating weights jointly normalized with sparse experts.
This design facilitates STL to MTL transition, enhances expert specialization,
and cooperation. Furthermore, we incorporate fine-grained experts by increasing
the number of LoRA experts while proportionally reducing their rank, enabling
more effective knowledge sharing under a comparable parameter budget. Extensive
experiments on the PASCAL-Context benchmark, under unified training settings,
demonstrate that ASE consistently improves performance across diverse
configurations and validates the effectiveness of fine-grained designs for MTL.

TL;DR: ArbInterp是一个创新的视频帧插值框架，支持任意时间戳和任意长度的帧插值，通过TaRoPE时间戳感知位置编码和外观-运动解耦策略实现灵活高效的插值生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成式视频帧插值方法只能合成固定数量的中间帧，缺乏调整生成帧率或序列时长的灵活性，限制了实际应用场景。

Method: 提出Timestamp-aware Rotary Position Embedding (TaRoPE)支持任意时间戳插值；采用分段帧合成策略实现任意长度插值；设计外观-运动解耦条件策略确保跨片段时空连续性。

Result: 在2x到32x多尺度帧插值基准测试中，ArbInterp在所有场景下都优于先前方法，具有更高的保真度和更无缝的时空连续性。

Conclusion: ArbInterp通过创新的时间戳感知位置编码和分段生成策略，成功解决了生成式视频帧插值在灵活性和连续性方面的关键限制。

Abstract: Video frame interpolation (VFI), which generates intermediate frames from
given start and end frames, has become a fundamental function in video
generation applications. However, existing generative VFI methods are
constrained to synthesize a fixed number of intermediate frames, lacking the
flexibility to adjust generated frame rates or total sequence duration. In this
work, we present ArbInterp, a novel generative VFI framework that enables
efficient interpolation at any timestamp and of any length. Specifically, to
support interpolation at any timestamp, we propose the Timestamp-aware Rotary
Position Embedding (TaRoPE), which modulates positions in temporal RoPE to
align generated frames with target normalized timestamps. This design enables
fine-grained control over frame timestamps, addressing the inflexibility of
fixed-position paradigms in prior work. For any-length interpolation, we
decompose long-sequence generation into segment-wise frame synthesis. We
further design a novel appearance-motion decoupled conditioning strategy: it
leverages prior segment endpoints to enforce appearance consistency and
temporal semantics to maintain motion coherence, ensuring seamless
spatiotemporal transitions across segments. Experimentally, we build
comprehensive benchmarks for multi-scale frame interpolation (2x to 32x) to
assess generalizability across arbitrary interpolation factors. Results show
that ArbInterp outperforms prior methods across all scenarios with higher
fidelity and more seamless spatiotemporal continuity. Project website:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MDS-NeRF提出了一种针对神经辐射场（NeRF）的多级动态风格迁移方法，通过重新设计NeRF流程，引入多级特征适配器和动态风格注入模块，实现更好的内容保持和艺术风格化效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的NeRF风格迁移方法通常将风格统计信息直接集成到原始NeRF流程中，导致内容保持和艺术风格化效果不佳。

Method: 提出多级特征适配器生成多级特征网格表示，动态风格注入模块学习提取相关风格特征并自适应集成到内容模式中，通过多级级联解码器将风格化特征转换为最终风格化视图。

Result: 大量实验证明MDS-NeRF在3D风格迁移方面表现优异，能够保持多尺度空间结构同时有效传递风格特征。

Conclusion: MDS-NeRF通过重新设计NeRF流程和引入创新模块，实现了高质量的3D风格迁移，支持使用3D风格参考进行全视角风格迁移。

Abstract: As the application of neural radiance fields (NeRFs) in various 3D vision
tasks continues to expand, numerous NeRF-based style transfer techniques have
been developed. However, existing methods typically integrate style statistics
into the original NeRF pipeline, often leading to suboptimal results in both
content preservation and artistic stylization. In this paper, we present
multi-level dynamic style transfer for NeRFs (MDS-NeRF), a novel approach that
reengineers the NeRF pipeline specifically for stylization and incorporates an
innovative dynamic style injection module. Particularly, we propose a
multi-level feature adaptor that helps generate a multi-level feature grid
representation from the content radiance field, effectively capturing the
multi-scale spatial structure of the scene. In addition, we present a dynamic
style injection module that learns to extract relevant style features and
adaptively integrates them into the content patterns. The stylized multi-level
features are then transformed into the final stylized view through our proposed
multi-level cascade decoder. Furthermore, we extend our 3D style transfer
method to support omni-view style transfer using 3D style references. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MDS-NeRF achieves outstanding performance for 3D
style transfer, preserving multi-scale spatial structures while effectively
transferring stylistic characteristics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基础设施安全检测中手动标注成本高、效率低的问题，实现自动化结构缺陷标注。

Method: 整合大视觉语言模型与语义模式匹配模块，采用优化的领域特定提示和递归验证过程，通过迭代自问机制进行精炼。

Result: 在区分缺陷与非缺陷图像上达到98%准确率，在四类缺陷标注中达到85%-98%准确率（类别平衡），在类别不平衡数据集上达到80%-92%准确率。

Conclusion: ADPT提供了可扩展且经济高效的高保真数据集构建方案，为结构损伤评估中的迁移学习和领域适应等下游任务提供有力支持。

Abstract: Automated structural defect annotation is essential for ensuring
infrastructure safety while minimizing the high costs and inefficiencies of
manual labeling. A novel agentic annotation framework, Agent-based Defect
Pattern Tagger (ADPT), is introduced that integrates Large Vision-Language
Models (LVLMs) with a semantic pattern matching module and an iterative
self-questioning refinement mechanism. By leveraging optimized domain-specific
prompting and a recursive verification process, ADPT transforms raw visual data
into high-quality, semantically labeled defect datasets without any manual
supervision. Experimental results demonstrate that ADPT achieves up to 98%
accuracy in distinguishing defective from non-defective images, and 85%-98%
annotation accuracy across four defect categories under class-balanced
settings, with 80%-92% accuracy on class-imbalanced datasets. The framework
offers a scalable and cost-effective solution for high-fidelity dataset
construction, providing strong support for downstream tasks such as transfer

TL;DR: 提出COFA策略，通过前景-背景特征增强提升视觉语言导航的泛化能力，在REVERIE和R2R数据集上达到SOTA性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言导航中，前景提供语义线索，背景包含空间连接信息，但两者的重要性未被充分探索

Method: 使用语义增强地标识别分离前景和背景特征，通过共识驱动的在线增强策略整合两阶段投票结果

Result: 在REVERIE和R2R数据集上提升了基线模型的泛化能力，并达到最先进性能

Conclusion: 前景-背景在线特征增强策略有效提升了视觉语言导航的泛化性能

Abstract: Following language instructions, vision-language navigation (VLN) agents are
tasked with navigating unseen environments. While augmenting multifaceted
visual representations has propelled advancements in VLN, the significance of
foreground and background in visual observations remains underexplored.
Intuitively, foreground regions provide semantic cues, whereas the background
encompasses spatial connectivity information. Inspired on this insight, we
propose a Consensus-driven Online Feature Augmentation strategy (COFA) with
alternative foreground and background features to facilitate the navigable
generalization. Specifically, we first leverage semantically-enhanced landmark
identification to disentangle foreground and background as candidate augmented
features. Subsequently, a consensus-driven online augmentation strategy
encourages the agent to consolidate two-stage voting results on feature
preferences according to diverse instructions and navigational locations.
Experiments on REVERIE and R2R demonstrate that our online
foreground-background augmentation boosts the generalization of baseline and
attains state-of-the-art performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RCOR方法通过将定位作为识别的核心部分，实现对象中心和上下文感知的建模分离，然后进行鲁棒的非参数融合，在保持上下文信息的同时解决背景过度依赖问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准监督学习会导致模型过度依赖背景信息（捷径学习），限制了在真实部署环境中的鲁棒性。现有方法主要通过抑制背景来改进泛化，但牺牲了上下文信息。

Method: RCOR将定位作为识别的组成部分，解耦对象中心和上下文感知建模，然后进行鲁棒的非参数融合。

Result: RCOR提高了监督模型和VLM在域内和域外背景数据集上的性能，即使在复杂场景如ImageNet-1k中也能实现定位先于识别。

Conclusion: 定位先于识别在复杂场景中成为可能，RCOR方法在不牺牲上下文信息的情况下实现了鲁棒性和上下文感知的联合优化。

Abstract: In visual recognition, both the object of interest (referred to as
foreground, FG, for simplicity) and its surrounding context (background, BG)
play an important role. However, standard supervised learning often leads to
unintended over-reliance on the BG, known as shortcut learning of spurious
correlations, limiting model robustness in real-world deployment settings. In
the literature, the problem is mainly addressed by suppressing the BG,
sacrificing context information for improved generalization.
  We propose RCOR -- Robust Context-Aware Object Recognition -- the first
approach that jointly achieves robustness and context-awareness without
compromising either. RCOR treats localization as an integral part of
recognition to decouple object-centric and context-aware modelling, followed by
a robust, non-parametric fusion. It improves the performance of both supervised
models and VLM on datasets with both in-domain and out-of-domain BG, even
without fine-tuning. The results confirm that localization before recognition
is now possible even in complex scenes as in ImageNet-1k.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出使用无条件判别器(UCD)来改进GAN训练，通过消除条件输入中的冗余捷径，促进纳什均衡，在ImageNet-64上达到1.47 FID的优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对抗训练在一步生成中很关键，但GAN训练难以正确收敛且存在模式崩溃问题。研究发现条件判别器中的条件输入会产生冗余捷径，阻碍有意义的特征提取。

Method: 提出无条件判别器(UCD)，强制判别器在没有条件注入的情况下提取更全面和鲁棒的特征，从而为生成器提供更好的监督，促进纳什均衡。

Result: 在ImageNet-64数据集上达到1.47 FID，超越了StyleGAN-XL和多个最先进的一步扩散模型，表现出显著的性能提升和高效率。

Conclusion: 无条件判别器能够有效改善GAN训练，理论保证与经典GAN理论兼容，可以即插即用地实现，实验证实了其显著性能优势。

Abstract: Adversarial training turns out to be the key to one-step generation,
especially for Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and diffusion model
distillation. Yet in practice, GAN training hardly converges properly and
struggles in mode collapse. In this work, we quantitatively analyze the extent
of Nash equilibrium in GAN training, and conclude that redundant shortcuts by
inputting condition in $D$ disables meaningful knowledge extraction. We thereby
propose to employ an unconditional discriminator (UCD), in which $D$ is
enforced to extract more comprehensive and robust features with no condition
injection. In this way, $D$ is able to leverage better knowledge to supervise
$G$, which promotes Nash equilibrium in GAN literature. Theoretical guarantee
on compatibility with vanilla GAN theory indicates that UCD can be implemented
in a plug-in manner. Extensive experiments confirm the significant performance
improvements with high efficiency. For instance, we achieved \textbf{1.47 FID}
on the ImageNet-64 dataset, surpassing StyleGAN-XL and several state-of-the-art
one-step diffusion models. The code will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Fashion image generation has so far focused on narrow tasks such as virtual
try-on, where garments appear in clean studio environments. In contrast,
editorial fashion presents garments through dynamic poses, diverse locations,
and carefully crafted visual narratives. We introduce the task of virtual
fashion photo-shoot, which seeks to capture this richness by transforming
standardized garment images into contextually grounded editorial imagery. To
enable this new direction, we construct the first large-scale dataset of
garment-lookbook pairs, bridging the gap between e-commerce and fashion media.
Because such pairs are not readily available, we design an automated retrieval
pipeline that aligns garments across domains, combining visual-language
reasoning with object-level localization. We construct a dataset with three
garment-lookbook pair accuracy levels: high quality (10,000 pairs), medium
quality (50,000 pairs), and low quality (300,000 pairs). This dataset offers a
foundation for models that move beyond catalog-style generation and toward
fashion imagery that reflects creativity, atmosphere, and storytelling.

<details>

Motivation: 现有基于CNN和Transformer的深度伪造检测方法在建模高度复杂和非线性的伪造伪影方面仍有改进空间，需要更有效的检测算法。

Method: 使用KAN网络替代传统激活函数，引入Landmark-assisted Adaptive KAN (LAKAN)模块，利用面部关键点作为结构先验动态生成KAN内部参数，引导图像编码器关注含伪影的关键面部区域。

Result: 在多个公共数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法取得了优越的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法成功结合了几何先验和网络学习过程，为深度伪造检测提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid development of deepfake generation techniques necessitates robust
face forgery detection algorithms. While methods based on Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) and Transformers are effective, there is still room for
improvement in modeling the highly complex and non-linear nature of forgery
artifacts. To address this issue, we propose a novel detection method based on
the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN). By replacing fixed activation functions
with learnable splines, our KAN-based approach is better suited to this
challenge. Furthermore, to guide the network's focus towards critical facial
areas, we introduce a Landmark-assisted Adaptive Kolmogorov-Arnold Network
(LAKAN) module. This module uses facial landmarks as a structural prior to
dynamically generate the internal parameters of the KAN, creating an
instance-specific signal that steers a general-purpose image encoder towards
the most informative facial regions with artifacts. This core innovation
creates a powerful combination between geometric priors and the network's
learning process. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets show that
our proposed method achieves superior performance.

Conclusion: ReFlux成功填补了概念擦除评估在最新T2I框架中的空白，为未来安全研究提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have enabled
impressive generative capabilities, but they also raise significant safety
concerns due to the potential to produce harmful or undesirable content. While
concept erasure has been explored as a mitigation strategy, most existing
approaches and corresponding attack evaluations are tailored to Stable
Diffusion (SD) and exhibit limited effectiveness when transferred to
next-generation rectified flow transformers such as Flux. In this work, we
present ReFlux, the first concept attack method specifically designed to assess
the robustness of concept erasure in the latest rectified flow-based T2I
framework. Our approach is motivated by the observation that existing concept
erasure techniques, when applied to Flux, fundamentally rely on a phenomenon
known as attention localization. Building on this insight, we propose a simple
yet effective attack strategy that specifically targets this property. At its
core, a reverse-attention optimization strategy is introduced to effectively
reactivate suppressed signals while stabilizing attention. This is further
reinforced by a velocity-guided dynamic that enhances the robustness of concept
reactivation by steering the flow matching process, and a
consistency-preserving objective that maintains the global layout and preserves
unrelated content. Extensive experiments consistently demonstrate the
effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed attack method, establishing a
reliable benchmark for evaluating the robustness of concept erasure strategies
in rectified flow transformers.

Abstract: Multi-sensor fusion in autonomous vehicles is becoming more common to offer a
more robust alternative for several perception tasks. This need arises from the
unique contribution of each sensor in collecting data: camera-radar fusion
offers a cost-effective solution by combining rich semantic information from
cameras with accurate distance measurements from radar, without incurring
excessive financial costs or overwhelming data processing requirements. Map
segmentation is a critical task for enabling effective vehicle behaviour in its
environment, yet it continues to face significant challenges in achieving high
accuracy and meeting real-time performance requirements. Therefore, this work
presents a novel and efficient map segmentation architecture, using cameras and
radars, in the \acrfull{bev} space. Our model introduces a real-time map
segmentation architecture considering aspects such as high accuracy, per-class
balancing, and inference time. To accomplish this, we use an advanced loss set
together with a new lightweight head to improve the perception results. Our
results show that, with these modifications, our approach achieves results
comparable to large models, reaching 53.5 mIoU, while also setting a new
benchmark for inference time, improving it by 260\% over the strongest baseline
models.

Motivation: 云层严重影响光学卫星图像质量，而薄云缺乏明显特征以及训练样本质量低限制了深度学习方法的云检测精度，需要进一步改进。

Method: 使用渐进式训练框架训练多尺度场景级云检测网络，结合多尺度概率图和云厚度图获得像素级云概率图，通过自适应阈值和距离加权优化生成二值云掩码。

Conclusion: SpecMCD方法在不同云覆盖条件下具有优越的云检测性能和潜力。

Abstract: Clouds significantly affect the quality of optical satellite images, which
seriously limits their precise application. Recently, deep learning has been
widely applied to cloud detection and has achieved satisfactory results.
However, the lack of distinctive features in thin clouds and the low quality of
training samples limit the cloud detection accuracy of deep learning methods,
leaving space for further improvements. In this paper, we propose a weakly
supervised cloud detection method that combines spectral features and
multi-scale scene-level deep network (SpecMCD) to obtain highly accurate
pixel-level cloud masks. The method first utilizes a progressive training
framework with a multi-scale scene-level dataset to train the multi-scale
scene-level cloud detection network. Pixel-level cloud probability maps are
then obtained by combining the multi-scale probability maps and cloud thickness
map based on the characteristics of clouds in dense cloud coverage and large
cloud-area coverage images. Finally, adaptive thresholds are generated based on
the differentiated regions of the scene-level cloud masks at different scales
and combined with distance-weighted optimization to obtain binary cloud masks.
Two datasets, WDCD and GF1MS-WHU, comprising a total of 60 Gaofen-1
multispectral (GF1-MS) images, were used to verify the effectiveness of the
proposed method. Compared to the other weakly supervised cloud detection
methods such as WDCD and WSFNet, the F1-score of the proposed SpecMCD method
shows an improvement of over 7.82%, highlighting the superiority and potential
of the SpecMCD method for cloud detection under different cloud coverage
conditions.

Motivation: 一致性模型(CMs)虽然能实现一步或两步采样，但需要长时间训练和大批量才能获得竞争力的样本质量。研究发现CMs在收敛附近的训练动态中，切线方向存在振荡问题，不指向数据流形。

Method: 提出流形特征距离(MFD)损失函数，提供与流形对齐的切线方向，使更新方向指向数据流形。该方法称为Align Your Tangent (AYT)。

Conclusion: 通过解决CMs训练中的振荡切线问题，AYT方法显著提升了训练效率和样本质量，为快速高质量生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: With diffusion and flow matching models achieving state-of-the-art generating
performance, the interest of the community now turned to reducing the inference
time without sacrificing sample quality. Consistency Models (CMs), which are
trained to be consistent on diffusion or probability flow ordinary differential
equation (PF-ODE) trajectories, enable one or two-step flow or diffusion
sampling. However, CMs typically require prolonged training with large batch
sizes to obtain competitive sample quality. In this paper, we examine the
training dynamics of CMs near convergence and discover that CM tangents -- CM
output update directions -- are quite oscillatory, in the sense that they move
parallel to the data manifold, not towards the manifold. To mitigate
oscillatory tangents, we propose a new loss function, called the manifold
feature distance (MFD), which provides manifold-aligned tangents that point
toward the data manifold. Consequently, our method -- dubbed Align Your Tangent
(AYT) -- can accelerate CM training by orders of magnitude and even out-perform
the learned perceptual image patch similarity metric (LPIPS). Furthermore, we
find that our loss enables training with extremely small batch sizes without
compromising sample quality. Code: https://github.com/1202kbs/AYT

Conclusion: U2-rPCA方法在保持数学可解释性的同时，无需学习标签，在微血管成像中实现了优越的杂波滤波性能。

Abstract: High-sensitivity clutter filtering is a fundamental step in ultrasound
microvascular imaging. Singular value decomposition (SVD) and robust principal
component analysis (rPCA) are the main clutter filtering strategies. However,
both strategies are limited in feature modeling and tissue-blood flow
separation for high-quality microvascular imaging. Recently, deep
learning-based clutter filtering has shown potential in more thoroughly
separating tissue and blood flow signals. However, the existing supervised
filters face the challenges of interpretability and lack of in-vitro and
in-vivo ground truths. While the interpretability issue can be addressed by
algorithm deep unfolding, the training ground truth remains unsolved. To this
end, this paper proposes an unsupervised unfolded rPCA (U2-rPCA) method that
preserves mathematical interpretability and is insusceptible to learning
labels. Specifically, U2-rPCA is unfolded from an iteratively reweighted least
squares (IRLS) rPCA baseline with intrinsic low-rank and sparse regularization.
A sparse-enhancement unit is added to the network to strengthen its capability
to capture the sparse micro-flow signals. U2-rPCA is like an adaptive filter
that is trained with part of the image sequence and then used for the following
frames. Experimental validations on a in-silico dataset and public in-vivo
datasets demonstrated the outperformance of U2-rPCA when compared with the
SVD-based method, the rPCA baseline, and another deep learning-based filter.
Particularly, the proposed method improved the contrastto-noise ratio (CNR) of
the power Doppler image by 2 dB to 10 dB when compared with other methods.
Furthermore, the effectiveness of the building modules of U2-rPCA was validated
through ablation studies.

Abstract: The intricate morphology of brain vessels poses significant challenges for
automatic segmentation models, which usually focus on a single imaging
modality. However, accurately treating brain-related conditions requires a
comprehensive understanding of the cerebrovascular tree, regardless of the
specific acquisition procedure. Our framework effectively segments brain
arteries and veins in various datasets through image-to-image translation while
avoiding domain-specific model design and data harmonization between the source
and the target domain. This is accomplished by employing disentanglement
techniques to independently manipulate different image properties, allowing
them to move from one domain to another in a label-preserving manner.
Specifically, we focus on manipulating vessel appearances during adaptation
while preserving spatial information, such as shapes and locations, which are
crucial for correct segmentation. Our evaluation effectively bridges large and
varied domain gaps across medical centers, image modalities, and vessel types.
Additionally, we conduct ablation studies on the optimal number of required
annotations and other architectural choices. The results highlight our
framework's robustness and versatility, demonstrating the potential of domain
adaptation methodologies to perform cerebrovascular image segmentation in
multiple scenarios accurately. Our code is available at

Conclusion: 该研究成功统一了几何和概率视角，提出的MPPM框架为理解扩散模型提供了新的几何解释，并在性能上超越了现有方法。

Abstract: The foundational premise of generative AI for images is the assumption that
images are inherently low-dimensional objects embedded within a
high-dimensional space. Additionally, it is often implicitly assumed that
thematic image datasets form smooth or piecewise smooth manifolds. Common
approaches overlook the geometric structure and focus solely on probabilistic
methods, approximating the probability distribution through universal
approximation techniques such as the kernel method. In some generative models,
the low dimensional nature of the data manifest itself by the introduction of a
lower dimensional latent space. Yet, the probability distribution in the latent
or the manifold coordinate space is considered uninteresting and is predefined
or considered uniform. This study unifies the geometric and probabilistic
perspectives by providing a geometric framework and a kernel-based
probabilistic method simultaneously. The resulting framework demystifies
diffusion models by interpreting them as a projection mechanism onto the
manifold of ``good images''. This interpretation leads to the construction of a
new deterministic model, the Manifold-Probabilistic Projection Model (MPPM),
which operates in both the representation (pixel) space and the latent space.
We demonstrate that the Latent MPPM (LMPPM) outperforms the Latent Diffusion
Model (LDM) across various datasets, achieving superior results in terms of
image restoration and generation.

Abstract: This work presents novel methods to reduce computational and memory
requirements for medical image segmentation with a large number of classes. We
curiously observe challenges in maintaining state-of-the-art segmentation
performance with all of the explored options. Standard learning-based methods
typically employ one-hot encoding of class labels. The computational complexity
and memory requirements thus increase linearly with the number of classes. We
propose a family of binary encoding approaches instead of one-hot encoding to
reduce the computational complexity and memory requirements to logarithmic in
the number of classes. In addition to vanilla binary encoding, we investigate
the effects of error-correcting output codes (ECOCs), class weighting,
hard/soft decoding, class-to-codeword assignment, and label embedding trees. We
apply the methods to the use case of whole brain parcellation with 108 classes
based on 3D MRI images. While binary encodings have proven efficient in
so-called extreme classification problems in computer vision, we faced
challenges in reaching state-of-the-art segmentation quality with binary
encodings. Compared to one-hot encoding (Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) =
82.4 (2.8)), we report reduced segmentation performance with the binary
segmentation approaches, achieving DSCs in the range from 39.3 to 73.8.
Informative negative results all too often go unpublished. We hope that this
work inspires future research of compact encoding strategies for large
multi-class segmentation tasks.

*Jinchang Zhang,Zijun Li,Jiakai Lin,Guoyu Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于事件图像知识蒸馏的开放词汇目标检测框架，通过CLIP教师模型指导事件学生模型学习视觉表示，结合SNN和CNN的混合架构自适应提取事件特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件相机在目标检测中具有高速响应、低延迟等优势，但缺乏纹理和色彩信息，难以实现开放词汇检测。现有方法局限于预定义类别，无法泛化到新物体。

Method: 使用图像帧作为教师模型输入，通过空间注意力蒸馏指导事件学生模型学习CLIP的视觉表示。设计SNN-CNN混合框架，SNN自适应确定事件分割时机，CNN处理特征进行目标检测。

Result: 该方法能够从原始事件输入中学习有意义的视觉特征，同时继承CLIP的广泛视觉知识，解决了事件数据与图像之间的模态差距问题。

Conclusion: 提出的框架成功实现了事件数据上的开放词汇目标检测，通过知识蒸馏和自适应事件分割有效克服了事件相机的信息限制。

Abstract: Event cameras offer advantages in object detection tasks due to high-speed
response, low latency, and robustness to motion blur. However, event cameras
lack texture and color information, making open-vocabulary detection
particularly challenging. Current event-based detection methods are typically
trained on predefined categories, limiting their ability to generalize to novel
objects, where encountering previously unseen objects is common.
Vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled open-vocabulary object detection in
RGB images. However, the modality gap between images and event streams makes it
ineffective to directly transfer CLIP to event data, as CLIP was not designed
for event streams. To bridge this gap, we propose an event-image knowledge
distillation framework that leverages CLIP's semantic understanding to achieve
open-vocabulary object detection on event data. Instead of training CLIP
directly on event streams, we use image frames as inputs to a teacher model,
guiding the event-based student model to learn CLIP's rich visual
representations. Through spatial attention-based distillation, the student
network learns meaningful visual features directly from raw event inputs while
inheriting CLIP's broad visual knowledge. Furthermore, to prevent information
loss due to event data segmentation, we design a hybrid spiking neural network
(SNN) and convolutional neural network (CNN) framework. Unlike fixed-group
event segmentation methods, which often discard crucial temporal information,
our SNN adaptively determines the optimal event segmentation moments, ensuring
that key temporal features are extracted. The extracted event features are then
processed by CNNs for object detection.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出ProtoMask模型，使用图像分割基础模型改进原型映射的真实性，通过语义图像补丁限制显著性图计算区域，在细粒度分类数据集上展现竞争性性能和独特可解释性特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于原型案例推理的方法通常依赖后处理显著性技术来解释学习到的原型语义，但这些技术的可靠性和质量受到质疑，需要改进嵌入空间到输入空间映射的真实性。

Method: 使用图像分割基础模型生成分割掩码，将每个掩码的边界框用于裁剪图像，构建ProtoMask模型架构，限制显著性图计算到预定义的语义图像补丁。

Result: 在三个流行的细粒度分类数据集上进行实验，使用多种评估指标，结果显示模型具有竞争性性能和独特的可解释性特征。

Conclusion: ProtoMask模型通过结合图像分割技术有效提升了原型映射的真实性，为可解释AI提供了更可靠的可视化方法。

Abstract: XAI gained considerable importance in recent years. Methods based on
prototypical case-based reasoning have shown a promising improvement in
explainability. However, these methods typically rely on additional post-hoc
saliency techniques to explain the semantics of learned prototypes. Multiple
critiques have been raised about the reliability and quality of such
techniques. For this reason, we study the use of prominent image segmentation
foundation models to improve the truthfulness of the mapping between embedding
and input space. We aim to restrict the computation area of the saliency map to
a predefined semantic image patch to reduce the uncertainty of such
visualizations. To perceive the information of an entire image, we use the
bounding box from each generated segmentation mask to crop the image. Each mask
results in an individual input in our novel model architecture named ProtoMask.
We conduct experiments on three popular fine-grained classification datasets
with a wide set of metrics, providing a detailed overview on explainability
characteristics. The comparison with other popular models demonstrates
competitive performance and unique explainability features of our model.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoE-SGT是一个增强概念瓶颈模型的多模态推理框架，通过图变换器和混合专家模块显式建模概念间的结构化关系，提升复杂概念推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统概念瓶颈模型(CBMs)通常是单模态的，且忽略了概念间的结构化关系，无法有效处理复杂概念推理任务。

Method: 构建答案-概念和答案-问题图来建模多模态输入中的结构化关系；集成图变换器捕获多层次依赖；用混合专家模块替换前馈层，动态分配推理任务给不同子专家。

Result: 在多个数据集上，MoE-SGT比其他概念瓶颈网络实现了更高的准确率。

Conclusion: 通过显式建模概念间结构化关系并采用动态专家选择机制，MoE-SGT显著提升了模型对复杂概念推理的适应能力。

Abstract: With growing demand for interpretability in deep learning, especially in high
stakes domains, Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) address this by inserting
human understandable concepts into the prediction pipeline, but they are
generally single modal and ignore structured concept relationships. To overcome
these limitations, we present MoE-SGT, a reasoning driven framework that
augments CBMs with a structure injecting Graph Transformer and a Mixture of
Experts (MoE) module. We construct answer-concept and answer-question graphs
for multimodal inputs to explicitly model the structured relationships among
concepts. Subsequently, we integrate Graph Transformer to capture multi level
dependencies, addressing the limitations of traditional Concept Bottleneck
Models in modeling concept interactions. However, it still encounters
bottlenecks in adapting to complex concept patterns. Therefore, we replace the
feed forward layers with a Mixture of Experts (MoE) module, enabling the model
to have greater capacity in learning diverse concept relationships while
dynamically allocating reasoning tasks to different sub experts, thereby
significantly enhancing the model's adaptability to complex concept reasoning.
MoE-SGT achieves higher accuracy than other concept bottleneck networks on
multiple datasets by modeling structured relationships among concepts and
utilizing a dynamic expert selection mechanism.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于MLLM内在不确定性的训练免费框架，通过模型输出熵作为指导信号，让模型自主聚焦于最相关的视觉信息，在视觉搜索、长视频理解和时间定位等任务上达到与专用方法竞争的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在细粒度感知方面存在困难，如高分辨率图像中的小物体识别或长视频中的关键时刻定位。现有方法通常依赖复杂的任务特定微调，限制了泛化能力并增加了模型复杂度。

Method: 利用MLLM内在不确定性作为主动指导信号，核心洞察是当呈现相关视觉信息时模型输出熵会降低。引入统一机制通过响应不确定性对候选视觉输入进行评分，使模型能自主聚焦于最显著的数据。

Result: 在视觉搜索、长视频理解和时间定位三个复杂视觉任务上，使现成的MLLM达到与专用微调方法竞争的性能表现。

Conclusion: 利用内在不确定性是增强细粒度多模态性能的强大通用策略，验证了该方法的有效性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) often struggle with fine-grained
perception, such as identifying small objects in high-resolution images or
finding key moments in long videos. Existing works typically rely on
complicated, task-specific fine-tuning, which limits their generalizability and
increases model complexity. In this work, we propose an effective,
training-free framework that uses an MLLM's intrinsic uncertainty as a
proactive guidance signal. Our core insight is that a model's output entropy
decreases when presented with relevant visual information. We introduce a
unified mechanism that scores candidate visual inputs by response uncertainty,
enabling the model to autonomously focus on the most salient data. We apply
this simple principle to three complex visual tasks: Visual Search, Long Video
Understanding, and Temporal Grounding, allowing off-the-shelf MLLMs to achieve
performance competitive with specialized, fine-tuned methods. Our work
validates that harnessing intrinsic uncertainty is a powerful, general strategy
for enhancing fine-grained multimodal performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统配准方法速度慢且对采集变异性敏感，限制了定量灌注成像的鲁棒性和可扩展性。

Method: 使用无监督深度学习管道替代迭代配准，通过三步运动校正和鲁棒主成分分析减少对比度相关影响，对齐灌注序列及辅助图像。

Result: 显著改善时间强度曲线平滑度，心肌对齐效果与基线相当但优于未配准状态，灌注图运动减少，处理时间减少15倍。

Conclusion: 该深度学习管道实现了快速鲁棒的运动校正，提高了定量灌注成像的准确性，有望促进临床广泛应用。

Abstract: Background: Quantitative stress perfusion cardiovascular magnetic resonance
(CMR) is a powerful tool for assessing myocardial ischemia. Motion correction
is essential for accurate pixel-wise mapping but traditional registration-based
methods are slow and sensitive to acquisition variability, limiting robustness
and scalability.
  Methods: We developed an unsupervised deep learning-based motion correction
pipeline that replaces iterative registration with efficient one-shot
estimation. The method corrects motion in three steps and uses robust principal
component analysis to reduce contrast-related effects. It aligns the perfusion
series and auxiliary images (arterial input function and proton
density-weighted series). Models were trained and validated on multivendor data
from 201 patients, with 38 held out for testing. Performance was assessed via
temporal alignment and quantitative perfusion values, compared to a previously
published registration-based method.
  Results: The deep learning approach significantly improved temporal
smoothness of time-intensity curves (p<0.001). Myocardial alignment (Dice =
0.92 (0.04) and 0.91 (0.05)) was comparable to the baseline and superior to
before registration (Dice = 0.80 (0.09), p<0.001). Perfusion maps showed
reduced motion, with lower standard deviation in the myocardium (0.52 (0.39)
ml/min/g) compared to baseline (0.55 (0.44) ml/min/g). Processing time was
reduced 15-fold.
  Conclusion: This deep learning pipeline enables fast, robust motion
correction for stress perfusion CMR, improving accuracy across dynamic and
auxiliary images. Trained on multivendor data, it generalizes across sequences
and may facilitate broader clinical adoption of quantitative perfusion imaging.

Motivation: 传统情感预测方法（如自我评估和面部表情分析）存在主观性和模糊性，而完整EEG测量复杂且资源密集。本研究旨在探索使用低成本EEG设备进行准确情感预测的可能性。

Method: 使用DEAP数据集的EEG通道子集，通过连续小波变换将EEG数据转换为尺度图，然后训练视觉变换器（ViT）模型进行情感分类。

Result: 模型在仅使用12个测量点（通道）的情况下，对4个情感象限（高/低唤醒度和效价）的分类准确率超过91.57%。

Conclusion: 显著减少输入通道数量仍能获得与使用32个通道的最先进方法（96.9%准确率）相媲美的高结果，证明了低成本EEG设备在情感预测中的有效性。

Abstract: Accurately predicting emotions from brain signals has the potential to
achieve goals such as improving mental health, human-computer interaction, and
affective computing. Emotion prediction through neural signals offers a
promising alternative to traditional methods, such as self-assessment and
facial expression analysis, which can be subjective or ambiguous. Measurements
of the brain activity via electroencephalogram (EEG) provides a more direct and
unbiased data source. However, conducting a full EEG is a complex,
resource-intensive process, leading to the rise of low-cost EEG devices with
simplified measurement capabilities. This work examines how subsets of EEG
channels from the DEAP dataset can be used for sufficiently accurate emotion
prediction with low-cost EEG devices, rather than fully equipped
EEG-measurements. Using Continuous Wavelet Transformation to convert EEG data
into scaleograms, we trained a vision transformer (ViT) model for emotion
classification. The model achieved over 91,57% accuracy in predicting 4
quadrants (high/low per arousal and valence) with only 12 measuring points
(also referred to as channels). Our work shows clearly, that a significant
reduction of input channels yields high results compared to state-of-the-art
results of 96,9% with 32 channels. Training scripts to reproduce our code can

TL;DR: 提出一种解决极端盲图像恢复(EBIR)的新框架，通过将极度低质量(ELQ)到高质量(HQ)的恢复过程分解为两步：先学习投影器将ELQ图像映射到中间低质量流形，再用现成的BIR模型恢复至HQ。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有盲图像恢复方法在处理极端复合退化时表现不佳，直接学习ELQ到HQ的映射因巨大的域差距导致不自然的伪影和细节丢失。

Method: 提出分解框架：1）学习投影器将ELQ图像映射到中间LQ流形；2）使用冻结的现成BIR模型恢复至HQ。基于信息瓶颈理论推导训练目标，平衡低质量重建和高质量先验匹配。

Result: 在严重退化场景下的广泛实验验证了方法的有效性，支持推理时提示精炼和即插即用增强现有模型。

Conclusion: 该框架通过分解恢复过程解决了EBIR挑战，提供了理论驱动的训练目标，能够有效稳定训练并提升恢复质量。

Abstract: Blind Image Restoration (BIR) methods have achieved remarkable success but
falter when faced with Extreme Blind Image Restoration (EBIR), where inputs
suffer from severe, compounded degradations beyond their training scope.
Directly learning a mapping from extremely low-quality (ELQ) to high-quality
(HQ) images is challenging due to the massive domain gap, often leading to
unnatural artifacts and loss of detail. To address this, we propose a novel
framework that decomposes the intractable ELQ-to-HQ restoration process. We
first learn a projector that maps an ELQ image onto an intermediate,
less-degraded LQ manifold. This intermediate image is then restored to HQ using
a frozen, off-the-shelf BIR model. Our approach is grounded in information
theory; we provide a novel perspective of image restoration as an Information
Bottleneck problem and derive a theoretically-driven objective to train our
projector. This loss function effectively stabilizes training by balancing a
low-quality reconstruction term with a high-quality prior-matching term. Our
framework enables Look Forward Once (LFO) for inference-time prompt refinement,
and supports plug-and-play strengthening of existing image restoration models
without need for finetuning. Extensive experiments under severe degradation
regimes provide a thorough analysis of the effectiveness of our work.

Motivation: 在陶瓷制造中，无损检测对于确保组件质量至关重要，而光学相干断层扫描能够提供高分辨率内部成像，但需要自动化方法来检测孔隙、分层或夹杂物等缺陷

Method: 基于U-Net架构的神经网络，使用手动分割标注的OCT图像进行训练，评估多种实验配置，并采用后处理技术进行定量和定性评估

Abstract: Non-destructive testing (NDT) is essential in ceramic manufacturing to ensure
the quality of components without compromising their integrity. In this
context, Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) enables high-resolution internal
imaging, revealing defects such as pores, delaminations, or inclusions. This
paper presents an automatic defect detection system based on Deep Learning
(DL), trained on OCT images with manually segmented annotations. A neural
network based on the U-Net architecture is developed, evaluating multiple
experimental configurations to enhance its performance. Post-processing
techniques enable both quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the
predictions. The system shows an accurate behavior of 0.979 Dice Score,
outperforming comparable studies. The inference time of 18.98 seconds per

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动音频描述生成工作主要关注短片段，且与单一参考AD比较，但AD写作具有主观性，需要更全面的评估方法。

Method: 通过分析同一电影的两个独立AD轨道来量化主观性，提出ADQA基准测试，评估长视频段的音频描述质量，包含视觉欣赏和叙事理解问题。

Result: 当前AD生成方法在帮助BLV用户理解故事和欣赏视觉细节方面远落后于人工创作的AD。

Conclusion: 需要新的评估基准来推动AD生成研究，提出了公共排行榜用于基准测试，并给出未来工作建议。

Abstract: Audio descriptions (ADs) narrate important visual details in movies, enabling
Blind and Low Vision (BLV) users to understand narratives and appreciate visual
details. Existing works in automatic AD generation mostly focus on few-second
trimmed clips, and evaluate them by comparing against a single ground-truth
reference AD. However, writing ADs is inherently subjective. Through alignment
and analysis of two independent AD tracks for the same movies, we quantify the
subjectivity in when and whether to describe, and what and how to highlight.
Thus, we show that working with trimmed clips is inadequate. We propose ADQA, a
QA benchmark that evaluates ADs at the level of few-minute long, coherent video
segments, testing whether they would help BLV users understand the story and
appreciate visual details. ADQA features visual appreciation (VA) questions
about visual facts and narrative understanding (NU) questions based on the
plot. Through ADQA, we show that current AD generation methods lag far behind
human-authored ADs. We conclude with several recommendations for future work
and introduce a public leaderboard for benchmarking.

Motivation: 当前图像-文本对齐评估缺乏综合基准，现有预测器在人类判断对齐、长序列处理、推理效率和多目标评分适用性等方面存在不足。

Method: 采用即插即用架构，在大型视觉语言模型基础上构建奖励头，通过轻量级岭回归层在冻结隐藏状态上训练，实现多目标和单目标评分。

Result: MULTI-TAP在不同LVLM架构上表现稳健，性能显著优于现有指标，与GPT-4o基预测器相当但模型更小（7-8B），在效率和性能上均优于VisionREWARD。

Conclusion: MULTI-TAP为可靠视觉语言应用提供了强大的评估工具，新发布的EYE4ALL数据集为开发更易访问的AI系统奠定了基础，特别是考虑了盲人和低视力用户的需求。

Abstract: Evaluating image-text alignment while reflecting human preferences across
multiple aspects is a significant issue for the development of reliable
vision-language applications. It becomes especially crucial in real-world
scenarios where multiple valid descriptions exist depending on contexts or user
needs. However, research progress is hindered by the lack of comprehensive
benchmarks and existing evaluation predictors lacking at least one of these key
properties: (1) Alignment with human judgments, (2) Long-sequence processing,
(3) Inference efficiency, and (4) Applicability to multi-objective scoring. To
address these challenges, we propose a plug-and-play architecture to build a
robust predictor, MULTI-TAP (Multi-Objective Task-Aware Predictor), capable of
both multi and single-objective scoring. MULTI-TAP can produce a single overall
score, utilizing a reward head built on top of a large vision-language model
(LVLMs). We show that MULTI-TAP is robust in terms of application to different
LVLM architectures, achieving significantly higher performance than existing
metrics and even on par with the GPT-4o-based predictor, G-VEval, with a
smaller size (7-8B). By training a lightweight ridge regression layer on the
frozen hidden states of a pre-trained LVLM, MULTI-TAP can produce fine-grained
scores for multiple human-interpretable objectives. MULTI-TAP performs better
than VisionREWARD, a high-performing multi-objective reward model, in both
performance and efficiency on multi-objective benchmarks and our newly released
text-image-to-text dataset, EYE4ALL. Our new dataset, consisting of
chosen/rejected human preferences (EYE4ALLPref) and human-annotated
fine-grained scores across seven dimensions (EYE4ALLMulti), can serve as a
foundation for developing more accessible AI systems by capturing the
underlying preferences of users, including blind and low-vision (BLV)
individuals.

Motivation: 探索生成世界模型是否能够替代传统的视觉编码器范式，用于通用多模态理解任务，特别是研究世界模型先验转移到视觉语言模型中的能力。

Method: 重新利用视频扩散模型作为生成编码器，执行单步去噪操作，将得到的潜在表示作为视觉嵌入，构建称为WorldLMs的模型类别，其中最佳变体命名为Dynamic Vision Aligner (DyVA)。

Result: DyVA在视觉推理任务中超越了开源和专有基线，达到最先进或相当的性能，特别是在空间推理能力方面表现显著提升。

Conclusion: WorldLMs通过继承视频预训练的运动一致性内部化获得了性能提升，为利用世界模型先验的新型视觉语言模型家族铺平了道路，有望成为通用视觉学习者的有前途路径。

Abstract: Trained on internet-scale video data, generative world models are
increasingly recognized as powerful world simulators that can generate
consistent and plausible dynamics over structure, motion, and physics. This
raises a natural question: with the advent of strong video foundational models,
might they supplant conventional vision encoder paradigms for general-purpose
multimodal understanding? While recent studies have begun to explore the
potential of world models on common vision tasks, these explorations typically
lack a systematic investigation of generic, multimodal tasks. In this work, we
strive to investigate the capabilities when world model priors are transferred
into Vision-Language Models: we re-purpose a video diffusion model as a
generative encoder to perform a single denoising step and treat the resulting
latents as a set of visual embedding. We empirically investigate this class of
models, which we refer to as World-Language Models (WorldLMs), and we find that
generative encoders can capture latents useful for downstream understanding
that show distinctions from conventional encoders. Naming our best-performing
variant Dynamic Vision Aligner (DyVA), we further discover that this method
significantly enhances spatial reasoning abilities and enables single-image
models to perform multi-frame reasoning. Through the curation of a suite of
visual reasoning tasks, we find DyVA to surpass both open-source and
proprietary baselines, achieving state-of-the-art or comparable performance. We
attribute these gains to WorldLM's inherited motion-consistency internalization
from video pre-training. Finally, we systematically explore extensive model
designs to highlight promising directions for future work. We hope our study
can pave the way for a new family of VLMs that leverage priors from world
models and are on a promising path towards generalist vision learners.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有黑盒对抗攻击方法需要多次查询或训练扩散模型来生成对抗样本，这在现实场景中适用性有限。需要开发一种更实用的零查询攻击方法。

Method: 从DNN获取特征图，将其添加到干净图像中，从而干扰目标模型的分类。这种方法不需要多次查询就能生成欺骗性对抗样本。

Result: ZQBA能够将对抗样本迁移到不同模型和数据集（CIFAR和Tiny ImageNet），在单次查询下比现有最先进的黑盒攻击更有效，同时保持扰动的不可感知性。

Conclusion: ZQBA方法强调了在现实世界环境中使用DNN的脆弱性，提供了一种高效且实用的黑盒对抗攻击解决方案。

Abstract: Current black-box adversarial attacks either require multiple queries or
diffusion models to produce adversarial samples that can impair the target
model performance. However, these methods require training a surrogate loss or
diffusion models to produce adversarial samples, which limits their
applicability in real-world settings. Thus, we propose a Zero Query Black-box
Adversarial (ZQBA) attack that exploits the representations of Deep Neural
Networks (DNNs) to fool other networks. Instead of requiring thousands of
queries to produce deceiving adversarial samples, we use the feature maps
obtained from a DNN and add them to clean images to impair the classification
of a target model. The results suggest that ZQBA can transfer the adversarial
samples to different models and across various datasets, namely CIFAR and Tiny
ImageNet. The experiments also show that ZQBA is more effective than
state-of-the-art black-box attacks with a single query, while maintaining the
imperceptibility of perturbations, evaluated both quantitatively (SSIM) and
qualitatively, emphasizing the vulnerabilities of employing DNNs in real-world
contexts. All the source code is available at

Abstract: In the context of image classification, Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs)
first embed images into a set of human-understandable concepts, followed by an
intrinsically interpretable classifier that predicts labels based on these
intermediate representations. While CBMs offer a semantically meaningful and
interpretable classification pipeline, they often sacrifice predictive
performance compared to end-to-end convolutional neural networks. Moreover, the
propagation of uncertainty from concept predictions to final label decisions
remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel uncertainty-aware and
interpretable classifier for the second stage of CBMs. Our method learns a set
of binary class-level concept prototypes and uses the distances between
predicted concept vectors and each class prototype as both a classification
score and a measure of uncertainty. These prototypes also serve as
interpretable classification rules, indicating which concepts should be present
in an image to justify a specific class prediction. The proposed framework
enhances both interpretability and robustness by enabling conformal prediction
for uncertain or outlier inputs based on their deviation from the learned
binary class-level concept prototypes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Authentic Discrete Diffusion (ADD)框架，直接在one-hot空间保持扩散核心特性，通过协调机制重新定义伪离散扩散方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统伪离散扩散方法依赖连续潜在空间扩散或掩码策略，ADD旨在直接在one-hot空间保持扩散特性，建立判别式与生成式学习的桥梁

Method: 使用浮点编码的one-hot类数据作为扩散输入，引入时间步条件交叉熵损失，在扩散模型输出与原始one-hot标签之间建立联系

Result: 在分类任务上表现优于基线，在图像描述文本生成方面也展现出优秀能力，各组件都带来可衡量的增益

Conclusion: ADD框架成功在离散空间实现了真实的扩散过程，为离散数据的扩散建模提供了新范式

Abstract: We propose an Authentic Discrete Diffusion (ADD) framework that fundamentally
redefines prior pseudo-discrete approaches by preserving core diffusion
characteristics directly in the one-hot space through a suite of coordinated
mechanisms. Unlike conventional "pseudo" discrete diffusion (PDD) methods, ADD
reformulates the diffusion input by directly using float-encoded one-hot class
data, without relying on diffusing in the continuous latent spaces or masking
policies. At its core, a timestep-conditioned cross-entropy loss is introduced
between the diffusion model's outputs and the original one-hot labels. This
synergistic design establishes a bridge between discriminative and generative
learning. Our experiments demonstrate that ADD not only achieves superior
performance on classification tasks compared to the baseline, but also exhibits
excellent text generation capabilities on Image captioning. Extensive ablations
validate the measurable gains of each component.

*Yifan Shen,Yangyang Shu,Hye-young Paik,Yulei Sui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了MetaLogic评估框架，用于检测文本到图像模型在语义一致性方面的缺陷，无需真实图像作为参考。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到图像模型在输入提示发生微小语言变化时难以保持语义一致性，暴露了模型在推理和泛化方面的鲁棒性不足。

Method: 利用蜕变测试生成语法不同但语义相同的提示对，通过直接比较生成的图像对来识别不一致性，从而诊断模型逻辑理解的鲁棒性问题。

Result: 在多个最先进的T2I模型上评估发现，即使如Flux.dev和DALLE-3这样的SOTA模型也分别有59%和71%的错位率。

Conclusion: MetaLogic是一种高效、可扩展且有效的方法，能够发现现有评估指标忽略的细粒度逻辑不一致问题。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) models, especially diffusion-based
architectures, have significantly improved the visual quality of generated
images. However, these models continue to struggle with a critical limitation:
maintaining semantic consistency when input prompts undergo minor linguistic
variations. Despite being logically equivalent, such prompt pairs often yield
misaligned or semantically inconsistent images, exposing a lack of robustness
in reasoning and generalisation. To address this, we propose MetaLogic, a novel
evaluation framework that detects T2I misalignment without relying on ground
truth images. MetaLogic leverages metamorphic testing, generating image pairs
from prompts that differ grammatically but are semantically identical. By
directly comparing these image pairs, the framework identifies inconsistencies
that signal failures in preserving the intended meaning, effectively diagnosing
robustness issues in the model's logic understanding. Unlike existing
evaluation methods that compare a generated image to a single prompt, MetaLogic
evaluates semantic equivalence between paired images, offering a scalable,
ground-truth-free approach to identifying alignment failures. It categorises
these alignment errors (e.g., entity omission, duplication, positional
misalignment) and surfaces counterexamples that can be used for model debugging
and refinement. We evaluate MetaLogic across multiple state-of-the-art T2I
models and reveal consistent robustness failures across a range of logical
constructs. We find that even the SOTA text-to-image models like Flux.dev and
DALLE-3 demonstrate a 59 percent and 71 percent misalignment rate,
respectively. Our results show that MetaLogic is not only efficient and
scalable, but also effective in uncovering fine-grained logical inconsistencies
that are overlooked by existing evaluation metrics.

TL;DR: Code2Video是一个基于代码的智能体框架，通过可执行的Python代码生成教育视频，解决了传统生成模型在专业教育视频制作中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统生成模型难以满足专业教育视频对学科知识、精确视觉结构和连贯过渡的要求，而通过可渲染环境的代码控制能更好地解决这些问题。

Method: 框架包含三个协作智能体：Planner（规划内容流程和视觉资源）、Coder（将指令转换为可执行代码）、Critic（使用视觉语言模型优化布局和清晰度）。

Result: 在MMMC基准测试中，Code2Video相比直接代码生成有40%的提升，生成的视频质量可与人工制作的教程相媲美。

Conclusion: Code2Video展示了作为可扩展、可解释和可控方法的潜力，为教育视频生成提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: While recent generative models advance pixel-space video synthesis, they
remain limited in producing professional educational videos, which demand
disciplinary knowledge, precise visual structures, and coherent transitions,
limiting their applicability in educational scenarios. Intuitively, such
requirements are better addressed through the manipulation of a renderable
environment, which can be explicitly controlled via logical commands (e.g.,
code). In this work, we propose Code2Video, a code-centric agent framework for
generating educational videos via executable Python code. The framework
comprises three collaborative agents: (i) Planner, which structures lecture
content into temporally coherent flows and prepares corresponding visual
assets; (ii) Coder, which converts structured instructions into executable
Python codes while incorporating scope-guided auto-fix to enhance efficiency;
and (iii) Critic, which leverages vision-language models (VLM) with visual
anchor prompts to refine spatial layout and ensure clarity. To support
systematic evaluation, we build MMMC, a benchmark of professionally produced,
discipline-specific educational videos. We evaluate MMMC across diverse
dimensions, including VLM-as-a-Judge aesthetic scores, code efficiency, and
particularly, TeachQuiz, a novel end-to-end metric that quantifies how well a
VLM, after unlearning, can recover knowledge by watching the generated videos.
Our results demonstrate the potential of Code2Video as a scalable,
interpretable, and controllable approach, achieving 40% improvement over direct
code generation and producing videos comparable to human-crafted tutorials. The
code and datasets are available at https://github.com/showlab/Code2Video.

Abstract: Building facades represent a significant untapped resource for solar energy
generation in dense urban environments, yet assessing their photovoltaic (PV)
potential remains challenging due to complex geometries and semantic com
ponents. This study introduces SF-SPA (Semantic Facade Solar-PV Assessment), an
automated framework that transforms street-view photographs into quantitative
PV deployment assessments. The approach combines com puter vision and
artificial intelligence techniques to address three key challenges: perspective
distortion correction, semantic understanding of facade elements, and spatial
reasoning for PV layout optimization. Our four-stage pipeline processes images
through geometric rectification, zero-shot semantic segmentation, Large
Language Model (LLM) guided spatial reasoning, and energy simulation.
Validation across 80 buildings in four countries demonstrates ro bust
performance with mean area estimation errors of 6.2% &#177; 2.8% compared to
expert annotations. The auto mated assessment requires approximately 100
seconds per building, a substantial gain in efficiency over manual methods.
Simulated energy yield predictions confirm the method's reliability and

Abstract: Current video generation models produce physically inconsistent motion that
violates real-world dynamics. We propose TrajVLM-Gen, a two-stage framework for

Model to predict coarse-grained motion trajectories that maintain consistency
with real-world physics. Second, these trajectories guide video generation
through attention-based mechanisms for fine-grained motion refinement. We build
a trajectory prediction dataset based on video tracking data with realistic
motion patterns. Experiments on UCF-101 and MSR-VTT demonstrate that
TrajVLM-Gen outperforms existing methods, achieving competitive FVD scores of
545 on UCF-101 and 539 on MSR-VTT.

TL;DR: PhraseStereo是首个将短语-区域分割引入立体图像对的数据集，通过GenStereo从单视图数据生成右视图图像，为立体视觉中的短语定位提供基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有短语定位研究主要局限于单视图图像，忽略了立体视觉中丰富的几何线索。为了利用深度信息实现更精确的上下文感知定位，需要将短语定位扩展到立体视觉领域。

Method: 基于PhraseCut数据集，使用GenStereo从现有单视图数据生成准确的右视图图像，从而构建包含对齐分割掩码和短语标注的立体图像对。

Result: 创建了PhraseStereo数据集，为语言、视觉和3D感知交叉领域的研究奠定了基础，促进了能够同时推理语义和几何的模型发展。

Conclusion: PhraseStereo数据集填补了立体视觉中短语定位的空白，为多模态学习提供了新的挑战和机遇，特别是在利用深度线索进行更精确的上下文感知定位方面。

Abstract: Understanding how natural language phrases correspond to specific regions in
images is a key challenge in multimodal semantic segmentation. Recent advances
in phrase grounding are largely limited to single-view images, neglecting the
rich geometric cues available in stereo vision. For this, we introduce
PhraseStereo, the first novel dataset that brings phrase-region segmentation to
stereo image pairs. PhraseStereo builds upon the PhraseCut dataset by
leveraging GenStereo to generate accurate right-view images from existing
single-view data, enabling the extension of phrase grounding into the stereo
domain. This new setting introduces unique challenges and opportunities for
multimodal learning, particularly in leveraging depth cues for more precise and
context-aware grounding. By providing stereo image pairs with aligned
segmentation masks and phrase annotations, PhraseStereo lays the foundation for
future research at the intersection of language, vision, and 3D perception,
encouraging the development of models that can reason jointly over semantics
and geometry. The PhraseStereo dataset will be released online upon acceptance
of this work.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出NSARM框架，使用自回归模型进行真实图像超分辨率，通过两阶段训练实现高质量和高效推理，在保持快速推理的同时提升对输入图像质量的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Real-ISR方法存在权衡：基于扩散模型的方法质量好但速度慢，直接输入的方法速度快但质量差，且现有方法对输入退化变化缺乏鲁棒性。

Method: 基于视觉自回归模型的逐尺度预测策略，采用两阶段训练：先训练转换网络生成初步尺度，再进行端到端全模型微调。

Result: NSARM在定量和定性评估中优于现有Real-ISR方法，视觉质量更好，推理速度快，对输入图像质量具有更高鲁棒性。

Conclusion: NSARM作为纯自回归模型，在真实图像超分辨率任务中实现了优越的视觉结果和快速推理，并展现出更强的泛化性能。

Abstract: Most recent real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) methods employ
pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models to synthesize the high-quality
image either from random Gaussian noise, which yields realistic results but is
slow due to iterative denoising, or directly from the input low-quality image,
which is efficient but at the price of lower output quality. These approaches
train ControlNet or LoRA modules while keeping the pre-trained model fixed,
which often introduces over-enhanced artifacts and hallucinations, suffering
from the robustness to inputs of varying degradations. Recent visual
autoregressive (AR) models, such as pre-trained Infinity, can provide strong
T2I generation capabilities while offering superior efficiency by using the
bitwise next-scale prediction strategy. Building upon next-scale prediction, we
introduce a robust Real-ISR framework, namely Next-Scale Autoregressive
Modeling (NSARM). Specifically, we train NSARM in two stages: a transformation
network is first trained to map the input low-quality image to preliminary
scales, followed by an end-to-end full-model fine-tuning. Such a comprehensive
fine-tuning enhances the robustness of NSARM in Real-ISR tasks without
compromising its generative capability. Extensive quantitative and qualitative
evaluations demonstrate that as a pure AR model, NSARM achieves superior visual
results over existing Real-ISR methods while maintaining a fast inference
speed. Most importantly, it demonstrates much higher robustness to the quality
of input images, showing stronger generalization performance. Project page:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统分类方法往往忽略不同层次级别间固有的类别关系，从而丢失重要的监督信号。

Method: 第一种方法利用高斯混合模型（G-HMLC），第二种方法使用注意力机制捕捉层次特定特征（A-HMLC），模仿人类处理方式。

Result: 在CIFAR100和ModelNet40数据集上，该方法在线性评估中实现了最先进的性能，比现有层次对比学习方法在准确率上提高了2个百分点。

Conclusion: 该方法通过显式建模层次间类别关系和类别不平衡分布，实现了在所有层次级别上的细粒度聚类，在计算机视觉等领域具有应用潜力。

Abstract: Hierarchical classification is a crucial task in many applications, where
objects are organized into multiple levels of categories. However, conventional
classification approaches often neglect inherent inter-class relationships at
different hierarchy levels, thus missing important supervisory signals. Thus,
we propose two novel hierarchical contrastive learning (HMLC) methods. The
first, leverages a Gaussian Mixture Model (G-HMLC) and the second uses an
attention mechanism to capture hierarchy-specific features (A-HMLC), imitating
human processing. Our approach explicitly models inter-class relationships and
imbalanced class distribution at higher hierarchy levels, enabling fine-grained
clustering across all hierarchy levels. On the competitive CIFAR100 and
ModelNet40 datasets, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in linear
evaluation, outperforming existing hierarchical contrastive learning methods by
2 percentage points in terms of accuracy. The effectiveness of our approach is
backed by both quantitative and qualitative results, highlighting its potential
for applications in computer vision and beyond.

TL;DR: 提出GSMamba，一种结合Mamba选择性状态空间模型和移位窗口自注意力的混合架构，用于视频超分辨率，通过Gather-Scatter机制解决遮挡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RNN在视频超分辨率中存在梯度消失、缺乏并行性和推理速度慢的问题，而Transformer因二次复杂度不适合长序列。Mamba提供了线性复杂度的替代方案，但缺乏空间上下文聚合能力。

Method: 结合移位窗口自注意力进行空间上下文聚合和Mamba选择性扫描进行高效时间传播，引入Gather-Scatter Mamba机制在Mamba传播前后对特征进行对齐和重分布。

Result: 官方实现已提供，该方法有效减少了遮挡伪影，确保聚合信息在所有帧间的有效重分布。

Conclusion: GSMamba通过混合架构成功结合了Mamba的高效时间建模和自注意力的空间上下文聚合能力，为视频超分辨率提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs)-most notably RNNs-have historically played a
central role in sequential modeling. Although attention mechanisms such as
Transformers have since dominated due to their ability to model global context,
their quadratic complexity and limited scalability make them less suited for
long sequences. Video super-resolution (VSR) methods have traditionally relied
on recurrent architectures to propagate features across frames. However, such
approaches suffer from well-known issues including vanishing gradients, lack of
parallelism, and slow inference speed. Recent advances in selective SSMs like
Mamba offer a compelling alternative: by enabling input-dependent state
transitions with linear-time complexity, Mamba mitigates these issues while
maintaining strong long-range modeling capabilities. Despite this potential,
Mamba alone struggles to capture fine-grained spatial dependencies due to its
causal nature and lack of explicit context aggregation. To address this, we
propose a hybrid architecture that combines shifted window self-attention for
spatial context aggregation with Mamba-based selective scanning for efficient
temporal propagation. Furthermore, we introduce Gather-Scatter Mamba (GSM), an
alignment-aware mechanism that warps features toward a center anchor frame
within the temporal window before Mamba propagation and scatters them back
afterward, effectively reducing occlusion artifacts and ensuring effective
redistribution of aggregated information across all frames. The official
implementation is provided at: https://github.com/Ko-Lani/GSMamba.

Conclusion: AI-CNet3D模型在青光眼诊断中表现出色，具有高计算效率、良好可解释性和解剖学一致性。

Abstract: Glaucoma is a progressive eye disease that leads to optic nerve damage,
causing irreversible vision loss if left untreated. Optical coherence
tomography (OCT) has become a crucial tool for glaucoma diagnosis, offering
high-resolution 3D scans of the retina and optic nerve. However, the
conventional practice of condensing information from 3D OCT volumes into 2D
reports often results in the loss of key structural details. To address this,
we propose a novel hybrid deep learning model that integrates cross-attention
mechanisms into a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN), enabling the
extraction of critical features from the superior and inferior hemiretinas, as
well as from the optic nerve head (ONH) and macula, within OCT volumes. We
introduce Channel Attention REpresentations (CAREs) to visualize
cross-attention outputs and leverage them for consistency-based multi-task
fine-tuning, aligning them with Gradient-Weighted Class Activation Maps
(Grad-CAMs) from the CNN's final convolutional layer to enhance performance,
interpretability, and anatomical coherence. We have named this model AI-CNet3D
(AI-`See'-Net3D) to reflect its design as an Anatomically-Informed
Cross-attention Network operating on 3D data. By dividing the volume along two
axes and applying cross-attention, our model enhances glaucoma classification
by capturing asymmetries between the hemiretinal regions while integrating
information from the optic nerve head and macula. We validate our approach on
two large datasets, showing that it outperforms state-of-the-art attention and
convolutional models across all key metrics. Finally, our model is
computationally efficient, reducing the parameter count by one-hundred--fold
compared to other attention mechanisms while maintaining high diagnostic
performance and comparable GFLOPS.

Motivation: 医学影像迁移学习中源数据集选择通常依赖研究者直觉而非系统原则，这会影响算法的泛化性和患者预后。研究旨在从人机交互视角理解实践者如何选择源数据集。

Method: 采用任务型调查方法，对机器学习实践者进行研究，关注他们选择源数据集时的决策过程，不同于以往仅基准测试模型和实验设置的方法。

Result: 研究发现选择是任务依赖性的，受社区实践、数据集属性、计算嵌入以及感知的视觉或语义相似性影响。相似性评分与预期性能并不总是一致，参与者常使用模糊术语。

Conclusion: 通过澄清这些启发式方法，该研究为迁移学习中更系统的源选择提供了实用见解，建议需要更清晰的定义和人机交互工具来使这些原则明确可用。

Abstract: Transfer learning is crucial for medical imaging, yet the selection of source
datasets - which can impact the generalizability of algorithms, and thus
patient outcomes - often relies on researchers' intuition rather than
systematic principles. This study investigates these decisions through a
task-based survey with machine learning practitioners. Unlike prior work that
benchmarks models and experimental setups, we take a human-centered HCI
perspective on how practitioners select source datasets. Our findings indicate
that choices are task-dependent and influenced by community practices, dataset
properties, and computational (data embedding), or perceived visual or semantic
similarity. However, similarity ratings and expected performance are not always
aligned, challenging a traditional "more similar is better" view. Participants
often used ambiguous terminology, which suggests a need for clearer definitions
and HCI tools to make them explicit and usable. By clarifying these heuristics,
this work provides practical insights for more systematic source selection in
transfer learning.

Method: 结合粗对齐、感兴趣区域过滤和初始标志点近似，使用基于补丁的点式CNN并增强注意力机制。

Conclusion: PAL-Net在准确性和计算成本之间提供良好权衡，为高通量3D人体测量分析提供轻量级可扩展解决方案，有潜力支持临床工作流程。

Abstract: Manual annotation of anatomical landmarks on 3D facial scans is a
time-consuming and expertise-dependent task, yet it remains critical for
clinical assessments, morphometric analysis, and craniofacial research. While
several deep learning methods have been proposed for facial landmark
localization, most focus on pseudo-landmarks or require complex input
representations, limiting their clinical applicability. This study presents a
fully automated deep learning pipeline (PAL-Net) for localizing 50 anatomical
landmarks on stereo-photogrammetry facial models. The method combines coarse
alignment, region-of-interest filtering, and an initial approximation of
landmarks with a patch-based pointwise CNN enhanced by attention mechanisms.
Trained and evaluated on 214 annotated scans from healthy adults, PAL-Net
achieved a mean localization error of 3.686 mm and preserves relevant
anatomical distances with a 2.822 mm average error, comparable to
intra-observer variability. To assess generalization, the model was further
evaluated on 700 subjects from the FaceScape dataset, achieving a point-wise
error of 0.41\,mm and a distance-wise error of 0.38\,mm. Compared to existing
methods, PAL-Net offers a favorable trade-off between accuracy and
computational cost. While performance degrades in regions with poor mesh
quality (e.g., ears, hairline), the method demonstrates consistent accuracy
across most anatomical regions. PAL-Net generalizes effectively across datasets
and facial regions, outperforming existing methods in both point-wise and
structural evaluations. It provides a lightweight, scalable solution for
high-throughput 3D anthropometric analysis, with potential to support clinical
workflows and reduce reliance on manual annotation. Source code can be found at

Abstract: Self-supervised learning for inverse problems allows to train a
reconstruction network from noise and/or incomplete data alone. These methods
have the potential of enabling learning-based solutions when obtaining
ground-truth references for training is expensive or even impossible. In this
paper, we propose a new self-supervised learning strategy devised for the
challenging setting where measurements are observed via a single incomplete
observation model. We introduce a new definition of equivariance in the context
of reconstruction networks, and show that the combination of self-supervised
splitting losses and equivariant reconstruction networks results in unbiased
estimates of the supervised loss. Through a series of experiments on image
inpainting, accelerated magnetic resonance imaging, and compressive sensing, we
demonstrate that the proposed loss achieves state-of-the-art performance in
settings with highly rank-deficient forward models.

Abstract: In surveillance scenarios, varying camera distances cause significant
differences among pedestrian image resolutions, making it hard to match
low-resolution (LR) images with high-resolution (HR) counterparts, limiting the
performance of Re-Identification (ReID) tasks. Most existing Cross-Resolution
ReID (CR-ReID) methods rely on super-resolution (SR) or joint learning for
feature compensation, which increases training and inference complexity and has
reached a performance bottleneck in recent studies. Inspired by semantic
directions in the word embedding space, we empirically discover that semantic
directions implying resolution differences also emerge in the feature space of
ReID, and we substantiate this finding from a statistical perspective using
Canonical Correlation Analysis and Pearson Correlation Analysis. Based on this
interesting finding, we propose a lightweight and effective Vector Panning
Feature Alignment (VPFA) framework, which conducts CR-ReID from a novel
perspective of modeling the resolution-specific feature discrepancy. Extensive
experimental results on multiple CR-ReID benchmarks show that our method
significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art baseline models while
obtaining higher efficiency, demonstrating the effectiveness and superiority of
our model based on the new finding in this paper.

### [83] [InfVSR: Breaking Length Limits of Generic Video Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00948)
*Ziqing Zhang,Kai Liu,Zheng Chen,Xi Li,Yucong Chen,Bingnan Duan,Linghe Kong,Yulun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InfVSR是一种创新的视频超分辨率方法，通过自回归单步扩散范式处理长视频序列，解决了现有方法在处理长视频时的效率和可扩展性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频超分辨率方法在处理长序列时面临两个主要挑战：全序列多步去噪的低效率，以及时间分解导致的伪影和不连续性。

Method: 将预训练的DiT调整为因果结构，通过滚动KV缓存和联合视觉指导保持局部和全局一致性；将扩散过程蒸馏为单步，采用补丁级像素监督和跨块分布匹配。

Result: 在长视频超分辨率任务中达到最先进质量，语义一致性增强，相比MGLD-VSR等方法速度提升高达58倍。

Conclusion: InfVSR突破了长视频超分辨率的限制，实现了高效可扩展的无界长度视频处理，并建立了专门的长视频评估基准。

Abstract: Real-world videos often extend over thousands of frames. Existing video
super-resolution (VSR) approaches, however, face two persistent challenges when
processing long sequences: (1) inefficiency due to the heavy cost of multi-step
denoising for full-length sequences; and (2) poor scalability hindered by
temporal decomposition that causes artifacts and discontinuities. To break
these limits, we propose InfVSR, which novelly reformulates VSR as an
autoregressive-one-step-diffusion paradigm. This enables streaming inference
while fully leveraging pre-trained video diffusion priors. First, we adapt the
pre-trained DiT into a causal structure, maintaining both local and global
coherence via rolling KV-cache and joint visual guidance. Second, we distill
the diffusion process into a single step efficiently, with patch-wise pixel
supervision and cross-chunk distribution matching. Together, these designs
enable efficient and scalable VSR for unbounded-length videos. To fill the gap
in long-form video evaluation, we build a new benchmark tailored for extended
sequences and further introduce semantic-level metrics to comprehensively
assess temporal consistency. Our method pushes the frontier of long-form VSR,
achieves state-of-the-art quality with enhanced semantic consistency, and
delivers up to 58x speed-up over existing methods such as MGLD-VSR. Code will
be available at https://github.com/Kai-Liu001/InfVSR.

TL;DR: JEPA-T是一个统一的多模态框架，通过联合嵌入预测Transformer处理视觉和文本标记，结合交叉注意力和原始文本嵌入注入来增强文本-图像融合，在ImageNet-1K上表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现代文本到图像生成中基于标记的架构在文本与视觉标记融合方面的挑战，旨在提升条件生成的效果。

Method: 将图像和标题编码为离散标记，使用联合嵌入预测Transformer处理，加入交叉注意力进行条件去噪，并在流匹配损失前注入原始文本嵌入以改善对齐。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K上实现了强大的数据效率、开放词汇泛化能力，并持续优于非融合和后期融合基线方法。

Conclusion: 后期架构融合与目标级对齐相结合，在基于标记的文本到图像生成中提供了条件强度与骨干通用性之间的有效平衡。

Abstract: Modern Text-to-Image (T2I) generation increasingly relies on token-centric
architectures that are trained with self-supervision, yet effectively fusing
text with visual tokens remains a challenge. We propose \textbf{JEPA-T}, a
unified multimodal framework that encodes images and captions into discrete
visual and textual tokens, processed by a joint-embedding predictive
Transformer. To enhance fusion, we incorporate cross-attention after the
feature predictor for conditional denoising while maintaining a task-agnostic
backbone. Additionally, raw texts embeddings are injected prior to the flow
matching loss to improve alignment during training. During inference, the same
network performs both class-conditional and free-text image generation by
iteratively denoising visual tokens conditioned on text. Evaluations on
ImageNet-1K demonstrate that JEPA-T achieves strong data efficiency,
open-vocabulary generalization, and consistently outperforms non-fusion and
late-fusion baselines. Our approach shows that late architectural fusion
combined with objective-level alignment offers an effective balance between
conditioning strength and backbone generality in token-based T2I.The code is
now available: https://github.com/justin-herry/JEPA-T.git

TL;DR: FastForward是一种单次前向传播的视觉定位方法，能够在极短时间内完成地图构建和查询图像定位，无需传统方法所需的长时间地图准备过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉定位方法即使从已知相机姿态的映射图像开始，仍需要数小时到数分钟的地图构建时间，限制了系统的实用性。本文旨在探索能否在保持竞争力的精度下大幅缩短处理时间。

Method: 将多个映射图像表示为3D空间中锚定的特征集合，利用这些映射特征预测查询图像与场景的对应关系，从而估计相机姿态。结合图像检索技术实现快速定位。

Result: FastForward在最小地图准备时间下实现了与最先进方法相当的精度，并在未见过的领域（包括具有挑战性的大规模室外环境）展现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: FastForward证明了通过单次前向传播实现高效视觉定位的可行性，为实时定位系统提供了新的解决方案，特别是在需要快速部署和跨域应用的场景中。

Abstract: Visually localizing an image, i.e., estimating its camera pose, requires
building a scene representation that serves as a visual map. The representation
we choose has direct consequences towards the practicability of our system.
Even when starting from mapping images with known camera poses,
state-of-the-art approaches still require hours of mapping time in the worst
case, and several minutes in the best. This work raises the question whether we
can achieve competitive accuracy much faster. We introduce FastForward, a
method that creates a map representation and relocalizes a query image
on-the-fly in a single feed-forward pass. At the core, we represent multiple
mapping images as a collection of features anchored in 3D space. FastForward
utilizes these mapping features to predict image-to-scene correspondences for
the query image, enabling the estimation of its camera pose. We couple
FastForward with image retrieval and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy when
compared to other approaches with minimal map preparation time. Furthermore,
FastForward demonstrates robust generalization to unseen domains, including
challenging large-scale outdoor environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归模型在序列建模中表现出色，但视觉信号的空间特性与下一个标记预测的顺序依赖性存在冲突，导致次优结果。

Method: 设计了一个后预训练的精炼模块，利用全局上下文和标记间关系，联合优化自回归模型生成的所有标记，缓解序列生成中的误差累积问题。

Result: 实验表明该方法提高了生成质量，增强了模型产生语义一致结果的能力。

Conclusion: 该精炼模块有效改善了自回归模型在视觉语言任务中的性能，通过增强空间对应关系建模解决了顺序依赖与空间特性之间的冲突。

Abstract: Autoregressive models excel in sequential modeling and have proven to be
effective for vision-language data. However, the spatial nature of visual
signals conflicts with the sequential dependencies of next-token prediction,
leading to suboptimal results. This work proposes a plug-and-play refinement
module to enhance the complex spatial correspondence modeling within the
generated visual sequence. This module operates as a post-pretraining step to
jointly refine all generated tokens of autoregressive model, enhancing
vision-language modeling under a shared sequential prediction framework. By
leveraging global context and relationship across the tokens, our method
mitigates the error accumulation issue within the sequential generation.
Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method improves the generation
quality, enhancing the model's ability to produce semantically consistent
results.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了SoftCFG方法解决自回归模型中分类器自由引导的两个关键问题：引导衰减和过度引导，通过不确定性加权引导和步长归一化来提升图像生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归模型在图像生成中面临分类器自由引导的两个主要问题：引导衰减（条件与无条件生成差异随解码过程快速消失）和过度引导（强条件导致视觉连贯性扭曲），需要新的引导方法来平衡文本引导与视觉上下文。

Method: 提出了SoftCFG方法，基于不确定性引导的推理技术，让每个生成的token贡献确定性加权的引导信号；引入了步长归一化来限制SoftCFG的累积扰动，稳定长序列生成。

Result: 实验表明SoftCFG显著优于标准CFG，在ImageNet 256上实现了自回归模型中最优的FID分数。

Conclusion: SoftCFG是一种无需训练、模型无关的方法，能无缝集成到现有自回归流程中，有效解决了引导衰减和过度引导问题，提升了条件图像生成质量。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models have emerged as powerful tools for image
generation by modeling images as sequences of discrete tokens. While
Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) has been adopted to improve conditional
generation, its application in AR models faces two key issues: guidance
diminishing, where the conditional-unconditional gap quickly vanishes as
decoding progresses, and over-guidance, where strong conditions distort visual
coherence. To address these challenges, we propose SoftCFG, an
uncertainty-guided inference method that distributes adaptive perturbations
across all tokens in the sequence. The key idea behind SoftCFG is to let each
generated token contribute certainty-weighted guidance, ensuring that the
signal persists across steps while resolving conflicts between text guidance
and visual context. To further stabilize long-sequence generation, we introduce
Step Normalization, which bounds cumulative perturbations of SoftCFG. Our
method is training-free, model-agnostic, and seamlessly integrates with
existing AR pipelines. Experiments show that SoftCFG significantly improves
image quality over standard CFG and achieves state-of-the-art FID on ImageNet
256 among autoregressive models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TextCAM是一个新的解释框架，通过结合CAM的空间定位能力和视觉语言模型的语义对齐，为深度视觉模型提供文本化的解释，说明模型关注的位置和支撑决策的视觉属性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的CAM及其变体方法虽然能突出显示影响预测的空间区域，但缺乏对这些激活区域背后语义属性的理解，限制了在高风险应用中的可信度。

Method: TextCAM利用CLIP嵌入和线性判别分析获取通道级语义表示，然后与CAM权重聚合生成文本描述，同时还能将特征通道分组以提供更细粒度的视觉-文本解释。

Result: 在ImageNet、CLEVR和CUB数据集上的实验表明，TextCAM能生成忠实且可解释的推理，提高人类理解能力，检测虚假相关性，并保持模型保真度。

Conclusion: TextCAM成功地将CAM的空间定位能力与视觉语言模型的语义理解相结合，为深度视觉模型提供了更丰富、更语义化的解释方法。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved remarkable success across domains
but remain difficult to interpret, limiting their trustworthiness in
high-stakes applications. This paper focuses on deep vision models, for which a
dominant line of explainability methods are Class Activation Mapping (CAM) and
its variants working by highlighting spatial regions that drive predictions. We
figure out that CAM provides little semantic insight into what attributes
underlie these activations. To address this limitation, we propose TextCAM, a
novel explanation framework that enriches CAM with natural languages. TextCAM
combines the precise spatial localization of CAM with the semantic alignment of
vision-language models (VLMs). Specifically, we derive channel-level semantic
representations using CLIP embeddings and linear discriminant analysis, and
aggregate them with CAM weights to produce textual descriptions of salient
visual evidence. This yields explanations that jointly specify where the model
attends and what visual attributes likely support its decision. We further
extend TextCAM to generate feature channels into semantically coherent groups,
enabling more fine-grained visual-textual explanations. Experiments on
ImageNet, CLEVR, and CUB demonstrate that TextCAM produces faithful and
interpretable rationales that improve human understanding, detect spurious
correlations, and preserve model fidelity.

TL;DR: POVQA是一种数据高效的方法，通过时间池化将每秒视频压缩为单帧图像，并使用轻量级监督对齐大型视觉语言模型，显著提升了视频问答性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频问答系统虽然能处理1500+帧的长视频，但仅对应50秒内容且信息损失严重，需要更高效的视频压缩和推理方法。

Method: 使用混合模糊、加权平均、指数和斜坡池化等技术构建1fps输入，在ReasonVQA数据集上对QWEN-2.5-VL 7B进行监督微调和直接偏好优化。

Result: 在ReasonVQA数据集上，F1分数从0.212提升至0.543，BLEU-4从0.031提升至0.291，ROUGE-L从0.196提升至0.528，推理质量显著提高。

Conclusion: 该方法在不同池化方案下均保持性能增益，在时间证据总结方面表现出强鲁棒性，在TVQA上的零样本测试也得到类似结果。

Abstract: Video Question Answering (VQA) with Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) has
gained significant traction in research ever since the Flamingo was introduced
by Deepmind. Recent advancements in large context/long video question answering
have allowed VQA tasks to have context window of 1500+ frames. However, this
only leads to 50 seconds of video footage without losing any significant
information. We introduce POVQA, a data-efficient pipeline that compresses each
second of video into a single temporally pooled image (via motion blur and
weighted averaging variants) and then align LVLMs with lightweight supervision.
Concretely, we build 1 fps input sources using Blend Blur with Last Frame,
Weighted Average, Exponential and Ramp pooling and fine-tune QWEN-2.5-VL 7B
with supervised two turn target including reasoning and final answer. We apply
Supervised Fine Tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) on our
novel dataset ReasonVQA consisting of 12 movies with 239 human annotated
question-answer with reasoning prompts. On our ReasonVQA dataset, this method
dramatically improves performance over pooled baselines: F1 score improves from
0.212 to 0.543, BLEU-4 from 0.031 to 0.291, and ROUGE-L from 0.196 to 0.528.
Rationale quality also significantly increases. Cross-evaluation of SFT + DPO
on various pooling functions show that the gains persist regardless of the
pooling scheme used at train or test time, indicating strong robustness on
summarization of temporal evidence. Similar observations were made on zero-shot
in TVQA.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常使用单一标量量化生成图像质量，无法提供全面且可解释的图像质量反馈。

Method: 引入"观察-思考-预测"范式，首先定位潜在缺陷，然后生成推理，最后给出定量评分。基于视觉语言模型，通过监督微调和强化学习训练。

Result: 在多个数据集上与人类偏好表现出强对齐，作为奖励模型使用时比基于标量的奖励模型提升10%的生成质量。

Conclusion: ImageDoctor作为评估指标有效，作为奖励模型能显著提升生成质量。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of text-to-image (T2I) models has increased the need
for reliable human preference modeling, a demand further amplified by recent
progress in reinforcement learning for preference alignment. However, existing
approaches typically quantify the quality of a generated image using a single
scalar, limiting their ability to provide comprehensive and interpretable
feedback on image quality. To address this, we introduce ImageDoctor, a unified
multi-aspect T2I model evaluation framework that assesses image quality across
four complementary dimensions: plausibility, semantic alignment, aesthetics,
and overall quality. ImageDoctor also provides pixel-level flaw indicators in
the form of heatmaps, which highlight misaligned or implausible regions, and
can be used as a dense reward for T2I model preference alignment. Inspired by
the diagnostic process, we improve the detail sensitivity and reasoning
capability of ImageDoctor by introducing a "look-think-predict" paradigm, where
the model first localizes potential flaws, then generates reasoning, and
finally concludes the evaluation with quantitative scores. Built on top of a
vision-language model and trained through a combination of supervised
fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, ImageDoctor demonstrates strong
alignment with human preference across multiple datasets, establishing its
effectiveness as an evaluation metric. Furthermore, when used as a reward model
for preference tuning, ImageDoctor significantly improves generation quality --
achieving an improvement of 10% over scalar-based reward models.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为AT-RA的新型高光谱对抗训练方法，通过增强光谱信息多样性和确保空间平滑性来提升高光谱分类模型对抗攻击的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于深度学习的高光谱分类模型对对抗攻击高度脆弱，而现有防御方法存在可扩展性差、对强攻击防御效果不佳的问题。高光谱数据相比RGB图像具有独特的挑战，对抗噪声会扭曲或消除重要的光谱语义信息。

Method: 将对抗训练引入高光谱领域，采用数据增强技术，并提出AT-RA方法，通过增加光谱信息多样性和确保空间平滑性来保护和校正高光谱图像中的光谱语义。

Result: 实验结果显示，AT-RA方法将对抗鲁棒性提升了21.34%（针对AutoAttack）和18.78%（针对PGD-50），同时将良性准确率提高了2.68%。

Conclusion: AT-RA方法有效解决了高光谱数据对抗训练中的独特挑战，显著提升了模型对抗攻击的鲁棒性，同时保持了良好的分类性能。

Abstract: Recent studies have revealed that hyperspectral classification models based
on deep learning are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which pose
significant security risks. Although several approaches have attempted to
enhance adversarial robustness by modifying network architectures, these
methods often rely on customized designs that limit scalability and fail to
defend effectively against strong attacks. To address these challenges, we
introduce adversarial training to the hyperspectral domain, which is widely
regarded as one of the most effective defenses against adversarial attacks.
Through extensive empirical analyses, we demonstrate that while adversarial
training does enhance robustness across various models and datasets,
hyperspectral data introduces unique challenges not seen in RGB images.
Specifically, we find that adversarial noise and the non-smooth nature of
adversarial examples can distort or eliminate important spectral semantic
information. To mitigate this issue, we employ data augmentation techniques and
propose a novel hyperspectral adversarial training method, termed AT-RA. By
increasing the diversity of spectral information and ensuring spatial
smoothness, AT-RA preserves and corrects spectral semantics in hyperspectral
images. Experimental results show that AT-RA improves adversarial robustness by
21.34% against AutoAttack and 18.78% against PGD-50 while boosting benign
accuracy by 2.68%.

Conclusion: 该方法首次实现了基于扩散模型的安全、高质量可逆人脸匿名化，通过密钥机制和面部掩码约束，在隐私保护和可逆性之间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: Face images processed by computer vision algorithms contain sensitive
personal information that malicious actors can capture without consent. These
privacy and security risks highlight the need for effective face anonymization
methods. Current methods struggle to propose a good trade-off between a secure
scheme with high-quality image generation and reversibility for later person
authentication. Diffusion-based approaches produce high-quality anonymized
images but lack the secret key mechanism to ensure that only authorized parties
can reverse the process. In this paper, we introduce, to our knowledge, the
first secure, high-quality reversible anonymization method based on a diffusion
model. We propose to combine the secret key with the latent faces
representation of the diffusion model. To preserve identity-irrelevant
features, generation is constrained by a facial mask, maintaining high-quality
images. By using a deterministic forward and backward diffusion process, our
approach enforces that the original face can be recovered with the correct
secret key. We also show that the proposed method produces anonymized faces
that are less visually similar to the original faces, compared to other
previous work.

Method: 使用分层图结构（楼层、房间、物体、功能元素），通过优化几何和视觉覆盖的关键帧选择，利用VLM提取场景信息，无需显式建模物体间关系边，采用分层RAG管道提取相关上下文。

Result: 在四个不同基准测试（包括3D物体分割和复杂查询检索）中，KeySG在大多数指标上优于先前方法，展示了其卓越的语义丰富性和效率。

Conclusion: KeySG框架通过分层图表示和关键帧优化，有效解决了3D场景图的语义限制和可扩展性问题，为复杂人类中心环境中的机器人推理和规划提供了更强大的支持。

Abstract: In recent years, 3D scene graphs have emerged as a powerful world
representation, offering both geometric accuracy and semantic richness.
Combining 3D scene graphs with large language models enables robots to reason,
plan, and navigate in complex human-centered environments. However, current
approaches for constructing 3D scene graphs are semantically limited to a
predefined set of relationships, and their serialization in large environments
can easily exceed an LLM's context window. We introduce KeySG, a framework that
represents 3D scenes as a hierarchical graph consisting of floors, rooms,
objects, and functional elements, where nodes are augmented with multi-modal
information extracted from keyframes selected to optimize geometric and visual
coverage. The keyframes allow us to efficiently leverage VLM to extract scene
information, alleviating the need to explicitly model relationship edges
between objects, enabling more general, task-agnostic reasoning and planning.
Our approach can process complex and ambiguous queries while mitigating the
scalability issues associated with large scene graphs by utilizing a
hierarchical retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline to extract relevant
context from the graph. Evaluated across four distinct benchmarks -- including
3D object segmentation and complex query retrieval -- KeySG outperforms prior
approaches on most metrics, demonstrating its superior semantic richness and
efficiency.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) are increasingly used in
autonomous-vehicle (AV) stacks, but hallucination limits their reliability in
safety-critical pipelines. We present Shapley-credited Context-Aware
Dawid-Skene with Agreement, a game-theoretic fusion method for multi-label
understanding of ego-view dashcam video. It learns per-model, per-label,
context-conditioned reliabilities from labelled history and, at inference,
converts each model's report into an agreement-guardrailed log-likelihood ratio
that is combined with a contextual prior and a public reputation state updated
via Shapley-based team credit. The result is calibrated, thresholdable
posteriors that (i) amplify agreement among reliable models, (ii) preserve
uniquely correct single-model signals, and (iii) adapt to drift. To specialise
general VLMs, we curate 1,000 real-world dashcam clips with structured
annotations (scene description, manoeuvre recommendation, rationale) via an
automatic pipeline that fuses HDD ground truth, vehicle kinematics, and YOLOv11
+ BoT-SORT tracking, guided by a three-step chain-of-thought prompt; three
heterogeneous VLMs are then fine-tuned with LoRA. We evaluate with Hamming

proposed method achieves a 23% reduction in Hamming distance, 55% improvement
in Macro-F1, and 47% improvement in Micro-F1 when comparing with the best
single model, supporting VLM fusion as a calibrated, interpretable, and robust
decision-support component for AV pipelines.

TL;DR: EvoWorld是一个结合全景视频生成与演化3D记忆的世界模型，能够进行空间一致的长时程探索。通过将演化的3D重建作为显式空间引导，显著提升了视觉真实性和几何一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受人类能够在脑海中探索和重放3D环境的能力启发，旨在开发能够进行空间一致长时程探索的世界模型。

Method: 1) 基于单张全景图生成未来视频帧；2) 使用前馈即插即用transformer演化3D重建；3) 基于几何重投影从显式3D记忆中合成未来帧。

Result: 在合成户外环境、Habitat室内场景和真实世界场景的基准测试中，演化3D记忆显著提升了视觉保真度并保持了空间场景一致性。

Conclusion: EvoWorld代表了向长时程空间一致世界建模的重要进展，通过显式3D空间引导实现了优于现有方法的性能。

Abstract: Humans possess a remarkable ability to mentally explore and replay 3D
environments they have previously experienced. Inspired by this mental process,
we present EvoWorld: a world model that bridges panoramic video generation with
evolving 3D memory to enable spatially consistent long-horizon exploration.
Given a single panoramic image as input, EvoWorld first generates future video
frames by leveraging a video generator with fine-grained view control, then
evolves the scene's 3D reconstruction using a feedforward plug-and-play
transformer, and finally synthesizes futures by conditioning on geometric
reprojections from this evolving explicit 3D memory. Unlike prior
state-of-the-arts that synthesize videos only, our key insight lies in
exploiting this evolving 3D reconstruction as explicit spatial guidance for the
video generation process, projecting the reconstructed geometry onto target
viewpoints to provide rich spatial cues that significantly enhance both visual
realism and geometric consistency. To evaluate long-range exploration
capabilities, we introduce the first comprehensive benchmark spanning synthetic
outdoor environments, Habitat indoor scenes, and challenging real-world
scenarios, with particular emphasis on loop-closure detection and spatial
coherence over extended trajectories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our evolving 3D memory substantially improves visual fidelity and maintains
spatial scene coherence compared to existing approaches, representing a
significant advance toward long-horizon spatially consistent world modeling.

TL;DR: IMAGEdit是一个无需训练的视频多主体编辑框架，通过多模态对齐和掩码重定向模块实现任意数量视频主体的外观编辑，无需微调或重新训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频编辑方法在多主体编辑时存在多模态条件不足和掩码边界纠缠问题，限制了实际应用范围。

Method: 使用提示引导的多模态对齐模块和基于先验的掩码重定向模块，利用大模型生成多模态信息和掩码运动序列，然后输入预训练的掩码驱动视频生成模型合成编辑后的视频。

Result: 在新建的多主体基准MSVBench上的实验表明，IMAGEdit持续超越最先进方法，具有强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: IMAGEdit显著扩展了视频编辑的适用性，兼容任何掩码驱动视频生成模型，显著提升整体性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we present IMAGEdit, a training-free framework for any number
of video subject editing that manipulates the appearances of multiple
designated subjects while preserving non-target regions, without finetuning or
retraining. We achieve this by providing robust multimodal conditioning and
precise mask sequences through a prompt-guided multimodal alignment module and
a prior-based mask retargeting module. We first leverage large models'
understanding and generation capabilities to produce multimodal information and
mask motion sequences for multiple subjects across various types. Then, the
obtained prior mask sequences are fed into a pretrained mask-driven video
generation model to synthesize the edited video. With strong generalization
capability, IMAGEdit remedies insufficient prompt-side multimodal conditioning
and overcomes mask boundary entanglement in videos with any number of subjects,
thereby significantly expanding the applicability of video editing. More
importantly, IMAGEdit is compatible with any mask-driven video generation
model, significantly improving overall performance. Extensive experiments on
our newly constructed multi-subject benchmark MSVBench verify that IMAGEdit
consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods. Code, models, and datasets are
publicly available at https://github.com/XWH-A/IMAGEdit.

*Hong kyu Lee,Ruixuan Liu,Li Xiong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为直接令牌优化（DTO）的新型自包含机器学习遗忘方法，无需外部资源即可有效移除模型对特定训练数据子集的记忆。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型遗忘方法通常依赖辅助语言模型、保留数据集或商业AI服务，这在实践中不切实际且可能引入额外隐私风险。

Method: 通过识别序列中的目标令牌（用于优化遗忘目标）和非目标令牌（用于保持模型性能），直接在令牌级别进行优化。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上，DTO相比最新基线方法在遗忘质量上提升了高达16.8倍，同时保持了可比较的模型性能。

Conclusion: DTO是一种有效且实用的自包含遗忘方法，能够在不依赖外部资源的情况下实现高质量的机器学习遗忘。

Abstract: Machine unlearning is an emerging technique that removes the influence of a
subset of training data (forget set) from a model without full retraining, with
applications including privacy protection, content moderation, and model
correction. The key challenge lies in ensuring that the model completely
forgets the knowledge of the forget set without compromising its overall
utility. Existing unlearning methods for large language models (LLMs) often
utilize auxiliary language models, retain datasets, or even commercial AI
services for effective unlearning and maintaining the model utility. However,
dependence on these external resources is often impractical and could
potentially introduce additional privacy risks. In this work, we propose direct
token optimization (DTO), a novel self-contained unlearning approach for LLMs
that directly optimizes the token level objectives and eliminates the need for
external resources. Given a sequence to unlearn, we identify two categories of
tokens: target tokens, which capture critical knowledge for unlearning, and the
remaining non-target tokens, which are crucial for maintaining the model
utility. The former are used to optimize the unlearning objective, while the
latter serve to preserve the model's performance. The experimental results show
that the proposed DTO achieves up to 16.8$\times$ improvement in forget quality
on several benchmark datasets than the latest baselines while maintaining a
comparable level of model utility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 程序性活动助手在日常生活和职业场景中具有广泛应用潜力，但相关系统开发仍处于探索不足状态。

Method: 使用多媒体返回工具实现交错多模态推理，在训练免费设置下运行，支持智能灵活的工具选择。

Result: 在ProMQA-Assembly数据集上的实验表明，该方法能提升视觉语言模型性能，特别是GPT-5和MiMo-VL模型。消融研究证实了多媒体返回工具和灵活工具选择的有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架和实验结果促进了视频和多模态任务的图像思维范式，推动了程序性活动助手的发展。

Abstract: Procedural activity assistants potentially support humans in a variety of
settings, from our daily lives, e.g., cooking or assembling flat-pack
furniture, to professional situations, e.g., manufacturing or biological
experiments. Despite its potential use cases, the system development tailored
for such an assistant is still underexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel
framework, called TAMA, a Tool-Augmented Multimodal Agent, for procedural
activity understanding. TAMA enables interleaved multimodal reasoning by making
use of multimedia-returning tools in a training-free setting. Our experimental
result on the multimodal procedural QA dataset, ProMQA-Assembly, shows that our
approach can improve the performance of vision-language models, especially
GPT-5 and MiMo-VL. Furthermore, our ablation studies provide empirical support
for the effectiveness of two features that characterize our framework,
multimedia-returning tools and agentic flexible tool selection. We believe our
proposed framework and experimental results facilitate the thinking with images
paradigm for video and multimodal tasks, let alone the development of
procedural activity assistants.

Motivation: 现有基准测试主要关注简单问题或仅限网络查询，无法评估AI代理在企业环境中处理复杂深度研究任务的能力。

Method: 通过精心设计的合成流程生成任务，包含人工验证，评估代理在异构搜索空间（包括生产力软件、云文件系统、邮件、聊天对话和开放网络）中检索相关信息的能力。

Conclusion: DRBench为推进企业深度研究提供了关键路径，展示了评估AI代理在复杂企业环境中表现的有效性。

Abstract: We introduce DRBench, a benchmark for evaluating AI agents on complex,
open-ended deep research tasks in enterprise settings. Unlike prior benchmarks
that focus on simple questions or web-only queries, DRBench evaluates agents on
multi-step queries (for example, ``What changes should we make to our product
roadmap to ensure compliance with this standard?") that require identifying
supporting facts from both the public web and private company knowledge base.
Each task is grounded in realistic user personas and enterprise context,
spanning a heterogeneous search space that includes productivity software,
cloud file systems, emails, chat conversations, and the open web. Tasks are
generated through a carefully designed synthesis pipeline with
human-in-the-loop verification, and agents are evaluated on their ability to
recall relevant insights, maintain factual accuracy, and produce coherent,
well-structured reports. We release 15 deep research tasks across 10 domains,
such as Sales, Cybersecurity, and Compliance. We demonstrate the effectiveness
of DRBench by evaluating diverse DR agents across open- and closed-source
models (such as GPT, Llama, and Qwen) and DR strategies, highlighting their
strengths, weaknesses, and the critical path for advancing enterprise deep
research. Code is available at https://github.com/ServiceNow/drbench.

Motivation: 随着语言模型应用的普及，需要更好地将个体用户表示给模型。研究探索是否可以利用个人信念系统的某些方面来改进模型的对齐效果。

Method: 开发PrimeX数据集，包含858名美国居民的民意调查数据，额外收集了受访者持有特定观点的书面解释和原始世界观调查数据。

Conclusion: PrimeX中的额外信念信息对NLP和心理学研究社区都有益处，为后续研究开辟了新途径。

Abstract: As the adoption of language models advances, so does the need to better
represent individual users to the model. Are there aspects of an individual's
belief system that a language model can utilize for improved alignment?
Following prior research, we investigate this question in the domain of opinion
prediction by developing PrimeX, a dataset of public opinion survey data from
858 US residents with two additional sources of belief information: written
explanations from the respondents for why they hold specific opinions, and the
Primal World Belief survey for assessing respondent worldview. We provide an
extensive initial analysis of our data and show the value of belief
explanations and worldview for personalizing language models. Our results
demonstrate how the additional belief information in PrimeX can benefit both
the NLP and psychological research communities, opening up avenues for further
study.

TL;DR: PREFDISCO是一个评估方法，将静态基准转化为个性化推理任务，揭示当前LLMs在个性化推理方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM开发将任务解决和偏好对齐分开处理，但在实际应用中，正确解决问题不足够，还需要匹配用户需求，特别是在冷启动或隐私限制场景下。

Method: 引入PREFDISCO评估方法，使用心理学基础的角色和稀疏偏好，将静态基准转化为交互式个性化任务，创建需要不同推理链的场景。

Result: 评估21个前沿模型在10个任务上，发现29.0%的个性化尝试比通用响应更差，而通用响应也无法有效满足个体用户需求。

Conclusion: 个性化推理需要专门开发，不会自然涌现。PREFDISCO建立了可衡量的研究前沿，揭示了当前LLMs交互能力的根本限制。

Abstract: Current large language model (LLM) development treats task-solving and
preference alignment as separate challenges, optimizing first for objective
correctness, then for alignment to aggregated human preferences. This paradigm
fails in human-facing applications where solving a problem correctly is
insufficient if the response mismatches the user's needs. This challenge
intensifies in just-in-time scenarios where no prior user interaction history
exists due to cold-start conditions or privacy constraints. LLMs need to
identify what they don't know about user preferences, strategically elicit
preference values through questioning, then adapt their reasoning processes and
responses accordingly -- a complicated chain of cognitive processes which we
term personalized reasoning. We introduce PREFDISCO, an evaluation methodology
that transforms static benchmarks into interactive personalization tasks using
psychologically-grounded personas with sparse preferences. Our framework
creates scenarios where identical questions require different reasoning chains
depending on user context, as optimal explanation approaches vary by individual
expertise and preferences while maintaining factual accuracy. Evaluation of 21
frontier models across 10 tasks reveals 29.0% of naive personalization attempts
produce worse preference alignment than generic responses, yet generic
responses also fail to serve individual user needs effectively. These findings
suggest personalized reasoning requires dedicated development rather than
emerging naturally. PREFDISCO establishes personalized reasoning as a
measurable research frontier and reveals fundamental limitations in current
LLMs' interactive capabilities, providing a foundation for developing systems
that can adapt to individual users in education, healthcare, and technical
domains where personalization is critical.

TL;DR: 提出了BiasFreeBench基准，用于统一评估LLM去偏方法，包含8种主流技术、两种测试场景，并引入Bias-Free Score响应级指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有去偏方法评估使用不同基线和指标，导致比较不一致，且基于概率的评估与用户实际交互场景存在差距。

Method: 构建统一基准，重组现有数据集为查询-响应设置，比较8种去偏方法（4种提示方法和4种训练方法），在两种场景下评估。

Result: 系统比较了提示与训练范式、模型大小、训练策略对未见偏见的泛化能力等关键维度的去偏性能。

Conclusion: 建立统一测试平台，促进偏见缓解研究的一致性评估。

Abstract: Existing studies on bias mitigation methods for large language models (LLMs)
use diverse baselines and metrics to evaluate debiasing performance, leading to
inconsistent comparisons among them. Moreover, their evaluations are mostly
based on the comparison between LLMs' probabilities of biased and unbiased
contexts, which ignores the gap between such evaluations and real-world use
cases where users interact with LLMs by reading model responses and expect fair
and safe outputs rather than LLMs' probabilities. To enable consistent
evaluation across debiasing methods and bridge this gap, we introduce
BiasFreeBench, an empirical benchmark that comprehensively compares eight
mainstream bias mitigation techniques (covering four prompting-based and four
training-based methods) on two test scenarios (multi-choice QA and open-ended
multi-turn QA) by reorganizing existing datasets into a unified query-response
setting. We further introduce a response-level metric, Bias-Free Score, to
measure the extent to which LLM responses are fair, safe, and
anti-stereotypical. Debiasing performances are systematically compared and
analyzed across key dimensions: the prompting vs. training paradigm, model
size, and generalization of different training strategies to unseen bias types.
We will publicly release our benchmark, aiming to establish a unified testbed
for bias mitigation research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有自动翻译评估指标缺乏可解释性和透明度的问题，利用大型推理模型的显式推理能力来改进翻译质量评估。

Method: 使用大型推理模型进行系统化、逐步的翻译质量评估，采用结构化提示模板，评估不同推理深度对评估质量的影响。

Result: 在WMT24评测中，TASER在系统级评估中获得了参考和无参考设置下的最高软配对准确率，在片段级评估中无参考变体在所有无参考方法中排名第一。

Conclusion: 大型推理模型在翻译质量评估方面展现出显著进步，结合了改进的准确性和跨语言对的透明评估能力。

Abstract: We introduce TASER (Translation Assessment via Systematic Evaluation and
Reasoning), a metric that uses Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) for automated
translation quality assessment. TASER harnesses the explicit reasoning
capabilities of LRMs to conduct systematic, step-by-step evaluation of
translation quality. We evaluate TASER on the WMT24 Metrics Shared Task across
both reference-based and reference-free scenarios, demonstrating
state-of-the-art performance. In system-level evaluation, TASER achieves the
highest soft pairwise accuracy in both reference-based and reference-free
settings, outperforming all existing metrics. At the segment level, TASER
maintains competitive performance with our reference-free variant ranking as
the top-performing metric among all reference-free approaches. Our experiments
reveal that structured prompting templates yield superior results with LRMs
compared to the open-ended approaches that proved optimal for traditional LLMs.
We evaluate o3, a large reasoning model from OpenAI, with varying reasoning
efforts, providing insights into the relationship between reasoning depth and
evaluation quality. The explicit reasoning process in LRMs offers
interpretability and visibility, addressing a key limitation of existing
automated metrics. Our results demonstrate that Large Reasoning Models show a
measurable advancement in translation quality assessment, combining improved
accuracy with transparent evaluation across diverse language pairs.

Method: 设计了首个开源的心电图文语言模型RAG流水线，包含检索增强生成组件，通过检索相关知识来提升模型输出的准确性和自然语言生成质量。

Result: 在三个公开数据集上的实验表明，采用RAG的ELM模型相比非RAG基线模型性能持续提升，并揭示了关键的ELM设计考虑因素。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了心电图文语言模型RAG实现的空白，证明了RAG技术对提升ELM模型性能的有效性，为后续研究提供了开源基准和设计指导。

Abstract: Interest in generative Electrocardiogram-Language Models (ELMs) is growing,
as they can produce textual responses conditioned on ECG signals and textual
queries. Unlike traditional classifiers that output label probabilities, ELMs
are more versatile, supporting domain-specific tasks (e.g., waveform analysis,
diagnosis, prognosis) as well as general tasks (e.g., open-ended questions,
dialogue). Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), widely used in Large Language
Models (LLMs) to ground LLM outputs in retrieved knowledge, helps reduce
hallucinations and improve natural language generation (NLG). However, despite
its promise, no open-source implementation or systematic study of RAG pipeline
design for ELMs currently exists. To address this gap, we present the first
open-source RAG pipeline for ELMs, along with baselines and ablation studies
for NLG. Experiments on three public datasets show that ELMs with RAG
consistently improves performance over non-RAG baselines and highlights key ELM
design considerations. Our code is available at:

Conclusion: 通过校准概率自动评分器来建模偏好分布，可以有效提高其在主观任务中的可靠性，同时保持客观任务的性能。

Abstract: The alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human values increasingly
relies on using other LLMs as automated judges, or ``autoraters''. However,
their reliability is limited by a foundational issue: they are trained on
discrete preference labels, forcing a single ground truth onto tasks that are
often subjective, ambiguous, or nuanced. We argue that a reliable autorater
must learn to model the full distribution of preferences defined by a target
population. In this paper, we propose a general framework for calibrating
probabilistic autoraters to any given preference distribution. We formalize the
problem and present two learning methods tailored to different data conditions:
1) a direct supervised fine-tuning for dense, probabilistic labels, and 2) a
reinforcement learning approach for sparse, binary labels. Our empirical
results show that finetuning autoraters with a distribution-matching objective
leads to verbalized probability predictions that are better aligned with the
target preference distribution, with improved calibration and significantly
lower positional bias, all while preserving performance on objective tasks.

Motivation: LLM在文本生成任务中表现出色，但在文本分类特别是需要细微理解的修订分类任务中表现不足，且传统微调需要大量昂贵的标注数据。

Method: 提出IR-Tuning框架，基于梯度范数分布动态选择重要LLM层进行微调，同时冻结冗余层，实现参数高效微调。

Result: IR-Tuning在多种文本修订任务中优于其他层间PEFT基线方法，具有快速收敛、低GPU内存消耗和小样本有效的特点。

Conclusion: IR-Tuning为LLM在文本分类任务中的参数高效微调提供了有效解决方案，特别适用于标注数据稀缺的场景。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown extraordinary success across various
text generation tasks; however, their potential for simple yet essential text
classification remains underexplored, as LLM pre-training tends to emphasize
generation over classification. While LLMs with instruction tuning can
transform classification into a generation task, they often struggle to
categorize nuanced texts. One such example is text revision, which involves
nuanced edits between pairs of texts. Although simply fine-tuning LLMs for
revision classification seems plausible, it requires a large amount of revision
annotations, which are exceptionally expensive and scarce in the community. To
address this issue, we introduce a plug-and-play layer-wise parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT) framework, i.e., IR-Tuning, which fine-tunes a subset of
important LLM layers that are dynamically selected based on their gradient norm
distribution, while freezing those of redundant layers. Extensive experiments
suggest that IR-Tuning surpasses several layer-wise PEFT baselines over diverse
text revisions, while achieving fast convergence, low GPU memory consumption,
and effectiveness on small revision corpora.

Motivation: 黑盒大语言模型使信息抽取易于配置但难以信任，抽取的信息不能保证基于文档，需要防止幻觉问题。

Method: 三步管道：1) LLM提取器从文档生成结构化实体及其上下文；2) 基于字符串的全局对齐器；3) 评分模型。

Result: 使用SafePassage可将信息抽取任务中的幻觉减少高达85%，且与人类对抽取质量判断高度一致。微调的transformer编码器在标记不安全段落方面优于LLM评分模型。

Conclusion: SafePassage既能减少LLM在信息抽取中的幻觉，又能用于评估LLM，且小样本微调的transformer模型优于LLM评分器。

Abstract: Black box large language models (LLMs) make information extraction (IE) easy
to configure, but hard to trust. Unlike traditional information extraction
pipelines, the information "extracted" is not guaranteed to be grounded in the
document. To prevent this, this paper introduces the notion of a "safe
passage": context generated by the LLM that is both grounded in the document
and consistent with the extracted information. This is operationalized via a
three-step pipeline, SafePassage, which consists of: (1) an LLM extractor that
generates structured entities and their contexts from a document, (2) a
string-based global aligner, and (3) a scoring model. Results show that using
these three parts in conjunction reduces hallucinations by up to 85% on
information extraction tasks with minimal risk of flagging non-hallucinations.
High agreement between the SafePassage pipeline and human judgments of
extraction quality mean that the pipeline can be dually used to evaluate LLMs.
Surprisingly, results also show that using a transformer encoder fine-tuned on
a small number of task-specific examples can outperform an LLM scoring model at
flagging unsafe passages. These annotations can be collected in as little as
1-2 hours.

Method: 定义临床基础标准，包括临床对齐性和关键指标能力（区分度、鲁棒性、单调性），使用精细标注的数据集系统评估现有指标。

Result: 发现现有指标在解释临床语义方面存在局限性：无法区分临床显著错误、过度惩罚无害变异、在错误严重程度级别间缺乏一致性。

Conclusion: 提出的框架为构建更可靠的临床评估方法提供了指导。

Abstract: Automatically generated radiology reports often receive high scores from
existing evaluation metrics but fail to earn clinicians' trust. This gap
reveals fundamental flaws in how current metrics assess the quality of
generated reports. We rethink the design and evaluation of these metrics and
propose a clinically grounded Meta-Evaluation framework. We define clinically
grounded criteria spanning clinical alignment and key metric capabilities,
including discrimination, robustness, and monotonicity. Using a fine-grained
dataset of ground truth and rewritten report pairs annotated with error types,
clinical significance labels, and explanations, we systematically evaluate
existing metrics and reveal their limitations in interpreting clinical
semantics, such as failing to distinguish clinically significant errors,
over-penalizing harmless variations, and lacking consistency across error
severity levels. Our framework offers guidance for building more clinically
reliable evaluation methods.

Abstract: The proliferation of transformer-based language models has revolutionized NLP
domain while simultaneously introduced significant challenges regarding model
transparency and trustworthiness. The complexity of achieving explainable
systems in this domain is evidenced by the extensive array of explanation
methods and evaluation metrics developed by researchers. To address the
challenge of selecting optimal explainability approaches, we present
\textbf{\texttt{o-mega}}, a hyperparameter optimization tool designed to
automatically identify the most effective explainable AI methods and their
configurations within the semantic matching domain. We evaluate o-mega on a
post-claim matching pipeline using a curated dataset of social media posts
paired with refuting claims. Our tool systematically explores different
explainable methods and their hyperparameters, demonstrating improved
transparency in automated fact-checking systems. As a result, such automated
optimization of explanation methods can significantly enhance the
interpretability of claim-matching models in critical applications such as
misinformation detection, contributing to more trustworthy and transparent AI
systems.

*Bowen Wei,Yuan Shen Tay,Howard Liu,Jinhao Pan,Kun Luo,Ziwei Zhu,Chris Jordan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CORTEX是一个用于SOC警报分类的多智能体LLM架构，通过专门智能体协作处理真实证据，显著减少误报并提高调查质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SOC面临每日数万警报的过载问题，传统检测管道脆弱且缺乏上下文，单一LLM方法难以处理嘈杂的企业数据且透明度有限

Method: 采用多智能体LLM架构，包括行为分析智能体检查活动序列、证据收集智能体查询外部系统、推理智能体综合发现形成可审计决策

Result: 在多样化企业场景中，CORTEX相比最先进的单智能体LLM显著减少误报并改善调查质量

Conclusion: 多智能体协作方法比单一LLM更适合高风险的警报分类任务，提供了更好的透明度和处理能力

Abstract: Security Operations Centers (SOCs) are overwhelmed by tens of thousands of
daily alerts, with only a small fraction corresponding to genuine attacks. This
overload creates alert fatigue, leading to overlooked threats and analyst
burnout. Classical detection pipelines are brittle and context-poor, while
recent LLM-based approaches typically rely on a single model to interpret logs,
retrieve context, and adjudicate alerts end-to-end -- an approach that
struggles with noisy enterprise data and offers limited transparency. We
propose CORTEX, a multi-agent LLM architecture for high-stakes alert triage in
which specialized agents collaborate over real evidence: a behavior-analysis
agent inspects activity sequences, evidence-gathering agents query external
systems, and a reasoning agent synthesizes findings into an auditable decision.
To support training and evaluation, we release a dataset of fine-grained SOC
investigations from production environments, capturing step-by-step analyst
actions and linked tool outputs. Across diverse enterprise scenarios, CORTEX
substantially reduces false positives and improves investigation quality over
state-of-the-art single-agent LLMs.

*Zijun Wu,Yongchang Hao,Lili Mou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TokMem是一种令牌化程序记忆，将重复程序存储为紧凑可训练的嵌入，通过记忆令牌编码程序地址和控制信号，在保持骨干模型冻结的同时实现持续适应，显著优于检索增强生成和微调方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型过度依赖提示来指定任务、回忆知识和指导推理，这种方式效率低下，需要在每个步骤重新读取提示，跨任务扩展性差，且缺乏模块化重用机制。

Method: 引入TokMem令牌化程序记忆，将重复程序存储为紧凑可训练的嵌入。每个记忆令牌编码程序地址和控制信号，引导生成过程，同时保持骨干模型冻结以支持持续适应。

Result: 在1000个原子回忆任务和函数调用任务上进行评估，TokMem持续优于检索增强生成方法，避免了重复上下文开销，且使用更少参数优于微调方法。

Conclusion: TokMem为LLMs提供了一种可扩展和模块化的替代方案，超越了提示工程和微调，为语言模型提供了显式的程序记忆能力。

Abstract: Large language models rely heavily on prompts to specify tasks, recall
knowledge and guide reasoning. However, this reliance is inefficient as prompts
must be re-read at each step, scale poorly across tasks, and lack mechanisms
for modular reuse. We introduce TokMem, a tokenized procedural memory that
stores recurring procedures as compact, trainable embeddings. Each memory token
encodes both an address to a procedure and a control signal that steers
generation, enabling targeted behavior with constant-size overhead. To support
continual adaptation, TokMem keeps the backbone model frozen, allowing new
procedures to be added without interfering with existing ones. We evaluate
TokMem on 1,000 tasks for atomic recall, and on function-calling tasks for
compositional recall, where it consistently outperforms retrieval-augmented
generation while avoiding repeated context overhead, and fine-tuning with far
fewer parameters. These results establish TokMem as a scalable and modular
alternative to prompt engineering and fine-tuning, offering an explicit
procedural memory for LLMs.

*Yuling Shi,Yichun Qian,Hongyu Zhang,Beijun Shen,Xiaodong Gu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LongCodeZip是一个专为代码LLM设计的即插即用压缩框架，通过双阶段压缩策略（粗粒度函数级压缩和细粒度块级压缩）有效减少上下文长度，在保持任务性能的同时实现高达5.6倍的压缩比。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM需要在代码库中处理大量信息，长上下文代码生成变得日益重要。现有上下文剪枝技术（如LLMLingua）虽然对通用文本有效，但忽略了代码特定结构和依赖关系，在编程任务中表现不佳。

Method: 采用双阶段压缩策略：1）粗粒度压缩，基于条件困惑度识别和排序函数级块，仅保留最相关函数；2）细粒度压缩，将保留函数分割为基于困惑度的块，在自适应token预算下选择最优子集以最大化相关性。

Result: 在代码补全、摘要和问答等多个任务上的评估表明，LongCodeZip始终优于基线方法，在不降低任务性能的情况下实现高达5.6倍的压缩比。

Conclusion: 通过有效减少上下文大小同时保留关键信息，LongCodeZip使LLM能够更好地扩展到现实世界的大规模代码场景，提升了代码智能应用的效率和能力。

Abstract: Code generation under long contexts is becoming increasingly critical as
Large Language Models (LLMs) are required to reason over extensive information
in the codebase. While recent advances enable code LLMs to process long inputs,
high API costs and generation latency remain substantial bottlenecks. Existing
context pruning techniques, such as LLMLingua, achieve promising results for
general text but overlook code-specific structures and dependencies, leading to
suboptimal performance in programming tasks. In this paper, we propose
LongCodeZip, a novel plug-and-play code compression framework designed
specifically for code LLMs. LongCodeZip employs a dual-stage strategy: (1)
coarse-grained compression, which identifies and ranks function-level chunks
using conditional perplexity with respect to the instruction, retaining only
the most relevant functions; and (2) fine-grained compression, which segments
retained functions into blocks based on perplexity and selects an optimal
subset under an adaptive token budget to maximize relevance. Evaluations across
multiple tasks, including code completion, summarization, and question
answering, show that LongCodeZip consistently outperforms baseline methods,
achieving up to a 5.6x compression ratio without degrading task performance. By
effectively reducing context size while preserving essential information,
LongCodeZip enables LLMs to better scale to real-world, large-scale code
scenarios, advancing the efficiency and capability of code intelligence
applications.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注分类或排序任务，而忽略了需要语言和数学推理的Likert量表评分预测任务。该任务具有重要工业应用价值，但大语言模型在此领域的应用尚未充分探索。

Method: 通过三个数据集上的八种模型进行综合实验，提供不同的上下文信息，包括用户评论和一般偏好描述，并尝试让模型首先生成假设性评论。

Result: 用户撰写的评论显著提升了大语言模型的评分预测性能，效果与传统矩阵分解方法相当；基于具体物品的评论比一般偏好描述更有效；首先生成假设性评论能进一步提升预测性能。

Conclusion: 现成大语言模型在评分预测任务中表现出色，用户评论是关键影响因素，为解决冷启动问题提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Personalizing the outputs of large language models (LLMs) to align with
individual user preferences is an active research area. However, previous
studies have mainly focused on classification or ranking tasks and have not
considered Likert-scale rating prediction, a regression task that requires both
language and mathematical reasoning to be solved effectively. This task has
significant industrial applications, but the utilization of LLMs remains
underexplored, particularly regarding the capabilities of off-the-shelf LLMs.
This study investigates the performance of off-the-shelf LLMs on rating
prediction, providing different in-context information. Through comprehensive
experiments with eight models across three datasets, we demonstrate that
user-written reviews significantly improve the rating prediction performance of
LLMs. This result is comparable to traditional methods like matrix
factorization, highlighting the potential of LLMs as a promising solution for
the cold-start problem. We also find that the reviews for concrete items are
more effective than general preference descriptions that are not based on any
specific item. Furthermore, we discover that prompting LLMs to first generate a
hypothetical review enhances the rating prediction performance. Our code is
available at https://github.com/ynklab/rating-prediction-with-reviews.

Motivation: 现有代理LLM主要通过上下文学习实现多步推理，但这种方法输入冗长且计算成本高。代理微调能够通过训练让LLM内化程序性推理和领域知识，但在专业技术微领域中的有效性尚不明确。

Method: 使用JP1特定数据集（来自领域手册）和LLM自身生成的蒸馏推理轨迹对LLM进行微调，推理时采用检索增强生成和上下文-答案提取器来提高信息相关性。

Result: 在JP1认证考试问题上，该方法相比基础模型实现了14%的性能提升，证明了代理微调在复杂微领域中领域特定推理的潜力。

Conclusion: 代理微调在专业微领域中能够有效提升LLM的决策准确性和搜索效率，为复杂技术领域的领域适应提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Agentic large language models (LLMs) have become prominent for autonomously
interacting with external environments and performing multi-step reasoning
tasks. Most approaches leverage these capabilities via in-context learning with
few-shot prompts, but this often results in lengthy inputs and higher
computational costs. Agent fine-tuning offers an alternative by enabling LLMs
to internalize procedural reasoning and domain-specific knowledge through
training on relevant data and demonstration trajectories. While prior studies
have focused on general domains, their effectiveness in specialized technical
microdomains remains unclear. This paper explores agent fine-tuning for domain
adaptation within Hitachi's JP1 middleware, a microdomain for specialized IT
operations. We fine-tuned LLMs using JP1-specific datasets derived from domain
manuals and distilled reasoning trajectories generated by LLMs themselves,
enhancing decision making accuracy and search efficiency. During inference, we
used an agentic prompt with retrieval-augmented generation and introduced a
context-answer extractor to improve information relevance. On JP1 certification
exam questions, our method achieved a 14% performance improvement over the base
model, demonstrating the potential of agent fine-tuning for domain-specific
reasoning in complex microdomains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管已有多种策略提升多模态代理在图形用户界面中的自主交互能力，但在处理复杂或领域外任务时可靠性仍然有限，需要探究现有多模态代理是否存在伪推理问题。

Method: 提出Agent-ScanKit系统探测框架，包含视觉引导、文本引导和结构引导三种正交探测范式，在不访问模型内部的情况下量化记忆和推理的贡献。

Result: 在5个公开GUI基准测试和18个多模态代理上的结果表明，机械记忆往往优于系统推理，大多数模型主要作为训练对齐知识的检索器，泛化能力有限。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在现实场景中为多模态代理开发稳健推理模型的必要性，为开发可靠多模态代理提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: Although numerous strategies have recently been proposed to enhance the
autonomous interaction capabilities of multimodal agents in graphical user
interface (GUI), their reliability remains limited when faced with complex or
out-of-domain tasks. This raises a fundamental question: Are existing
multimodal agents reasoning spuriously? In this paper, we propose
\textbf{Agent-ScanKit}, a systematic probing framework to unravel the memory
and reasoning capabilities of multimodal agents under controlled perturbations.
Specifically, we introduce three orthogonal probing paradigms: visual-guided,
text-guided, and structure-guided, each designed to quantify the contributions
of memorization and reasoning without requiring access to model internals. In
five publicly available GUI benchmarks involving 18 multimodal agents, the
results demonstrate that mechanical memorization often outweighs systematic
reasoning. Most of the models function predominantly as retrievers of
training-aligned knowledge, exhibiting limited generalization. Our findings
underscore the necessity of robust reasoning modeling for multimodal agents in
real-world scenarios, offering valuable insights toward the development of
reliable multimodal agents.

TL;DR: MOSS-Speech是一个真正的语音到语音大语言模型，无需文本中间表示直接理解和生成语音，结合模态分层架构和冻结预训练策略，在保持文本LLM推理能力的同时增加原生语音能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统语音对话系统依赖级联管道会丢弃副语言线索并限制表达性，现有端到端方法仍依赖文本中间表示造成瓶颈。

Method: 采用模态分层架构和冻结预训练策略，在预训练文本LLM基础上添加原生语音能力。

Result: 在口语问答任务中达到最先进结果，语音到语音性能与现有文本引导系统相当，同时保持竞争力的文本性能。

Conclusion: 通过缩小文本引导与直接语音生成之间的差距，为表达性和高效的端到端语音交互建立了新范式。

Abstract: Spoken dialogue systems often rely on cascaded pipelines that transcribe,
process, and resynthesize speech. While effective, this design discards
paralinguistic cues and limits expressivity. Recent end-to-end methods reduce
latency and better preserve these cues, yet still rely on text intermediates,
creating a fundamental bottleneck. We present MOSS-Speech, a true
speech-to-speech large language model that directly understands and generates
speech without relying on text guidance. Our approach combines a modality-based
layer-splitting architecture with a frozen pre-training strategy, preserving
the reasoning and knowledge of pretrained text LLMs while adding native speech
capabilities. Experiments show that our model achieves state-of-the-art results
in spoken question answering and delivers comparable speech-to-speech
performance relative to existing text-guided systems, while still maintaining
competitive text performance. By narrowing the gap between text-guided and
direct speech generation, our work establishes a new paradigm for expressive
and efficient end-to-end speech interaction.

TL;DR: Graph2Eval是一个基于知识图谱的框架，用于自动生成多模态文档理解和网页交互任务，以全面评估智能体的推理、协作和交互能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着多模态LLM驱动的智能体在自主性和泛化能力上的进步，基于静态数据集的评估已无法充分评估它们在动态环境和多样化任务中的真实能力。现有方法主要针对LLM训练和评估，无法直接应用于需要工具使用和交互能力的智能体任务。

Method: 使用从多源外部数据构建的知识图谱作为任务空间，通过子图采样、任务模板和元路径将语义关系转化为结构化多模态任务。采用基于节点可达性、LLM评分和相似性分析的多阶段过滤管道来保证生成任务的质量和可执行性。

Result: 构建了Graph2Eval-Bench数据集，包含1,319个涵盖文档理解和网页交互场景的任务。实验表明Graph2Eval能有效生成区分智能体和模型性能的任务，揭示不同设置下推理、协作和网页交互方面的差距。

Conclusion: Graph2Eval为智能体评估提供了新视角，能够全面评估多种智能体类型（单智能体、多智能体、网页智能体）的推理、协作和交互能力。

Abstract: As multimodal LLM-driven agents continue to advance in autonomy and
generalization, evaluation based on static datasets can no longer adequately
assess their true capabilities in dynamic environments and diverse tasks.
Existing LLM-based synthetic data methods are largely designed for LLM training
and evaluation, and thus cannot be directly applied to agent tasks that require
tool use and interactive capabilities. While recent studies have explored
automatic agent task generation with LLMs, most efforts remain limited to text
or image analysis, without systematically modeling multi-step interactions in
web environments. To address these challenges, we propose Graph2Eval, a
knowledge graph-based framework that automatically generates both multimodal
document comprehension tasks and web interaction tasks, enabling comprehensive
evaluation of agents' reasoning, collaboration, and interactive capabilities.
In our approach, knowledge graphs constructed from multi-source external data
serve as the task space, where we translate semantic relations into structured
multimodal tasks using subgraph sampling, task templates, and meta-paths. A
multi-stage filtering pipeline based on node reachability, LLM scoring, and
similarity analysis is applied to guarantee the quality and executability of
the generated tasks. Furthermore, Graph2Eval supports end-to-end evaluation of
multiple agent types (Single-Agent, Multi-Agent, Web Agent) and measures
reasoning, collaboration, and interaction capabilities. We instantiate the
framework with Graph2Eval-Bench, a curated dataset of 1,319 tasks spanning
document comprehension and web interaction scenarios. Experiments show that
Graph2Eval efficiently generates tasks that differentiate agent and model
performance, revealing gaps in reasoning, collaboration, and web interaction
across different settings and offering a new perspective for agent evaluation.

TL;DR: CopyPasteLLM通过两阶段高复制响应偏好训练，提高LLM在RAG中对上下文的忠实度，减少幻觉。该方法仅需少量训练样本，在多个基准测试中显著优于基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RAG中LLM不信任提供上下文导致的上下文不忠实幻觉问题，提高生成响应的可靠性。

Method: 提出CopyPasteLLM，通过两阶段高复制响应偏好训练，设计三种提示方法增强复制程度，构建自动化管道将生成响应转换为高复制偏好数据。

Result: 在FaithEval、ConFiQA和PubMedQA上表现最佳，FaithEval准确率比最佳基线提升12.2%至24.5%，仅需365个训练样本（基线数据的1/50）。

Conclusion: CopyPasteLLM通过重新校准对内部参数知识的依赖而非外部知识来减少幻觉，有效提高RAG的上下文忠实度。

Abstract: While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enables large language models
(LLMs) to generate contextually grounded responses, contextual faithfulness
remains challenging as LLMs may not consistently trust provided context,
leading to hallucinations that undermine reliability. We observe an inverse
correlation between response copying degree and context-unfaithful
hallucinations on RAGTruth, suggesting that higher copying degrees reduce
hallucinations by fostering genuine contextual belief. We propose CopyPasteLLM,
obtained through two-stage high-copying response preference training. We design
three prompting methods to enhance copying degree, demonstrating that
high-copying responses achieve superior contextual faithfulness and
hallucination control. These approaches enable a fully automated pipeline that
transforms generated responses into high-copying preference data for training
CopyPasteLLM. On FaithEval, ConFiQA and PubMedQA, CopyPasteLLM achieves best
performance in both counterfactual and original contexts, remarkably with 12.2%
to 24.5% accuracy improvements on FaithEval over the best baseline, while
requiring only 365 training samples -- 1/50th of baseline data. To elucidate
CopyPasteLLM's effectiveness, we propose the Context-Parameter Copying
Capturing algorithm. Interestingly, this reveals that CopyPasteLLM recalibrates
reliance on internal parametric knowledge rather than external knowledge during
generation. All codes are available at

Abstract: Large Language Models are increasingly deployed as autonomous agents for
complex real-world tasks, yet existing systems often focus on isolated
improvements without a unifying design for robustness and adaptability. We
propose a generalist agent architecture that integrates three core components:
a collective multi-agent framework combining planning and execution agents with
critic model voting, a hierarchical memory system spanning working, semantic,
and procedural layers, and a refined tool suite for search, code execution, and
multimodal parsing. Evaluated on a comprehensive benchmark, our framework
consistently outperforms open-source baselines and approaches the performance
of proprietary systems. These results demonstrate the importance of
system-level integration and highlight a path toward scalable, resilient, and
adaptive AI assistants capable of operating across diverse domains and tasks.

Result: 提取了超过61k小时的对齐语音片段，19种语言超过1k小时，22种语言超过500小时高质量语音数据。微调现有ASR模型后，词错误率平均降低41.8%。

Conclusion: 该管道成功构建了大规模多语言语音数据集，显著提升了ASR性能，为解决多语言语音处理中的数据不足问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Recent progress in speech processing has highlighted that high-quality
performance across languages requires substantial training data for each
individual language. While existing multilingual datasets cover many languages,
they often contain insufficient data for most languages. Thus, trained models
perform poorly on the majority of the supported languages. Our work addresses
this challenge by introducing a scalable pipeline for constructing speech
datasets from parliamentary recordings. The proposed pipeline includes robust
components for media retrieval and a two-stage alignment algorithm designed to
handle non-verbatim transcripts and long-form audio. Applying this pipeline to
recordings from 22 European parliaments, we extract over 61k hours of aligned
speech segments, achieving substantial per-language coverage with 19 languages
exceeding 1k hours and 22 languages exceeding 500 hours of high-quality speech
data. We obtain an average 41.8\% reduction in word error rates over baselines
when finetuning an existing ASR model on our dataset, demonstrating the
usefulness of our approach.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究发现，监督微调(SFT)中默认使用的负对数似然(NLL)目标函数存在局限性，提出根据模型能力连续体选择不同的概率目标函数，在模型能力强时使用偏向先验的目标函数效果更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 监督微调(SFT)的泛化能力有限，作者认为这是因为默认的负对数似然(NLL)目标函数在模型后训练阶段可能不再是最优的，因为此时模型已经编码了任务相关的先验知识，且监督信号可能冗长且嘈杂。

Method: 研究了一系列基于概率的目标函数族，通过7个模型骨干、14个基准测试和3个领域的综合实验和消融研究，分析了模型能力连续体对目标函数效果的影响。

Result: 发现模型能力连续体是决定目标函数效果的关键维度：在模型能力强的一端，偏向先验的目标函数(如$-p$, $-p^{10}$等)持续优于NLL；在模型能力弱的一端，NLL占主导；在中间区域，没有单一目标函数占优。

Conclusion: 目标函数的效果取决于模型能力水平，需要根据模型在能力连续体上的位置来选择合适的训练目标函数，这为适应模型能力的目标函数选择提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is the standard approach for post-training large
language models (LLMs), yet it often shows limited generalization. We trace
this limitation to its default training objective: negative log likelihood
(NLL). While NLL is classically optimal when training from scratch,
post-training operates in a different paradigm and could violate its optimality
assumptions, where models already encode task-relevant priors and supervision
can be long and noisy. To this end, we study a general family of
probability-based objectives and characterize their effectiveness under
different conditions. Through comprehensive experiments and extensive ablation
studies across 7 model backbones, 14 benchmarks, and 3 domains, we uncover a
critical dimension that governs objective behavior: the model-capability
continuum. Near the model-strong end, prior-leaning objectives that downweight
low-probability tokens (e.g., $-p$, $-p^{10}$, thresholded variants)
consistently outperform NLL; toward the model-weak end, NLL dominates; in
between, no single objective prevails. Our theoretical analysis further
elucidates how objectives trade places across the continuum, providing a
principled foundation for adapting objectives to model capability. Our code is
available at https://github.com/GaotangLi/Beyond-Log-Likelihood.

Motivation: GUI代理在处理高分辨率截图和长任务时面临效率挑战，现有的缓存压缩方法未能充分利用GUI的空间和时间冗余特性。

Method: 结合空间显著性指导（增强注意力分数）和时间冗余评分（优先修剪冗余历史），采用统一的预算分配策略进行KV缓存压缩。

Result: 在标准GUI代理基准测试中，GUI-KV优于现有压缩方法，在AgentNetBench基准上减少38.9%解码FLOPs同时提高4.1%步骤准确性。

Conclusion: 利用GUI特定的冗余特性可以实现高效可靠的代理性能，GUI-KV无需重新训练即可有效压缩KV缓存。

Abstract: Graphical user interface (GUI) agents built on vision-language models have
emerged as a promising approach to automate human-computer workflows. However,
they also face the inefficiency challenge as they process long sequences of
high-resolution screenshots and solving long-horizon tasks, making inference
slow, costly and memory-bound. While key-value (KV) caching can mitigate this,
storing the full cache is prohibitive for image-heavy contexts. Existing
cache-compression methods are sub-optimal as they do not account for the
spatial and temporal redundancy of GUIs. In this work, we first analyze
attention patterns in GUI agent workloads and find that, unlike in natural
images, attention sparsity is uniformly high across all transformer layers.
This insight motivates a simple uniform budget allocation strategy, which we
show empirically outperforms more complex layer-varying schemes. Building on
this, we introduce GUI-KV, a plug-and-play KV cache compression method for GUI
agents that requires no retraining. GUI-KV combines two novel techniques: (i)
spatial saliency guidance, which augments attention scores with the L2 norm of
hidden states to better preserve semantically important visual tokens, and (ii)
temporal redundancy scoring, which projects previous frames' keys onto the
current frame's key subspace to preferentially prune redundant history. Across
standard GUI agent benchmarks and models, GUI-KV outperforms competitive KV
compression baselines, closely matching full-cache accuracy at modest budgets.
Notably, in a 5-screenshot setting on the AgentNetBench benchmark, GUI-KV
reduces decoding FLOPs by 38.9% while increasing step accuracy by 4.1% over the
full-cache baseline. These results demonstrate that exploiting GUI-specific
redundancies enables efficient and reliable agent performance.

*Minjae Oh,Sangjun Song,Seungkyu Lee,Sungmin Jo,Yohan Jo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出ThinkBrake方法，通过监控句子边界处</think>与当前top token的对数概率差来触发提前终止，解决小推理模型在工具使用中的过度思考问题，在保持或提升准确率的同时显著减少推理token数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小推理模型在工具使用中存在过度思考问题：它们已经达到正确的工具参数配置，但继续推理并用错误的最终调用覆盖它。这种问题在数学推理领域已有研究，但在工具推理领域仍待探索。

Method: 通过oracle rollout在句子边界注入</think>来诊断过度思考问题，并提出了ThinkBrake方法——一种无需训练的解码启发式方法，监控句子边界处</think>与当前top token的对数概率差，当该差值变小时触发终止。

Result: 在Berkeley Function Calling Leaderboard上，oracle终止将平均准确率从85.8%提升到94.2%，同时减少80-94%的token。ThinkBrake在单轮、非实时和实时任务中保持或提升准确率，同时减少高达25%的token，优于各种基线方法。

Conclusion: 过度思考是小推理模型在工具使用中的重要问题，通过适当的提前终止策略可以显著提升性能并减少计算开销，ThinkBrake提供了一种有效的训练无关解决方案。

Abstract: Small reasoning models (SRMs) often overthink during tool use: they reach a
correct tool-argument configuration, then continue reasoning and overwrite it
with an incorrect final call. We diagnose overthinking via oracle rollouts that
inject </think> at sentence boundaries. On the Berkeley Function Calling
Leaderboard (BFCL), this oracle termination lifts average accuracy from 85.8\%
to 94.2\% while reducing tokens by 80-94\%, revealing substantial recoverable
headroom and potential redundant reasoning. While prior work on concise
reasoning has largely targeted mathematics, tool reasoning remains
underexplored. We adapt various early-termination baselines to tool use and
introduce ThinkBrake, a training-free decoding heuristic. ThinkBrake monitors
the log-probability margin between </think> and the current top token at
sentence boundaries and triggers termination when this margin becomes small.
Across BFCL's single turn, non-live and live splits, ThinkBrake preserves or
improves accuracy while reducing tokens up to 25\%, outperforming various
baselines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了CHIME数据集，用于评估大语言模型对中文网络流行语的理解能力，发现LLMs在解释文化内涵丰富的梗时表现不佳，特别是在追溯梗的起源方面。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大语言模型是否真正理解互联网上快速传播的病毒性内容——网络流行语（梗），特别是在中文语境下的理解能力。

Method: 构建CHIME数据集，包含中文网络流行语及其详细注释；设计两个评估任务：1) 解释梗的含义、起源并生成例句；2) 在上下文句子中选择合适的梗填空的多选题。

Result: LLMs能够解释部分梗的含义，但对文化和语言细微差别的梗类型表现显著下降；在追溯梗起源方面持续困难；多选题任务表现低于人类水平。

Conclusion: 大语言模型对中文网络流行语的理解能力有限，特别是在文化背景和起源方面存在明显不足，CHIME数据集将为未来计算性梗理解研究提供支持。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are trained on vast amounts of text from the
Internet, but do they truly understand the viral content that rapidly spreads
online -- commonly known as memes? In this paper, we introduce CHIME, a dataset
for CHinese Internet Meme Explanation. The dataset comprises popular
phrase-based memes from the Chinese Internet, annotated with detailed
information on their meaning, origin, example sentences, types, etc. To
evaluate whether LLMs understand these memes, we designed two tasks. In the
first task, we assessed the models' ability to explain a given meme, identify
its origin, and generate appropriate example sentences. The results show that
while LLMs can explain the meanings of some memes, their performance declines
significantly for culturally and linguistically nuanced meme types.
Additionally, they consistently struggle to provide accurate origins for the
memes. In the second task, we created a set of multiple-choice questions (MCQs)
requiring LLMs to select the most appropriate meme to fill in a blank within a
contextual sentence. While the evaluated models were able to provide correct
answers, their performance remains noticeably below human levels. We have made
CHIME public and hope it will facilitate future research on computational meme
understanding.

TL;DR: 提出了ReSeek框架，通过自校正机制和密集过程奖励函数训练搜索代理，显著提升任务成功率和路径忠实度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有基于强化学习的搜索代理依赖稀疏或基于规则的奖励，导致代理容易陷入次优推理路径且无法恢复的问题

Method: 引入自校正机制，允许代理通过JUDGE动作动态识别和纠正错误搜索路径；设计了包含正确性奖励和实用性奖励的密集过程奖励函数；创建了FictionalHot基准数据集

Result: 在任务成功率和路径忠实度方面显著优于现有最先进基线方法

Conclusion: ReSeek框架直观合理且实践简单，能够有效训练具有自校正能力的搜索代理

Abstract: Search agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated
significant potential in tackling knowledge-intensive tasks. Reinforcement
learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for training these agents to
perform complex, multi-step reasoning. However, prior RL-based methods often
rely on sparse or rule-based rewards, which can lead agents to commit to
suboptimal or erroneous reasoning paths without the ability to recover. To
address these limitations, we propose ReSeek, a novel self-correcting framework
for training search agents. Our framework introduces a self-correction
mechanism that empowers the agent to dynamically identify and recover from
erroneous search paths during an episode. By invoking a special JUDGE action,
the agent can judge the information and re-plan its search strategy. To guide
this process, we design a dense, instructive process reward function, which
decomposes into a correctness reward for retrieving factual information and a
utility reward for finding information genuinely useful for the query.
Furthermore, to mitigate the risk of data contamination in existing datasets,
we introduce FictionalHot, a new and challenging benchmark with recently
curated questions requiring complex reasoning. Being intuitively reasonable and
practically simple, extensive experiments show that agents trained with ReSeek
significantly outperform SOTA baselines in task success rate and path
faithfulness.

TL;DR: 提出了CoT Vectors来低成本提升LLMs的推理能力，通过可学习的向量表示编码多步推理知识，在多种基准测试中优于现有方法，并揭示了LLMs中多步推理的功能组织机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的CoT实现（如上下文学习和微调）成本高且效率低，需要一种更经济有效的方法来提升大语言模型的推理能力。

Method: 引入CoT Vectors作为紧凑的推理知识表示，先提取CoT向量观察到层间不稳定性，然后提出可学习的CoT向量，在师生框架下优化以提供更稳定的指导。

Result: 在多种基准测试和模型上的广泛评估表明，CoT Vectors不仅优于现有基线，而且性能可与参数高效微调方法相媲美，同时需要更少的可训练参数。

Conclusion: CoT Vectors作为一种探针，揭示了其有效性受潜在空间结构、信息密度、获取机制和预训练差异的影响，为理解LLMs中多步推理的功能组织提供了新见解。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has emerged as a powerful approach to
enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However,
existing implementations, such as in-context learning and fine-tuning, remain
costly and inefficient. To improve CoT reasoning at a lower cost, and inspired
by the task vector paradigm, we introduce CoT Vectors, compact representations
that encode task-general, multi-step reasoning knowledge. Through experiments
with Extracted CoT Vectors, we observe pronounced layer-wise instability,
manifesting as a U-shaped performance curve that reflects a systematic
three-stage reasoning process in LLMs. To address this limitation, we propose
Learnable CoT Vectors, optimized under a teacher-student framework to provide
more stable and robust guidance. Extensive evaluations across diverse
benchmarks and models demonstrate that CoT Vectors not only outperform existing
baselines but also achieve performance comparable to parameter-efficient
fine-tuning methods, while requiring fewer trainable parameters. Moreover, by
treating CoT Vectors as a probe, we uncover how their effectiveness varies due
to latent space structure, information density, acquisition mechanisms, and
pre-training differences, offering new insights into the functional
organization of multi-step reasoning in LLMs. The source code will be released.

Conclusion: 不仅推进了语言分割研究，还为代码切换语音技术建立了基础框架。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a neural spoken language diarization model that
supports an unconstrained span of languages within a single framework. Our
approach integrates a learnable query-based architecture grounded in
multilingual awareness, with large-scale pretraining on simulated
code-switching data. By jointly leveraging these two components, our method
overcomes the limitations of conventional approaches in data scarcity and
architecture optimization, and generalizes effectively to real-world
multilingual settings across diverse environments. Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on several
language diarization benchmarks, with a relative performance improvement of 23%
to 52% over previous methods. We believe that this work not only advances
research in language diarization but also establishes a foundational framework
for code-switching speech technologies.

Motivation: Tenyidie是一种低资源的藏缅语系语言，目前尚无音节化相关研究。音节化是NLP中的重要任务，对形态分析、词性标注、机器翻译等应用至关重要。

Method: 创建了10,120个音节化词汇数据集，应用LSTM、BLSTM、BLSTM+CRF和编码器-解码器四种深度学习架构进行音节化任务，数据集按80:10:10划分训练集、验证集和测试集。

Result: 在测试集上，BLSTM模型取得了99.21%的最高准确率，表明深度学习模型在Tenyidie语言音节化任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: 这项工作为Tenyidie语言的NLP研究提供了重要资源，所开发的音节化技术将为该语言的形态分析、词性标注、机器翻译等应用奠定基础。

Abstract: The Tenyidie language is a low-resource language of the Tibeto-Burman family
spoken by the Tenyimia Community of Nagaland in the north-eastern part of India
and is considered a major language in Nagaland. It is tonal,
Subject-Object-Verb, and highly agglutinative in nature. Being a low-resource
language, very limited research on Natural Language Processing (NLP) has been
conducted. To the best of our knowledge, no work on syllabification has been
reported for this language. Among the many NLP tasks, syllabification or
syllabication is an important task in which the given word syllables are
identified. The contribution of this work is the creation of 10,120 syllabified
Tenyidie words and the application of the Deep Learning techniques on the
created corpus. In this paper, we have applied LSTM, BLSTM, BLSTM+CRF, and
Encoder-decoder deep learning architectures on our created dataset. In our
dataset split of 80:10:10 (train:validation:test) set, we achieved the highest
accuracy of 99.21% with BLSTM model on the test set. This work will find its
application in numerous other NLP applications, such as morphological analysis,
part-of-speech tagging, machine translation, etc, for the Tenyidie Language.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了MCM-DPO方法，通过多维度偏好优化改进替代文本生成，无需精确标注，在嘈杂的用户标注数据上表现优于DPO和SFT方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 替代文本生成任务存在用户标注噪声、标准不一致以及多模态大语言模型对上下文信息不敏感等问题，传统监督微调方法依赖准确的目标标注，但在用户生成的替代文本中这些标注往往存在缺陷

Method: 提出多维度跨模态直接偏好优化(MCM-DPO)，在单维度、配对维度和多偏好维度上优化偏好，涵盖文本、视觉和跨模态因素，无需精确标注即可识别偏好对中的更好选项

Result: 实验结果表明MCM-DPO方法在替代文本生成任务上持续优于DPO和SFT方法，建立了新的最先进水平

Conclusion: MCM-DPO方法有效解决了替代文本生成中的标注质量问题，构建的两个大规模高质量数据集TAlt和PAlt为后续研究提供了支持

Abstract: The alt-text generation task produces concise, context-relevant descriptions
of images, enabling blind and low-vision users to access online images. Despite
the capabilities of large vision-language models, alt-text generation
performance remains limited due to noisy user annotations, inconsistent
standards, and MLLMs' insensitivity to contextual information. Previous efforts
to fine-tune MLLMs using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) have struggled, as SFT
relies on accurate target annotations, which are often flawed in user-generated
alt-text. To address this, we propose Multi-faceted Cross-modal Direct
Preference Optimization (MCM-DPO), which improves alt-text generation by
learning to identify better options in preference pairs without requiring
precise annotations. MCM-DPO optimizes preferences across single, paired, and
multi-preference dimensions, covering textual, visual, and cross-modal factors.
In light of the scarcity of high-quality annotated and preference-labeled
datasets for alt-text, we constructed two large-scale, high-quality datasets
named TAlt and PAlt, sourced from Twitter and Pinterest. These datasets include
202k annotated alt-text samples and 18k preference pairs that cover diverse
preference dimensions, aiming to support further research in this domain.
Experimental results show that our proposed MCM-DPO method consistently
outperforms both DPO and SFT, establishing a new state of the art in alt-text
generation. We release the code and data here:

TL;DR: 本文研究了使用大型语言模型自动化生成易读文本的方法，通过多任务学习结合文本摘要、文本简化和ETR生成，提出了基于检索增强生成和多任务LoRA的两种策略，在Mistral-7B和LLaMA-3-8B模型上验证了多任务方法的优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 简化复杂文本对于确保信息公平获取至关重要，特别是对认知障碍人群。手动创建易读文本耗时且资源密集，因此需要自动化解决方案。

Method: 提出多任务学习方法，联合训练文本摘要、文本简化和ETR生成任务。探索了两种策略：基于检索增强生成的多任务RAG用于上下文学习，以及参数高效微调的MTL-LoRA方法。

Result: 在基于新构建的高质量数据集ETR-fr的实验表明，多任务设置在所有配置下都优于单任务基线。RAG策略在跨域设置中表现出泛化能力，而MTL-LoRA在域内配置中优于所有学习策略。

Conclusion: 多任务学习方法是自动化生成易读文本的有效途径，不同策略在不同场景下各有优势，为神经多样性人群的信息获取提供了可行的技术解决方案。

Abstract: Simplifying complex texts is essential for ensuring equitable access to
information, especially for individuals with cognitive impairments. The
Easy-to-Read (ETR) initiative offers a framework for making content accessible
to the neurodivergent population, but the manual creation of such texts remains
time-consuming and resource-intensive. In this work, we investigate the
potential of large language models (LLMs) to automate the generation of ETR
content. To address the scarcity of aligned corpora and the specificity of ETR
constraints, we propose a multi-task learning (MTL) approach that trains models
jointly on text summarization, text simplification, and ETR generation. We
explore two different strategies: multi-task retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) for in-context learning, and MTL-LoRA for parameter-efficient
fine-tuning. Our experiments with Mistral-7B and LLaMA-3-8B, based on ETR-fr, a
new high-quality dataset, demonstrate the benefits of multi-task setups over
single-task baselines across all configurations. Moreover, results show that
the RAG-based strategy enables generalization in out-of-domain settings, while
MTL-LoRA outperforms all learning strategies within in-domain configurations.

Conclusion: PLMs在易读文本生成任务中表现与LLMs相当，且具有良好的领域适应能力，为可扩展的易读文本生成提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Ensuring accessibility for individuals with cognitive impairments is
essential for autonomy, self-determination, and full citizenship. However,
manual Easy-to-Read (ETR) text adaptations are slow, costly, and difficult to
scale, limiting access to crucial information in healthcare, education, and
civic life. AI-driven ETR generation offers a scalable solution but faces key
challenges, including dataset scarcity, domain adaptation, and balancing
lightweight learning of Large Language Models (LLMs). In this paper, we
introduce ETR-fr, the first dataset for ETR text generation fully compliant
with European ETR guidelines. We implement parameter-efficient fine-tuning on
PLMs and LLMs to establish generative baselines. To ensure high-quality and
accessible outputs, we introduce an evaluation framework based on automatic
metrics supplemented by human assessments. The latter is conducted using a
36-question evaluation form that is aligned with the guidelines. Overall
results show that PLMs perform comparably to LLMs and adapt effectively to
out-of-domain texts.

TL;DR: ALARB是一个阿拉伯语法律推理数据集，包含13K+沙特商业法庭案例，用于评估大语言模型在阿拉伯法律领域的多步推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有阿拉伯语基准测试缺乏专门针对多步推理的数据集，特别是在开放式语境下，阿拉伯语LLMs在法律领域的推理能力评估不足。

Method: 构建包含案件事实、法庭推理、判决结果和引用条款的数据集，定义判决预测、推理链补全和相关法规识别等任务，并对代表性阿拉伯语LLMs进行基准测试。

Result: 使用ALARB对12B参数模型进行指令调优后，其在判决预测和阿拉伯语判决生成方面的性能显著提升，达到与GPT-4o相当的水平。

Conclusion: ALARB数据集有效提升了阿拉伯语LLMs在法律领域的推理能力，填补了阿拉伯语多步推理评估的空白。

Abstract: We introduce ALARB, a dataset and suite of tasks designed to evaluate the
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) within the Arabic legal
domain. While existing Arabic benchmarks cover some knowledge-intensive tasks
such as retrieval and understanding, substantial datasets focusing specifically
on multistep reasoning for Arabic LLMs, especially in open-ended contexts, are
lacking. The dataset comprises over 13K commercial court cases from Saudi
Arabia, with each case including the facts presented, the reasoning of the
court, the verdict, as well as the cited clauses extracted from the regulatory
documents. We define a set of challenging tasks leveraging this dataset and
reflecting the complexity of real-world legal reasoning, including verdict
prediction, completion of reasoning chains in multistep legal arguments, and
identification of relevant regulations based on case facts. We benchmark a
representative selection of current open and closed Arabic LLMs on these tasks
and demonstrate the dataset's utility for instruction tuning. Notably, we show
that instruction-tuning a modest 12B parameter model using ALARB significantly
enhances its performance in verdict prediction and Arabic verdict generation,
reaching a level comparable to that of GPT-4o.

TL;DR: 该研究探索如何将小型高效LLMs适配到法罗语（一种低资源的北日耳曼语言），通过从英语模型出发，在相关斯堪的纳维亚语言上继续预训练，然后对法罗语进行微调，比较了全参数微调和LoRA参数高效调优方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究法罗语这种低资源语言的LLM适配问题，因为缺乏现有的法罗语评估数据，需要构建新的基准测试。

Method: 从英语模型开始，在相关斯堪的纳维亚语言上继续预训练（单独或合并），然后对法罗语进行微调，比较全参数微调和LoRA方法，构建新的最小对基准测试并辅以人类评估。

Result: 相关语言的迁移至关重要，但最优源语言因任务而异：冰岛语提高语言准确性，丹麦语提升理解能力；LoRA和全参数微调的选择也取决于任务：LoRA改善语言可接受性，全参数微调产生更强的理解性能。

Conclusion: 低资源语言适配需要仔细选择源语言和微调方法，不同任务需要不同的策略组合。

Abstract: We investigate how to adapt small, efficient LLMs to Faroese, a low-resource
North Germanic language. Starting from English models, we continue pre-training
on related Scandinavian languages, either individually or combined via merging,
before fine-tuning on Faroese. We compare full fine-tuning with
parameter-efficient tuning using LoRA, evaluating their impact on both
linguistic accuracy and text comprehension. Due to the lack of existing Faroese
evaluation data, we construct two new minimal-pair benchmarks from adapted and
newly collected datasets and complement them with human evaluations by Faroese
linguists. Our results demonstrate that transfer from related languages is
crucial, though the optimal source language depends on the task: Icelandic
enhances linguistic accuracy, whereas Danish boosts comprehension. Similarly,
the choice between full fine-tuning and LoRA is task-dependent: LoRA improves
linguistic acceptability and slightly increases human evaluation scores on the
base model, while full fine-tuning yields stronger comprehension performance
and better preserves model capabilities during downstream fine-tuning.

TL;DR: 本文系统评估了检索增强LLM机器翻译(REAL-MT)在噪声检索环境下的鲁棒性，发现低资源语言对在噪声下性能严重下降，大推理模型(LRMs)反而更容易受噪声影响并合理化错误内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管REAL-MT在知识密集型任务如习语翻译中表现良好，但其在真实世界常见的噪声检索环境下的可靠性尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 提出了噪声合成框架和新指标来系统评估REAL-MT的鲁棒性，使用Qwen系列模型（包括标准LLM和增强推理能力的大推理模型）在不同资源水平的语言对上进行习语翻译测试。

Result: 低资源语言对在噪声下性能下降更严重，常产生无意义翻译；LRMs在错误纠正方面无改进，反而更容易受噪声影响，倾向于合理化错误上下文；注意力从源习语转移到噪声内容，置信度增加但准确性下降。

Conclusion: 当前方法存在局限性，揭示了在干净上下文性能和鲁棒性之间的基本权衡，强调了需要自验证集成机制的重要性。

Abstract: \textbf{RE}trieval-\textbf{A}ugmented \textbf{L}LM-based \textbf{M}achine
\textbf{T}ranslation (REAL-MT) shows promise for knowledge-intensive tasks like
idiomatic translation, but its reliability under noisy retrieval contexts
remains poorly understood despite this being a common challenge in real-world
deployment. To address this gap, we propose a noise synthesis framework and new
metrics to evaluate the robustness of REAL-MT systematically. Using this
framework, we instantiate REAL-MT with Qwen-series models, including standard
LLMs and large reasoning models (LRMs) with enhanced reasoning, and evaluate
their performance on idiomatic translation across high-, medium-, and
low-resource language pairs under synthesized noise. Our results show that
low-resource language pairs, which rely more heavily on retrieved context,
degrade more severely under noise than high-resource ones and often produce
nonsensical translations. Although LRMs possess enhanced reasoning
capabilities, they show no improvement in error correction and are even more
susceptible to noise, tending to rationalize incorrect contexts. We find that
this stems from an attention shift away from the source idiom to noisy content,
while confidence increases despite declining accuracy, indicating poor
calibration. To mitigate these issues, we investigate training-free and
fine-tuning strategies, which improve robustness at the cost of performance in
clean contexts, revealing a fundamental trade-off. Our findings highlight the
limitations of current approaches, underscoring the need for self-verifying
integration mechanisms.

Motivation: 现有安全基准主要关注防止生成有害内容，但忽略了当实现操作目标的最有效路径与人类安全冲突时，智能体可能采取有害行动的问题。

Method: 创建包含人类验证的管理场景基准，每个场景都要求在实用但有害的行动与安全但操作性能较差的行动之间做出选择，并设有平行控制组来测量模型的实用主义倾向。

Result: 前沿LLM在安全-实用权衡方面表现不佳：许多模型为推进操作目标而持续选择有害选项，而其他模型则因避免伤害而变得过于安全且无效。模型能够准确感知伤害，但存在优先级排序错误。

Conclusion: ManagerBench是评估智能体行为核心组成部分的具有挑战性的基准：当操作目标和对齐价值激励冲突行动时做出安全选择。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) evolve from conversational assistants into
autonomous agents, evaluating the safety of their actions becomes critical.
Prior safety benchmarks have primarily focused on preventing generation of
harmful content, such as toxic text. However, they overlook the challenge of
agents taking harmful actions when the most effective path to an operational
goal conflicts with human safety. To address this gap, we introduce
ManagerBench, a benchmark that evaluates LLM decision-making in realistic,
human-validated managerial scenarios. Each scenario forces a choice between a
pragmatic but harmful action that achieves an operational goal, and a safe
action that leads to worse operational performance. A parallel control set,
where potential harm is directed only at inanimate objects, measures a model's
pragmatism and identifies its tendency to be overly safe. Our findings indicate
that the frontier LLMs perform poorly when navigating this safety-pragmatism
trade-off. Many consistently choose harmful options to advance their
operational goals, while others avoid harm only to become overly safe and
ineffective. Critically, we find this misalignment does not stem from an
inability to perceive harm, as models' harm assessments align with human
judgments, but from flawed prioritization. ManagerBench is a challenging
benchmark for a core component of agentic behavior: making safe choices when
operational goals and alignment values incentivize conflicting actions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了可擦除强化学习(ERL)框架，通过识别、擦除和重新生成错误推理步骤，显著提升搜索增强大语言模型在多跳推理中的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 搜索增强大语言模型在复杂多跳推理中可靠性有限，主要面临分解错误、检索缺失和推理错误三大挑战，任一环节的失败都会导致最终答案错误。

Method: ERL框架明确识别错误推理步骤，擦除这些步骤并在原地重新生成推理，防止错误逻辑在推理链中传播。

Result: 使用ERL训练的ESearch模型在多个数据集上取得显著提升：3B模型EM提升8.48%，F1提升11.56%；7B模型EM提升5.38%，F1提升7.22%，超越之前SOTA结果。

Conclusion: 可擦除强化学习为大语言模型中的鲁棒多步推理提供了强大的范式转变。

Abstract: While search-augmented large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive
capabilities, their reliability in complex multi-hop reasoning remains limited.
This limitation arises from three fundamental challenges: decomposition errors,
where tasks are incorrectly broken down; retrieval missing, where key evidence
fails to be retrieved; and reasoning errors, where flawed logic propagates
through the reasoning chain. A single failure in any of these stages can derail
the final answer. We propose Erasable Reinforcement Learning (ERL), a novel
framework that transforms fragile reasoning into a robust process. ERL
explicitly identifies faulty steps, erases them, and regenerates reasoning in
place, preventing defective logic from propagating through the reasoning chain.
This targeted correction mechanism turns brittle reasoning into a more
resilient process. Models trained with ERL, termed ESearch, achieve substantial
improvements on HotpotQA, MuSiQue, 2Wiki, and Bamboogle, with the 3B model
achieving +8.48% EM and +11.56% F1, and the 7B model achieving +5.38% EM and
+7.22% F1 over previous state-of-the-art(SOTA) results. These findings suggest
that erasable reinforcement learning provides a powerful paradigm shift for
robust multi-step reasoning in LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HalluGuard是一个40亿参数的小型推理模型，专门用于缓解检索增强生成(RAG)中的幻觉问题，通过分类文档-声明对并提供证据支持的理由来实现透明化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在NLP任务中表现出色，但容易产生幻觉，限制了在实际应用中的可信度。

Method: 结合领域无关的合成数据集、合成的基础和幻觉声明，以及基于偏好的微调方法(Odds Ratio Preference Optimization)，将大模型推理能力蒸馏到小模型中。

Result: 在RAGTruth子集上达到84.0%的平衡准确率，与更大的专门模型性能相当；在整个基准测试中达到75.7%的平衡准确率，与GPT-4o相当。

Conclusion: HalluGuard以更小的参数量实现了与大型模型相当的幻觉检测性能，为解决LLM幻觉问题提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in many NLP tasks but remain prone to
hallucinations, limiting trust in real-world applications. We present
HalluGuard, a 4B-parameter Small Reasoning Model (SRM) for mitigating
hallucinations in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). HalluGuard classifies
document-claim pairs as grounded or hallucinated and produces evidence-grounded
justifications for transparency. Our approach combines (i) a domain-agnostic
synthetic dataset derived from FineWeb and refined through multi-stage curation
and data reformation, (ii) synthetic grounded and hallucinated claims, and
(iii) preference-based fine-tuning with Odds Ratio Preference Optimization to
distill large-model reasoning into a smaller backbone. On the RAGTruth subset
of the LLM-AggreFact benchmark, HalluGuard achieves 84.0% balanced accuracy
(BAcc), rivaling specialized models, MiniCheck (7B; 84.0%) and Granite Guardian
3.3 (8B; 82.2%) while using roughly half their parameters. Over the full
benchmark it reaches 75.7% BAcc, matching larger general-purpose LLMs such as
GPT-4o (75.9%). We will release HalluGuard and datasets under Apache 2.0 upon
acceptance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Sci-SpanDet是一个用于检测AI生成学术文本的结构感知框架，通过结合分段条件风格建模和多层次对比学习，实现了精确的跨度级检测和可靠的置信度校准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在科学写作中的快速应用引发了关于作者身份完整性和学术出版物可靠性的严重担忧，现有检测方法缺乏细粒度的跨度定位能力，校准能力弱，且难以跨学科和生成器泛化。

Method: 结合分段条件风格建模与多层次对比学习，集成BIO-CRF序列标注与基于指针的边界解码和置信度校准，实现精确的跨度级检测。

Result: 在包含10万个标注样本的跨学科数据集上，Sci-SpanDet实现了最先进的性能：F1(AI)为80.17，AUROC为92.63，Span-F1为74.36，在对抗性重写下表现出强韧性，并在IMRaD章节和不同学科间保持平衡的准确性。

Conclusion: Sci-SpanDet显著超越了现有基线方法，为学术文档中AI生成文本检测提供了有效的解决方案，并将公开发布数据集和源代码以促进进一步研究。

Abstract: The rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) in scientific writing
raises serious concerns regarding authorship integrity and the reliability of
scholarly publications. Existing detection approaches mainly rely on
document-level classification or surface-level statistical cues; however, they
neglect fine-grained span localization, exhibit weak calibration, and often
fail to generalize across disciplines and generators. To address these
limitations, we present Sci-SpanDet, a structure-aware framework for detecting
AI-generated scholarly texts. The proposed method combines section-conditioned
stylistic modeling with multi-level contrastive learning to capture nuanced
human-AI differences while mitigating topic dependence, thereby enhancing
cross-domain robustness. In addition, it integrates BIO-CRF sequence labeling
with pointer-based boundary decoding and confidence calibration to enable
precise span-level detection and reliable probability estimates. Extensive
experiments on a newly constructed cross-disciplinary dataset of 100,000
annotated samples generated by multiple LLM families (GPT, Qwen, DeepSeek,
LLaMA) demonstrate that Sci-SpanDet achieves state-of-the-art performance, with
F1(AI) of 80.17, AUROC of 92.63, and Span-F1 of 74.36. Furthermore, it shows
strong resilience under adversarial rewriting and maintains balanced accuracy
across IMRaD sections and diverse disciplines, substantially surpassing
existing baselines. To ensure reproducibility and to foster further research on
AI-generated text detection in scholarly documents, the curated dataset and
source code will be publicly released upon publication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索RAG在专家级物理推理（如解决奥林匹克物理问题）中的潜力，受学生通过复习过往问题准备竞赛的启发。

Method: 引入PhoPile多模态数据集，包含图表、图形和方程，系统研究基于检索的推理。使用该数据集对RAG增强的基础模型进行基准测试，涵盖LLM和LMM模型及多种检索器。

Result: 结果表明，将检索与物理语料库集成可以提高模型性能，但也突显了在检索增强物理推理方面需要进一步研究的挑战。

Conclusion: RAG在增强基础模型的物理推理能力方面具有潜力，但需要更多研究来解决现有挑战。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with foundation models has achieved
strong performance across diverse tasks, but their capacity for expert-level
reasoning-such as solving Olympiad-level physics problems-remains largely
unexplored. Inspired by the way students prepare for competitions by reviewing
past problems, we investigate the potential of RAG to enhance physics reasoning
in foundation models. We introduce PhoPile, a high-quality multimodal dataset
specifically designed for Olympiad-level physics, enabling systematic study of
retrieval-based reasoning. PhoPile includes diagrams, graphs, and equations,
capturing the inherently multimodal nature of physics problem solving. Using
PhoPile, we benchmark RAG-augmented foundation models, covering both large
language models (LLMs) and large multimodal models (LMMs) with multiple
retrievers. Our results demonstrate that integrating retrieval with physics
corpora can improve model performance, while also highlighting challenges that
motivate further research in retrieval-augmented physics reasoning.

TL;DR: 提出Fusion-of-N方法，使用LLM法官将多个样本中最具信息量的元素融合成单一最终答案，相比传统的Best-of-N方法在测试时扩展和合成数据生成中表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Best-of-N方法本质上是零和的，会丢弃多样化和潜在有用的信息。探索协作设置，让所有候选都能为最终生成做出贡献。

Method: Fusion-of-N方法：使用通用LLM法官来合成每个样本中最具信息量的元素，形成单一最终答案。在测试时扩展和合成数据生成两种设置中进行比较。

Result: 在11种语言、3个多样化任务和不同模型规模上广泛测试，Fusion-of-N始终优于Best-of-N，在测试时扩展和合成数据生成的下游收益中表现出多功能性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 应该改变对LLM生成的评估和利用方式，从单一质量度量转向接受其多元性质，整合多样优势，解锁潜在能力，实现仅通过选择无法获得的改进。

Abstract: Obtaining high-quality generations in modern LLMs has largely been framed as
a selection problem: identifying a single winning generation from a diverse
pool of N samples, the Best-of-N (BoN). Yet, this approach is inherently
zero-sum, discarding diverse and potentially useful information from the pool.
Instead, we explore a collaborative setup, where all candidates can potentially
contribute to the final winning generation. To this end, we propose Fusion-of-N
(FusioN): a method that uses a general LLM judge to synthesize the most
informative elements of each sample into a single final answer. We compare
FusioN to BoN in two settings, (i) test-time scaling, where we sample and
aggregate from a single model at test-time (ii) synthetic data generation,
where we fuse samples from a pool of diverse teachers to improve a student
model. We extensively benchmark both setups across 11 languages, 3 diverse
tasks and varying model scales. Across the bench, FusioN consistently
outperforms BoN showing versatility and robustness both in test-time scaling
and in downstream gains from synthetic data generation. We also perform
extensive analysis on FusioN, where it shows surprising strengths and
robustness under challenging settings. These results show that we should shift
how we think about evaluating and utilizing LLM generations from a monolithic
measure of quality, to embracing their polylithic nature. This shift allows us
to integrate diverse strengths, unlock latent potential, and achieve
improvements that were previously inaccessible through selection alone.

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型在处理非标准英语方言时性能下降，某些特定语法规则（如存在性it、零系词和y'all）是导致性能下降的主要原因。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分析大型语言模型在处理非标准英语方言时的性能差异，特别是识别导致性能下降的具体语法规则。

Method: 通过将标准美式英语问题转换为非标准方言变体，在多选题回答任务上测试LLM性能，并分析不同语法规则的影响。

Result: 非标准英语方言问题导致准确率下降高达20%，其中三个特定语法规则（存在性it、零系词和y'all）解释了多数性能下降。

Conclusion: 建议未来研究关注针对个别高影响语法结构的偏见缓解方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are ubiquitous in modern day natural language
processing. However, previous work has shown degraded LLM performance for
under-represented English dialects. We analyze the effects of typifying
"standard" American English language questions as non-"standard" dialectal
variants on multiple choice question answering tasks and find up to a 20%
reduction in accuracy. Additionally, we investigate the grammatical basis of
under-performance in non-"standard" English questions. We find that individual
grammatical rules have varied effects on performance, but some are more
consequential than others: three specific grammar rules (existential "it", zero
copula, and y'all) can explain the majority of performance degradation observed
in multiple dialects. We call for future work to investigate bias mitigation
methods focused on individual, high-impact grammatical structures.

TL;DR: 提出了一种语法引导的扩散语言模型，通过整合结构监督和个性化条件来提升文本质量、多样性和可控性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型生成的文本往往过于通用，结构多样性不足，限制了个性化表达。扩散模型为超越自回归范式限制提供了新机会。

Method: 采用级联框架先生成语法指导再进行条件文本生成，并推广到非级联架构以改善结构与内容的对齐。通过共享表示机制实现细粒度个性化。

Result: 在多个任务上的广泛实验表明，该方法在流畅性、多样性和风格保真度方面具有优越性。定性分析突显了其在学习个性化模式方面的可解释性和灵活性。

Conclusion: 通过将语法信息整合到生成过程中，所提出的模型能更好地捕捉风格化句子构建的词汇和结构特征，支持忠实的风格生成和可泛化的零样本推理。

Abstract: Large language models have made revolutionary progress in generating
human-like text, yet their outputs often tend to be generic, exhibiting
insufficient structural diversity, which limits personalized expression. Recent
advances in diffusion models have opened new opportunities for improving
language generation beyond the limitations of autoregressive paradigms. In this
work, we propose a syntax-guided diffusion language model that integrates
structural supervision and personalized conditioning to enhance text quality,
diversity, and controllability. We introduce a cascaded framework that
generates syntactic guidance before conditional text generation, and further
generalize it to a novel noncascaded architecture for better alignment between
structure and content. By incorporating syntactic information in the generating
process, the proposed model better captures the lexical and structural
characteristics of stylistic sentence construction. To enable fine-grained
personalization, we develop a shared representation mechanism that facilitates
information integration across users, supporting both faithful stylistic
generation and generalizable zero-shot inference. Extensive experiments on
multiple tasks demonstrate the superiority of our approach in fluency,
diversity, and stylistic fidelity. Further qualitative analyses highlight its
interpretability and flexibility in learning personalized patterns.

Motivation: 理解神经网络决策过程是机制可解释性的核心目标，需要揭示模型组件（如神经元、注意力头）和抽象表示（如稀疏自编码器特征）的作用机制。

Method: 使用强大的生成模型为模型组件和抽象生成开放词汇的自然语言概念描述，并系统梳理了相关方法、评估指标和数据集。

Conclusion: 通过概述最新进展和识别关键挑战，本综述为未来研究提供了路线图，旨在使模型更加透明。

Abstract: Understanding the decision-making processes of neural networks is a central
goal of mechanistic interpretability. In the context of Large Language Models
(LLMs), this involves uncovering the underlying mechanisms and identifying the
roles of individual model components such as neurons and attention heads, as
well as model abstractions such as the learned sparse features extracted by
Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs). A rapidly growing line of work tackles this
challenge by using powerful generator models to produce open-vocabulary,
natural language concept descriptions for these components. In this paper, we
provide the first survey of the emerging field of concept descriptions for
model components and abstractions. We chart the key methods for generating
these descriptions, the evolving landscape of automated and human metrics for
evaluating them, and the datasets that underpin this research. Our synthesis
reveals a growing demand for more rigorous, causal evaluation. By outlining the
state of the art and identifying key challenges, this survey provides a roadmap
for future research toward making models more transparent.

Motivation: 传统基于规则的DST方法在开放域和多轮聊天机器人中效率不足，无法提供复杂对话中类似人类的适应性和连贯性体验。

Method: 使用BERT进行槽位填充和意图检测，XGBoost进行意图验证，GPT进行对话状态跟踪，在线代理进行实时答案生成。

Result: 在波斯语多轮对话数据集上，该模型相比现有方法显著提高了准确性和连贯性。

Conclusion: 混合方法能有效提升DST能力，为构建更定制化、适应性更强、更类似人类的对话AI系统铺平道路。

Abstract: Dialogue State Tracking (DST) is an essential element of conversational AI
with the objective of deeply understanding the conversation context and leading
it toward answering user requests. Due to high demands for open-domain and
multi-turn chatbots, the traditional rule-based DST is not efficient enough,
since it cannot provide the required adaptability and coherence for human-like
experiences in complex conversations. This study proposes a hybrid DST model
that utilizes rule-based methods along with language models, including BERT for
slot filling and intent detection, XGBoost for intent validation, GPT for DST,
and online agents for real-time answer generation. This model is uniquely
designed to be evaluated on a comprehensive Persian multi-turn dialogue dataset
and demonstrated significantly improved accuracy and coherence over existing
methods in Persian-based chatbots. The results demonstrate how effectively a
hybrid approach may improve DST capabilities, paving the way for conversational
AI systems that are more customized, adaptable, and human-like.

TL;DR: 这篇系统文献综述分析了非洲低资源语言自动语音识别(ASR)的研究现状，发现虽然自监督学习和迁移学习有前景，但面临数据集稀缺、方言覆盖不足、资源有限等挑战，建议通过社区驱动、伦理数据集创建和轻量建模来改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管ASR技术在全球取得显著进展，但非洲2000多种低资源语言在数字包容方面仍严重不足，需要系统评估当前研究状况以推动发展。

Method: 采用PRISMA 2020程序，检索DBLP、ACM Digital Library等数据库2020-2025年的研究，筛选71篇文献，分析74个数据集覆盖111种语言约11,206小时语音数据。

Result: 发现少于15%的研究提供可复现材料，数据集许可不清晰；WER是主要评估指标，但CER、DER等语言学指标使用极少；自监督学习受限于预训练数据不足和方言覆盖问题。

Conclusion: ASR系统证据不一致，受数据集可用性、标注质量、许可不确定性等限制，但社区驱动和方法进步提供了改进路径，建议通过利益相关者合作、伦理数据集、轻量建模和基准测试实现可持续发展。

Abstract: ASR has achieved remarkable global progress, yet African low-resource
languages remain rigorously underrepresented, producing barriers to digital
inclusion across the continent with more than +2000 languages. This systematic
literature review (SLR) explores research on ASR for African languages with a
focus on datasets, models and training methods, evaluation techniques,
challenges, and recommends future directions. We employ the PRISMA 2020
procedures and search DBLP, ACM Digital Library, Google Scholar, Semantic
Scholar, and arXiv for studies published between January 2020 and July 2025. We
include studies related to ASR datasets, models or metrics for African
languages, while excluding non-African, duplicates, and low-quality studies
(score <3/5). We screen 71 out of 2,062 records and we record a total of 74
datasets across 111 languages, encompassing approximately 11,206 hours of
speech. Fewer than 15% of research provided reproducible materials, and dataset
licensing is not clear. Self-supervised and transfer learning techniques are
promising, but are hindered by limited pre-training data, inadequate coverage
of dialects, and the availability of resources. Most of the researchers use
Word Error Rate (WER), with very minimal use of linguistically informed scores
such as Character Error Rate (CER) or Diacritic Error Rate (DER), and thus with
limited application in tonal and morphologically rich languages. The existing
evidence on ASR systems is inconsistent, hindered by issues like dataset
availability, poor annotations, licensing uncertainties, and limited
benchmarking. Nevertheless, the rise of community-driven initiatives and
methodological advancements indicates a pathway for improvement. Sustainable
development for this area will also include stakeholder partnership, creation
of ethically well-balanced datasets, use of lightweight modelling techniques,
and active benchmarking.

Abstract: Evaluation using Large Language Model (LLM) judges has been widely adopted in
English and shown to be effective for automatic evaluation. However, their
performance does not generalize well to non-English settings, and it remains
unclear what constitutes effective multilingual training for such judges. In
this paper, we introduce mR3, a massively multilingual, rubric-agnostic reward
reasoning model trained on 72 languages, achieving the broadest language
coverage in reward modeling to date. We present a comprehensive study of data
and curriculum selection for training to identify effective strategies and data
sources for building high-quality reward models, including the integration of
target-language reasoning datasets. Our approach attains state-of-the-art
performance on multilingual reward model benchmarks, surpassing much larger
models (i.e., GPT-OSS-120B) while being up to 9x smaller, and its effectiveness
is further confirmed through extensive ablation studies. Our models, data, and

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MASH是一个训练框架，通过强化学习让LLM学会在超出知识边界时寻求外部帮助（搜索工具），从而间接实现弃权能力，无需预先定义知识边界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM无法可靠识别自身知识边界，经常对超出边界的问题产生幻觉回答，而人类知道自己的局限性并会寻求帮助或弃权。

Method: 使用强化学习框架，通过按次搜索付费的奖励机制，惩罚外部搜索行为同时奖励回答准确性，让LLM学会选择性寻求帮助。

Result: 在三个知识密集型QA数据集上，MASH显著提升了选择性寻求帮助的性能，在多跳数据集上答案准确率提高7.6%，并能有效区分可回答/不可回答问题。

Conclusion: MASH训练有效对齐了搜索工具使用与参数化知识，可以成功用于做出弃权决策，且无需预先确定知识边界来构建训练数据。

Abstract: LLMs cannot reliably recognize their parametric knowledge boundaries and
often hallucinate answers to outside-of-boundary questions. In contrast, humans
recognize their limitations and can either seek external help for such
questions or abstain. In this paper, we introduce MASH (Modeling Abstention via
Selective Help-seeking), a training framework that readily extracts abstentions
from LLMs. Our key idea is that any external help-seeking by an LLM, i.e.
search tool use, can serve as a proxy for abstention if the external help
(search) is appropriately penalized while simultaneously rewarding answer
accuracy. MASH operationalizes this idea using reinforcement learning with a
pay-per-search reward.
  We run experiments on three knowledge-intensive QA datasets. Our results show
that MASH substantially improves upon the selective help-seeking performance of
prior efficient search approaches; on multi-hop datasets, MASH improves answer
accuracy by 7.6%. Furthermore, MASH demonstrates strong off-the-shelf
abstention -- it can distinguish between unanswerable/answerable questions and
selectively generate responses for answerable questions -- showcasing behavior
analogous to specialized abstention approaches. We emphasize that contrary to
prior abstention methods, MASH does not require pre-determining knowledge
boundaries to construct training data. Instead, MASH's abstentions are a
by-product of training for the auxiliary selective help-seeking task. Overall,
we show that MASH training effectively aligns search tool use with parametric
knowledge, which can be successfully leveraged for making abstention decisions.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型和多模态扩展的普及，级联领域特定编码器与LLM的方法使模型继承了所有组件的漏洞，需要研究音频后门攻击及其防御。

Method: 使用四种语音编码器和三个数据集，覆盖四种任务进行音频后门攻击实验，并进行组件级分析识别最脆弱的管道阶段。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and their multimodal extensions are becoming
increasingly popular. One common approach to enable multimodality is to cascade
domain-specific encoders with an LLM, making the resulting model inherit
vulnerabilities from all of its components. In this work, we present the first
systematic study of audio backdoor attacks against speech language models. We
demonstrate its effectiveness across four speech encoders and three datasets,
covering four tasks: automatic speech recognition (ASR), speech emotion
recognition, and gender and age prediction. The attack consistently achieves
high success rates, ranging from 90.76% to 99.41%. To better understand how
backdoors propagate, we conduct a component-wise analysis to identify the most
vulnerable stages of the pipeline. Finally, we propose a fine-tuning-based
defense that mitigates the threat of poisoned pretrained encoders.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了Social Welfare Function Benchmark，用于评估LLMs在社会资源分配中的表现，发现大多数模型偏向功利主义，且分配策略易受干扰。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs被用于高风险决策，需要评估它们在分配稀缺社会资源时的原则和价值观。

Method: 引入SWF Benchmark动态模拟环境，让LLM作为分配者向异质社区分配任务，在集体效率和分配公平性之间创建权衡。

Result: 评估20个先进LLMs发现：模型对话能力与分配技能无关；大多数模型偏向功利主义；分配策略易受输出长度限制和社会影响框架干扰。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs作为社会决策者存在风险，需要专门的基准测试和针对性对齐来改进AI治理。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly entrusted with high-stakes
decisions that affect human welfare. However, the principles and values that
guide these models when distributing scarce societal resources remain largely
unexamined. To address this, we introduce the Social Welfare Function (SWF)
Benchmark, a dynamic simulation environment where an LLM acts as a sovereign
allocator, distributing tasks to a heterogeneous community of recipients. The
benchmark is designed to create a persistent trade-off between maximizing
collective efficiency (measured by Return on Investment) and ensuring
distributive fairness (measured by the Gini coefficient). We evaluate 20
state-of-the-art LLMs and present the first leaderboard for social welfare
allocation. Our findings reveal three key insights: (i) A model's general
conversational ability, as measured by popular leaderboards, is a poor
predictor of its allocation skill. (ii) Most LLMs exhibit a strong default
utilitarian orientation, prioritizing group productivity at the expense of
severe inequality. (iii) Allocation strategies are highly vulnerable, easily
perturbed by output-length constraints and social-influence framing. These
results highlight the risks of deploying current LLMs as societal
decision-makers and underscore the need for specialized benchmarks and targeted
alignment for AI governance.

*Oussama Gabouj,Kamel Charaf,Ivan Zakazov,Nicolas Baldwin,Robert West*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了GRAD方法，通过训练LLM生成针对特定输入的简洁演示，在预算限制下优于传统RAG方法，并在数学推理和STEM问题上表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG方法依赖静态数据库，缺乏适应性且可能提供不相关的演示，限制了LLM在多样化任务中的表现。

Method: 训练LLM模型生成输入特定的简洁演示，为每个输入提供定制化的上下文支持，形成动态的基于演示的方法。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-14B上，GRAD在数学推理和高级STEM问题上持续优于强基线，并展现出对物理、化学、计算机科学等OOD领域的强大泛化能力。

Conclusion: GRAD引入了可扩展的演示生成器模型，为资源受限环境中的动态少样本学习范式迈出了第一步，同时较小模型生成的演示也能有效指导较大目标模型。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve strong performance across diverse tasks,
but their effectiveness often depends on the quality of the provided context.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enriches prompts with external
information, but its reliance on static databases constrains adaptability and
can result in irrelevant demonstrations. In this work, we propose a Generative
Retrieval-Aligned Demonstrator (GRAD), a dynamic demonstration-based approach
where an LLM model is trained to generate input-specific concise
demonstrations. By tailoring demonstrations to each input, our method offers
better contextual support than traditional RAG approaches. We demonstrate the
superiority of GRAD under budget constraints, where we limit both the number of
tokens used per demonstration and the number of tokens used for the final
output. Trained solely on a math dataset, GRAD consistently outperforms strong
baselines on Qwen2.5-14B across mathematical reasoning and advanced STEM
questions, highlighting GRAD's robust generalization to out-of-distribution
(OOD) domains such as physics, chemistry, and computer science. Furthermore, we
show that demonstrations generated by trained smaller models can effectively
guide larger target models, reducing training costs while maintaining
competitive accuracy. Overall, this work introduces a scalable demonstration
generator model presenting the first step toward a dynamic few-shot learning
paradigm in resource-constrained settings. We release the code used for the
project.

*Jiayi Zhang,Simon Yu,Derek Chong,Anthony Sicilia,Michael R. Tomz,Christopher D. Manning,Weiyan Shi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文发现后训练对齐导致LLM多样性下降（模式崩溃）的根本原因是偏好数据中的典型性偏见，并提出了一种无需训练的提示策略——言语化采样，能显著提升生成多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 后训练对齐经常减少LLM的多样性，导致模式崩溃现象。与之前将这种现象归因于算法限制的研究不同，本文识别出一个根本性的、普遍存在的数据层面驱动因素：偏好数据中的典型性偏见。

Method: 提出了言语化采样（Verbalized Sampling），这是一种简单、无需训练的提示策略。该方法提示模型对一组响应进行概率分布的言语化表达（例如“生成5个关于咖啡的笑话及其对应概率”）。

Result: 综合实验表明，VS在创意写作（诗歌、故事、笑话）、对话模拟、开放式问答和合成数据生成方面显著提高了性能，同时不牺牲事实准确性和安全性。在创意写作中，VS将多样性提高了1.6-2.1倍。

Conclusion: 本文为模式崩溃提供了新的数据中心视角，并提供了一种实用的推理时补救措施，有助于释放预训练生成模型的多样性。

Abstract: Post-training alignment often reduces LLM diversity, leading to a phenomenon
known as mode collapse. Unlike prior work that attributes this effect to
algorithmic limitations, we identify a fundamental, pervasive data-level
driver: typicality bias in preference data, whereby annotators systematically
favor familiar text as a result of well-established findings in cognitive
psychology. We formalize this bias theoretically, verify it on preference
datasets empirically, and show that it plays a central role in mode collapse.
Motivated by this analysis, we introduce Verbalized Sampling, a simple,
training-free prompting strategy to circumvent mode collapse. VS prompts the
model to verbalize a probability distribution over a set of responses (e.g.,
``Generate 5 jokes about coffee and their corresponding probabilities'').
Comprehensive experiments show that VS significantly improves performance
across creative writing (poems, stories, jokes), dialogue simulation,
open-ended QA, and synthetic data generation, without sacrificing factual
accuracy and safety. For instance, in creative writing, VS increases diversity
by 1.6-2.1x over direct prompting. We further observe an emergent trend that
more capable models benefit more from VS. In sum, our work provides a new
data-centric perspective on mode collapse and a practical inference-time remedy
that helps unlock pre-trained generative diversity.

### [154] [Energy-Regularized Sequential Model Editing on Hyperspheres](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01172)
*Qingyuan Liu,Jia-Chen Gu,Yunzhi Yao,Hong Wang,Nanyun Peng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出SPHERE方法，通过保持神经元权重在超球面上的均匀分布来稳定模型编辑过程，防止灾难性遗忘，同时可靠地更新知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型需要持续更新以保持与现实世界知识同步，但顺序编辑往往会导致表示不稳定和灾难性遗忘。本文旨在理解和缓解顺序编辑引起的性能下降。

Method: 使用超球面能量(HE)量化编辑过程中的神经元均匀性，提出SPHERE方法——一种HE驱动的正则化策略，通过将新知识投影到与预训练权重矩阵主超球面方向互补的稀疏空间中来稳定神经元权重分布。

Result: 在LLaMA3(8B)和Qwen2.5(7B)上的广泛实验表明，SPHERE在编辑能力上平均优于最佳基线16.41%，同时最忠实地保留了一般模型性能。

Conclusion: SPHERE为可靠的大规模知识编辑提供了一条原则性路径，通过稳定超球面能量来保持先验知识，同时实现可靠的顺序更新。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) require constant updates to remain aligned with
evolving real-world knowledge. Model editing offers a lightweight alternative
to retraining, but sequential editing often destabilizes representations and
induces catastrophic forgetting. In this work, we seek to better understand and
mitigate performance degradation caused by sequential editing. We hypothesize
that hyperspherical uniformity, a property that maintains uniform distribution
of neuron weights on a hypersphere, helps the model remain stable, retain prior
knowledge, while still accommodate new updates. We use Hyperspherical Energy
(HE) to quantify neuron uniformity during editing, and examine its correlation
with editing performance. Empirical studies across widely used editing methods
reveals a strong correlation between HE dynamics and editing performance, with
editing failures consistently coinciding with high HE fluctuations. We further
theoretically prove that HE dynamics impose a lower bound on the degradation of
pretrained knowledge, highlighting why HE stability is crucial for knowledge
retention. Motivated by these insights, we propose SPHERE (Sparse Projection
for Hyperspherical Energy-Regularized Editing), an HE-driven regularization
strategy that stabilizes neuron weight distributions, ultimately preserving
prior knowledge while enabling reliable sequential updates. Specifically,
SPHERE identifies a sparse space complementary to the principal hyperspherical
directions of the pretrained weight matrices and projects new knowledge onto
it, attenuating perturbations on the principal directions. Extensive
experiments on LLaMA3 (8B) and Qwen2.5 (7B) show that SPHERE outperforms the
best baseline in editing capability by an average of 16.41%, while most
faithfully preserving general model performance, thereby offering a principled
path toward reliable large-scale knowledge editing.

Abstract: Effective tool use is essential for agentic AI, yet training agents to
utilize tools remains challenging due to manually designed rewards, limited
training data, and poor multi-tool selection, resulting in slow adaptation,
wasted computational resources, and suboptimal performance. We introduce
ToolBrain, a lightweight and user-friendly framework for coaching tool use in
agentic models with flexible reinforcement learning (RL), easing the barriers
for researchers and practitioners to adapt LLM-based agents to specific
domains. It supports a wide range of training strategies, including RL
algorithms such as GRPO and DPO, as well as supervised learning. ToolBrain
enables custom reward callables directly on an agent's execution traces or
simply utilizes an automated LLM-as-a-judge system for reward generation. It is
packed with useful capabilities, including knowledge distillation from large to
small models for efficient development, automatic task generation from tool
descriptions, seamless tool retrieval, efficient fine-tuning pipelines with
QLoRA through Unsloth, and quantized inference via bitsandbytes. We demonstrate
ToolBrain through diverse use cases, such as training a CodeAct agent to
autonomously execute email search tasks, showing fast, targeted improvements
(up to 30.0%) in tool-use skills while keeping the codebase simple and
extensible in Agentic AI. Our framework is publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理语言模型在复杂推理任务中表现出色，但存在计算效率低下的问题，现有方法难以平衡推理质量与推理成本。

Method: ARS采用训练免费方法，通过多检查点确定性估计机制和渐进抑制阈值，动态抑制冗余推理步骤。

Result: 在数学推理基准测试中，ARS实现了53%的token减少、46.1%的延迟减少和57.9%的能耗减少，同时保持或提高了准确性。

Conclusion: ARS方法在多个模型架构上验证了其有效性，为高效推理提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Language Models (LRLMs or LRMs) demonstrate remarkable
capabilities in complex reasoning tasks, but suffer from significant
computational inefficiencies due to overthinking phenomena. Existing efficient
reasoning methods face the challenge of balancing reasoning quality with
inference cost reduction. We propose \textbf{Adaptive Reasoning Suppression
(ARS)}, a novel training-free approach that dynamically suppresses redundant
reasoning steps while preserving accuracy through adaptive certainty
monitoring. ARS introduces a multi-checkpoint certainty estimation mechanism
with progressive suppression thresholds, achieving superior efficiency compared
to static suppression methods. Our extensive evaluation across mathematical
reasoning benchmarks using multiple model architectures demonstrates that ARS
achieves up to 53%, 46.1%, and 57.9% in token, latency and energy reduction,

Motivation: 设计明智的AI政策是社会面临的重大挑战，但目前缺乏有效的科学共识形成机制。NeurIPS作为AI领域的领导者，是推动这种共识的最佳选择。

Method: 建议NeurIPS借鉴IPCC在气候政策共识形成方面的经验，通过初步试点项目来催化AI政策科学共识。

Result: 论文论证了NeurIPS推动AI政策科学共识的可行性和必要性，驳斥了AI研究者分歧过大和NeurIPS不应参与政策制定的反对意见。

Conclusion: NeurIPS应该在AI政策领域发挥领导作用，通过促进科学共识来创造更高质量的AI政策。

Abstract: Designing wise AI policy is a grand challenge for society. To design such
policy, policymakers should place a premium on rigorous evidence and scientific
consensus. While several mechanisms exist for evidence generation, and nascent
mechanisms tackle evidence synthesis, we identify a complete void on consensus
formation. In this position paper, we argue NeurIPS should actively catalyze
scientific consensus on AI policy. Beyond identifying the current deficit in
consensus formation mechanisms, we argue that NeurIPS is the best option due
its strengths and the paucity of compelling alternatives. To make progress, we
recommend initial pilots for NeurIPS by distilling lessons from the IPCC's
leadership to build scientific consensus on climate policy. We dispel
predictable counters that AI researchers disagree too much to achieve consensus
and that policy engagement is not the business of NeurIPS. NeurIPS leads AI on
many fronts, and it should champion scientific consensus to create higher
quality AI policy.

Motivation: 随着视觉语言模型的兴起，法律判决预测系统开始结合罪犯图像和文本案例报告，但这种方式可能带来意外后果和恶意使用风险，需要评估其效率和公平性。

Method: 首先审计独立VLMs在保释预测任务中的表现，然后设计干预算法：通过RAG管道引入法律先例，再使用创新方案对VLMs进行微调。

Result: 发现独立VLMs在多个交叉群体中表现糟糕，会高置信度错误拒绝应获保释者。干预措施显著改善了保释预测性能。

Conclusion: 这项工作为未来在VLMs部署到真实世界法律判决预测之前设计更智能的干预措施铺平了道路。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been extensively used for legal judgment
prediction tasks based on case reports and crime history. However, with a surge
in the availability of large vision language models (VLMs), legal judgment
prediction systems can now be made to leverage the images of the criminals in
addition to the textual case reports/crime history. Applications built in this
way could lead to inadvertent consequences and be used with malicious intent.
In this work, we run an audit to investigate the efficiency of standalone VLMs
in the bail decision prediction task. We observe that the performance is poor
across multiple intersectional groups and models \textit{wrongly deny bail to
deserving individuals with very high confidence}. We design different
intervention algorithms by first including legal precedents through a RAG
pipeline and then fine-tuning the VLMs using innovative schemes. We demonstrate
that these interventions substantially improve the performance of bail
prediction. Our work paves the way for the design of smarter interventions on
VLMs in the future, before they can be deployed for real-world legal judgment
prediction.

Motivation: 传统方法依赖安全工程师手动编码大量恢复规则，但无法预测现实世界中的各种意外情况，且难以保持完整性。

Method: 利用具身AI和大视觉语言模型提供常识推理能力，在Unreal Engine模拟的城市场景中，让无人机动态解读环境并决定紧急机动以实现安全着陆。

Result: 结果显示具身AI能够实现一类新的自适应恢复和决策流程，这些流程以前无法通过手工设计实现。

Conclusion: 该方法推进了自主空中系统的弹性和安全性，为无人机在突发事件中的实时响应提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Autonomous drones must often respond to sudden events, such as alarms,
faults, or unexpected changes in their environment, that require immediate and
adaptive decision-making. Traditional approaches rely on safety engineers
hand-coding large sets of recovery rules, but this strategy cannot anticipate
the vast range of real-world contingencies and quickly becomes incomplete.
Recent advances in embodied AI, powered by large visual language models,
provide commonsense reasoning to assess context and generate appropriate
actions in real time. We demonstrate this capability in a simulated urban
benchmark in the Unreal Engine, where drones dynamically interpret their
surroundings and decide on sudden maneuvers for safe landings. Our results show
that embodied AI makes possible a new class of adaptive recovery and
decision-making pipelines that were previously infeasible to design by hand,
advancing resilience and safety in autonomous aerial systems.

*Anni Li,Aria Attar,Paul Dong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Thinkquel是一个经过微调的模型，用于生成可靠、可移植且经过执行验证的数据库查询。它集成了新颖的合成数据管道TS-SQL和专门设计的Token-Sequence GRPO(TS-GRPO)强化学习目标，以弥合token级训练信号与序列级执行奖励之间的差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将自然语言请求转换为可靠、生产就绪的数据转换仍然具有挑战性：正确性依赖于精确的模式链接和特定数据仓库的SQL方言，而训练期间最强的监督——执行成功和结果匹配——仅在序列级别提供。同时，组装大型、经过执行验证的语料库成本高昂，且token级目标与这些全局信号不匹配，导致优化不稳定和可移植性有限。

Method: Thinkquel集成了新颖的合成数据管道TS-SQL，利用dbt作为可移植的中间表示，以及专门设计的Token-Sequence GRPO(TS-GRPO)强化学习目标。TS-GRPO专门用于在微调LLMs时弥合token级训练信号与序列级执行奖励之间的差距。

Result: 在500个示例的TS-SQL测试集上，Thinkquel(32B)通过两阶段SFT课程达到93.2%的执行成功率和61.8%的精确结果匹配，相比基础模型提高了67.2%(执行)和44.4%(匹配)。在Spider(14B)实验中，TS-GRPO相对于GRPO和GSPO提高了训练稳定性并加速了执行匹配奖励的收敛。

Conclusion: Thinkquel通过集成TS-SQL合成数据管道和TS-GRPO强化学习目标，成功解决了自然语言到SQL转换中的关键挑战，显著提高了执行成功率和结果匹配精度，同时改善了训练稳定性和收敛速度。

Abstract: Transforming natural-language requests into reliable, production-ready data
transformations remains challenging: correctness depends on precise schema
linking and warehouse-specific SQL dialects, while the strongest supervision
available during training--execution success and result matching--are provided
only at the sequence level. At the same time, assembling large,
execution-validated corpora is costly, and token-level objectives misalign with
these global signals, yielding unstable optimization and limited portability.
We introduce Thinkquel, a fine-tuned model for producing robust, portable, and
execution-validated database queries. Methodologies in Thinkquel integrates a
novel synthetic data pipeline, TS-SQL, that leverages dbt as a portable
intermediate representation with a span-aware reinforcement learning objective,
and Token-Sequence GRPO (TS-GRPO), specifically designed to bridge the gap
between token-level training signals and sequence-level execution rewards when
finetuning LLMs. On the 500-example TS-SQL test set, Thinkquel (32B) reaches
93.2\% execution success and 61.8\% exact-result match with a two-stage SFT
curriculum, improving over the base model by 67.2\% (exec.) and 44.4\% (match).
In Spider (14B) experiments, TS-GRPO increases training stability and speeds

TL;DR: 提出了一种解耦微调方法和DualTune推理框架，通过将工具调用任务分解为工具选择和参数生成两个子任务，使用专用LoRA适配器分别处理，显著提升了本地LLM在工具调用场景下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本地LLM在工具调用场景中表现不佳，难以处理大型工具集的选择和复杂参数结构的生成，需要隐私保护且成本效益高的本地推理解决方案。

Method: 采用解耦微调方法，使用LoRA微调创建专用适配器，分别处理工具选择和工具特定参数生成，并通过DualTune框架在推理时动态加载相应适配器，实现分层编排以限制工具选择数量。

Result: 在MCP-Bench基准测试中，使用解耦微调训练的Qwen-2.5-7B模型将基础模型的工具调用准确率提升了46%，在大多数情况下优于其他相似大小的本地推理、非推理和微调模型，甚至优于2倍大小的模型。

Conclusion: 解耦微调和DualTune框架有效解决了本地LLM在工具调用中的性能瓶颈，为隐私保护、成本效益高的本地代理编排提供了可行方案。

Abstract: The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) as agentic orchestrators has
revolutionized task automation, but the need for privacy-preserving,
cost-effective solutions demands on-device inference capabilities. However,
local LLMs consistently underperform compared to frontier models in tool
calling scenarios, struggling with both tool selection from large tool sets and
accurate argument generation for complex parameter structures. We introduce a
methodology that disaggregates a tool-calling task into two distinct subtasks:
tool selection and argument generation. We propose "decoupled fine-tuning", a
novel post-training approach that employs LoRA fine-tuning to create dedicated
LoRA adapters for tool selection and tool-specific argument generation using
separate loss masking for each of the subtasks. Furthermore, we present
DualTune, an inference framework that leverages the LoRA adapters created using
decoupled fine-tuning to perform efficient agent orchestration with the help of
local models on end-user devices. DualTune decomposes the tool-call generation
step into tool selection and argument generation, and dynamically loads the
corresponding LoRA adapters to generate tool calls. Additionally, DualTune
implements hierarchical orchestration to restrict the number of tools required
for tool selection. Our experiments on the MCP-Bench benchmark demonstrate that
the Qwen-2.5-7B model trained using decoupled fine-tuning improves the tool
calling accuracy of the base model by 46%, and outperforms other local
reasoning, non-reasoning and fine-tuned models of similar size in all cases,
and models that are 2x larger, in most cases.

*Maisha Maliha,Dean Hougen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了MAGIC-MASK框架，将基于扰动的可解释性方法扩展到多智能体强化学习，通过智能体间协作共享掩码状态信息和经验，提高关键状态发现效率和解释保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度强化学习在安全关键和多智能体环境中决策过程可解释性不足的问题，现有方法在计算成本、探索覆盖和多智能体适应性方面存在局限。

Method: 集成近端策略优化、自适应epsilon-greedy探索和轻量级智能体间协作，进行显著性引导的掩码处理和基于奖励的见解共享，基于轨迹扰动、奖励保真度分析和KL散度正则化的统一数学形式化。

Result: 在单智能体和多智能体基准测试中验证，包括多智能体高速公路驾驶环境和Google Research Football，在保真度、学习效率和策略鲁棒性方面持续优于最先进基线。

Conclusion: MAGIC-MASK通过概率建模和多智能体马尔可夫决策过程提供了局部化、可解释的解释，实现了从单智能体到多智能体系统的可解释性泛化。

Abstract: Understanding the decision-making process of Deep Reinforcement Learning
agents remains a key challenge for deploying these systems in safety-critical
and multi-agent environments. While prior explainability methods like
StateMask, have advanced the identification of critical states, they remain
limited by computational cost, exploration coverage, and lack of adaptation to
multi-agent settings. To overcome these limitations, we propose a
mathematically grounded framework, MAGIC-MASK (Multi-Agent Guided Inter-agent
Collaboration with Mask-Based Explainability for Reinforcement Learning), that
extends perturbation-based explanation to Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning.
Our method integrates Proximal Policy Optimization, adaptive epsilon-greedy
exploration, and lightweight inter-agent collaboration to share masked state
information and peer experience. This collaboration enables each agent to
perform saliency-guided masking and share reward-based insights with peers,
reducing the time required for critical state discovery, improving explanation
fidelity, and leading to faster and more robust learning. The core novelty of
our approach lies in generalizing explainability from single-agent to
multi-agent systems through a unified mathematical formalism built on
trajectory perturbation, reward fidelity analysis, and Kullback-Leibler
divergence regularization. This framework yields localized, interpretable
explanations grounded in probabilistic modeling and multi-agent Markov decision
processes. We validate our framework on both single-agent and multi-agent
benchmarks, including a multi-agent highway driving environment and Google
Research Football, demonstrating that MAGIC-MASK consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines in fidelity, learning efficiency, and policy
robustness while offering interpretable and transferable explanations.

TL;DR: ICL引导虽然能提升特定任务性能，但会损害跨领域推理能力，导致"优化脆弱性"现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索ICL引导对跨知识领域推理能力的影响，目前这方面研究尚属空白。

Method: 使用GPT-OSS:20b模型的6个变体（1个基准模型和5种ICL配置），在840个测试中评估通用知识、逻辑谜题和数学奥赛问题的表现。

Result: ICL模型在通用知识任务上达到91%-99%准确率，但在复杂推理问题上性能下降，谜题准确率降至10-43%（基准模型为43%），数学奥赛问题无显著差异。

Conclusion: ICL引导在效率和推理灵活性之间存在系统性权衡，对LLM部署和AI安全有重要启示。

Abstract: ICL guides are known to improve task-specific performance, but their impact
on cross-domain cognitive abilities remains unexplored. This study examines how
ICL guides affect reasoning across different knowledge domains using six
variants of the GPT-OSS:20b model: one baseline model and five ICL
configurations (simple, chain-of-thought, random, appended text, and symbolic
language). The models were subjected to 840 tests spanning general knowledge
questions, logic riddles, and a mathematical olympiad problem. Statistical
analysis (ANOVA) revealed significant behavioral modifications (p less than
0.001) across ICL variants, demonstrating a phenomenon termed "optimized
fragility." ICL models achieved 91%-99% accuracy on general knowledge tasks
while showing degraded performance on complex reasoning problems, with accuracy
dropping to 10-43% on riddles compared to 43% for the baseline model. Notably,
no significant differences emerged on the olympiad problem (p=0.2173),
suggesting that complex mathematical reasoning remains unaffected by ICL
optimization. These findings indicate that ICL guides create systematic
trade-offs between efficiency and reasoning flexibility, with important
implications for LLM deployment and AI safety.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了LLM代理在工具选择中的偏见问题，提出了评估工具选择偏见的基准，发现模型存在不公平偏好，分析了偏见来源，并提出了轻量级缓解方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM代理依赖外部工具，但工具选择如果存在系统性偏见，会降低用户体验并扭曲市场竞争，需要研究工具选择偏见问题。

Method: 构建包含多个功能等效工具的基准测试集，测试7个模型的工具选择行为，通过控制实验分析工具特征、元数据和预训练暴露对偏见的影响。

Result: 发现语义对齐是选择的最强预测因素，扰动描述会显著改变选择，预训练暴露会放大偏见，提出的过滤加均匀采样方法能有效减少偏见。

Conclusion: 工具选择偏见是工具增强LLM公平部署的关键障碍，需要关注和缓解此类偏见问题。

Abstract: Agents backed by large language models (LLMs) often rely on external tools
drawn from marketplaces where multiple providers offer functionally equivalent
options. This raises a critical point concerning fairness: if selection is
systematically biased, it can degrade user experience and distort competition
by privileging some providers over others. We introduce a benchmark of diverse
tool categories, each containing multiple functionally equivalent tools, to
evaluate tool-selection bias. Using this benchmark, we test seven models and
show that unfairness exists with models either fixating on a single provider or
disproportionately preferring earlier-listed tools in context. To investigate
the origins of this bias, we conduct controlled experiments examining tool
features, metadata (name, description, parameters), and pre-training exposure.
We find that: (1) semantic alignment between queries and metadata is the
strongest predictor of choice; (2) perturbing descriptions significantly shifts
selections; and (3) repeated pre-training exposure to a single endpoint
amplifies bias. Finally, we propose a lightweight mitigation that first filters
the candidate tools to a relevant subset and then samples uniformly, reducing
bias while preserving good task coverage. Our findings highlight tool-selection
bias as a key obstacle for the fair deployment of tool-augmented LLMs.

TL;DR: CAIA基准测试揭示了AI在对抗性高风险环境中的关键盲点：即使最先进的模型也难以在主动欺骗环境中可靠运作，特别是在加密货币等高风险领域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI评估主要关注受控环境下的任务完成能力，但现实世界部署需要模型具备对抗主动欺骗的韧性。加密货币市场2024年因漏洞损失300亿美元，是理想的测试场景。

Method: 使用加密货币市场作为测试平台，评估17个模型在178个时间锚定任务上的表现，要求模型区分真相与操纵、导航碎片化信息环境，并在对抗压力下做出不可逆的金融决策。

Result: 无工具时前沿模型准确率仅28%，工具增强后提升至67.4%，但仍低于80%的人类基准。模型系统性偏好不可靠的网页搜索而非权威数据，易受SEO优化错误信息和社交媒体操纵影响。

Conclusion: 当前模型尽管在推理得分上表现优异，但在需要对抗主动反对的环境中仍基本未准备好。对抗鲁棒性是可信AI自主性的必要条件，CAIA基准为此提供了持续更新的评估框架。

Abstract: We present CAIA, a benchmark exposing a critical blind spot in AI evaluation:
the inability of state-of-the-art models to operate in adversarial, high-stakes
environments where misinformation is weaponized and errors are irreversible.
While existing benchmarks measure task completion in controlled settings,
real-world deployment demands resilience against active deception. Using crypto
markets as a testbed where $30 billion was lost to exploits in 2024, we
evaluate 17 models on 178 time-anchored tasks requiring agents to distinguish
truth from manipulation, navigate fragmented information landscapes, and make
irreversible financial decisions under adversarial pressure.
  Our results reveal a fundamental capability gap: without tools, even frontier
models achieve only 28% accuracy on tasks junior analysts routinely handle.
Tool augmentation improves performance but plateaus at 67.4% versus 80% human
baseline, despite unlimited access to professional resources. Most critically,
we uncover a systematic tool selection catastrophe: models preferentially
choose unreliable web search over authoritative data, falling for SEO-optimized
misinformation and social media manipulation. This behavior persists even when
correct answers are directly accessible through specialized tools, suggesting
foundational limitations rather than knowledge gaps. We also find that Pass@k
metrics mask dangerous trial-and-error behavior for autonomous deployment.
  The implications extend beyond crypto to any domain with active adversaries,
e.g. cybersecurity, content moderation, etc. We release CAIA with contamination
controls and continuous updates, establishing adversarial robustness as a
necessary condition for trustworthy AI autonomy. The benchmark reveals that
current models, despite impressive reasoning scores, remain fundamentally
unprepared for environments where intelligence must survive active opposition.

Result: 在Sudoku-Extreme和Maze-Hard任务上取得了显著优于之前报告的性能

Conclusion: 研究结果提出了令人惊讶的观察和进一步研究的有趣方向

Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated remarkable performance in natural language
processing and related domains, as they largely focus on sequential,
autoregressive next-token prediction tasks. Yet, they struggle in logical
reasoning, not necessarily because of a fundamental limitation of these models,
but possibly due to the lack of exploration of more creative uses, such as
latent space and recurrent reasoning. An emerging exploration in this direction
is the Hierarchical Reasoning Model (Wang et al., 2025), which introduces a
novel type of recurrent reasoning in the latent space of transformers,
achieving remarkable performance on a wide range of 2D reasoning tasks. Despite
the promising results, this line of models is still at an early stage and calls
for in-depth investigation. In this work, we perform a critical review on this
class of models, examine key design choices and present intriguing variants
that achieve significantly better performance on the Sudoku-Extreme and
Maze-Hard tasks than previously reported. Our results also raise surprising
observations and intriguing directions for further research.

Conclusion: 该语义驱动的AI智能体通信框架具有在AI智能体通信网络中应用的潜力，能够有效应对动态环境和资源约束的挑战。

Abstract: With the rapid growth of intelligent services, communication targets are
shifting from humans to artificial intelligent (AI) agents, which require new
paradigms to enable real-time perception, decision-making, and collaboration.
Semantic communication, which conveys task-relevant meaning rather than raw
data, offers a promising solution. However, its practical deployment remains
constrained by dynamic environments and limited resources. To address these
issues, this article proposes a semantic-driven AI agent communication
framework and develops three enabling techniques. First, semantic adaptation
transmission applies fine-tuning with real or generative samples to efficiently
adapt models to varying environments. Second, semantic lightweight transmission
incorporates pruning, quantization, and perception-aware sampling to reduce
model complexity and alleviate computational burden on edge agents. Third,
semantic self-evolution control employs distributed hierarchical
decision-making to optimize multi-dimensional resources, enabling robust
multi-agent collaboration in dynamic environments. Simulation results show that
the proposed solutions achieve faster convergence and stronger robustness,
while the proposed distributed hierarchical optimization method significantly
outperforms conventional decision-making schemes, highlighting its potential
for AI agent communication networks.

Motivation: 现有智能体基准测试显示出新开发智能体快速达到性能上限的趋势，难以满足评估智能体能力的需求，需要更动态和可持续的评估系统。

Method: TRACE框架包含三个阶段：进化提案挖掘（通过初步探索和发散思维提供任务进化提案）、问题形成与自由探索（将提案概念化为可行问题候选，记录执行轨迹）、多级验证（确保进化任务具有可验证和可复现的轨迹）。

Result: 在GAIA基准上的实验表明，TRACE框架能够持续提升任务复杂度，同时通过可验证的执行轨迹提高正确性的可靠性。

Conclusion: 这项工作标志着从静态、手动策划的基准测试向动态、自进化评估系统的范式转变，为智能体开发提供了可持续且具有挑战性的发展路径。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and agent system designs have
empowered agents with unprecedented levels of capability. However, existing
agent benchmarks are showing a trend of rapid ceiling-hitting by newly
developed agents, making it difficult to meet the demands for evaluating agent
abilities. To address this problem, we propose the Trajectory-based
Validated-by-Reproducing Agent-benchmark Complexity Evolution (TRACE)
framework. This framework takes an original task from an existing benchmark and
encourages agents to freely explore and evolve it into a new task with higher
difficulty while recording validatable agent trajectories. The framework
proceeds in three stages: (1) evolutionary proposal mining, which provides task
evolution proposals through preliminary exploration and divergent thinking; (2)
problem formation and free exploration, where proposals are conceptualized into
feasible problem candidates and the agents then explore them freely while
recording their execution trajectories; and (3) multi-level validation, which
ensures that the evolved tasks are accompanied by validatable and reproducible
trajectories. Experiments on the GAIA benchmark demonstrate that the TRACE
framework consistently enhances task complexity while improving the reliability
of correctness through validatable execution trajectories. This work marks a
paradigm shift from static, manually curated benchmarks to dynamic,
self-evolving evaluation systems, providing a sustainable and challenging
runway for agent development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估AI回答患者健康问题的黄金标准——人工专家评审——劳动密集且耗时，限制了可扩展性。自动化指标虽然前景广阔，但与人类判断的一致性不一且常依赖上下文。

Method: 在100个患者案例中，收集了28个AI系统的回答（共2800个），从三个维度评估：是否回答问题、是否适当使用临床记录证据、是否使用一般医学知识。使用临床医生撰写的参考答案作为指标锚点。

Result: 自动化排名与专家评分高度匹配，表明自动化评估能够有效替代人工评审。

Conclusion: 精心设计的自动化评估可以扩展AI系统的比较评估，并支持患者-临床医生沟通。

Abstract: Automated approaches to answer patient-posed health questions are rising, but
selecting among systems requires reliable evaluation. The current gold standard
for evaluating the free-text artificial intelligence (AI) responses--human
expert review--is labor-intensive and slow, limiting scalability. Automated
metrics are promising yet variably aligned with human judgments and often
context-dependent. To address the feasibility of automating the evaluation of
AI responses to hospitalization-related questions posed by patients, we
conducted a large systematic study of evaluation approaches. Across 100 patient
cases, we collected responses from 28 AI systems (2800 total) and assessed them
along three dimensions: whether a system response (1) answers the question, (2)
appropriately uses clinical note evidence, and (3) uses general medical
knowledge. Using clinician-authored reference answers to anchor metrics,
automated rankings closely matched expert ratings. Our findings suggest that
carefully designed automated evaluation can scale comparative assessment of AI
systems and support patient-clinician communication.

TL;DR: 提出Expandable Decision-Making States (EDMS)方法，通过语义丰富的状态表示和动作掩码方案，在足球等入侵性团队运动中构建可解释的玩家级智能体模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于规则的分析方法直观但有限，现代机器学习模型虽然能预测但缺乏明确的智能体表示和战术可解释性。需要构建既能从数据中学习，又具有战术可解释性和跨数据源鲁棒性的玩家级智能体模型。

Method: EDMS方法：1）语义丰富的状态表示，在原始位置和速度基础上增加关系变量（如空间得分、传球和得分）；2）动作掩码方案，为持球和无球球员提供不同的决策集；3）将学习到的价值函数和动作策略映射到人类可解释的战术概念。

Result: 实验表明，EDMS结合动作掩码在动作预测损失和时间差分误差方面均优于基线方法。定性案例研究和Q值可视化显示EDMS能突出高风险高回报的战术模式（如快速反击和防守突破）。

Conclusion: EDMS方法成功构建了战术可解释的玩家级智能体模型，能够识别关键战术模式，并与多个商业和开源数据集兼容，支持跨提供商评估和可重复实验。

Abstract: Invasion team sports such as soccer produce a high-dimensional, strongly
coupled state space as many players continuously interact on a shared field,
challenging quantitative tactical analysis. Traditional rule-based analyses are
intuitive, while modern predictive machine learning models often perform
pattern-matching without explicit agent representations. The problem we address
is how to build player-level agent models from data, whose learned values and
policies are both tactically interpretable and robust across heterogeneous data
sources. Here, we propose Expandable Decision-Making States (EDMS), a
semantically enriched state representation that augments raw positions and
velocities with relational variables (e.g., scoring of space, pass, and score),
combined with an action-masking scheme that gives on-ball and off-ball agents
distinct decision sets. Compared to prior work, EDMS maps learned value
functions and action policies to human-interpretable tactical concepts (e.g.,
marking pressure, passing lanes, ball accessibility) instead of raw coordinate
features, and aligns agent choices with the rules of play. In the experiments,
EDMS with action masking consistently reduced both action-prediction loss and
temporal-difference (TD) error compared to the baseline. Qualitative case
studies and Q-value visualizations further indicate that EDMS highlights
high-risk, high-reward tactical patterns (e.g., fast counterattacks and
defensive breakthroughs). We also integrated our approach into an open-source
library and demonstrated compatibility with multiple commercial and open
datasets, enabling cross-provider evaluation and reproducible experiments.

Motivation: 传统观点认为过程奖励模型(PRM)优于结果奖励模型(ORM)，但这种观点主要基于数学相关领域的证据。本研究旨在在多样化领域中对四种奖励模型变体进行统一评估。

Method: 在14个多样化领域中评估四种奖励模型变体：判别式ORM和PRM(DisORM, DisPRM)以及生成式ORM和PRM(GenORM, GenPRM)。

Result: 发现DisORM与DisPRM表现相当，GenPRM不具竞争力，而GenORM在所有测试领域中都表现出显著且一致的增益，是最稳健的模型。

Conclusion: 研究挑战了细粒度监督总是更好的普遍假设，支持在多领域部署中使用生成式结果验证方法。

Abstract: The reliability of large language models (LLMs) during test-time scaling is
often assessed with \emph{external verifiers} or \emph{reward models} that
distinguish correct reasoning from flawed logic. Prior work generally assumes
that process reward models (PRMs), which score every intermediate reasoning
step, outperform outcome reward models (ORMs) that assess only the final
answer. This view is based mainly on evidence from narrow, math-adjacent
domains. We present the first unified evaluation of four reward model variants,
discriminative ORM and PRM (\DisORM, \DisPRM) and generative ORM and PRM
(\GenORM, \GenPRM), across 14 diverse domains. Contrary to conventional wisdom,
we find that (i) \DisORM performs on par with \DisPRM, (ii) \GenPRM is not
competitive, and (iii) overall, \GenORM is the most robust, yielding
significant and consistent gains across every tested domain. We attribute this
to PRM-style stepwise scoring, which inherits label noise from LLM
auto-labeling and has difficulty evaluating long reasoning trajectories,
including those involving self-correcting reasoning. Our theoretical analysis
shows that step-wise aggregation compounds errors as reasoning length grows,
and our empirical observations confirm this effect. These findings challenge
the prevailing assumption that fine-grained supervision is always better and
support generative outcome verification for multi-domain deployment. We
publicly release our code, datasets, and checkpoints at
\href{https://github.com/db-Lee/Multi-RM}{\underline{\small\texttt{https://github.com/db-Lee/Multi-RM}}}

Motivation: 现有嵌入模型缺乏视觉交互能力，无法处理用户指定的感兴趣区域（如点、边界框、掩码），限制了其在需要局部语义理解的应用场景中的适用性。

Method: 提出VIRTUE模型，通过整合分割模型和视觉语言模型，使分割模型能够处理视觉提示来精确定位图像中的特定区域，从而增强嵌入模型对复杂和模糊场景的处理能力。

Result: 在36个通用MMEB任务上性能提升3.1%-8.5%，在5个视觉交互SCaR任务上提升15.2%-20.3%，均达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: VIRTUE成功将视觉交互能力引入嵌入模型，不仅解锁了新的应用场景，还通过实体级信息学习补充了全局表示，为多模态表示学习开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Multimodal representation learning models have demonstrated successful
operation across complex tasks, and the integration of vision-language models
(VLMs) has further enabled embedding models with instruction-following
capabilities. However, existing embedding models lack visual-interactive
capabilities to specify regions of interest from users (e.g., point, bounding
box, mask), which have been explored in generative models to broaden their
human-interactive applicability. Equipping embedding models with visual
interactions not only would unlock new applications with localized grounding of
user intent, which remains unexplored, but also enable the models to learn
entity-level information within images to complement their global
representations for conventional embedding tasks. In this paper, we propose a
novel Visual-InteRactive Text-Image Universal Embedder (VIRTUE) that extends
the capabilities of the segmentation model and the vision-language model to the
realm of representation learning. In VIRTUE, the segmentation model can process
visual prompts that pinpoint specific regions within an image, thereby enabling
the embedder to handle complex and ambiguous scenarios more precisely. To
evaluate the visual-interaction ability of VIRTUE, we introduce a large-scale
Segmentation-and-Scene Caption Retrieval (SCaR) benchmark comprising 1M samples
that aims to retrieve the text caption by jointly considering the entity with a
specific object and image scene. VIRTUE consistently achieves a
state-of-the-art performance with significant improvements across 36 universal
MMEB (3.1%-8.5%) and five visual-interactive SCaR (15.2%-20.3%) tasks.

enhance Large Language Models with enterprise-specific knowledge. However,
current data quality (DQ) frameworks have been primarily developed for static
datasets, and only inadequately address the dynamic, multi-stage nature of RAG
systems. This study aims to develop DQ dimensions for this new type of AI-based
systems. We conduct 16 semi-structured interviews with practitioners of leading
IT service companies. Through a qualitative content analysis, we inductively
derive 15 distinct DQ dimensions across the four processing stages of RAG
systems: data extraction, data transformation, prompt & search, and generation.
Our findings reveal that (1) new dimensions have to be added to traditional DQ
frameworks to also cover RAG contexts; (2) these new dimensions are
concentrated in early RAG steps, suggesting the need for front-loaded quality
management strategies, and (3) DQ issues transform and propagate through the
RAG pipeline, necessitating a dynamic, step-aware approach to quality
management.

### [178] [Toward Safer Diffusion Language Models: Discovery and Mitigation of Priming Vulnerability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00565)
*Shojiro Yamabe,Jun Sakuma*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文揭示了扩散语言模型(DLMs)在迭代去噪过程中存在关键安全漏洞，攻击者可通过注入肯定令牌绕过安全防护，并提出了一种针对DLMs的安全对齐方法来缓解此漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散语言模型通过并行迭代去噪生成令牌，这种推理机制可能带来未被充分理解的安全风险，特别是越狱攻击可能利用这一机制。

Method: 研究发现如果在中间步骤出现对有害查询的肯定令牌，后续去噪过程可能被引导生成有害响应。基于此分析，提出了一种针对DLMs的安全对齐方法，训练模型从包含肯定令牌的污染中间状态生成安全响应。

Result: 实验表明所提方法显著缓解了该漏洞，对任务性能影响最小，同时提高了对传统越狱攻击的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 这项工作强调了针对扩散语言模型进行特定安全研究的必要性，因为其独特的推理机制带来了新的安全挑战。

Abstract: Diffusion language models (DLMs) generate tokens in parallel through
iterative denoising, which can reduce latency and enable bidirectional
conditioning. However, the safety risks posed by jailbreak attacks that exploit
this inference mechanism are not well understood. In this paper, we reveal that
DLMs have a critical vulnerability stemming from their iterative denoising
process and propose a countermeasure. Specifically, our investigation shows
that if an affirmative token for a harmful query appears at an intermediate
step, subsequent denoising can be steered toward a harmful response even in
aligned models. As a result, simply injecting such affirmative tokens can
readily bypass the safety guardrails. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the
vulnerability allows existing optimization-based jailbreak attacks to succeed
on DLMs. Building on this analysis, we propose a novel safety alignment method
tailored to DLMs that trains models to generate safe responses from
contaminated intermediate states that contain affirmative tokens. Our
experiments indicate that the proposed method significantly mitigates the
vulnerability with minimal impact on task performance. Furthermore, our method
improves robustness against conventional jailbreak attacks. Our work
underscores the need for DLM-specific safety research.

*Minki Kang,Wei-Ning Chen,Dongge Han,Huseyin A. Inan,Lukas Wutschitz,Yanzhi Chen,Robert Sim,Saravan Rajmohan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Agent Context Optimization (ACON)框架，通过优化压缩指导方针来压缩环境观察和交互历史，减少内存使用26-54%的同时保持任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型作为代理在动态环境中部署时，需要积累长历史记录，导致上下文长度增长、成本增加和效率降低。现有上下文压缩方法主要关注单步任务或窄应用。

Method: ACON框架通过自然语言空间中的压缩指导方针优化：在完整上下文成功但压缩上下文失败的配对轨迹中，分析失败原因并相应更新压缩指导方针。还将优化的LLM压缩器蒸馏到更小模型中。

Result: 在AppWorld、OfficeBench和Multi-objective QA上的实验显示，ACON减少内存使用26-54%（峰值token），同时大幅保持任务性能，蒸馏到更小压缩器时保持95%以上准确率，并提升较小LM作为长视野代理的性能达46%。

Conclusion: ACON提供了一种有效的上下文压缩方法，能够在减少内存使用的同时保持代理性能，并通过蒸馏技术实现高效部署。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as agents in dynamic,
real-world environments, where success requires both reasoning and effective
tool use. A central challenge for agentic tasks is the growing context length,
as agents must accumulate long histories of actions and observations. This
expansion raises costs and reduces efficiency in long-horizon tasks, yet prior
work on context compression has mostly focused on single-step tasks or narrow
applications. We introduce Agent Context Optimization (ACON), a unified
framework that optimally compresses both environment observations and
interaction histories into concise yet informative condensations. ACON
leverages compression guideline optimization in natural language space: given
paired trajectories where full context succeeds but compressed context fails,
capable LLMs analyze the causes of failure, and the compression guideline is
updated accordingly. Furthermore, we propose distilling the optimized LLM
compressor into smaller models to reduce the overhead of the additional module.
Experiments on AppWorld, OfficeBench, and Multi-objective QA show that ACON
reduces memory usage by 26-54% (peak tokens) while largely preserving task
performance, preserves over 95% of accuracy when distilled into smaller
compressors, and enhances smaller LMs as long-horizon agents with up to 46%
performance improvement.

*Rosni Vasu,Peter Jansen,Pao Siangliulue,Cristina Sarasua,Abraham Bernstein,Peter Clark,Bhavana Dalvi Mishra*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HARPA是一个AI驱动的科学发现系统，通过文献挖掘识别研究趋势、探索假设设计空间、定位研究差距来生成可测试且基于文献的假设，在可行性和基础性方面显著优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有自动化科学发现工具难以生成既可测试又基于科学文献的假设，以及无法根据先前实验结果进行调整的问题。

Method: 采用受人类研究人员启发的构思工作流程：文献挖掘识别新兴研究趋势、探索假设设计空间、通过定位研究差距和论证设计选择来收敛到精确可测试的假设，并学习基于先前实验结果的奖励模型。

Result: HARPA生成的研究提案在可行性(+0.78)和基础性(+0.85)方面显著优于基线；与ASD代理(CodeScientist)测试时，成功执行更多(20 vs 11/40)，失败更少(16 vs 21/40)；奖励模型比未训练基线提高约28%的绝对增益。

Conclusion: HARPA代表了AI驱动科学发现领域的重要进展，能够生成更可行、更基础的研究假设，并能根据经验不断改进假设质量。

Abstract: While there has been a surge of interest in automated scientific discovery
(ASD), especially with the emergence of LLMs, it remains challenging for tools
to generate hypotheses that are both testable and grounded in the scientific
literature. Additionally, existing ideation tools are not adaptive to prior
experimental outcomes. We developed HARPA to address these challenges by
incorporating the ideation workflow inspired by human researchers. HARPA first
identifies emerging research trends through literature mining, then explores
hypothesis design spaces, and finally converges on precise, testable hypotheses
by pinpointing research gaps and justifying design choices. Our evaluations
show that HARPA-generated hypothesis-driven research proposals perform
comparably to a strong baseline AI-researcher across most qualitative
dimensions (e.g., specificity, novelty, overall quality), but achieve
significant gains in feasibility(+0.78, p$<0.05$, bootstrap) and groundedness
(+0.85, p$<0.01$, bootstrap) on a 10-point Likert scale. When tested with the
ASD agent (CodeScientist), HARPA produced more successful executions (20 vs. 11
out of 40) and fewer failures (16 vs. 21 out of 40), showing that expert
feasibility judgments track with actual execution success. Furthermore, to
simulate how researchers continuously refine their understanding of what
hypotheses are both testable and potentially interesting from experience, HARPA
learns a reward model that scores new hypotheses based on prior experimental
outcomes, achieving approx. a 28\% absolute gain over HARPA's untrained
baseline scorer. Together, these methods represent a step forward in the field
of AI-driven scientific discovery.

*Wei Liu,Haomei Xu,Bingqing Liu,Zhiying Deng,Haozhao Wang,Jun Wang,Ruixuan Li,Yee Whye Teh,Wee Sun Lee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文发现当前模型编辑方法存在根本性缺陷，其表面可靠性建立在脆弱基础上，实际是利用隐藏捷径而非真实语义，在否定查询下完全失效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示模型编辑领域存在的根本问题，即当前方法可能只是利用捷径而非真正更新知识，挑战模型编辑的可行性基础。

Method: 开发了一套新的评估方法，特别设计了否定查询等负样本测试，系统性地检验现有模型编辑方法的鲁棒性。

Result: 发现最先进的模型编辑方法在简单的否定查询下就会崩溃，证明编辑更可能是基于捷径而非完整语义。

Conclusion: 模型编辑领域需要重新审视其基础，当前方法存在根本性缺陷，在进一步推进前必须解决捷径利用问题。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) inevitably encode outdated or incorrect
knowledge. Updating, deleting, and forgetting such knowledge is important for
alignment, safety, and other issues. To address this issue, model editing has
emerged as a promising paradigm: by precisely editing a small subset of
parameters such that a specific fact is updated while preserving other
knowledge. Despite its great success reported in previous papers, we find the
apparent reliability of editing rests on a fragile foundation and the current
literature is largely driven by illusory success. The fundamental goal of
steering the model's output toward a target with minimal modification would
encourage exploiting hidden shortcuts, rather than utilizing real semantics.
This problem directly challenges the feasibility of the current model editing
literature at its very foundation, as shortcuts are inherently at odds with
robust knowledge integration. Coincidentally, this issue has long been obscured
by evaluation frameworks that lack the design of negative examples. To uncover
it, we systematically develop a suite of new evaluation methods. Strikingly, we
find that state-of-the-art approaches collapse even under the simplest negation
queries. Our empirical evidence shows that editing is likely to be based on
shortcuts rather than full semantics, calling for an urgent reconsideration of
the very basis of model editing before further advancements can be meaningfully
pursued.

### [182] [Collaborative-Distilled Diffusion Models (CDDM) for Accelerated and Lightweight Trajectory Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00627)
*Bingzhang Wang,Kehua Chen,Yinhai Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CDDM提出了一种用于实时轻量级轨迹预测的新方法，通过协同渐进蒸馏技术，在减少采样步骤的同时压缩模型规模，实现了高性能生成模型与实际部署需求的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在概率轨迹预测中表现出色，但其大模型规模和慢采样过程阻碍了实际部署。需要开发既保持高精度又满足实时性要求的轻量级预测方法。

Method: 基于协同渐进蒸馏(CPD)，CDDM将高容量教师扩散模型的知识逐步转移到轻量级学生模型中，同时减少采样步骤和模型规模。引入双信号正则化蒸馏损失，结合教师和真实数据的指导。

Result: 在ETH-UCY行人基准和nuScenes车辆基准上的实验表明，CDDM达到最先进的预测精度。在行人轨迹上保留96.2%和95.5%的ADE和FDE性能，仅需231K参数和4或2个采样步骤，实现161倍压缩、31倍加速和9ms延迟。

Conclusion: CDDM通过桥接高性能生成模型与实际部署约束，为自动驾驶车辆和智能交通系统实现了资源高效的概率预测。

Abstract: Trajectory prediction is a fundamental task in Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) and
Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), supporting efficient motion planning
and real-time traffic safety management. Diffusion models have recently
demonstrated strong performance in probabilistic trajectory prediction, but
their large model size and slow sampling process hinder real-world deployment.
This paper proposes Collaborative-Distilled Diffusion Models (CDDM), a novel
method for real-time and lightweight trajectory prediction. Built upon
Collaborative Progressive Distillation (CPD), CDDM progressively transfers
knowledge from a high-capacity teacher diffusion model to a lightweight student
model, jointly reducing both the number of sampling steps and the model size
across distillation iterations. A dual-signal regularized distillation loss is
further introduced to incorporate guidance from both the teacher and
ground-truth data, mitigating potential overfitting and ensuring robust
performance. Extensive experiments on the ETH-UCY pedestrian benchmark and the
nuScenes vehicle benchmark demonstrate that CDDM achieves state-of-the-art
prediction accuracy. The well-distilled CDDM retains 96.2% and 95.5% of the
baseline model's ADE and FDE performance on pedestrian trajectories, while
requiring only 231K parameters and 4 or 2 sampling steps, corresponding to 161x
compression, 31x acceleration, and 9 ms latency. Qualitative results further
show that CDDM generates diverse and accurate trajectories under dynamic agent
behaviors and complex social interactions. By bridging high-performing
generative models with practical deployment constraints, CDDM enables
resource-efficient probabilistic prediction for AVs and ITS. Code is available

### [183] [Expected Attention: KV Cache Compression by Estimating Attention from Future Queries Distribution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00636)
*Alessio Devoto,Maximilian Jeblick,Simon Jégou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Expected Attention的训练无关KV缓存压缩方法，通过预测未来查询对KV对的关注度来估计其重要性，解决了现有注意力分数方法在推理时的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KV缓存的内存消耗是大型语言模型推理效率的主要瓶颈。现有的基于注意力分数的KV缓存剪枝方法面临实际限制：压缩时无法获得未来token的注意力分数，且现代实现如Flash Attention不生成完整注意力矩阵。

Method: 利用LLM激活的分布特性，以闭式形式计算每个KV对的期望注意力分数，从而对KV对进行排序和剪枝，对残差流影响最小。

Result: 该方法在预填充和解码阶段都能无缝运行，在两个场景中都持续优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: 作者发布了KVPress库，一个包含20多种技术的综合库，供研究人员实现和基准测试KV缓存压缩方法。

Abstract: Memory consumption of the Key-Value (KV) cache represents a major bottleneck
for efficient large language model inference. While attention-score-based KV
cache pruning shows promise, it faces critical practical limitations: attention
scores from future tokens are unavailable during compression, and modern
implementations like Flash Attention do not materialize the full attention
matrix, making past scores inaccessible. To overcome these challenges, we
introduce $\textbf{Expected Attention, a training-free compression method}$
that estimates KV pairs importance by predicting how future queries will attend
to them. Our approach leverages the distributional properties of LLM
activations to compute expected attention scores in closed form for each KV
pair. These scores enable principled ranking and pruning of KV pairs with
minimal impact on the residual stream, achieving effective compression without
performance degradation. Importantly, our method operates seamlessly across
both prefilling and decoding phases, consistently outperforming
state-of-the-art baselines in both scenarios. Finally, $\textbf{we release
KVPress, a comprehensive library to enable researchers to implement and
benchmark KV cache compression methods, already including more than 20
techniques}$.

Result: Batch-CAM在准确性和图像重建质量上同时提升，同时减少了训练和推理时间。

Conclusion: 通过确保模型学习证据相关信息，该方法为构建更透明、可解释和可信赖的AI系统做出贡献。

Abstract: Understanding the inner workings of deep learning models is crucial for
advancing artificial intelligence, particularly in high-stakes fields such as
healthcare, where accurate explanations are as vital as precision. This paper
introduces Batch-CAM, a novel training paradigm that fuses a batch
implementation of the Grad-CAM algorithm with a prototypical reconstruction
loss. This combination guides the model to focus on salient image features,
thereby enhancing its performance across classification tasks. Our results
demonstrate that Batch-CAM achieves a simultaneous improvement in accuracy and
image reconstruction quality while reducing training and inference times. By
ensuring models learn from evidence-relevant information,this approach makes a
relevant contribution to building more transparent, explainable, and
trustworthy AI systems.

TL;DR: 提出了一种迭代式相关区域(RZ)缩减方法，通过重复求解同一位置并逐步限制参与区域，引导求解器找到更小的RZ，从而提高策略重用性和剪枝效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 游戏求解面临指数级增长的游戏树问题，虽然相关区域(RZ)技术能显著减少搜索空间，但不同解会产生不同大小的RZ。更小的RZ能提高重用机会和剪枝效率。

Method: 设计了迭代RZ缩减方法，包含三种约束生成策略，并整合了RZ模式表以充分利用过往解。

Result: 在7x7 Killall-Go实验中，平均RZ大小减少到原始的85.95%。

Conclusion: 缩减后的RZ可作为可重用知识永久存储，用于未来更大棋盘或不同开局时的求解任务。

Abstract: Game solving aims to find the optimal strategies for all players and
determine the theoretical outcome of a game. However, due to the exponential
growth of game trees, many games remain unsolved, even though methods like
AlphaZero have demonstrated super-human level in game playing. The
Relevance-Zone (RZ) is a local strategy reuse technique that restricts the
search to only the regions relevant to the outcome, significantly reducing the
search space. However, RZs are not unique. Different solutions may result in
RZs of varying sizes. Smaller RZs are generally more favorable, as they
increase the chance of reuse and improve pruning efficiency. To this end, we
propose an iterative RZ reduction method that repeatedly solves the same
position while gradually restricting the region involved, guiding the solver
toward smaller RZs. We design three constraint generation strategies and
integrate an RZ Pattern Table to fully leverage past solutions. In experiments
on 7x7 Killall-Go, our method reduces the average RZ size to 85.95% of the
original. Furthermore, the reduced RZs can be permanently stored as reusable
knowledge for future solving tasks, especially for larger board sizes or
different openings.

Motivation: 现有强化学习算法（如PPO）在训练大规模视觉语言模型时存在静态训练计划和刚性裁剪机制的限制，影响了复杂推理任务的对齐效果

Method: ACPO包含两个核心组件：1）动态课程学习，从稳定探索阶段逐步过渡到高效利用阶段；2）优势感知自适应裁剪机制，用动态样本级边界替代固定裁剪参数

Result: 在MathVista、LogicVista和MMMU-Pro等基准测试中，ACPO一致优于DAPO和PAPO等基线方法，实现了最先进性能、加速收敛和优越的训练稳定性

Conclusion: ACPO通过自适应学习策略有效解决了VLMs对齐训练中的挑战，为复杂多模态推理任务提供了更有效的强化学习优化框架

Abstract: Aligning large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) for complex reasoning via
reinforcement learning is often hampered by the limitations of existing policy
optimization algorithms, such as static training schedules and the rigid,
uniform clipping mechanism in Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). In this work,
we introduce Adaptive Curriculum Policy Optimization (ACPO), a novel framework
that addresses these challenges through a dual-component adaptive learning
strategy. First, ACPO employs a dynamic curriculum that orchestrates a
principled transition from a stable, near on-policy exploration phase to an
efficient, off-policy exploitation phase by progressively increasing sample
reuse. Second, we propose an Advantage-Aware Adaptive Clipping (AAAC) mechanism
that replaces the fixed clipping hyperparameter with dynamic, sample-wise
bounds modulated by the normalized advantage of each token. This allows for
more granular and robust policy updates, enabling larger gradients for
high-potential samples while safeguarding against destructive ones. We conduct
extensive experiments on a suite of challenging multimodal reasoning
benchmarks, including MathVista, LogicVista, and MMMU-Pro. Results demonstrate
that ACPO consistently outperforms strong baselines such as DAPO and PAPO,
achieving state-of-the-art performance, accelerated convergence, and superior
training stability.

Abstract: In today's interconnected society, social media platforms provide a window
into individuals' thoughts, emotions, and mental states. This paper explores
the use of platforms like Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and Reddit for
depression severity detection. We propose AttentionDep, a domain-aware
attention model that drives explainable depression severity estimation by
fusing contextual and domain knowledge. Posts are encoded hierarchically using
unigrams and bigrams, with attention mechanisms highlighting clinically
relevant tokens. Domain knowledge from a curated mental health knowledge graph
is incorporated through a cross-attention mechanism, enriching the contextual
features. Finally, depression severity is predicted using an ordinal regression
framework that respects the clinical-relevance and natural ordering of severity
levels. Our experiments demonstrate that AttentionDep outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines by over 5% in graded F1 score across datasets, while
providing interpretable insights into its predictions. This work advances the
development of trustworthy and transparent AI systems for mental health
assessment from social media.

Conclusion: 数据增强流水线在多个基准测试中有效，EvolProver超越了所有同等规模的模型，包括基于推理的模型。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) for formal theorem proving have shown
significant promise, yet they often lack generalizability and are fragile to
even minor transformations of problem statements. To address this limitation,
we introduce a novel data augmentation pipeline designed to enhance model
robustness from two perspectives: symmetry and difficulty. From the symmetry
perspective, we propose two complementary methods: EvolAST, an Abstract Syntax
Tree (AST) based approach that targets syntactic symmetry to generate
semantically equivalent problem variants, and EvolDomain, which leverages LLMs
to address semantic symmetry by translating theorems across mathematical
domains. From the difficulty perspective, we propose EvolDifficulty, which uses
carefully designed evolutionary instructions to guide LLMs in generating new
theorems with a wider range of difficulty. We then use the evolved data to
train EvolProver, a 7B-parameter non-reasoning theorem prover. EvolProver
establishes a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) on FormalMATH-Lite with a 53.8%
pass@32 rate, surpassing all models of comparable size, including
reasoning-based models. It also sets new SOTA records for non-reasoning models
on MiniF2F-Test (69.8% pass@32), Ineq-Comp-Seed (52.2% pass@32), and
Ineq-Comp-Transformed (34.0% pass@32). Ablation studies further confirm our
data augmentation pipeline's effectiveness across multiple benchmarks.

TL;DR: 本文提出DDIM反演攻击(DIA)，通过攻击DDIM反演轨迹路径来有效防御恶意图像编辑，超越现有防御方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DDIM反演技术使恶意用户能轻松合成虚假或侵权内容，现有防御方法如AdvDM和Photoguard由于目标与去噪轨迹不匹配，防御效果有限。

Method: 提出DDIM反演攻击(DIA)，直接攻击集成的DDIM轨迹路径，而非单个防御目标。

Result: DIA在多种编辑方法中均能有效破坏扩散过程，性能超越之前的防御方法。

Conclusion: 该框架为行业和研究社区提供了实用的AI恶意使用防御方法。

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown to be strong representation learners, showcasing
state-of-the-art performance across multiple domains. Aside from accelerated
sampling, DDIM also enables the inversion of real images back to their latent
codes. A direct inheriting application of this inversion operation is real
image editing, where the inversion yields latent trajectories to be utilized
during the synthesis of the edited image. Unfortunately, this practical tool
has enabled malicious users to freely synthesize misinformative or deepfake
contents with greater ease, which promotes the spread of unethical and abusive,
as well as privacy-, and copyright-infringing contents. While defensive
algorithms such as AdvDM and Photoguard have been shown to disrupt the
diffusion process on these images, the misalignment between their objectives
and the iterative denoising trajectory at test time results in weak disruptive
performance.In this work, we present the DDIM Inversion Attack (DIA) that
attacks the integrated DDIM trajectory path. Our results support the effective
disruption, surpassing previous defensive methods across various editing
methods. We believe that our frameworks and results can provide practical
defense methods against the malicious use of AI for both the industry and the
research community. Our code is available here:

Method: 创建了10个手工策划且经过领域专家验证的数据集，进行了广泛的基准测试，比较了ChatGPT Agent、化学专用数据提取代理等现有系统，并提出了自己的单代理方法。

Result: 实证发现化学信息提取仍存在持续挑战，特别是在处理领域特定术语、复杂表格和图示表示以及上下文相关歧义方面。

Conclusion: ChemX基准测试是推进化学自动化信息提取的关键资源，挑战了现有方法的泛化能力，并为有效评估策略提供了宝贵见解。

Abstract: The emergence of agent-based systems represents a significant advancement in
artificial intelligence, with growing applications in automated data
extraction. However, chemical information extraction remains a formidable
challenge due to the inherent heterogeneity of chemical data. Current
agent-based approaches, both general-purpose and domain-specific, exhibit
limited performance in this domain. To address this gap, we present ChemX, a
comprehensive collection of 10 manually curated and domain-expert-validated
datasets focusing on nanomaterials and small molecules. These datasets are
designed to rigorously evaluate and enhance automated extraction methodologies
in chemistry. To demonstrate their utility, we conduct an extensive
benchmarking study comparing existing state-of-the-art agentic systems such as
ChatGPT Agent and chemical-specific data extraction agents. Additionally, we
introduce our own single-agent approach that enables precise control over
document preprocessing prior to extraction. We further evaluate the performance
of modern baselines, such as GPT-5 and GPT-5 Thinking, to compare their
capabilities with agentic approaches. Our empirical findings reveal persistent
challenges in chemical information extraction, particularly in processing
domain-specific terminology, complex tabular and schematic representations, and
context-dependent ambiguities. The ChemX benchmark serves as a critical
resource for advancing automated information extraction in chemistry,
challenging the generalization capabilities of existing methods, and providing
valuable insights into effective evaluation strategies.

TL;DR: 本文比较了加权知识库与c-representations两种处理不一致知识库的方法，展示了它们在语义层面的等价性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 比较两种处理不一致知识库的方法：加权知识库和c-representations，探索它们在语义结构上的等价性

Method: 通过分析两种方法的语义结构，证明在特定条件下它们能生成相同的解释排序，并比较它们的推理关系

Result: 证明了在特定条件下，加权知识库和一组可废止条件可以生成相同的解释排序，两种形式在某些推理概念上具有等价表达能力

Conclusion: 研究结果为成本语义和c-representations的进一步工作提供了有益的基础

Abstract: Weighted-knowledge bases and cost-based semantics represent a recent
formalism introduced by Bienvenu et al. for Ontology Mediated Data Querying in
the case where a given knowledge base is inconsistent. This is done by adding a
weight to each statement in the knowledge base (KB), and then giving each DL
interpretation a cost based on how often it breaks rules in the KB. In this
paper we compare this approach with c-representations, a form of non-monotonic
reasoning originally introduced by Kern-Isberner. c-Representations describe a
means to interpret defeasible concept inclusions in the first-order case. This
is done by assigning a numerical ranking to each interpretations via penalties
for each violated conditional. We compare these two approaches on a semantic
level. In particular, we show that under certain conditions a weighted
knowledge base and a set of defeasible conditionals can generate the same
ordering on interpretations, and therefore an equivalence of semantic
structures up to relative cost. Moreover, we compare entailment described in
both cases, where certain notions are equivalently expressible in both
formalisms. Our results have the potential to benefit further work on both
cost-based semantics and c-representations

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种无监督评估分类器的逻辑框架，通过分析分类器之间的一致性和分歧来计算逻辑一致的群体评估结果，并构建了无需知识的警报系统来检测LLM评委是否违反用户设定的最低评分阈值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当专家意见不一致时，我们可以确定他们不可能都100%正确；但当他们完全一致时，无法排除任何可能的评估结果。这种一致性与分歧在效用上的不对称性激发了本文对分类器无监督评估逻辑的研究。

Method: 将分类器对齐决策的统计摘要作为线性规划问题的输入，在整数空间中计算可能的正确或错误响应。使用逻辑约束（如正确响应数不能超过观察到的响应数）作为不等式，并应用适用于所有有限测试的普遍线性等式公理。

Result: 开发了基于纯逻辑一致性的无监督评估方法，构建了无需知识的警报系统，能够检测LLM评委是否违反用户指定的最低评分阈值。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了仅使用逻辑一致性进行无监督评估的实际效用，为分类器评估提供了一种无需真实标签的可行方案。

Abstract: If two experts disagree on a test, we may conclude both cannot be 100 per
cent correct. But if they completely agree, no possible evaluation can be
excluded. This asymmetry in the utility of agreements versus disagreements is
explored here by formalizing a logic of unsupervised evaluation for
classifiers. Its core problem is computing the set of group evaluations that
are logically consistent with how we observe them agreeing and disagreeing in
their decisions. Statistical summaries of their aligned decisions are inputs
into a Linear Programming problem in the integer space of possible correct or
incorrect responses given true labels. Obvious logical constraints, such as,
the number of correct responses cannot exceed the number of observed responses,
are inequalities. But in addition, there are axioms, universally applicable
linear equalities that apply to all finite tests. The practical and immediate
utility of this approach to unsupervised evaluation using only logical
consistency is demonstrated by building no-knowledge alarms that can detect
when one or more LLMs-as-Judges are violating a minimum grading threshold
specified by the user.

Motivation: 随着分布式能源资源特别是可再生能源的集成增加，传统基于固定阈值的保护方案无法在动态条件下可靠识别和定位短路故障，而机器学习提供了有前景的替代方案，但缺乏系统性的模型和设置基准。

Method: 使用电压和电流波形数据，将其分割为10毫秒到50毫秒的滑动窗口，在现实的实时约束下评估经典机器学习模型，评估指标包括准确性、对窗口大小的鲁棒性和运行时效率。

Conclusion: 机器学习模型在电力系统保护的故障分类和故障定位任务中表现出色，能够满足实时处理要求，为复杂电网条件下的保护方案提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The increasing integration of distributed energy resources (DERs),
particularly renewables, poses significant challenges for power system
protection, with fault classification (FC) and fault localization (FL) being
among the most critical tasks. Conventional protection schemes, based on fixed
thresholds, cannot reliably identify and localize short circuits with the
increasing complexity of the grid under dynamic conditions. Machine learning
(ML) offers a promising alternative; however, systematic benchmarks across
models and settings remain limited. This work presents, for the first time, a
comparative benchmarking study of classical ML models for FC and FL in power
system protection based on EMT data. Using voltage and current waveforms
segmented into sliding windows of 10 ms to 50 ms, we evaluate models under
realistic real-time constraints. Performance is assessed in terms of accuracy,
robustness to window size, and runtime efficiency. The best-performing FC model
achieved an F1 score of 0.992$\pm$0.001, while the top FL model reached an R2
of 0.806$\pm$0.008 with a mean processing time of 0.563 ms.

Motivation: 加密货币市场中泵与转储操纵事件稀缺导致严重的类别不平衡问题，阻碍了准确的操纵行为检测。

Method: 应用合成少数类过采样技术(SMOTE)处理数据不平衡，并评估先进的集成学习模型来区分操纵交易行为与正常市场活动。

Result: SMOTE显著提高了所有模型检测泵与转储事件的能力，XGBoost和LightGBM分别达到94.87%和93.59%的高召回率，并表现出强大的F1分数和快速计算性能。

Conclusion: 将数据平衡技术与集成方法相结合，显著改善了操纵活动的早期检测能力，有助于建立更公平、透明和稳定的加密货币市场。

Abstract: This study aims to detect pump and dump (P&D) manipulation in cryptocurrency
markets, where the scarcity of such events causes severe class imbalance and
hinders accurate detection. To address this issue, the Synthetic Minority
Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) was applied, and advanced ensemble learning
models were evaluated to distinguish manipulative trading behavior from normal
market activity. The experimental results show that applying SMOTE greatly
enhanced the ability of all models to detect P&D events by increasing recall
and improving the overall balance between precision and recall. In particular,
XGBoost and LightGBM achieved high recall rates (94.87% and 93.59%,
respectively) with strong F1-scores and demonstrated fast computational
performance, making them suitable for near real time surveillance. These
findings indicate that integrating data balancing techniques with ensemble
methods significantly improves the early detection of manipulative activities,
contributing to a fairer, more transparent, and more stable cryptocurrency
market.

Result: 在模型路由和基准测试准确率预测任务上实现了最先进的性能，分析验证了学习到的参数能够编码有意义、可解释的模型能力和查询特征信息。

Conclusion: 该方法成功学习了紧凑且可解释的LLM能力表示，为高效管理大规模语言模型资源提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed a surge in the number of large language models
(LLMs), yet efficiently managing and utilizing these vast resources remains a
significant challenge. In this work, we explore how to learn compact
representations of LLM abilities that can facilitate downstream tasks, such as
model routing and performance prediction on new benchmarks. We frame this
problem as estimating the probability that a given model will correctly answer
a specific query. Inspired by the item response theory (IRT) in psychometrics,
we model this probability as a function of three key factors: (i) the model's
multi-skill ability vector, (2) the query's discrimination vector that
separates models of differing skills, and (3) the query's difficulty scalar. To
learn these parameters jointly, we introduce a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) network
that couples model- and query-level embeddings. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our approach leads to state-of-the-art performance in both
model routing and benchmark accuracy prediction. Moreover, analysis validates
that the learned parameters encode meaningful, interpretable information about
model capabilities and query characteristics.

Result: 在真实和合成数据上的评估表明，AIDE能有效识别数据转换和模型，发现有趣的数据模式。

Conclusion: AIDE为自动化知识发现提供了坚实基础，其可扩展框架允许未来集成更多模式提取策略和领域知识。

Abstract: Organizations are increasingly focused on leveraging data from their
processes to gain insights and drive decision-making. However, converting this
data into actionable knowledge remains a difficult and time-consuming task.
There is often a gap between the volume of data collected and the ability to
process and understand it, which automated knowledge discovery aims to fill.
Automated knowledge discovery involves complex open problems, including
effectively navigating data, building models to extract implicit relationships,
and considering subjective goals and knowledge. In this paper, we introduce a
novel method for Automated Insights and Data Exploration (AIDE), that serves as
a robust foundation for tackling these challenges through the use of Monte
Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). We evaluate AIDE using both real-world and synthetic
data, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying data transformations and
models that uncover interesting data patterns. Among its strengths, AIDE's
MCTS-based framework offers significant extensibility, allowing for future
integration of additional pattern extraction strategies and domain knowledge.
This makes AIDE a valuable step towards developing a comprehensive solution for
automated knowledge discovery.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了FusionAdapter方法，用于多模态知识图谱中的少样本关系学习，通过适配器模块和融合策略有效整合多模态信息，在低资源设置下优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MMKG方法主要将多模态对齐到共享空间，忽视了特定模态的独特贡献，在低资源设置下性能受限。

Method: 引入适配器模块使各模态能够高效适应未见关系，采用融合策略整合多模态实体表示同时保留模态特定特征。

Result: 在两个基准MMKG数据集上的广泛实验表明，FusionAdapter优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: 通过有效适应和融合多模态信息，FusionAdapter在最小监督下提高了对新型关系的泛化能力。

Abstract: Multimodal Knowledge Graphs (MMKGs) incorporate various modalities, including
text and images, to enhance entity and relation representations. Notably,
different modalities for the same entity often present complementary and
diverse information. However, existing MMKG methods primarily align modalities
into a shared space, which tends to overlook the distinct contributions of
specific modalities, limiting their performance particularly in low-resource
settings. To address this challenge, we propose FusionAdapter for the learning
of few-shot relationships (FSRL) in MMKG. FusionAdapter introduces (1) an
adapter module that enables efficient adaptation of each modality to unseen
relations and (2) a fusion strategy that integrates multimodal entity
representations while preserving diverse modality-specific characteristics. By
effectively adapting and fusing information from diverse modalities,
FusionAdapter improves generalization to novel relations with minimal
supervision. Extensive experiments on two benchmark MMKG datasets demonstrate
that FusionAdapter achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 本文提出了DAIL算法，通过LLM引导的进化框架自动发现数据驱动的奖励分配函数，相比传统人工设计的对抗模仿学习方法具有更好的稳定性和泛化性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对抗模仿学习(AIL)方法中，奖励分配函数主要基于人工设计的散度最小化目标，其作用对训练动态和最终策略性能的影响被忽视。本文旨在探索数据驱动的奖励分配函数发现方法。

Method: 采用LLM引导的进化框架，在奖励分配函数空间中进行高效探索，自动发现基于模仿策略性能的奖励分配函数，提出了首个元学习的AIL算法DAIL。

Result: DAIL在未见过的环境和策略优化算法上展现出良好的泛化能力，超越了当前最先进的人工设计基线方法，并实现了更稳定的训练过程。

Conclusion: DAIL通过自动发现的奖励分配函数显著提升了对抗模仿学习的稳定性和性能，为理解奖励分配函数在AIL稳定性中的作用提供了新的见解。

Abstract: Adversarial Imitation Learning (AIL) methods, while effective in settings
with limited expert demonstrations, are often considered unstable. These
approaches typically decompose into two components: Density Ratio (DR)
estimation $\frac{\rho_E}{\rho_{\pi}}$, where a discriminator estimates the
relative occupancy of state-action pairs under the policy versus the expert;
and Reward Assignment (RA), where this ratio is transformed into a reward
signal used to train the policy. While significant research has focused on
improving density estimation, the role of reward assignment in influencing
training dynamics and final policy performance has been largely overlooked. RA
functions in AIL are typically derived from divergence minimization objectives,
relying heavily on human design and ingenuity. In this work, we take a
different approach: we investigate the discovery of data-driven RA functions,
i.e, based directly on the performance of the resulting imitation policy. To
this end, we leverage an LLM-guided evolutionary framework that efficiently
explores the space of RA functions, yielding \emph{Discovered Adversarial
Imitation Learning} (DAIL), the first meta-learnt AIL algorithm. Remarkably,
DAIL generalises across unseen environments and policy optimization algorithms,
outperforming the current state-of-the-art of \emph{human-designed} baselines.
Finally, we analyse why DAIL leads to more stable training, offering novel
insights into the role of RA functions in the stability of AIL. Code is
publicly available: https://github.com/shshnkreddy/DAIL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于深度学习的分离方法生成的切割数量不足，因为模型对生成多样化子集的敏感性不够，需要提升切割生成的多样性和质量。

Method: 引入随机边选择替代贪心图粗化方法，并提出GraphCHiP算法，利用粗化历史识别RCIs和FCIs。

Conclusion: 测试时搜索与随机性结合能显著提升训练模型在推理时的性能，为CVRP切割平面方法提供了更有效的分离策略。

Abstract: The identification of valid inequalities, such as the rounded capacity
inequalities (RCIs), is a key component of cutting plane methods for the
Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). While a deep learning-based
separation method can learn to find high-quality cuts, our analysis reveals
that the model produces fewer cuts than expected because it is insufficiently
sensitive to generate a diverse set of generated subsets. This paper proposes
an alternative: enhancing the performance of a trained model at inference time
through a new test-time search with stochasticity. First, we introduce
stochastic edge selection into the graph coarsening procedure, replacing the
previously proposed greedy approach. Second, we propose the Graph Coarsening
History-based Partitioning (GraphCHiP) algorithm, which leverages coarsening
history to identify not only RCIs but also, for the first time, the Framed
capacity inequalities (FCIs). Experiments on randomly generated CVRP instances
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in reducing the dual gap compared
to the existing neural separation method. Additionally, our method discovers
effective FCIs on a specific instance, despite the challenging nature of
identifying such cuts.

Abstract: Designing and optimizing task-specific quantum circuits are crucial to
leverage the advantage of quantum computing. Recent large language model
(LLM)-based quantum circuit generation has emerged as a promising automatic
solution. However, the fundamental challenges remain unaddressed: (i)
parameterized quantum gates require precise numerical values for optimal
performance, which also depend on multiple aspects, including the number of
quantum gates, their parameters, and the layout/depth of the circuits. (ii)
LLMs often generate low-quality or incorrect quantum circuits due to the lack
of quantum domain-specific knowledge. We propose QUASAR, an agentic
reinforcement learning (RL) framework for quantum circuits generation and
optimization based on tool-augmented LLMs. To align the LLM with
quantum-specific knowledge and improve the generated quantum circuits, QUASAR
designs (i) a quantum circuit verification approach with external quantum
simulators and (ii) a sophisticated hierarchical reward mechanism in RL
training. Extensive evaluation shows improvements in both syntax and semantic
performance of the generated quantum circuits. When augmenting a 4B LLM, QUASAR
has achieved the validity of 99.31% in Pass@1 and 100% in Pass@10,
outperforming industrial LLMs of GPT-4o, GPT-5 and DeepSeek-V3 and several
supervised-fine-tuning (SFT)-only and RL-only baselines.

Abstract: Rare-disease diagnosis remains one of the most pressing challenges in digital
health, hindered by extreme data scarcity, privacy concerns, and the limited
resources of edge devices. This paper proposes the Adaptive Federated Few-Shot
Rare-Disease Diagnosis (AFFR) framework, which integrates three pillars: (i)
few-shot federated optimization with meta-learning to generalize from limited
patient samples, (ii) energy-aware client scheduling to mitigate device
dropouts and ensure balanced participation, and (iii) secure aggregation with
calibrated differential privacy to safeguard sensitive model updates. Unlike
prior work that addresses these aspects in isolation, AFFR unifies them into a
modular pipeline deployable on real-world clinical networks. Experimental
evaluation on simulated rare-disease detection datasets demonstrates up to 10%
improvement in accuracy compared with baseline FL, while reducing client
dropouts by over 50% without degrading convergence. Furthermore,
privacy-utility trade-offs remain within clinically acceptable bounds. These
findings highlight AFFR as a practical pathway for equitable and trustworthy
federated diagnosis of rare conditions.

Abstract: This paper presents a practical architecture for after-sales demand
forecasting and monitoring that unifies a revenue- and cluster-aware ensemble
of statistical, machine-learning, and deep-learning models with a role-driven
analytics layer for scorecards and trend diagnostics. The framework ingests
exogenous signals (installed base, pricing, macro indicators, life cycle,
seasonality) and treats COVID-19 as a distinct regime, producing country-part
forecasts with calibrated intervals. A Pareto-aware segmentation forecasts
high-revenue items individually and pools the long tail via clusters, while
horizon-aware ensembling aligns weights with business-relevant losses (e.g.,
WMAPE). Beyond forecasts, a performance scorecard delivers decision-focused
insights: accuracy within tolerance thresholds by revenue share and count, bias
decomposition (over- vs under-forecast), geographic and product-family
hotspots, and ranked root causes tied to high-impact part-country pairs. A
trend module tracks trajectories of MAPE/WMAPE and bias across recent months,
flags entities that are improving or deteriorating, detects change points
aligned with known regimes, and attributes movements to lifecycle and seasonal
factors. LLMs are embedded in the analytics layer to generate role-aware
narratives and enforce reporting contracts. They standardize business
definitions, automate quality checks and reconciliations, and translate
quantitative results into concise, explainable summaries for planners and
executives. The system exposes a reproducible workflow -- request
specification, model execution, database-backed artifacts, and AI-generated
narratives -- so planners can move from "How accurate are we now?" to "Where is
accuracy heading and which levers should we pull?", closing the loop between
forecasting, monitoring, and inventory decisions across more than 90 countries
and about 6,000 parts.

Result: 发现不同特征形成圆、线、簇等几何结构；这些结构反映概念属性、跨模型稳定、支持推理、随上下文动态重塑。

Conclusion: 特征流形在语言模型中具有功能性作用，支持基于实体的推理模型，语言模型编码和转换结构化表示。

Abstract: The linear representation hypothesis states that language models (LMs) encode
concepts as directions in their latent space, forming organized,
multidimensional manifolds. Prior efforts focus on discovering specific
geometries for specific features, and thus lack generalization. We introduce
Supervised Multi-Dimensional Scaling (SMDS), a model-agnostic method to
automatically discover feature manifolds. We apply SMDS to temporal reasoning
as a case study, finding that different features form various geometric
structures such as circles, lines, and clusters. SMDS reveals many insights on
these structures: they consistently reflect the properties of the concepts they
represent; are stable across model families and sizes; actively support
reasoning in models; and dynamically reshape in response to context changes.
Together, our findings shed light on the functional role of feature manifolds,
supporting a model of entity-based reasoning in which LMs encode and transform
structured representations.

*Zach Studdiford,Timothy T. Rogers,Kushin Mukherjee,Siddharth Suresh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究评估了70多个不同架构的大语言模型在概念表示上与人类的对齐程度，发现指令微调和注意力头维度是影响人类对齐的关键因素，而多模态预训练和参数规模影响有限。现有基准测试无法充分捕捉人类-AI对齐度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型在计算要素上存在多样性，但尚不清楚哪些要素对构建具有人类类似表示能力的模型最为关键。同时，现有基准测试不适合衡量人类与模型之间的表示对齐度。

Method: 使用认知科学中成熟的三元组相似性任务，基于THINGS数据库的概念，评估了70多个在架构、微调方法和训练数据等方面差异显著的模型，比较人类和模型的表示对齐度。

Result: 经过指令微调的模型和具有更大注意力头维度的模型与人类表示最为对齐；多模态预训练和参数规模对对齐度影响有限；现有基准测试中MMLU比MUSR更适合捕捉表示对齐，但都无法完全解释对齐度方差。

Conclusion: 指令微调和注意力头维度是推动大语言模型成为人类概念表示模型的关键计算要素，同时填补了LLM评估中的基准测试空白。

Abstract: The ability to translate diverse patterns of inputs into structured patterns
of behavior has been thought to rest on both humans' and machines' ability to
learn robust representations of relevant concepts. The rapid advancement of
transformer-based large language models (LLMs) has led to a diversity of
computational ingredients -- architectures, fine tuning methods, and training
datasets among others -- but it remains unclear which of these ingredients are
most crucial for building models that develop human-like representations.
Further, most current LLM benchmarks are not suited to measuring
representational alignment between humans and models, making benchmark scores
unreliable for assessing if current LLMs are making progress towards becoming
useful cognitive models. We address these limitations by first evaluating a set
of over 70 models that widely vary in their computational ingredients on a
triplet similarity task, a method well established in the cognitive sciences
for measuring human conceptual representations, using concepts from the THINGS
database. Comparing human and model representations, we find that models that
undergo instruction-finetuning and which have larger dimensionality of
attention heads are among the most human aligned, while multimodal pretraining
and parameter size have limited bearing on alignment. Correlations between
alignment scores and scores on existing benchmarks reveal that while some
benchmarks (e.g., MMLU) are better suited than others (e.g., MUSR) for
capturing representational alignment, no existing benchmark is capable of fully
accounting for the variance of alignment scores, demonstrating their
insufficiency in capturing human-AI alignment. Taken together, our findings
help highlight the computational ingredients most essential for advancing LLMs
towards models of human conceptual representation and address a key
benchmarking gap in LLM evaluation.

*Akchunya Chanchal,David A. Kelly,Hana Chockler*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的前向传播范式Activation-Deactivation (AD)，通过关闭与遮挡部分对应的模型部分来消除遮挡输入特征对模型决策的影响，解决了传统黑盒解释方法因遮挡导致分布外图像的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统黑盒解释方法依赖遮挡输入部分来生成解释，这会导致分布外图像，影响解释质量。同时，选择合适的遮挡值需要领域知识，限制了方法的实用性。

Method: 提出了ConvAD机制，可以轻松添加到任何训练好的卷积神经网络中，实现AD范式。该方法通过关闭与遮挡区域对应的模型部分，而不是直接遮挡输入，避免了分布外问题。

Result: 实验表明，AD解释在多个数据集和模型架构上相比传统遮挡方法，鲁棒性提高了高达62.5%，且不需要领域知识来选择遮挡值。

Conclusion: ConvAD机制能够在不改变网络决策过程的情况下，提供更鲁棒的解释，解决了传统遮挡方法的关键限制。

Abstract: Black-box explainability methods are popular tools for explaining the
decisions of image classifiers. A major drawback of these tools is their
reliance on mutants obtained by occluding parts of the input, leading to
out-of-distribution images. This raises doubts about the quality of the
explanations. Moreover, choosing an appropriate occlusion value often requires
domain knowledge. In this paper we introduce a novel forward-pass paradigm
Activation-Deactivation (AD), which removes the effects of occluded input
features from the model's decision-making by switching off the parts of the
model that correspond to the occlusions. We introduce ConvAD, a drop-in
mechanism that can be easily added to any trained Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN), and which implements the AD paradigm. This leads to more robust
explanations without any additional training or fine-tuning. We prove that the
ConvAD mechanism does not change the decision-making process of the network. We
provide experimental evaluation across several datasets and model
architectures. We compare the quality of AD-explanations with explanations
achieved using a set of masking values, using the proxies of robustness, size,
and confidence drop-off. We observe a consistent improvement in robustness of
AD explanations (up to 62.5%) compared to explanations obtained with
occlusions, demonstrating that ConvAD extracts more robust explanations without
the need for domain knowledge.

TL;DR: 提出基于Curry-Howard对应的理论框架，将CoT推理过程映射为形式化证明结构，通过类型检查验证推理的忠实性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决CoT提示生成推理过程的忠实性问题，提升模型可解释性和可靠性。

Method: 利用Curry-Howard对应关系，将自然语言推理步骤映射为形式化类型证明结构，通过类型检查验证推理的忠实性。

Result: 成功将CoT推理轨迹转换为良好类型的证明，为计算忠实性提供可验证证书。

Conclusion: 该框架将可信的叙述性解释转化为可形式验证的程序，为构建更可靠和可信的AI系统提供路径。

Abstract: While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting enhances the reasoning capabilities of
large language models, the faithfulness of the generated rationales remains an
open problem for model interpretability. We propose a novel theoretical lens
for this problem grounded in the Curry-Howard correspondence, which posits a
direct relationship between formal proofs and computer programs. Under this
paradigm, a faithful reasoning trace is analogous to a well-typed program,
where each intermediate step corresponds to a typed logical inference. We
operationalise this analogy, presenting methods to extract and map the
informal, natural language steps of CoT into a formal, typed proof structure.
Successfully converting a CoT trace into a well-typed proof serves as a strong,
verifiable certificate of its computational faithfulness, moving beyond
heuristic interpretability towards formal verification. Our framework provides
a methodology to transform plausible narrative explanations into formally
verifiable programs, offering a path towards building more reliable and
trustworthy AI systems.

TL;DR: SIRL方法利用LLM内部的安全信念，将拒绝有害请求时的高置信度转化为自我奖励信号，无需外部验证器即可实现有效的安全对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏通用标准和可靠的内容验证器，确保LLM安全面临挑战，难以获得有效的训练信号。研究发现对齐模型已具备强大的内部安全信念。

Method: 提出SIRL方法，将模型内部的安全置信度转化为自我生成的奖励信号，通过强化低熵拒绝行为来教导模型信任其安全本能。

Result: 在Llama和Qwen模型上评估，SIRL对20+种越狱方法保持89%+的防御成功率，仅使用15,000个未标记提示即可超越资源密集的监督方法。

Conclusion: 有效的对齐可以从模型内部产生，为无需大量人工监督的自主、可扩展AI安全机制开辟了道路。

Abstract: Ensuring Large Language Model (LLM) safety remains challenging due to the
absence of universal standards and reliable content validators, making it
difficult to obtain effective training signals. We discover that aligned models
already possess robust internal safety beliefs: they consistently produce
high-confidence refusals to harmful requests while exhibiting high entropy when
generating potentially dangerous content. This entropy gap reveals an untapped
signal--models intrinsically "know" when to refuse. We introduce Safety
Instincts Reinforcement Learning (SIRL), which transforms this internal
confidence into a self-generated reward signal, eliminating dependence on
external validators or human annotations. SIRL teaches models to trust their
safety instincts by reinforcing low-entropy refusal behaviors. Evaluated on
Llama and Qwen models, SIRL maintains 89%+ Defense Success Rates (DSRs) against
20+ jailbreak methods, from static prompts to adaptive attacks. Using only
15,000 unlabeled prompts, SIRL surpasses resource-intensive supervised methods
while preserving performance on mathematics, coding, and conversation
benchmarks. Our work demonstrates that effective alignment can emerge from
within, paving the way for more autonomous and robust AI safety mechanisms that
scale without extensive human oversight.

TL;DR: 提出一个双层人本生产规划框架，结合约束规划和强化学习优化工业制造中的运营效率和劳动力公平性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统生产规划中忽视工人偏好、经验和医疗约束等问题，实现运营效率与劳动力公平的平衡

Method: 第一层使用约束编程(CP)进行订单-产线分配，第二层使用马尔可夫决策过程(MDP)进行工人-产线分配，比较贪婪分配、MCTS和RL三种策略

Result: CP调度产生紧凑可行的生产计划，MDP工人分配显著提高公平性和偏好对齐，领域专家评价有效

Conclusion: CP与学习型决策结合为人本生产规划提供了稳健方法，能同时优化吞吐量和劳动力福祉

Abstract: This work presents a two-layer, human-centric production planning framework
designed to optimize both operational efficiency and workforce fairness in
industrial manufacturing. The first layer formulates the Order-Line allocation
as a Constraint Programming (CP) problem, generating high-utilization
production schedules that respect machine capacities, processing times, and due
dates. The second layer models Worker-Line allocation as a Markov Decision
Process (MDP), integrating human factors such as worker preference, experience,
resilience, and medical constraints into the assignment process. Three solution
strategies, greedy allocation, MCTS, and RL, are implemented and compared
across multiple evaluation scenarios. The proposed system is validated through
16 test sessions with domain experts from the automotive industry, combining
quantitative key performance indicators (KPIs) with expert ratings. Results
indicate that the CP-based scheduling approach produces compact, feasible
production plans with low tardiness, while the MDP-based worker allocation
significantly improves fairness and preference alignment compared to baseline
approaches. Domain experts rated both the Order-Line and Worker-Line components
as effective and highlighted opportunities to further refine the objective
function to penalize excessive earliness and improve continuity in worker
assignments. Overall, the findings demonstrate that combining CP with
learning-based decision-making provides a robust approach for human-centric
production planning. The approach enables simultaneous optimization of
throughput and workforce well-being, offering a practical foundation for fair
and efficient manufacturing scheduling in industrial settings.

TL;DR: PRISM-Consult是一个临床医生对齐的专家小组架构，将紧凑的PRISM序列模型扩展为路由的领域专家家族，通过轻量级路由器将急诊病例分派给不同专科模型，实现参数效率和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决急诊科大规模咨询场景下，如何在保证安全性的同时实现低延迟、可审计的临床决策支持，避免常见事件主导模型性能的问题。

Method: 采用专家小组架构，将临床事件结构化标记化，通过轻量级路由器读取前几个标记并分派给心脏血管、肺部、胃肠食管、肌肉骨骼、心理源性等专科模型，每个专科继承PRISM的小型transformer骨干和标记模板。

Result: 在真实急诊科队列中，专科模型在各领域表现出平滑收敛和低开发困惑度，路由器在安全优先策略下实现高质量路由和显著计算节省，相比全咨询方案有较大优势。

Conclusion: 该框架为安全、可审计、低延迟的大规模咨询提供了实用路径，并通过外部/时间复制、非对称生命威胁阈值和多标签仲裁等验证步骤满足前瞻性临床部署标准。

Abstract: We present PRISM-Consult, a clinician-aligned panel-of-experts architecture
that extends the compact PRISM sequence model into a routed family of domain
specialists. Episodes are tokenized as structured clinical events; a
light-weight router reads the first few tokens and dispatches to specialist
models (Cardiac-Vascular, Pulmonary, Gastro-Oesophageal, Musculoskeletal,
Psychogenic). Each specialist inherits PRISM's small transformer backbone and
token template, enabling parameter efficiency and interpretability. On
real-world Emergency Department cohorts, specialists exhibit smooth convergence
with low development perplexities across domains, while the router achieves
high routing quality and large compute savings versus consult-all under a
safety-first policy. We detail the data methodology (initial vs. conclusive
ICD-9 families), routing thresholds and calibration, and report per-domain
results to avoid dominance by common events. The framework provides a practical
path to safe, auditable, and low-latency consult at scale, and we outline
validation steps-external/temporal replication, asymmetric life-threat
thresholds, and multi-label arbitration-to meet prospective clinical deployment
standards.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG方法简化了复杂关系，专业模型成本高且静态，无法有效处理金融风险中的多模态、网络原生数据。

Method: 将供应链网络视为知识图谱，使用网络中心性指导图遍历提取关键风险路径，结合数值因子表和新闻流数据，通过上下文模板将定量数据转换为LLM可理解的自然语言。

Result: 开发出轻量级框架，无需昂贵微调或专用图数据库，即可实时生成简洁、可解释且上下文丰富的风险叙述。

Conclusion: 该LLM中心化智能体框架成功解决了金融风险分析中的多模态数据挑战，提供了一种高效、可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with the complex, multi-modal, and
network-native data underlying financial risk. Standard Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) oversimplifies relationships, while specialist models are
costly and static. We address this gap with an LLM-centric agent framework for
supply chain risk analysis. Our core contribution is to exploit the inherent
duality between networks and knowledge graphs (KG). We treat the supply chain
network as a KG, allowing us to use structural network science principles for
retrieval. A graph traverser, guided by network centrality scores, efficiently
extracts the most economically salient risk paths. An agentic architecture
orchestrates this graph retrieval alongside data from numerical factor tables
and news streams. Crucially, it employs novel ``context shells'' -- descriptive
templates that embed raw figures in natural language -- to make quantitative
data fully intelligible to the LLM. This lightweight approach enables the model
to generate concise, explainable, and context-rich risk narratives in real-time
without costly fine-tuning or a dedicated graph database.

Motivation: 证明通过精心设计的训练方法而非单纯扩大规模，可以在有限计算资源下实现前沿水平的多模态推理能力，使更多组织能够使用先进模型。

Method: 采用渐进式三阶段方法：1)深度扩展推理能力；2)分阶段持续预训练，包括基础文本视觉理解和针对性合成数据增强；3)高质量文本监督微调。

Result: 在Artificial Analysis Intelligence Index上获得52分，与DeepSeek-R1-0528相当；在10个图像基准测试中，性能平均比Gemini-2.5-Flash和Claude Sonnet-3.7低5分以内。

Abstract: We present Apriel-1.5-15B-Thinker, a 15-billion parameter open-weights
multimodal reasoning model that achieves frontier-level performance through
training design rather than sheer scale. Starting from Pixtral-12B, we apply a
progressive three-stage methodology: (1) depth upscaling to expand reasoning
capacity without pretraining from scratch, (2) staged continual pre-training
that first develops foundational text and vision understanding, then enhances
visual reasoning through targeted synthetic data generation addressing spatial
structure, compositional understanding, and fine-grained perception, and (3)
high-quality text-only supervised fine-tuning on curated instruction-response
pairs with explicit reasoning traces spanning mathematics, coding, science, and
tool use. Notably, our model achieves competitive results without reinforcement
learning or preference optimization, isolating the contribution of our
data-centric continual pre-training approach. On the Artificial Analysis
Intelligence Index, Apriel-1.5-15B-Thinker attains a score of 52, matching
DeepSeek-R1-0528 despite requiring significantly fewer computational resources.
Across ten image benchmarks, its performance is on average within five points
of Gemini-2.5-Flash and Claude Sonnet-3.7, a key achievement for a model
operating within single-GPU deployment constraints. Our results demonstrate
that thoughtful mid-training 2 design can close substantial capability gaps
without massive scale, making frontier-level multimodal reasoning accessible to
organizations with limited infrastructure. We release the model checkpoint, all
training recipes, and evaluation protocols under the MIT license to to advance
open-source research.

TL;DR: Bridge方法通过重新思考批量LLM隐藏状态作为整体张量而非独立切片，在并行LLM推理中生成相互依赖的响应，仅需少量新参数即可显著提升响应质量和一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统并行LLM推理中，N个并行响应通常相互独立生成，这导致计算资源分配不均且无法充分利用其他生成中的有用信息，与响应长度扩展形成对比。

Method: 提出Bridge方法，将批量LLM隐藏状态视为整体张量而非独立切片，仅需添加少量新参数（2.8%-5.1%），使并行响应生成相互依赖。

Result: Bridge将可验证奖励强化学习的相对平均准确率提升高达50%，并提高了正确响应的一致性。训练一次即可扩展到任何生成宽度，性能始终优于独立生成。

Conclusion: Bridge解锁了一种更通用的并行扩展模式，有效利用序列间信息，兼容任何后生成聚合技术。

Abstract: Parallel LLM inference scaling involves sampling a set of $N>1$ responses for
a single input prompt. However, these $N$ parallel responses tend to be
generated independently from each other, partitioning compute resources and
leaving potentially useful information in one generation untapped by others.
This is in contrast to response length scaling where past computation is used
in all future steps. For higher quality responses and response sets, we propose
Bridge to generate interdependent responses in parallel by rethinking batched
LLM hidden states as holistic tensors rather than independent slices. With only
a small amount (2.8%-5.1%) of new parameters, Bridge improves the relative mean
accuracy gains from reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards by up to 50%
and boosts consistency of correct responses. Trained once, Bridge scales to any
generation width, all with greater performance than independent generations,
unlocking a more general mode of parallel scaling that effectively leverages
information between sequences, compatible with any post-generation aggregation
technique.

TL;DR: AutoPK是一个两阶段框架，用于从复杂科学表格中准确提取药代动力学数据，结合LLM和混合相似性度量，显著提升提取精度和召回率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 药代动力学数据通常嵌入在结构复杂、术语不一致的表格中，难以自动化提取和标准化，影响药物开发和监管决策。

Method: 第一阶段使用LLM识别PK参数变体，结合混合相似性度量和LLM验证；第二阶段过滤相关行，将表格转换为键值文本格式，并用LLM重构标准化表格。

Result: 在605个真实PK表格上评估，AutoPK显著优于直接使用LLM的基线方法。使用LLaMA 3.1-70B时，半衰期和清除率的F1分数分别达到0.92和0.91。开源模型Gemma 3-27B在多个PK参数上甚至超过GPT-4o Mini。

Conclusion: AutoPK实现了可扩展、高置信度的PK数据提取，适用于兽医药理学、药物安全监测和公共卫生决策等关键应用，并能处理异构表格结构和术语。

Abstract: Pharmacokinetics (PK) plays a critical role in drug development and
regulatory decision-making for human and veterinary medicine, directly
affecting public health through drug safety and efficacy assessments. However,
PK data are often embedded in complex, heterogeneous tables with variable
structures and inconsistent terminologies, posing significant challenges for
automated PK data retrieval and standardization. AutoPK, a novel two-stage
framework for accurate and scalable extraction of PK data from complex
scientific tables. In the first stage, AutoPK identifies and extracts PK
parameter variants using large language models (LLMs), a hybrid similarity
metric, and LLM-based validation. The second stage filters relevant rows,
converts the table into a key-value text format, and uses an LLM to reconstruct
a standardized table. Evaluated on a real-world dataset of 605 PK tables,
including captions and footnotes, AutoPK shows significant improvements in
precision and recall over direct LLM baselines. For instance, AutoPK with LLaMA
3.1-70B achieved an F1-score of 0.92 on half-life and 0.91 on clearance
parameters, outperforming direct use of LLaMA 3.1-70B by margins of 0.10 and
0.21, respectively. Smaller models such as Gemma 3-27B and Phi 3-12B with
AutoPK achieved 2-7 fold F1 gains over their direct use, with Gemma's
hallucination rates reduced from 60-95% down to 8-14%. Notably, AutoPK enabled
open-source models like Gemma 3-27B to outperform commercial systems such as
GPT-4o Mini on several PK parameters. AutoPK enables scalable and
high-confidence PK data extraction, making it well-suited for critical
applications in veterinary pharmacology, drug safety monitoring, and public
health decision-making, while addressing heterogeneous table structures and
terminology and demonstrating generalizability across key PK parameters. Code

Method: 通过系统文献综述开发分类法，将100多个指标和KPI组织到平衡计分卡框架的四个子集群（基础性、情境性、解析性和专业性）中。

Result: 创建了一个综合分类法，将数据质量定位为平衡计分卡各视角（财务、客户、内部流程、学习与成长）的战略连接器，展示了质量指标如何支撑估值准确性、客户信任、运营效率和创新能力。

Conclusion: 该框架的互连"指标层"确保一个维度的改进会级联到其他维度，最大化战略影响，为从业者、数据管理者和战略家提供了将数据质量管理与可持续价值创造对齐的工具。

Abstract: This chapter presents a comprehensive taxonomy for assessing data quality in
the context of data monetisation, developed through a systematic literature
review. Organising over one hundred metrics and Key Performance Indicators
(KPIs) into four subclusters (Fundamental, Contextual, Resolution, and
Specialised) within the Balanced Scorecard (BSC) framework, the taxonomy
integrates both universal and domain-specific quality dimensions. By
positioning data quality as a strategic connector across the BSC's Financial,
Customer, Internal Processes, and Learning & Growth perspectives, it
demonstrates how quality metrics underpin valuation accuracy, customer trust,
operational efficiency, and innovation capacity. The framework's interconnected
"metrics layer" ensures that improvements in one dimension cascade into others,
maximising strategic impact. This holistic approach bridges the gap between
granular technical assessment and high-level decision-making, offering
practitioners, data stewards, and strategists a scalable, evidence-based
reference for aligning data quality management with sustainable value creation.

Motivation: 当前临床预测模型依赖从电子病历中提取的结构化数据，但这一过程仍由硬编码、特定于数据库的流水线主导，限制了可扩展性、可重现性和跨机构泛化能力。

Method: 开发了基于智能体的框架，通过交互式查询数据库来自动化队列选择、特征提取和代码映射。模块化智能体迭代观察查询结果，基于模式和文档进行推理，将SQL不仅用于数据检索，还作为数据库观察和决策工具。

Result: 在三个EMR数据库（MIMIC-III、eICU、SICdb）上进行了基准测试，包括已见和未见模式设置，结果显示在这些数据库上具有强大的性能和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 证明了自动化先前被认为需要专家驱动设计的过程的可行性，代码将公开发布。

Abstract: Machine learning models for clinical prediction rely on structured data
extracted from Electronic Medical Records (EMRs), yet this process remains
dominated by hardcoded, database-specific pipelines for cohort definition,
feature selection, and code mapping. These manual efforts limit scalability,
reproducibility, and cross-institutional generalization. To address this, we
introduce EMR-AGENT (Automated Generalized Extraction and Navigation Tool), an
agent-based framework that replaces manual rule writing with dynamic, language
model-driven interaction to extract and standardize structured clinical data.
Our framework automates cohort selection, feature extraction, and code mapping
through interactive querying of databases. Our modular agents iteratively
observe query results and reason over schema and documentation, using SQL not
just for data retrieval but also as a tool for database observation and
decision making. This eliminates the need for hand-crafted, schema-specific
logic. To enable rigorous evaluation, we develop a benchmarking codebase for
three EMR databases (MIMIC-III, eICU, SICdb), including both seen and unseen
schema settings. Our results demonstrate strong performance and generalization
across these databases, highlighting the feasibility of automating a process
previously thought to require expert-driven design. The code will be released
publicly at https://github.com/AITRICS/EMR-AGENT/tree/main. For a
