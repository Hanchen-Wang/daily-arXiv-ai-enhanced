### [1] [SoC-DT: Standard-of-Care Aligned Digital Twins for Patient-Specific Tumor Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03287)
*Moinak Bhattacharya,Gagandeep Singh,Prateek Prasanna*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了SoC-DT框架，结合反应扩散肿瘤生长模型和标准治疗干预，通过可微分求解器预测治疗后肿瘤结构，在合成和真实胶质瘤数据上优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有反应扩散模型无法捕捉异质性治疗范式下的肿瘤动态，需要能真实模拟标准治疗干预并考虑患者间差异的计算框架。

Method: 开发SoC-DT可微分框架，统一反应扩散肿瘤生长模型、离散标准治疗干预（手术、化疗、放疗）以及基因组和人口统计学个性化；提出IMEX-SoC隐显式指数时间差分求解器确保稳定性。

Result: 在合成数据和真实世界胶质瘤数据评估中，SoC-DT在预测肿瘤动态方面持续优于经典PDE基线和纯数据驱动的神经模型。

Conclusion: SoC-DT通过将机制可解释性与现代可微分求解器相结合，为肿瘤学中患者特异性数字孪生建立了原则性基础，实现生物学一致的肿瘤动态估计。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of tumor trajectories under standard-of-care (SoC)
therapies remains a major unmet need in oncology. This capability is essential
for optimizing treatment planning and anticipating disease progression.
Conventional reaction-diffusion models are limited in scope, as they fail to
capture tumor dynamics under heterogeneous therapeutic paradigms. There is
hence a critical need for computational frameworks that can realistically
simulate SoC interventions while accounting for inter-patient variability in
genomics, demographics, and treatment regimens. We introduce Standard-of-Care
Digital Twin (SoC-DT), a differentiable framework that unifies
reaction-diffusion tumor growth models, discrete SoC interventions (surgery,
chemotherapy, radiotherapy) along with genomic and demographic personalization
to predict post-treatment tumor structure on imaging. An implicit-explicit
exponential time-differencing solver, IMEX-SoC, is also proposed, which ensures
stability, positivity, and scalability in SoC treatment situations. Evaluated
on both synthetic data and real world glioma data, SoC-DT consistently
outperforms classical PDE baselines and purely data-driven neural models in
predicting tumor dynamics. By bridging mechanistic interpretability with modern
differentiable solvers, SoC-DT establishes a principled foundation for
patient-specific digital twins in oncology, enabling biologically consistent
tumor dynamics estimation. Code will be made available upon acceptance.

### [2] [Visualizing Celebrity Dynamics in Video Content: A Proposed Approach Using Face Recognition Timestamp Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03292)
*Doğanay Demir,İlknur Durgar Elkahlout*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一个结合分布式多GPU推理系统和交互式可视化平台的混合框架，用于分析视频剧集中的名人动态，通过高效处理视频数据生成时间戳记录，并提供多种可视化图表来揭示名人出现模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在视频内容主导的时代，理解视频结构和动态变得越来越重要，需要高效处理大量视频数据并提供深入分析的工具。

Method: 使用优化的ONNX模型、异构批量推理和高吞吐量并行处理，构建分布式多GPU推理系统，生成时间戳出现记录，然后通过交互式可视化平台提供多种图表分析。

Result: 系统能够高效处理大量视频数据，生成全面的可视化分析，包括出现频率、时长分析、共现关系、网络图等，揭示名人突出度、屏幕时间分布、时间动态等模式。

Abstract: In an era dominated by video content, understanding its structure and
dynamics has become increasingly important. This paper presents a hybrid
framework that combines a distributed multi-GPU inference system with an
interactive visualization platform for analyzing celebrity dynamics in video
episodes. The inference framework efficiently processes large volumes of video
data by leveraging optimized ONNX models, heterogeneous batch inference, and
high-throughput parallelism, ensuring scalable generation of timestamped
appearance records. These records are then transformed into a comprehensive
suite of visualizations, including appearance frequency charts, duration
analyses, pie charts, co-appearance matrices, network graphs, stacked area
charts, seasonal comparisons, and heatmaps. Together, these visualizations
provide multi-dimensional insights into video content, revealing patterns in
celebrity prominence, screen-time distribution, temporal dynamics,
co-appearance relationships, and intensity across episodes and seasons. The
interactive nature of the system allows users to dynamically explore data,
identify key moments, and uncover evolving relationships between individuals.
By bridging distributed recognition with structured, visually-driven analytics,
this work enables new possibilities for entertainment analytics, content
creation strategies, and audience engagement studies.

### [3] [Domain-Robust Marine Plastic Detection Using Vision Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03294)
*Saanvi Kataria*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究评估了多种深度学习模型在水下塑料垃圾跨域检测中的表现，发现轻量级CNN模型MobileNetV2在跨域测试中表现最佳，而零样本模型CLIP和Gemini各有优势但存在不同的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 海洋塑料污染是紧迫的环境威胁，需要可靠的水下垃圾自动检测系统。但视觉系统在一个数据集上训练后，由于域偏移问题，在新图像上性能会下降。

Method: 训练了CNN模型（MobileNetV2、ResNet-18、EfficientNet-B0）和视觉变换器（DeiT-Tiny、ViT-B16）在标记的水下数据集上，然后在跨域测试集上评估。还评估了两个零样本模型CLIP ViT-L14和Gemini 2.0 Flash。

Result: 轻量级MobileNetV2在跨域测试中表现最佳（F1 0.97），所有微调模型都实现了高精度（约99%），但在召回率上存在差异。零样本CLIP召回率约80%但精度较低（约56%），Gemini则相反（精度约99%，召回率约81%）。

Conclusion: 经过监督训练的紧凑CNN模型能够有效泛化用于跨域水下检测，而大型预训练视觉语言模型提供了互补优势。

Abstract: Marine plastic pollution is a pressing environmental threat, making reliable
automation for underwater debris detection essential. However, vision systems
trained on one dataset often degrade on new imagery due to domain shift. This
study benchmarks models for cross-domain robustness, training convolutional
neural networks - CNNs (MobileNetV2, ResNet-18, EfficientNet-B0) and vision
transformers (DeiT-Tiny, ViT-B16) on a labeled underwater dataset and then
evaluates them on a balanced cross-domain test set built from plastic-positive
images drawn from a different source and negatives from the training domain.
Two zero-shot models were assessed, CLIP ViT-L14 and Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash,
that leverage pretraining to classify images without fine-tuning. Results show
the lightweight MobileNetV2 delivers the strongest cross-domain performance (F1
0.97), surpassing larger models. All fine-tuned models achieved high Precision
(around 99%), but differ in Recall, indicating varying sensitivity to plastic
instances. Zero-shot CLIP is comparatively sensitive (Recall around 80%) yet
prone to false positives (Precision around 56%), whereas Gemini exhibits the
inverse profile (Precision around 99%, Recall around 81%). Error analysis
highlights recurring confusions with coral textures, suspended particulates,
and specular glare. Overall, compact CNNs with supervised training can
generalize effectively for cross-domain underwater detection, while large
pretrained vision-language models provide complementary strengths.

### [4] [Multimodal Arabic Captioning with Interpretable Visual Concept Integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03295)
*Passant Elchafei,Amany Fashwan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLCAP是一个阿拉伯语图像描述框架，结合了基于CLIP的视觉标签检索和多模态文本生成，通过提取可解释的阿拉伯视觉概念来生成文化连贯且上下文准确的阿拉伯语描述。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个可解释的阿拉伯语图像描述系统，避免单纯依赖端到端方法，而是通过视觉概念提取来增强生成过程的文化连贯性和准确性。

Method: 使用三种多语言编码器（mCLIP、AraCLIP、Jina V4）进行视觉标签检索，构建混合词汇表，将检索到的标签转换为阿拉伯语提示，然后结合原始图像传递给视觉语言模型进行描述生成。

Result: mCLIP + Gemini Pro Vision组合在BLEU-1（5.34%）和余弦相似度（60.01%）上表现最佳，而AraCLIP + Qwen-VL组合在LLM-judge评分（36.33%）上最高。

Conclusion: VLCAP框架能够生成文化连贯且上下文准确的阿拉伯语图像描述，其可解释的流水线设计为阿拉伯语图像理解提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We present VLCAP, an Arabic image captioning framework that integrates
CLIP-based visual label retrieval with multimodal text generation. Rather than
relying solely on end-to-end captioning, VLCAP grounds generation in
interpretable Arabic visual concepts extracted with three multilingual
encoders, mCLIP, AraCLIP, and Jina V4, each evaluated separately for label
retrieval. A hybrid vocabulary is built from training captions and enriched
with about 21K general domain labels translated from the Visual Genome dataset,
covering objects, attributes, and scenes. The top-k retrieved labels are
transformed into fluent Arabic prompts and passed along with the original image
to vision-language models. In the second stage, we tested Qwen-VL and Gemini
Pro Vision for caption generation, resulting in six encoder-decoder
configurations. The results show that mCLIP + Gemini Pro Vision achieved the
best BLEU-1 (5.34%) and cosine similarity (60.01%), while AraCLIP + Qwen-VL
obtained the highest LLM-judge score (36.33%). This interpretable pipeline
enables culturally coherent and contextually accurate Arabic captions.

### [5] [Convolutional Neural Nets vs Vision Transformers: A SpaceNet Case Study with Balanced vs Imbalanced Regimes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03297)
*Akshar Gothi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 对比EfficientNet-B0和ViT-Base在SpaceNet数据集上的性能，考察了不平衡和平衡两种标签分布情况下的表现，包括准确率、F1分数、模型大小和延迟等指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 比较卷积神经网络和视觉Transformer在遥感图像分类任务中的性能差异，特别是在不同标签分布情况下的表现，为实际应用中的模型选择提供参考。

Method: 在SpaceNet数据集上进行控制实验，使用不平衡的五类分割和平衡重采样分割（每类700张图像），采用相同的预处理（224x224，ImageNet归一化）、轻量级数据增强，在NVIDIA P100上训练40个周期。

Result: 在不平衡分割中，EfficientNet-B0达到93%测试准确率，具有更好的宏F1和更低延迟；ViT-Base也达到93%但参数更多、运行时间更长。在平衡分割中，两者表现都很强，EfficientNet-B0达到99%，ViT-Base保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 平衡数据分布会缩小架构间的性能差距，但CNN在效率方面仍保持优势。EfficientNet-B0在不平衡和平衡情况下都表现出色，具有更好的效率和性能平衡。

Abstract: We present a controlled comparison of a convolutional neural network
(EfficientNet-B0) and a Vision Transformer (ViT-Base) on SpaceNet under two
label-distribution regimes: a naturally imbalanced five-class split and a
balanced-resampled split with 700 images per class (70:20:10 train/val/test).
With matched preprocessing (224x224, ImageNet normalization), lightweight
augmentations, and a 40-epoch budget on a single NVIDIA P100, we report
accuracy, macro-F1, balanced accuracy, per-class recall, and deployment metrics
(model size and latency). On the imbalanced split, EfficientNet-B0 reaches 93%
test accuracy with strong macro-F1 and lower latency; ViT-Base is competitive
at 93% with a larger parameter count and runtime. On the balanced split, both
models are strong; EfficientNet-B0 reaches 99% while ViT-Base remains
competitive, indicating that balancing narrows architecture gaps while CNNs
retain an efficiency edge. We release manifests, logs, and per-image
predictions to support reproducibility.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基础设施措施在动态城市环境中保护弱势道路使用者效果有限，而现有AI应用调查主要关注检测任务，缺乏对VRU全面理解和保护所需的其他视觉任务的覆盖。

Method: 系统回顾了过去五年基于摄像头的AI感知系统在VRU安全领域的最新进展，重点关注检测分类、跟踪重识别、轨迹预测、意图识别四个核心任务。

Result: 构建了AI赋能的主动式VRU保护解决方案的技术框架，识别了数据、模型和部署三个层面的主要开放挑战。

Conclusion: 通过将视觉AI进展与实际部署考虑相结合，为开发下一代感知系统以增强VRU安全提供了基础性参考。

Abstract: Ensuring the safety of vulnerable road users (VRUs), such as pedestrians and
cyclists, remains a critical global challenge, as conventional
infrastructure-based measures often prove inadequate in dynamic urban
environments. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in
visual perception and reasoning, open new opportunities for proactive and
context-aware VRU protection. However, existing surveys on AI applications for
VRUs predominantly focus on detection, offering limited coverage of other
vision-based tasks that are essential for comprehensive VRU understanding and
protection. This paper presents a state-of-the-art review of recent progress in
camera-based AI sensing systems for VRU safety, with an emphasis on
developments from the past five years and emerging research trends. We
systematically examine four core tasks, namely detection and classification,
tracking and reidentification, trajectory prediction, and intent recognition
and prediction, which together form the backbone of AI-empowered proactive
solutions for VRU protection in intelligent transportation systems. To guide
future research, we highlight four major open challenges from the perspectives
of data, model, and deployment. By linking advances in visual AI with practical
considerations for real-world implementation, this survey aims to provide a
foundational reference for the development of next-generation sensing systems
to enhance VRU safety.

### [7] [The View From Space: Navigating Instrumentation Differences with EOFMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03316)
*Ryan P. Demilt,Nicholas LaHaye,Karis Tenneson*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 地球观测基础模型对传感器架构高度敏感，理解这种差异对模型设计和应用至关重要


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有地球观测基础模型大多在单一模态数据上训练，但被应用于跨模态任务，不清楚不同传感器架构对模型内部表示的影响

Method: 分析地球观测基础模型的表示空间对传感器架构的敏感性

Result: 发现地球观测基础模型的表示空间对传感器架构高度敏感

Conclusion: 理解传感器架构差异为当前地球观测基础模型设计的缺陷提供了重要视角，并为模型开发者、用户和遥感科学社区指明了前进方向

Abstract: Earth Observation Foundation Models (EOFMs) have exploded in prevalence as
tools for processing the massive volumes of remotely sensed and other earth
observation data, and for delivering impact on the many essential earth
monitoring tasks. An emerging trend posits using the outputs of pre-trained
models as 'embeddings' which summarize high dimensional data to be used for
generic tasks such as similarity search and content-specific queries. However,
most EOFM models are trained only on single modalities of data and then applied
or benchmarked by matching bands across different modalities. It is not clear
from existing work what impact diverse sensor architectures have on the
internal representations of the present suite of EOFMs. We show in this work
that the representation space of EOFMs is highly sensitive to sensor
architecture and that understanding this difference gives a vital perspective
on the pitfalls of current EOFM design and signals for how to move forward as
model developers, users, and a community guided by robust remote-sensing
science.

### [8] [Photorealistic Inpainting for Perturbation-based Explanations in Ecological Monitoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03317)
*Günel Aghakishiyeva,Jiayi Zhou,Saagar Arya,James David Poling,Holly R. Houliston,Jamie N. Womble,David W. Johnston,Brinnae Bent*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于修复引导的扰动解释方法，通过生成逼真的局部编辑来揭示视觉模型在生态监测中的决策依据，特别是在海豹检测任务中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生态监测中自动化视觉模型的不透明预测限制了信任和实际应用，需要更直观的解释方法来支持AI在生态学中的可信部署。

Method: 使用修复引导的扰动技术，结合Segment-Anything-Model精炼的掩码，进行对象移除/替换和背景替换，生成保持场景上下文的逼真编辑。

Result: 该方法能够定位诊断结构，避免传统扰动的删除伪影，通过翻转率和置信度下降等指标评估，获得领域相关的生态学见解。

Conclusion: 该方法为生态学AI部署提供了更可信的解释支持，能够生成生态学上合理的解释，支持专家验证。

Abstract: Ecological monitoring is increasingly automated by vision models, yet opaque
predictions limit trust and field adoption. We present an inpainting-guided,
perturbation-based explanation technique that produces photorealistic,
mask-localized edits that preserve scene context. Unlike masking or blurring,
these edits stay in-distribution and reveal which fine-grained morphological
cues drive predictions in tasks such as species recognition and trait
attribution. We demonstrate the approach on a YOLOv9 detector fine-tuned for
harbor seal detection in Glacier Bay drone imagery, using
Segment-Anything-Model-refined masks to support two interventions: (i) object
removal/replacement (e.g., replacing seals with plausible ice/water or boats)
and (ii) background replacement with original animals composited onto new
scenes. Explanations are assessed by re-scoring perturbed images (flip rate,
confidence drop) and by expert review for ecological plausibility and
interpretability. The resulting explanations localize diagnostic structures,
avoid deletion artifacts common to traditional perturbations, and yield
domain-relevant insights that support expert validation and more trustworthy
deployment of AI in ecology.

Abstract: Medical Image Segmentation (MIS) stands as a cornerstone in medical image
analysis, playing a pivotal role in precise diagnostics, treatment planning,
and monitoring of various medical conditions. This paper presents a
comprehensive and systematic survey of MIS methodologies, bridging the gap
between traditional image processing techniques and modern deep learning
approaches. The survey encompasses thresholding, edge detection, region-based
segmentation, clustering algorithms, and model-based techniques while also
delving into state-of-the-art deep learning architectures such as Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs), Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs), and the widely
adopted U-Net and its variants. Moreover, integrating attention mechanisms,
semi-supervised learning, generative adversarial networks (GANs), and
Transformer-based models is thoroughly explored. In addition to covering
established methods, this survey highlights emerging trends, including hybrid
architectures, cross-modality learning, federated and distributed learning
frameworks, and active learning strategies, which aim to address challenges
such as limited labeled datasets, computational complexity, and model
generalizability across diverse imaging modalities. Furthermore, a specialized
case study on lumbar spine segmentation is presented, offering insights into
the challenges and advancements in this relatively underexplored anatomical
region. Despite significant progress in the field, critical challenges persist,
including dataset bias, domain adaptation, interpretability of deep learning
models, and integration into real-world clinical workflows.

### [10] [DECOR: Deep Embedding Clustering with Orientation Robustness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03328)
*Fiona Victoria Stanley Jothiraj,Arunaggiri Pandian Karunanidhi,Seth A. Eichmeyer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DECOR是一个用于晶圆缺陷检测的深度聚类框架，通过考虑晶圆图的方向变化，能够在复杂、不平衡、未标记的数据条件下可靠地聚类缺陷模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 半导体制造中，晶圆缺陷的早期检测对产品良率优化至关重要。原始晶圆数据复杂、未标记、不平衡且可能包含多种缺陷，需要设计在非理想数据条件下仍可靠的聚类方法。

Method: DECOR框架通过深度聚类结合方向鲁棒性，明确考虑晶圆图的方向变化，确保空间相似的缺陷无论旋转或对齐如何都能被一致聚类。

Result: 在MixedWM38数据集上的实验表明，DECOR能够无需手动调参即可发现聚类，且性能优于现有的聚类基线方法。

Conclusion: DECOR为自动化视觉检测系统提供了一个可靠且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: In semiconductor manufacturing, early detection of wafer defects is critical
for product yield optimization. However, raw wafer data from wafer quality
tests are often complex, unlabeled, imbalanced and can contain multiple defects
on a single wafer, making it crucial to design clustering methods that remain
reliable under such imperfect data conditions. We introduce DECOR, a deep
clustering with orientation robustness framework that groups complex defect
patterns from wafer maps into consistent clusters. We evaluate our method on
the open source MixedWM38 dataset, demonstrating its ability to discover
clusters without manual tuning. DECOR explicitly accounts for orientation
variations in wafer maps, ensuring that spatially similar defects are
consistently clustered regardless of its rotation or alignment. Experiments
indicate that our method outperforms existing clustering baseline methods, thus
providing a reliable and scalable solution in automated visual inspection
systems.

### [11] [Error correction in multiclass image classification of facial emotion on unbalanced samples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03337)
*Andrey A. Lebedev,Victor B. Kazantsev,Sergey V. Stasenko*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于LSTM和注意力机制的面部表情分类方法，专门解决类别不平衡问题，通过错误校正技术提高对小类别的识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决面部表情分类中类别不平衡的问题，其中某些情绪类别显著多于其他类别，这在实际应用中很常见但会影响分类性能。

Method: 使用基于LSTM的神经网络模型，结合注意力机制聚焦于面部关键区域，在训练时排除一个类别，然后通过错误校正技术恢复该类别。

Result: 实验表明所有类别都能进行校正恢复，但成功率各不相同；在测试集上，对小类别的关键质量指标有所提升。

Conclusion: 该方法可有效应用于面部表情分析系统，特别适用于类别分布不平衡的分类任务，如反欺诈系统中的罕见事件检测。

Abstract: This paper considers the problem of error correction in multi-class
classification of face images on unbalanced samples. The study is based on the
analysis of a data frame containing images labeled by seven different emotional
states of people of different ages. Particular attention is paid to the problem
of class imbalance, in which some emotions significantly prevail over others.
To solve the classification problem, a neural network model based on LSTM with
an attention mechanism focusing on key areas of the face that are informative
for emotion recognition is used. As part of the experiments, the model is
trained on all possible configurations of subsets of six classes with
subsequent error correction for the seventh class, excluded at the training
stage. The results show that correction is possible for all classes, although
the degree of success varies: some classes are better restored, others are
worse. In addition, on the test sample, when correcting some classes, an
increase in key quality metrics for small classes was recorded, which indicates
the promise of the proposed approach in solving applied problems related to the
search for rare events, for example, in anti-fraud systems. Thus, the proposed
method can be effectively applied in facial expression analysis systems and in
tasks requiring stable classification under skewed class distribution.

TL;DR: 提出了DCG-Bench基准测试，评估多模态大语言模型在动态图表生成任务中的能力，并开发了Qwen2.5-VL-DCG-3B模型，在三个任务上平均性能提升8.31%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在静态图表生成和理解方面取得显著进展，但在动态图表生成和理解方面的潜力尚未充分探索，需要填补这一研究空白。

Method: 构建了DCG-8K高质量数据集，包含指令-代码-视频三元组和QA对；提出了两阶段训练方法，使用联合代码视觉奖励进行组相对策略优化。

Result: 基准测试揭示了现有MLLM在视觉到图表任务中的不足；提出的模型在三个任务上平均性能提升8.31%，仅用3B参数就达到了与专有模型相当的性能。

Conclusion: 提出的训练方法有效，证明了MLLM在动态图表生成任务中的潜力，代码和数据集将公开提供。

Abstract: Dynamic Chart Generation (DCG) involves producing code-rendered animated
visualizations as charts. While recent advances in multi-modal large language
models (MLLMs) have significantly improved their capability on static chart
generation and comprehension, MLLMs' potential for handling dynamic chart
generation and understanding remains underexplored. To bridge this research
gap, we introduce DCG-Bench (Dynamic Chart Generation Benchmark), the first
benchmark evaluating MLLM's capability on dynamic chart generation tasks from
three dimensions: Simple Text-to-Chart, Detailed Text-to-Chart, and
Video-to-Chart tasks. We construct DCG-8K, a high-quality DCG dataset with
annotations covering instruction-code-video triplets and QA pairs for both code
and video evaluation. Based on DCG-8K, we explored a two-stage training recipe,
proposing Joint-Code-Visual Reward for group relative policy optimization to
construct expert MLLM Qwen2.5-VL-DCG-3B for the DCG task. Our benchmarking
result reveals shortcomings of existing MLLMs in the visual-to-chart task, and
our model beats the best open-sourced MLLM with an average 8.31% performance
gain across three tasks, and shows on par performance against proprietary
models with only 3B parameters, proving the effectiveness of our training
recipe. Our code and dataset will be publicly available.

*Vlardimir Yugay,Duy-Kien Nguyen,Theo Gevers,Cees G. M. Snoek,Martin R. Oswald*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了VoT（视觉里程计Transformer），一种端到端的单目视觉里程计方法，无需手工组件如捆绑调整、特征匹配或相机标定，直接预测相机运动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖预训练深度学习组件和优化模块，导致复杂流程，需要相机标定和超参数调优，在未见过的真实场景中表现不佳。

Method: 使用Transformer处理单目帧序列，通过时空注意力提取特征和建模全局关系，直接预测相机运动而无需估计密集几何，仅使用相机位姿进行监督。

Result: VoT在更大数据集上有效扩展，受益于更强的预训练骨干网络，在不同相机运动和标定设置下泛化良好，性能超越传统方法且运行速度快3倍以上。

Conclusion: 单目视觉里程计可以通过端到端方法有效解决，无需手工组件，VoT框架模块化灵活，可集成各种预训练编码器。

Abstract: Modern monocular visual odometry methods typically combine pre-trained deep
learning components with optimization modules, resulting in complex pipelines
that rely heavily on camera calibration and hyperparameter tuning, and often
struggle in unseen real-world scenarios. Recent large-scale 3D models trained
on massive amounts of multi-modal data have partially alleviated these
challenges, providing generalizable dense reconstruction and camera pose
estimation. Still, they remain limited in handling long videos and providing
accurate per-frame estimates, which are required for visual odometry. In this
work, we demonstrate that monocular visual odometry can be addressed
effectively in an end-to-end manner, thereby eliminating the need for
handcrafted components such as bundle adjustment, feature matching, camera
calibration, or dense 3D reconstruction. We introduce VoT, short for Visual
odometry Transformer, which processes sequences of monocular frames by
extracting features and modeling global relationships through temporal and
spatial attention. Unlike prior methods, VoT directly predicts camera motion
without estimating dense geometry and relies solely on camera poses for
supervision. The framework is modular and flexible, allowing seamless
integration of various pre-trained encoders as feature extractors. Experimental
results demonstrate that VoT scales effectively with larger datasets, benefits
substantially from stronger pre-trained backbones, generalizes across diverse
camera motions and calibration settings, and outperforms traditional methods
while running more than 3 times faster. The code will be released.

Conclusion: 所提方法能有效利用侧信息改善扩散模型在逆问题中的重建性能，提供了一种替代梯度基引导的可靠方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as powerful priors for solving inverse
problems. However, existing approaches typically overlook side information that
could significantly improve reconstruction quality, especially in severely
ill-posed settings. In this work, we propose a novel inference-time search
algorithm that guides the sampling process using the side information in a
manner that balances exploration and exploitation. This enables more accurate
and reliable reconstructions, providing an alternative to the gradient-based
guidance that is prone to reward-hacking artifacts. Our approach can be
seamlessly integrated into a wide range of existing diffusion-based image
reconstruction pipelines. Through extensive experiments on a number of inverse
problems, such as box inpainting, super-resolution, and various deblurring
tasks including motion, Gaussian, nonlinear, and blind deblurring, we show that
our approach consistently improves the qualitative and quantitative performance
of diffusion-based image reconstruction algorithms. We also show the superior
performance of our approach with respect to other baselines, including reward
gradient-based guidance algorithms. The code is available at

Abstract: Sonar images are relevant for advancing underwater exploration, autonomous
navigation, and ecosystem monitoring. However, the progress depends on data
availability. The scarcity of publicly available, well-annotated sonar image
datasets creates a significant bottleneck for the development of robust machine
learning models. This paper presents a comprehensive and concise review of the
current landscape of sonar image datasets, seeking not only to catalog existing
resources but also to contextualize them, identify gaps, and provide a clear
roadmap, serving as a base guide for researchers of any kind who wish to start
or advance in the field of underwater acoustic data analysis. We mapped
publicly accessible datasets across various sonar modalities, including Side
Scan Sonar (SSS), Forward-Looking Sonar (FLS), Synthetic Aperture Sonar (SAS),
Multibeam Echo Sounder (MBES), and Dual-Frequency Identification Sonar
(DIDSON). An analysis was conducted on applications such as classification,
detection, segmentation, and 3D reconstruction. This work focuses on
state-of-the-art advancements, incorporating newly released datasets. The
findings are synthesized into a master table and a chronological timeline,
offering a clear and accessible comparison of characteristics, sizes, and

Motivation: 解决传统深度网络的不透明性、幻觉问题，以及为数据贡献者分配信用等挑战，提高神经模型的透明度、鲁棒性和可信度。

Method: 模型在正常操作中学习将每个预测直接链接到其支持训练样本，通过联合优化主任务和可解释性目标，在架构本身嵌入可解释性。

Conclusion: 虽然引入额外计算成本且目前适用于中等规模数据集，但溯源网络为现有可解释性技术提供了补充方法，改善了神经模型的透明度、鲁棒性和可信度。

Abstract: We introduce provenance networks, a novel class of neural models designed to
provide end-to-end, training-data-driven explainability. Unlike conventional
post-hoc methods, provenance networks learn to link each prediction directly to
its supporting training examples as part of the model's normal operation,
embedding interpretability into the architecture itself. Conceptually, the
model operates similarly to a learned KNN, where each output is justified by
concrete exemplars weighted by relevance in the feature space. This approach
facilitates systematic investigations of the trade-off between memorization and
generalization, enables verification of whether a given input was included in
the training set, aids in the detection of mislabeled or anomalous data points,
enhances resilience to input perturbations, and supports the identification of
similar inputs contributing to the generation of a new data point. By jointly
optimizing the primary task and the explainability objective, provenance
networks offer insights into model behavior that traditional deep networks
cannot provide. While the model introduces additional computational cost and
currently scales to moderately sized datasets, it provides a complementary
approach to existing explainability techniques. In particular, it addresses
critical challenges in modern deep learning, including model opaqueness,
hallucination, and the assignment of credit to data contributors, thereby
improving transparency, robustness, and trustworthiness in neural models.

Conclusion: UCF是一个通用的后处理框架，能有效提升各种无监督异常检测方法的性能，为统一处理单模态和多模态异常检测提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) aims to identify image- and pixel-level
anomalies using only normal training data, with wide applications such as
industrial inspection and medical analysis, where anomalies are scarce due to
privacy concerns and cold-start constraints. Existing methods, whether
reconstruction-based (restoring normal counterparts) or embedding-based
(pretrained representations), fundamentally conduct image- or feature-level
matching to generate anomaly maps. Nonetheless, matching noise has been largely
overlooked, limiting their detection ability. Beyond earlier focus on unimodal
RGB-based UAD, recent advances expand to multimodal scenarios, e.g., RGB--3D
and RGB--Text, enabled by point cloud sensing and vision--language models.
Despite shared challenges, these lines remain largely isolated, hindering a
comprehensive understanding and knowledge transfer. In this paper, we advocate
unified UAD for both unimodal and multimodal settings in the matching
perspective. Under this insight, we present Unified Cost Filtering (UCF), a
generic post-hoc refinement framework for refining anomaly cost volume of any
UAD model. The cost volume is constructed by matching a test sample against
normal samples from the same or different modalities, followed by a learnable
filtering module with multi-layer attention guidance from the test sample,
mitigating matching noise and highlighting subtle anomalies. Comprehensive
experiments on 22 diverse benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy of UCF in
enhancing a variety of UAD methods, consistently achieving new state-of-the-art
results in both unimodal (RGB) and multimodal (RGB--3D, RGB--Text) UAD
scenarios. Code and models will be released at

Result: 实现了对复杂工业图纸对象检测结果的自动化质量评估，提高了整体检测性能

Conclusion: 该框架为工业图纸数字化提供了有效的质量评估方法，有助于构建更准确的数字孪生系统

Abstract: Industrial diagrams such as piping and instrumentation diagrams (P&IDs) are
essential for the design, operation, and maintenance of industrial plants.
Converting these diagrams into digital form is an important step toward
building digital twins and enabling intelligent industrial automation. A
central challenge in this digitalization process is accurate object detection.
Although recent advances have significantly improved object detection
algorithms, there remains a lack of methods to automatically evaluate the
quality of their outputs. This paper addresses this gap by introducing a
framework that employs Visual Language Models (VLMs) to assess object detection
results and guide their refinement. The approach exploits the multimodal
capabilities of VLMs to identify missing or inconsistent detections, thereby
enabling automated quality assessment and improving overall detection
performance on complex industrial diagrams.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have advanced multimodal reasoning but still
face challenges in spatial reasoning for 3D scenes and complex object
configurations. To address this, we introduce SpatialViLT, an enhanced VLM that
integrates spatial features like depth maps, 3D coordinates, and edge maps

embeddings with spatial understanding. We propose two variants: SpatialViLT and
MaskedSpatialViLT, focusing on full and masked object regions, respectively.
Additionally, SpatialEnsemble combines both approaches, achieving

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 两相光学切片结构照明的短采集时间会引入残留伪影，传统去噪方法难以有效抑制，且缺乏干净的监督训练数据

Result: 两种网络都提高了图像清晰度，各自在不同类型的伪影上表现优异

Conclusion: 合成训练能够实现光学切片结构照明图像的监督去噪，编码器-解码器网络有潜力简化重建工作流程

Abstract: Structured illumination (SI) enhances image resolution and contrast by
projecting patterned light onto a sample. In two-phase optical-sectioning SI
(OS-SI), reduced acquisition time introduces residual artifacts that
conventional denoising struggles to suppress. Deep learning offers an
alternative to traditional methods; however, supervised training is limited by
the lack of clean, optically sectioned ground-truth data. We investigate
encoder-decoder networks for artifact reduction in two-phase OS-SI, using
synthetic training pairs formed by applying real artifact fields to synthetic
images. An asymmetrical denoising autoencoder (DAE) and a U-Net are trained on
the synthetic data, then evaluated on real OS-SI images. Both networks improve
image clarity, with each excelling against different artifact types. These
results demonstrate that synthetic training enables supervised denoising of
OS-SI images and highlight the potential of encoder-decoder networks to
streamline reconstruction workflows.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖少量高变基因，限制了预测范围并忽略了协调的生物学程序，需要更全面的多模态整合方法。

Method: 使用ssGSEA计算通路激活分数，用transformer编码通路信号，通过对比学习与组织学特征对齐。

Result: 在三个癌症ST数据集中，PEaRL在基因和通路水平表达预测上均优于SOTA方法，Pearson相关系数分别提高达58.9%和20.4%。

Conclusion: 基于通路的转录组表示能产生更生物学忠实和可解释的多模态模型，推动计算病理学超越基因水平嵌入。

Abstract: Integrating histopathology with spatial transcriptomics (ST) provides a
powerful opportunity to link tissue morphology with molecular function. Yet
most existing multimodal approaches rely on a small set of highly variable
genes, which limits predictive scope and overlooks the coordinated biological
programs that shape tissue phenotypes. We present PEaRL (Pathway Enhanced
Representation Learning), a multimodal framework that represents
transcriptomics through pathway activation scores computed with ssGSEA. By
encoding biologically coherent pathway signals with a transformer and aligning
them with histology features via contrastive learning, PEaRL reduces
dimensionality, improves interpretability, and strengthens cross-modal
correspondence. Across three cancer ST datasets (breast, skin, and lymph node),
PEaRL consistently outperforms SOTA methods, yielding higher accuracy for both
gene- and pathway-level expression prediction (up to 58.9 percent and 20.4
percent increase in Pearson correlation coefficient compared to SOTA). These
results demonstrate that grounding transcriptomic representation in pathways
produces more biologically faithful and interpretable multimodal models,
advancing computational pathology beyond gene-level embeddings.

Abstract: Deep learning for medical imaging is hampered by task-specific models that
lack generalizability and prognostic capabilities, while existing 'universal'
approaches suffer from simplistic conditioning and poor medical semantic
understanding. To address these limitations, we introduce DuPLUS, a deep
learning framework for efficient multi-modal medical image analysis. DuPLUS
introduces a novel vision-language framework that leverages hierarchical
semantic prompts for fine-grained control over the analysis task, a capability
absent in prior universal models. To enable extensibility to other medical
tasks, it includes a hierarchical, text-controlled architecture driven by a
unique dual-prompt mechanism. For segmentation, DuPLUS is able to generalize
across three imaging modalities, ten different anatomically various medical
datasets, encompassing more than 30 organs and tumor types. It outperforms the
state-of-the-art task specific and universal models on 8 out of 10 datasets. We
demonstrate extensibility of its text-controlled architecture by seamless
integration of electronic health record (EHR) data for prognosis prediction,
and on a head and neck cancer dataset, DuPLUS achieved a Concordance Index (CI)
of 0.69. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning enables rapid adaptation to new tasks
and modalities from varying centers, establishing DuPLUS as a versatile and
clinically relevant solution for medical image analysis. The code for this work

Abstract: Real-time animal detection and segmentation in natural environments are vital
for wildlife conservation, enabling non-invasive monitoring through remote
camera streams. However, these tasks remain challenging due to limited
computational resources and the cryptic appearance of many species. We propose
a mobile-optimized two-stage deep learning framework that integrates a
Threading Detection Model (TDM) to parallelize YOLOv10-based detection and
MobileSAM-based segmentation. Unlike prior YOLO+SAM pipelines, our approach
improves real-time performance by reducing latency through threading. YOLOv10
handles detection while MobileSAM performs lightweight segmentation, both
executed concurrently for efficient resource use. On the cryptic Houbara
Bustard, a conservation-priority species, our model achieves mAP50 of 0.9627,
mAP75 of 0.7731, mAP95 of 0.7178, and a MobileSAM mIoU of 0.7421. YOLOv10
operates at 43.7 ms per frame, confirming real-time readiness. We introduce a
curated Houbara dataset of 40,000 annotated images to support model training
and evaluation across diverse conditions. The code and dataset used in this

Motivation: 现有Transformer缺乏对科学和计算机视觉中常见几何对称性的归纳偏置，而现有的等变方法往往通过复杂设计牺牲了Transformer的效率和灵活性。

Method: 通过从柏拉图立体对称群定义相对注意力，引入原则性的权重共享方案，使注意力形式上等同于动态群卷积。

Result: 在计算机视觉（CIFAR-10）、3D点云（ScanObjectNN）和分子属性预测（QM9、OMol25）等多个基准测试中取得了有竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: Platonic Transformer以零额外成本利用几何约束，在保持Transformer效率的同时实现了几何等变性。

Abstract: While widespread, Transformers lack inductive biases for geometric symmetries
common in science and computer vision. Existing equivariant methods often
sacrifice the efficiency and flexibility that make Transformers so effective
through complex, computationally intensive designs. We introduce the Platonic
Transformer to resolve this trade-off. By defining attention relative to
reference frames from the Platonic solid symmetry groups, our method induces a
principled weight-sharing scheme. This enables combined equivariance to
continuous translations and Platonic symmetries, while preserving the exact
architecture and computational cost of a standard Transformer. Furthermore, we
show that this attention is formally equivalent to a dynamic group convolution,
which reveals that the model learns adaptive geometric filters and enables a
highly scalable, linear-time convolutional variant. Across diverse benchmarks
in computer vision (CIFAR-10), 3D point clouds (ScanObjectNN), and molecular
property prediction (QM9, OMol25), the Platonic Transformer achieves
competitive performance by leveraging these geometric constraints at no
additional cost.

Abstract: The generalization of deep neural networks to unknown domains is a major
challenge despite their tremendous progress in recent years. For this reason,
the dynamic area of domain generalization (DG) has emerged. In contrast to
unsupervised domain adaptation, there is no access to or knowledge about the
target domains, and DG methods aim to generalize across multiple different
unseen target domains. Domain generalization is particularly relevant for the
task semantic segmentation which is used in several areas such as biomedicine
or automated driving. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of the
rapidly evolving topic of domain generalized semantic segmentation. We cluster
and review existing approaches and identify the paradigm shift towards
foundation-model-based domain generalization. Finally, we provide an extensive
performance comparison of all approaches, which highlights the significant
influence of foundation models on domain generalization. This survey seeks to

Abstract: Endoscopic procedures such as esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and
colonoscopy play a critical role in diagnosing and managing gastrointestinal
(GI) disorders. However, the documentation burden associated with these
procedures place significant strain on gastroenterologists, contributing to
inefficiencies in clinical workflows and physician burnout. To address this
challenge, we propose a novel automated report generation model that leverages
a transformer-based vision encoder and text decoder within a two-stage training
framework. In the first stage, both components are pre-trained on image/text
caption pairs to capture generalized vision-language features, followed by
fine-tuning on images/report pairs to generate clinically meaningful findings.
Our approach not only streamlines the documentation process but also holds
promise for reducing physician workload and improving patient care.

Abstract: We propose SketchPlan, a diffusion-based planner that interprets 2D
hand-drawn sketches over depth images to generate 3D flight paths for drone
navigation. SketchPlan comprises two components: a SketchAdapter that learns to
map the human sketches to projected 2D paths, and DiffPath, a diffusion model
that infers 3D trajectories from 2D projections and a first person view depth
image. Our model achieves zero-shot sim-to-real transfer, generating accurate
and safe flight paths in previously unseen real-world environments. To train
the model, we build a synthetic dataset of 32k flight paths using a diverse set
of photorealistic 3D Gaussian Splatting scenes. We automatically label the data
by computing 2D projections of the 3D flight paths onto the camera plane, and
use this to train the DiffPath diffusion model. However, since real human 2D
sketches differ significantly from ideal 2D projections, we additionally label
872 of the 3D flight paths with real human sketches and use this to train the
SketchAdapter to infer the 2D projection from the human sketch. We demonstrate
SketchPlan's effectiveness in both simulated and real-world experiments, and
show through ablations that training on a mix of human labeled and auto-labeled
data together with a modular design significantly boosts its capabilities to
correctly interpret human intent and infer 3D paths. In real-world drone tests,
SketchPlan achieved 100\% success in low/medium clutter and 40\% in unseen
high-clutter environments, outperforming key ablations by 20-60\% in task
completion.

*Danial Samadi Vahdati,Tai Duc Nguyen,Ekta Prashnani,Koki Nagano,David Luebke,Orazio Gallo,Matthew Stamm*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于生物特征泄漏防御的方法，通过分析姿态-表情潜在空间中的身份信息来检测实时视频会议中的身份劫持攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI驱动的说话头视频会议系统通过传输紧凑的姿态-表情潜在表示来减少带宽，但这些潜在表示可能被恶意操控，导致攻击者实时劫持受害者形象。由于每帧都是合成的，传统的深度伪造和合成视频检测器无法有效工作。

Method: 使用姿态条件化的大间隔对比编码器，从传输的潜在表示中分离出持久的身份线索，同时消除瞬时的姿态和表情信息。通过在这个解耦嵌入上进行简单的余弦测试来实时检测非法身份交换。

Result: 在多个说话头生成模型上的实验表明，该方法始终优于现有的操控防御方法，能够实时运行，并在分布外场景中表现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法首次实现了在不查看重建RGB视频的情况下防御生物特征泄漏，有效解决了AI视频会议系统中的身份劫持安全问题。

Abstract: AI-based talking-head videoconferencing systems reduce bandwidth by sending a
compact pose-expression latent and re-synthesizing RGB at the receiver, but
this latent can be puppeteered, letting an attacker hijack a victim's likeness
in real time. Because every frame is synthetic, deepfake and synthetic video
detectors fail outright. To address this security problem, we exploit a key
observation: the pose-expression latent inherently contains biometric
information of the driving identity. Therefore, we introduce the first
biometric leakage defense without ever looking at the reconstructed RGB video:
a pose-conditioned, large-margin contrastive encoder that isolates persistent
identity cues inside the transmitted latent while cancelling transient pose and
expression. A simple cosine test on this disentangled embedding flags illicit
identity swaps as the video is rendered. Our experiments on multiple
talking-head generation models show that our method consistently outperforms
existing puppeteering defenses, operates in real-time, and shows strong
generalization to out-of-distribution scenarios.

*Junbao Zhou,Yuan Zhou,Kesen Zhao,Qingshan Xu,Beier Zhu,Richang Hong,Hanwang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了REVEL任务和DragStream方法，实现基于拖拽的流式视频编辑，支持任意时刻对任意内容进行平移、变形和旋转操作，解决了潜在空间漂移和上下文干扰问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自回归视频扩散模型难以实现流式、细粒度的输出控制，无法保证与用户期望的一致性。需要一种能够随时对生成视频进行交互式拖拽编辑的方法。

Method: 提出DragStream训练免费方法，包含：自适应分布自校正策略（利用相邻帧统计约束潜在嵌入漂移）和空间频率选择性优化机制（选择性传播视觉线索以减少上下文干扰）。

Result: 方法可无缝集成到现有自回归视频扩散模型中，大量实验证明DragStream的有效性。

Conclusion: REVEL任务和DragStream方法成功解决了流式拖拽视频编辑中的潜在空间漂移和上下文干扰问题，实现了灵活的视频操控。

Abstract: Achieving streaming, fine-grained control over the outputs of autoregressive
video diffusion models remains challenging, making it difficult to ensure that
they consistently align with user expectations. To bridge this gap, we propose
\textbf{stReaming drag-oriEnted interactiVe vidEo manipuLation (REVEL)}, a new
task that enables users to modify generated videos \emph{anytime} on
\emph{anything} via fine-grained, interactive drag. Beyond DragVideo and
SG-I2V, REVEL unifies drag-style video manipulation as editing and animating
video frames with both supporting user-specified translation, deformation, and
rotation effects, making drag operations versatile. In resolving REVEL, we
observe: \emph{i}) drag-induced perturbations accumulate in latent space,
causing severe latent distribution drift that halts the drag process;
\emph{ii}) streaming drag is easily disturbed by context frames, thereby
yielding visually unnatural outcomes. We thus propose a training-free approach,
\textbf{DragStream}, comprising: \emph{i}) an adaptive distribution
self-rectification strategy that leverages neighboring frames' statistics to
effectively constrain the drift of latent embeddings; \emph{ii}) a
spatial-frequency selective optimization mechanism, allowing the model to fully
exploit contextual information while mitigating its interference via
selectively propagating visual cues along generation. Our method can be
seamlessly integrated into existing autoregressive video diffusion models, and
extensive experiments firmly demonstrate the effectiveness of our DragStream.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型在计算病理学中提供了强大的通用特征提取器，但为特定诊断任务调整和基准测试单个模型通常耗时且资源密集，特别是考虑到其规模和多样性。

Method: 提出Group-Aggregative Selection Multi-Instance Learning (GAS-MIL)，一个灵活的集成框架，整合多个基础模型的特征，保留它们的互补优势。

Result: 在三个癌症数据集（前列腺癌PANDA、卵巢癌UBC-OCEAN、乳腺癌TCGA-BrCa）的分类任务中，GAS-MIL始终达到优于或相当于单个基础模型和已建立的MIL方法的性能。

Conclusion: GAS-MIL通过实现异构基础模型的高效集成，简化了病理学模型部署，并为未来多模态和精准肿瘤学应用提供了可扩展的基础。

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) have transformed computational pathology by providing
powerful, general-purpose feature extractors. However, adapting and
benchmarking individual FMs for specific diagnostic tasks is often
time-consuming and resource-intensive, especially given their scale and
diversity. To address this challenge, we introduce Group-Aggregative Selection
Multi-Instance Learning (GAS-MIL), a flexible ensemble framework that
seamlessly integrates features from multiple FMs, preserving their
complementary strengths without requiring manual feature selection or extensive
task-specific fine-tuning. Across classification tasks in three cancer
datasets-prostate (PANDA), ovarian (UBC-OCEAN), and breast (TCGA-BrCa)-GAS-MIL
consistently achieves superior or on-par performance relative to individual FMs
and established MIL methods, demonstrating its robustness and generalizability.
By enabling efficient integration of heterogeneous FMs, GAS-MIL streamlines
model deployment for pathology and provides a scalable foundation for future
multimodal and precision oncology applications.

Motivation: 无人机快速递送纳洛酮为阿片类药物过量紧急情况提供了有前景的解决方案，但需要解决旁观者情境感知评估的研究空白，以支持人机协作团队的有效运作。

Method: 引入DANDSD数据集，提出基于图嵌入和Transformer模型的视频实时情境感知评估框架，整合几何、运动学和交互图特征等视觉感知和理解线索。

Result: 实现了高性能的情境感知预测，在时间分割精度上显著优于FINCH基线，MoF提高9%，IoU提高5%。

Conclusion: 这项工作支持开发能够有效指导旁观者的自适应无人机系统，最终改善紧急响应结果并拯救生命。

Abstract: Rapid naloxone delivery via drones offers a promising solution for responding
to opioid overdose emergencies (OOEs), by extending lifesaving interventions to
medically untrained bystanders before emergency medical services (EMS) arrive.
Recognizing the critical role of bystander situational awareness (SA) in
human-autonomy teaming (HAT), we address a key research gap in real-time SA
assessment by introducing the Drone-Assisted Naloxone Delivery Simulation
Dataset (DANDSD). This pioneering dataset captures HAT during simulated OOEs,
where college students without medical training act as bystanders tasked with
administering intranasal naloxone to a mock overdose victim. Leveraging this
dataset, we propose a video-based real-time SA assessment framework that
utilizes graph embeddings and transformer models to assess bystander SA in real
time. Our approach integrates visual perception and comprehension cues--such as
geometric, kinematic, and interaction graph features--and achieves
high-performance SA prediction. It also demonstrates strong temporal
segmentation accuracy, outperforming the FINCH baseline by 9% in Mean over
Frames (MoF) and 5% in Intersection over Union (IoU). This work supports the
development of adaptive drone systems capable of guiding bystanders
effectively, ultimately improving emergency response outcomes and saving lives.

*Mayimunah Nagayi,Alice Khan,Tamryn Frank,Rina Swart,Clement Nyirenda*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 评估四种开源OCR系统（Tesseract、EasyOCR、PaddleOCR、TrOCR）在真实食品包装图像上的性能，重点关注成分表和营养面板的提取能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 包装上的准确OCR对于合规性和营养监测很重要，但由于多语言文本、密集布局、字体变化、反光和曲面等因素而具有挑战性。

Method: 使用231个产品（1,628张图像）的数据集处理所有四种模型，评估速度和覆盖率，并创建113张图像（60个产品）的真实标注子集进行准确性评估。

Result: 在真实标注子集上，Tesseract实现了最低的字符错误率（0.912）和最高的BLEU分数（0.245）。EasyOCR在准确性和多语言支持之间提供了良好平衡。PaddleOCR实现了近乎完整的覆盖率但速度较慢，TrOCR尽管有GPU加速但表现最弱。

Conclusion: 这些结果为包装特定任务提供了基准，建立了基线，并为布局感知方法和文本定位指明了方向。

Abstract: This study evaluates four open-source Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
systems which are Tesseract, EasyOCR, PaddleOCR, and TrOCR on real world food
packaging images. The aim is to assess their ability to extract ingredient
lists and nutrition facts panels. Accurate OCR for packaging is important for
compliance and nutrition monitoring but is challenging due to multilingual
text, dense layouts, varied fonts, glare, and curved surfaces. A dataset of 231
products (1,628 images) was processed by all four models to assess speed and
coverage, and a ground truth subset of 113 images (60 products) was created for
accuracy evaluation. Metrics include Character Error Rate (CER), Word Error
Rate (WER), BLEU, ROUGE-L, F1, coverage, and execution time. On the ground
truth subset, Tesseract achieved the lowest CER (0.912) and the highest BLEU
(0.245). EasyOCR provided a good balance between accuracy and multilingual
support. PaddleOCR achieved near complete coverage but was slower because it
ran on CPU only due to GPU incompatibility, and TrOCR produced the weakest
results despite GPU acceleration. These results provide a packaging-specific
benchmark, establish a baseline, and highlight directions for layout-aware
methods and text localization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FrameOracle是一个轻量级即插即用模块，通过预测关键帧和所需帧数来优化视频理解，在保持准确性的同时显著减少输入帧数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有帧采样策略无法适应信息密度和任务复杂度的变化，导致效率低下和信息损失，需要更智能的帧选择方法。

Method: 使用四阶段课程学习训练，前三个阶段依赖跨模态相似度等弱代理信号，最后阶段利用新构建的FrameOracle-41K数据集提供的强监督。

Result: 在5个VLMs和6个基准测试中，FrameOracle将16帧输入平均减少到10.4帧且无精度损失；从64帧候选帧减少到13.9帧时精度提升1.4%。

Conclusion: FrameOracle实现了最先进的效率-精度权衡，为可扩展视频理解提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have advanced video understanding, but their
performance is limited by the number of input frames they can process. Existing
frame sampling strategies, such as uniform or fixed-budget selection, often
fail to adapt to variations in information density or task complexity,
resulting in inefficiency and information loss. To address this, we present
FrameOracle, a lightweight and plug-and-play module that predicts both (1)
which frames are most relevant to a given query and (2) how many frames are
needed. FrameOracle is trained using a four-stage curriculum, with the first
three stages relying on weak proxy signals such as cross-modal similarity. In
the final stage, it leverages stronger supervision from a new dataset we
introduce, FrameOracle-41K, the first large-scale VideoQA collection to provide
keyframe annotations specifying the minimal set of frames required to answer
each question. Extensive experiments across five VLMs and six benchmarks
demonstrate that FrameOracle reduces 16-frame inputs to an average of 10.4
frames without any loss in accuracy. When starting from 64-frame candidates, it
reduces the input to an average of 13.9 frames while improving accuracy by
1.4%, achieving state-of-the-art efficiency-accuracy trade-offs for scalable
video understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合协同微调(CFT)方法，通过整合标记和未标记数据来改进游戏视觉bug检测，减少对目标游戏标记数据的依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 游戏视觉bug的手动识别成本高且需要专业知识，而监督模型依赖大量标记数据，但这类bug出现频率低，获取标记数据困难。

Method: CFT方法结合目标游戏和同领域游戏的标记样本，并利用未标记数据增强特征表示学习，最大化所有可用数据的效用。

Result: 实验结果显示该方法在多种游戏环境中优于传统基线方法，即使仅使用50%的目标游戏标记数据仍能保持竞争力。

Conclusion: CFT框架具有更好的可扩展性和适应性，能够有效促进跨游戏标题的视觉bug检测。

Abstract: Manual identification of visual bugs in video games is a resource-intensive
and costly process, often demanding specialized domain knowledge. While
supervised visual bug detection models offer a promising solution, their
reliance on extensive labeled datasets presents a significant challenge due to
the infrequent occurrence of such bugs. To overcome this limitation, we propose
a hybrid Co-FineTuning (CFT) method that effectively integrates both labeled
and unlabeled data. Our approach leverages labeled samples from the target game
and diverse co-domain games, additionally incorporating unlabeled data to
enhance feature representation learning. This strategy maximizes the utility of
all available data, substantially reducing the dependency on labeled examples
from the specific target game. The developed framework demonstrates enhanced
scalability and adaptability, facilitating efficient visual bug detection
across various game titles. Our experimental results show the robustness of the
proposed method for game visual bug detection, exhibiting superior performance
compared to conventional baselines across multiple gaming environments.
Furthermore, CFT maintains competitive performance even when trained with only
50% of the labeled data from the target game.

*Alexander V. Mantzaris*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HRM模型在MNIST上表现良好（约98%测试准确率），但在CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100等小尺寸自然图像上过拟合严重，性能远不如简单的卷积神经网络基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究HRM模型（包含两个Transformer模块、DEQ风格训练、深度监督等组件）是否可以作为实用的图像分类器。

Method: 在MNIST、CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100数据集上评估HRM，采用原始训练策略：无数据增强、相同优化器家族、一周期预热后余弦衰减、标签平滑。

Result: HRM在MNIST上达到约98%测试准确率，但在CIFAR-10上仅65.0%（CNN基线77.2%），CIFAR-100上仅29.7%（CNN基线45.3%），且训练速度慢30倍。

Conclusion: 对于无增强的小分辨率图像分类，当前HRM不如简单卷积架构，但模型修改可能带来显著改进。

Abstract: This paper asks whether the Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM) with the two
Transformer-style modules $(f_L,f_H)$, one step (DEQ-style) training, deep
supervision, Rotary Position Embeddings, and RMSNorm can serve as a practical
image classifier. It is evaluated on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 under a
deliberately raw regime: no data augmentation, identical optimizer family with
one-epoch warmup then cosine-floor decay, and label smoothing. HRM optimizes
stably and performs well on MNIST ($\approx 98\%$ test accuracy), but on small
natural images it overfits and generalizes poorly: on CIFAR-10, HRM reaches
65.0\% after 25 epochs, whereas a two-stage Conv--BN--ReLU baseline attains
77.2\% while training $\sim 30\times$ faster per epoch; on CIFAR-100, HRM
achieves only 29.7\% test accuracy despite 91.5\% train accuracy, while the
same CNN reaches 45.3\% test with 50.5\% train accuracy. Loss traces and error
analyses indicate healthy optimization but insufficient image-specific
inductive bias for HRM in this regime. It is concluded that, for
small-resolution image classification without augmentation, HRM is not
competitive with even simple convolutional architectures as the HRM currently
exist but this does not exclude possibilities that modifications to the model
may allow it to improve greatly.

Motivation: 自监督学习的最新进展使得能够学习既捕获高级语义又保留细粒度空间结构的通用视觉特征。DINOv2的突破性表现激发了对其核心思想和性能的深入分析需求。

Method: 采用多裁剪视图增强和均值教师自蒸馏方法，通过对比不同视图的特征表示来学习鲁棒的视觉特征。

Result: DINOv2在大多数基准测试中超越了弱监督方法如OpenCLIP，其基于Transformer架构学习到的特征在各种下游任务中表现出色，并展现出一些显著的新兴特性。

Conclusion: 尽管DINOv2存在一些局限性，但它对自监督学习领域产生了重要影响，并为未来研究方向提供了有价值的启示。

Abstract: Recent advances in self-supervised learning (SSL) have made it possible to
learn general-purpose visual features that capture both the high-level
semantics and the fine-grained spatial structure of images. Most notably, the
recent DINOv2 has established a new state of the art by surpassing weakly
supervised methods (WSL) like OpenCLIP on most benchmarks. In this survey, we
examine the core ideas behind its approach, multi-crop view augmentation and
self-distillation with a mean teacher, and trace their development in previous
work. We then compare the performance of DINO and DINOv2 with other SSL and WSL
methods across various downstream tasks, and highlight some remarkable emergent
properties of their learned features with transformer backbones. We conclude by
briefly discussing DINOv2's limitations, its impact, and future research
directions.

TL;DR: 提出DCS框架，通过扩散模型与FSCIL分类器的协同进化循环，解决少样本类增量学习中的数据稀缺和遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前FSCIL方法因依赖有限数据集而泛化能力不足，直接使用扩散模型进行数据增强可能导致语义不对齐或无效指导。

Method: 采用奖励对齐学习策略，基于分类器状态构建动态多面奖励函数，在特征层面确保语义一致性和多样性，在logits层面促进探索性图像生成和类间区分度。

Result: 在FSCIL基准测试中达到最先进性能，显著提升知识保持和新类学习能力。

Conclusion: DCS框架通过扩散模型与分类器的协同进化，有效解决了FSCIL中的数据稀缺和稳定性-可塑性权衡问题。

Abstract: Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) challenges models to sequentially
learn new classes from minimal examples without forgetting prior knowledge, a
task complicated by the stability-plasticity dilemma and data scarcity. Current
FSCIL methods often struggle with generalization due to their reliance on
limited datasets. While diffusion models offer a path for data augmentation,
their direct application can lead to semantic misalignment or ineffective
guidance. This paper introduces Diffusion-Classifier Synergy (DCS), a novel
framework that establishes a mutual boosting loop between diffusion model and
FSCIL classifier. DCS utilizes a reward-aligned learning strategy, where a
dynamic, multi-faceted reward function derived from the classifier's state
directs the diffusion model. This reward system operates at two levels: the
feature level ensures semantic coherence and diversity using prototype-anchored
maximum mean discrepancy and dimension-wise variance matching, while the logits
level promotes exploratory image generation and enhances inter-class
discriminability through confidence recalibration and cross-session
confusion-aware mechanisms. This co-evolutionary process, where generated
images refine the classifier and an improved classifier state yields better
reward signals, demonstrably achieves state-of-the-art performance on FSCIL
benchmarks, significantly enhancing both knowledge retention and new class
learning.

Abstract: Industrial accidents, particularly in high-risk domains such as surface and
underground mining, are frequently caused by unsafe worker behaviors.
Traditional manual inspection remains labor-intensive, error-prone, and
insufficient for large-scale, dynamic environments, highlighting the urgent
need for intelligent and automated safety monitoring. In this paper, we present
MonitorVLM, a novel vision--language framework designed to detect safety
violations directly from surveillance video streams. MonitorVLM introduces
three key innovations: (1) a domain-specific violation dataset comprising 9,000
vision--question--answer (VQA) samples across 40 high-frequency mining
regulations, enriched with augmentation and auxiliary detection cues; (2) a
clause filter (CF) module that dynamically selects the Top-$K$ most relevant
clauses, reducing inference latency by 13.56\% while maintaining accuracy; and
(3) a behavior magnifier (BM) module that enhances worker regions to improve
fine-grained action recognition, yielding additional gains of 3.45% in
precision and 8.62% in recall. Experimental results demonstrate that MonitorVLM
significantly outperforms baseline vision--language models, achieving
improvements of 22.01% in precision, 34.22\% in recall, and 28.37% in F1 score
over the 72B unfine-tuned baseline. A lightweight web-based interface further
integrates MonitorVLM into practical workflows, enabling automatic violation
reporting with video timestamping. This study highlights the potential of
multimodal large models to enhance occupational safety monitoring in mining and
beyond.

Abstract: The integration of Diffusion Models into Intelligent Transportation Systems
(ITS) is a substantial improvement in the detection of accidents. We present a
novel hybrid model integrating guidance classification with diffusion
techniques. By leveraging fine-tuned ExceptionNet architecture outputs as input
for our proposed diffusion model and processing image tensors as our
conditioning, our approach creates a robust classification framework. Our model
consists of multiple conditional modules, which aim to modulate the linear
projection of inputs using time embeddings and image covariate embeddings,
allowing the network to adapt its behavior dynamically throughout the diffusion
process. To address the computationally intensive nature of diffusion models,
our implementation is cloud-based, enabling scalable and efficient processing.
Our strategy overcomes the shortcomings of conventional classification
approaches by leveraging diffusion models inherent capacity to effectively
understand complicated data distributions. We investigate important diffusion
characteristics, such as timestep schedulers, timestep encoding techniques,
timestep count, and architectural design changes, using a thorough ablation
study, and have conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed model
against the baseline models on a publicly available dataset. The proposed
diffusion model performs best in image-based accident detection with an
accuracy of 97.32%.

Conclusion: SAMSOD模型通过解决模态不平衡和梯度冲突问题，在RGB-T显著性目标检测任务中取得了显著性能提升，并展现出良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: RGB-T salient object detection (SOD) aims to segment attractive objects by
combining RGB and thermal infrared images. To enhance performance, the Segment
Anything Model has been fine-tuned for this task. However, the imbalance
convergence of two modalities and significant gradient difference between high-
and low- activations are ignored, thereby leaving room for further performance
enhancement. In this paper, we propose a model called \textit{SAMSOD}, which
utilizes unimodal supervision to enhance the learning of non-dominant modality
and employs gradient deconfliction to reduce the impact of conflicting
gradients on model convergence. The method also leverages two decoupled
adapters to separately mask high- and low-activation neurons, emphasizing
foreground objects by enhancing background learning. Fundamental experiments on
RGB-T SOD benchmark datasets and generalizability experiments on scribble
supervised RGB-T SOD, fully supervised RGB-D SOD datasets and full-supervised
RGB-D rail surface defect detection all demonstrate the effectiveness of our
proposed method.

learning have led to significant performance improvements in REC tasks.
However, localizing extremely small objects remains a considerable challenge
despite its importance in real-world applications such as autonomous driving.
To address this issue, we introduce a novel dataset and method for REC
targeting small objects. First, we present the small object REC (SOREC)
dataset, which consists of 100,000 pairs of referring expressions and
corresponding bounding boxes for small objects in driving scenarios. Second, we
propose the progressive-iterative zooming adapter (PIZA), an adapter module for
parameter-efficient fine-tuning that enables models to progressively zoom in
and localize small objects. In a series of experiments, we apply PIZA to
GroundingDINO and demonstrate a significant improvement in accuracy on the
SOREC dataset. Our dataset, codes and pre-trained models are publicly available
on the project page.

Abstract: Segmenting of clinically important retinal blood vessels into arteries and
veins is a prerequisite for retinal vessel analysis. Such analysis can provide
potential insights and bio-markers for identifying and diagnosing various
retinal eye diseases. Alteration in the regularity and width of the retinal
blood vessels can act as an indicator of the health of the vasculature system
all over the body. It can help identify patients at high risk of developing
vasculature diseases like stroke and myocardial infarction. Over the years,
various Deep Learning architectures have been proposed to perform retinal
vessel segmentation. Recently, attention mechanisms have been increasingly used
in image segmentation tasks. The work proposes a new Deep Learning approach for
artery-vein segmentation. The new approach is based on the Attention mechanism
that is incorporated into the WNet Deep Learning model, and we call the model
as Attention-WNet. The proposed approach has been tested on publicly available
datasets such as HRF and DRIVE datasets. The proposed approach has outperformed
other state-of-art models available in the literature.

TL;DR: 该研究为LAION-400M数据集创建了大规模人口统计标注，揭示了训练数据组成与下游模型偏见之间的经验联系，发现60-70%的CLIP和Stable Diffusion性别偏见可由数据中的直接共现线性解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉语言模型存在的人口统计偏见问题，但由于缺乏网络规模数据集（如LAION-400M）的人口统计标注，训练数据在产生这些偏见中的作用仍不清楚。

Method: 通过验证的自动标注流程为整个LAION-400M数据集创建以人为中心的标注，包括超过2.76亿个边界框、感知性别和种族/民族标签，以及自动生成的标题。使用对象检测、多模态标题生成和微调分类器的组合。

Result: 揭示了人口统计不平衡和有害关联，例如男性和被感知为黑人或中东裔的个体与犯罪相关和负面内容的不成比例关联。发现CLIP和Stable Diffusion中60-70%的性别偏见可由数据中的直接共现线性解释。

Conclusion: 建立的资源首次大规模实证了数据集组成与下游模型偏见之间的联系，为理解和缓解视觉语言模型中的偏见提供了重要基础。

Abstract: Vision-language models trained on large-scale multimodal datasets show strong
demographic biases, but the role of training data in producing these biases
remains unclear. A major barrier has been the lack of demographic annotations
in web-scale datasets such as LAION-400M. We address this gap by creating
person-centric annotations for the full dataset, including over 276 million
bounding boxes, perceived gender and race/ethnicity labels, and automatically
generated captions. These annotations are produced through validated automatic
labeling pipelines combining object detection, multimodal captioning, and
finetuned classifiers. Using them, we uncover demographic imbalances and
harmful associations, such as the disproportionate linking of men and
individuals perceived as Black or Middle Eastern with crime-related and
negative content. We also show that 60-70% of gender bias in CLIP and Stable
Diffusion can be linearly explained by direct co-occurrences in the data. Our
resources establish the first large-scale empirical link between dataset
composition and downstream model bias.

Motivation: 现有深度学习方法尚未充分利用预训练神经网络的潜力，需要研究任务特异性与数据量哪个对非正式住区检测更重要

Method: 使用两种预训练神经网络：1) 在大型通用图像数据集上预训练的通用网络，2) 在卫星图像上预训练的专用网络

Result: 研究比较了两种网络在检测里约热内卢贫民窟方面的性能差异

Conclusion: 探讨任务特异性与数据量在非正式住区检测中的相对重要性

Abstract: While deep learning methods for detecting informal settlements have already
been developed, they have not yet fully utilized the potential offered by
recent pretrained neural networks. We compare two types of pretrained neural
networks for detecting the favelas of Rio de Janeiro: 1. Generic networks
pretrained on large diverse datasets of unspecific images, 2. A specialized
network pretrained on satellite imagery. While the latter is more specific to
the target task, the former has been pretrained on significantly more images.
Hence, this research investigates whether task specificity or data volume
yields superior performance in urban informal settlement detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的主动防御方法缺乏鲁棒性和可靠性，需要开发能够绕过这些防御的新技术。

Method: 使用低秩适应(LoRA)补丁技术，结合可学习的门控机制和多模态特征对齐损失函数，在语义层面使对抗输出与期望输出对齐。

Result: 仅使用1,000个面部样本和单轮微调，LoRA补丁就能成功绕过多种主动防御系统。

Conclusion: 揭示了当前防御范式的关键弱点，强调需要开发更鲁棒的Deepfake防御策略。

Abstract: Deepfakes pose significant societal risks, motivating the development of
proactive defenses that embed adversarial perturbations in facial images to
prevent manipulation. However, in this paper, we show that these preemptive
defenses often lack robustness and reliability. We propose a novel approach,
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) patching, which injects a plug-and-play LoRA patch
into Deepfake generators to bypass state-of-the-art defenses. A learnable
gating mechanism adaptively controls the effect of the LoRA patch and prevents
gradient explosions during fine-tuning. We also introduce a Multi-Modal Feature
Alignment (MMFA) loss, encouraging the features of adversarial outputs to align
with those of the desired outputs at the semantic level. Beyond bypassing, we
present defensive LoRA patching, embedding visible warnings in the outputs as a
complementary solution to mitigate this newly identified security
vulnerability. With only 1,000 facial examples and a single epoch of
fine-tuning, LoRA patching successfully defeats multiple proactive defenses.
These results reveal a critical weakness in current paradigms and underscore
the need for more robust Deepfake defense strategies. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 提出参考集微调(RSF)方法，利用测试时的参考集信息来提升视觉位置识别(VPR)在挑战性数据集上的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VPR方法在训练-测试域差异大的挑战性数据集上表现不佳，而测试时的参考集包含目标域信息但未被充分利用

Method: 在测试前对VPR模型在参考集上进行简单微调，利用参考集中的图像和位姿信息

Result: 在挑战性数据集上平均提升Recall@1约2.3%，且保持泛化能力，适用于多种测试数据集

Conclusion: 参考集微调是提升VPR性能的有效补充方法，能显著改善域差异问题

Abstract: Given a query image, Visual Place Recognition (VPR) is the task of retrieving
an image of the same place from a reference database with robustness to
viewpoint and appearance changes. Recent works show that some VPR benchmarks
are solved by methods using Vision-Foundation-Model backbones and trained on
large-scale and diverse VPR-specific datasets. Several benchmarks remain
challenging, particularly when the test environments differ significantly from
the usual VPR training datasets. We propose a complementary, unexplored source
of information to bridge the train-test domain gap, which can further improve
the performance of State-of-the-Art (SOTA) VPR methods on such challenging
benchmarks. Concretely, we identify that the test-time reference set, the
"map", contains images and poses of the target domain, and must be available
before the test-time query is received in several VPR applications. Therefore,
we propose to perform simple Reference-Set-Finetuning (RSF) of VPR models on
the map, boosting the SOTA (~2.3% increase on average for Recall@1) on these
challenging datasets. Finetuned models retain generalization, and RSF works
across diverse test datasets.

TL;DR: ARSAM通过自适应采样-重用-混合分解梯度的方法，在保持SAM泛化能力的同时显著加速训练，速度提升约40%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM虽然能提升模型泛化能力，但计算成本是SGD的两倍，需要更高效的优化方法

Method: 将SAM梯度分解为SGD梯度和二阶梯度在一阶梯度上的投影(PSF)，通过自适应重用PSF和及时更新PSF来加速训练

Result: 在CIFAR-10/100等数据集上达到与SAM相当的准确率，速度提升约40%，在人体姿态估计、模型量化等挑战任务中也表现优异

Conclusion: ARSAM在保持SAM泛化优势的同时显著降低计算成本，具有广泛的实用性

Abstract: Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) improves model generalization but doubles
the computational cost of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) by requiring twice
the gradient calculations per optimization step. To mitigate this, we propose
Adaptively sampling-Reusing-mixing decomposed gradients to significantly
accelerate SAM (ARSAM). Concretely, we firstly discover that SAM's gradient can
be decomposed into the SGD gradient and the Projection of the Second-order
gradient onto the First-order gradient (PSF). Furthermore, we observe that the
SGD gradient and PSF dynamically evolve during training, emphasizing the
growing role of the PSF to achieve a flat minima. Therefore, ARSAM is proposed
to the reused PSF and the timely updated PSF still maintain the model's
generalization ability. Extensive experiments show that ARSAM achieves
state-of-the-art accuracies comparable to SAM across diverse network
architectures. On CIFAR-10/100, ARSAM is comparable to SAM while providing a
speedup of about 40\%. Moreover, ARSAM accelerates optimization for the various
challenge tasks (\textit{e.g.}, human pose estimation, and model quantization)
without sacrificing performance, demonstrating its broad practicality.% The

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在临床诊断中需要透明度，但现有概念瓶颈方法仅从最终层编码特征，忽略了浅层和多尺度特征，缺乏有效的概念编码指导，限制了细粒度概念提取。

Method: 提出概念提示与聚合(CoPA)框架，包含概念感知嵌入生成器(CEG)从视觉编码器各层提取概念表示，以及概念提示调优(CPT)引导模型放大关键概念相关视觉线索，聚合多层视觉表示与文本概念表示对齐。

Result: 在三个公共数据集上的广泛实验表明，CoPA在概念和疾病预测性能上优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: CoPA框架能有效捕获和利用图像中的概念信息，显著提升了概念瓶颈模型在临床诊断中的性能。

Abstract: The transparency of deep learning models is essential for clinical
diagnostics. Concept Bottleneck Model provides clear decision-making processes
for diagnosis by transforming the latent space of black-box models into
human-understandable concepts. However, concept-based methods still face
challenges in concept capture capabilities. These methods often rely on encode
features solely from the final layer, neglecting shallow and multiscale
features, and lack effective guidance in concept encoding, hindering
fine-grained concept extraction. To address these issues, we introduce Concept
Prompting and Aggregating (CoPA), a novel framework designed to capture
multilayer concepts under prompt guidance. This framework utilizes the
Concept-aware Embedding Generator (CEG) to extract concept representations from
each layer of the visual encoder. Simultaneously, these representations serve
as prompts for Concept Prompt Tuning (CPT), steering the model towards
amplifying critical concept-related visual cues. Visual representations from
each layer are aggregated to align with textual concept representations. With
the proposed method, valuable concept-wise information in the images is
captured and utilized effectively, thus improving the performance of concept
and disease prediction. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that CoPA
outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three public datasets. Code is

Motivation: 解决3D医学影像数据规模庞大和复杂性带来的协作研究和可移植性障碍。

Method: 在包含真实血管分割的大规模3D医学数据集上，应用ZFP压缩技术的误差容忍和固定速率两种模式。

Result: ZFP实现了高达22.89:1的数据压缩比，同时分割质量几乎不受影响（平均Dice系数0.87656，基准为0.8774）。

Conclusion: ZFP是促进大规模医学数据集高效和可访问研究的有效工具，有助于推动更广泛的社区合作。

Abstract: The increasing size and complexity of medical imaging datasets, particularly
in 3D formats, present significant barriers to collaborative research and
transferability. This study investigates whether the ZFP compression technique
can mitigate these challenges without compromising the performance of automated
cerebrovascular segmentation, a critical first step in intracranial aneurysm
detection. We apply ZFP in both its error tolerance and fixed-rate modes to a
large scale, and one of the most recent, datasets in the literature, 3D medical
dataset containing ground-truth vascular segmentations. The segmentation
quality on the compressed volumes is rigorously compared to the uncompressed
baseline (Dice approximately equals 0.8774). Our findings reveal that ZFP can
achieve substantial data reduction--up to a 22.89:1 ratio in error tolerance
mode--while maintaining a high degree of fidelity, with the mean Dice
coefficient remaining high at 0.87656. These results demonstrate that ZFP is a
viable and powerful tool for enabling more efficient and accessible research on
large-scale medical datasets, fostering broader collaboration across the
community.

Motivation: 现有医学图像分割模型多为任务特定，在不同模态和解剖区域的性能差异大，且难以平衡模型复杂度和性能，特别是在临床环境中需要兼顾准确性和效率。

Method: 采用三分支编码器集成CNN、Transformer和Mamba注意力融合机制，捕捉局部、全局和长程依赖；多尺度注意力CNN解码器重建细粒度分割图；协同注意力门增强跨尺度特征选择和交互。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法在准确性和泛化性方面优于现有最优方法，同时保持相当的计算复杂度。

Conclusion: 该架构通过有效平衡效率和效果，为多样化医学成像任务提供了实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: In recent years, deep learning has shown near-expert performance in
segmenting complex medical tissues and tumors. However, existing models are
often task-specific, with performance varying across modalities and anatomical
regions. Balancing model complexity and performance remains challenging,
particularly in clinical settings where both accuracy and efficiency are
critical. To address these issues, we propose a hybrid segmentation
architecture featuring a three-branch encoder that integrates CNNs,
Transformers, and a Mamba-based Attention Fusion (MAF) mechanism to capture
local, global, and long-range dependencies. A multi-scale attention-based CNN
decoder reconstructs fine-grained segmentation maps while preserving contextual
consistency. Additionally, a co-attention gate enhances feature selection by
emphasizing relevant spatial and semantic information across scales during both
encoding and decoding, improving feature interaction and cross-scale
communication. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets show that
our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and
generalization, while maintaining comparable computational complexity. By
effectively balancing efficiency and effectiveness, our architecture offers a
practical and scalable solution for diverse medical imaging tasks. Source code
and trained models will be publicly released upon acceptance to support
reproducibility and further research.

Method: 采用YOLOv9算法，使用多边形标注而非传统边界框进行更精确的道路缺陷定位，在包含1000多张图像的数据集上训练三个类别（损坏、未损坏、井盖）。

Result: 整体图像级准确率78.1%，损坏类别F1分数86.7%，未损坏类别89.2%，但井盖检测仅18.2% F1分数，主要由于类别不平衡问题。

Abstract: Urban safety and infrastructure maintenance are critical components of smart
city development. Manual monitoring of road damages is time-consuming, highly
costly, and error-prone. This paper presents a deep learning approach for
automated road damage and manhole detection using the YOLOv9 algorithm with
polygonal annotations. Unlike traditional bounding box annotation, we employ
polygonal annotations for more precise localization of road defects. We develop
a novel dataset comprising more than one thousand images which are mostly
collected from Dhaka, Bangladesh. This dataset is used to train a YOLO-based
model for three classes, namely Broken, Not Broken, and Manhole. We achieve
78.1% overall image-level accuracy. The YOLOv9 model demonstrates strong
performance for Broken (86.7% F1-score) and Not Broken (89.2% F1-score)
classes, with challenges in Manhole detection (18.2% F1-score) due to class
imbalance. Our approach offers an efficient and scalable solution for
monitoring urban infrastructure in developing countries.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非配对图像翻译缺乏对齐样本，而基于分数的扩散模型能生成高质量多样化输出，对比学习则能在无监督情况下学习语义相似性，两者结合适合非配对I2I任务。

Method: 使用时间相关对比学习方法，通过SimCLR将图像与其域不变特征作为正样本对进行训练，然后用学习到的对比模型引导预训练的SDE进行图像翻译。

Result: 在三个常见非配对I2I任务上与多个基线比较，使用四个评估指标，Contrastive-SDE在多个指标上达到与最先进方法相当的结果，且收敛更快，无需标签监督或分类器训练。

Conclusion: 该方法为非配对图像翻译提供了更高效的替代方案，结合了对比学习和扩散模型的优势，实现了快速收敛和无监督学习。

Abstract: Unpaired image-to-image translation involves learning mappings between source
domain and target domain in the absence of aligned or corresponding samples.
Score based diffusion models have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in
generative tasks. Their ability to approximate complex data distributions
through stochastic differential equations (SDEs) enables them to generate
high-fidelity and diverse outputs, making them particularly well-suited for
unpaired I2I settings. In parallel, contrastive learning provides a powerful
framework for learning semantic similarities without the need for explicit
supervision or paired data. By pulling together representations of semantically
similar samples and pushing apart dissimilar ones, contrastive methods are
inherently aligned with the objectives of unpaired translation. Its ability to
selectively enforce semantic consistency at the feature level makes contrastive
learning particularly effective for guiding generation in unpaired scenarios.
In this work, we propose a time-dependent contrastive learning approach where a
model is trained with SimCLR by considering an image and its domain invarient
feature as a positive pair, enabling the preservation of domain-invariant
features and the discarding of domain-specific ones. The learned contrastive
model then guides the inference of a pretrained SDE for the I2I translation
task. We empirically compare Contrastive-SDE with several baselines across
three common unpaired I2I tasks, using four metrics for evaluation.
Constrastive-SDE achieves comparable results to the state-of-the-art on several
metrics. Furthermore, we observe that our model converges significantly faster
and requires no label supervision or classifier training, making it a more
efficient alternative for this task.

TL;DR: LIBERO-PRO是一个扩展的VLA模型基准测试，通过四种扰动维度（操纵对象、初始状态、任务指令和环境）系统评估模型性能，揭示了现有模型在标准测试中90%+的准确率在广义设置下崩溃至0.0%的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LIBERO基准测试的训练和评估设置存在问题，导致性能估计虚高，阻碍了公平的模型比较。需要开发更严格的评估方法来检验模型的真实泛化能力。

Method: 引入LIBERO-PRO基准，在四个维度上施加合理扰动：操纵对象、初始状态、任务指令和环境，系统评估模型在广义设置下的性能表现。

Result: 实验结果显示，现有模型在标准LIBERO评估中达到90%以上的准确率，但在广义设置下性能崩溃至0.0%。模型依赖对训练集中动作序列和环境布局的死记硬背，而非真正的任务理解或环境感知。

Conclusion: 当前评估实践存在严重缺陷，呼吁社区放弃误导性方法，采用能够稳健评估模型泛化能力和理解能力的测试方法。

Abstract: LIBERO has emerged as a widely adopted benchmark for evaluating
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models; however, its current training and
evaluation settings are problematic, often leading to inflated performance
estimates and preventing fair model comparison. To address these issues, we
introduce LIBERO-PRO, an extended LIBERO benchmark that systematically
evaluates model performance under reasonable perturbations across four
dimensions: manipulated objects, initial states, task instructions, and
environments. Experimental results reveal that, although existing models
achieve over 90% accuracy under the standard LIBERO evaluation, their
performance collapses to 0.0% under our generalized setting. Crucially, this
discrepancy exposes the models' reliance on rote memorization of action
sequences and environment layouts from the training set, rather than genuine
task understanding or environmental perception. For instance, models persist in
executing grasping actions when the target object is replaced with irrelevant
items, and their outputs remain unchanged even when given corrupted
instructions or even messy tokens. These findings expose the severe flaws in
current evaluation practices, and we call on the community to abandon
misleading methodologies in favor of robust assessments of model generalization
and comprehension. Our code is available at:

Motivation: 当前AI生成图像越来越难以被标准检测器识别，但人类仍能通过可见伪影进行区分，需要开发更有效的检测方法。

Method: 构建Mirage数据集，包含各种具有可见伪影的AI生成图像，并评估大型视觉语言模型在检测这些图像时的表现。

Result: 大型视觉语言模型在检测具有可见伪影的AI生成图像时表现优异，但在缺乏此类线索的图像上性能下降。

Conclusion: 大型视觉语言模型可作为可解释AI图像检测的有效工具，特别是在存在可见伪影的情况下，但需要进一步改进以处理更高质量的生成图像。

Abstract: Recent advances in image generation models have led to models that produce
synthetic images that are increasingly difficult for standard AI detectors to
identify, even though they often remain distinguishable by humans. To identify
this discrepancy, we introduce \textbf{Mirage}, a curated dataset comprising a
diverse range of AI-generated images exhibiting visible artifacts, where
current state-of-the-art detection methods largely fail. Furthermore, we
investigate whether Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), which are
increasingly employed as substitutes for human judgment in various tasks, can
be leveraged for explainable AI image detection. Our experiments on both Mirage
and existing benchmark datasets demonstrate that while LVLMs are highly
effective at detecting AI-generated images with visible artifacts, their
performance declines when confronted with images lacking such cues.

TL;DR: UGround提出了一种统一的视觉定位范式，通过动态选择展开transformer的中间层作为"mask as prompt"，替代传统固定最后一层作为"<SEG> as prompt"的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有范式两个主要问题：1) 依赖固定最后一层导致误差累积传播；2) 使用<SEG>作为提示缺乏明确的空间线索。

Method: 采用Policy-Prompted Masking方法，包含随机跳跃连接(SSC)和Mask as Prompt(MasP)两个组件。SSC通过强化学习策略让<SEG>token在transformer层间滑动，MasP使用相似度图作为软logit掩码来提示SAM生成掩码。

Result: 首次从属性角度统一了视觉定位，涵盖从传统参考表达分割到推理分割，从单目标到多目标，从正查询到错误前提的各种任务。

Conclusion: UGround通过动态层选择和显式空间线索，有效解决了现有视觉定位方法的局限性，提供了一个统一的框架。

Abstract: We present UGround, a \textbf{U}nified visual \textbf{Ground}ing paradigm
that dynamically selects intermediate layers across \textbf{U}nrolled
transformers as ``mask as prompt'', diverging from the prevailing pipeline that
leverages the fixed last hidden layer as ``\texttt{<SEG>} as prompt''. UGround
addresses two primary challenges posed by the prevailing paradigm: (1) its
reliance on the fixed last hidden layer, which sequentially amplifies
cumulative errors arising from layer-by-layer propagation without intermediate
correction, and (2) its use of \texttt{<SEG>} as a prompt, which implicitly
projects textual embeddings into visual space without explicit spatial cues
(\eg, coordinates). Central to UGround is Policy-Prompted Masking, which
comprises two key components: Stochastic Skip Connection (SSC) and Mask as
Prompt (MasP). SSC is a reinforcement learning policy that, via stochastic
sampling, allows each \texttt{<SEG>} token to slide across unrolled transformer
layers, enabling dynamic layer selection at which it connects to the vision
model (\eg, SAM) in a skip-connection fashion. Given the selected hidden layer,
MasP uses the similarity map derived from the \texttt{<SEG>} token and image
tokens as a soft logit mask to prompt SAM for mask generation, offering
explicit spatial cues through its activation regions. To validate the

TL;DR: OMG4是一个优化的4D高斯泼溅框架，通过三阶段渐进式剪枝和压缩技术，显著减少动态场景表示的存储开销，在保持重建质量的同时将模型大小减少超过60%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 4D高斯泼溅虽然能实时渲染复杂动态场景，但面临存储开销过大的挑战，需要数百万个高斯元进行高保真重建。现有方法在压缩比或视觉质量方面仍存在局限性。

Method: 采用三阶段渐进式剪枝：高斯采样识别关键基元、高斯剪枝去除冗余、高斯合并融合相似特征。同时集成隐式外观压缩和推广子向量量化到4D表示。

Result: 在标准基准数据集上的实验表明，OMG4显著优于现有最先进方法，模型大小减少超过60%的同时保持重建质量。

Conclusion: OMG4在紧凑4D场景表示方面迈出了重要一步，为广泛应用开辟了新可能性。

Abstract: 4D Gaussian Splatting has emerged as a new paradigm for dynamic scene
representation, enabling real-time rendering of scenes with complex motions.
However, it faces a major challenge of storage overhead, as millions of
Gaussians are required for high-fidelity reconstruction. While several studies
have attempted to alleviate this memory burden, they still face limitations in
compression ratio or visual quality. In this work, we present OMG4 (Optimized
Minimal 4D Gaussian Splatting), a framework that constructs a compact set of
salient Gaussians capable of faithfully representing 4D Gaussian models. Our
method progressively prunes Gaussians in three stages: (1) Gaussian Sampling to
identify primitives critical to reconstruction fidelity, (2) Gaussian Pruning
to remove redundancies, and (3) Gaussian Merging to fuse primitives with
similar characteristics. In addition, we integrate implicit appearance
compression and generalize Sub-Vector Quantization (SVQ) to 4D representations,
further reducing storage while preserving quality. Extensive experiments on
standard benchmark datasets demonstrate that OMG4 significantly outperforms
recent state-of-the-art methods, reducing model sizes by over 60% while
maintaining reconstruction quality. These results position OMG4 as a
significant step forward in compact 4D scene representation, opening new
possibilities for a wide range of applications. Our source code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的开放词汇目标检测框架，通过结构化领域对齐将地面视图的预训练模型知识迁移到航空图像领域，解决了跨域检测的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统目标检测模型在固定类别集上训练，缺乏灵活性且扩展新类别成本高。开放词汇目标检测能够识别未见过类别，但航空图像与地面视图存在领域偏移、视角变化和尺度差异，需要专门的适应策略。

Method: 采用对比图像到图像对齐增强航空和地面视图嵌入的相似性，并使用多实例词汇关联将航空图像与文本嵌入对齐，实现结构化领域对齐。

Result: 在xView、DOTAv2、VisDrone、DIOR和HRRSD数据集上的实验验证了方法的有效性。在零样本设置下，相比微调的封闭词汇模型，在DOTAv2上提升+6.32 mAP，VisDrone上+4.16 mAP，HRRSD上+3.46 mAP。

Conclusion: 该方法为航空应用中的目标检测系统提供了更灵活和可扩展的解决方案，通过有效的跨域知识迁移实现了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: Traditional object detection models are typically trained on a fixed set of
classes, limiting their flexibility and making it costly to incorporate new
categories. Open-vocabulary object detection addresses this limitation by
enabling models to identify unseen classes without explicit training.
Leveraging pretrained models contrastively trained on abundantly available
ground-view image-text classification pairs provides a strong foundation for
open-vocabulary object detection in aerial imagery. Domain shifts, viewpoint
variations, and extreme scale differences make direct knowledge transfer across
domains ineffective, requiring specialized adaptation strategies. In this
paper, we propose a novel framework for adapting open-vocabulary
representations from ground-view images to solve object detection in aerial
imagery through structured domain alignment. The method introduces contrastive
image-to-image alignment to enhance the similarity between aerial and
ground-view embeddings and employs multi-instance vocabulary associations to
align aerial images with text embeddings. Extensive experiments on the xView,
DOTAv2, VisDrone, DIOR, and HRRSD datasets are used to validate our approach.
Our open-vocabulary model achieves improvements of +6.32 mAP on DOTAv2, +4.16
mAP on VisDrone (Images), and +3.46 mAP on HRRSD in the zero-shot setting when
compared to finetuned closed-vocabulary dataset-specific model performance,
thus paving the way for more flexible and scalable object detection systems in
aerial applications.

Motivation: GAN在生成任务中表现出色，但计算需求大难以部署到资源受限设备。知识蒸馏是GAN压缩的有前景方向，但由于学生生成器和教师判别器之间的容量不匹配，有效训练较小的学生生成器具有挑战性。

Method: 提出学生判别器辅助知识蒸馏(SDAKD)，引入学生判别器来缓解容量不匹配问题。采用三阶段训练策略，并在最后两个训练阶段集成适配的特征图蒸馏方法。

Conclusion: SDAKD是一种有效的GAN蒸馏方法，通过引入学生判别器成功解决了容量不匹配问题，在超分辨率任务上表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) achieve excellent performance in
generative tasks, such as image super-resolution, but their computational
requirements make difficult their deployment on resource-constrained devices.
While knowledge distillation is a promising research direction for GAN
compression, effectively training a smaller student generator is challenging
due to the capacity mismatch between the student generator and the teacher
discriminator. In this work, we propose Student Discriminator Assisted
Knowledge Distillation (SDAKD), a novel GAN distillation methodology that
introduces a student discriminator to mitigate this capacity mismatch. SDAKD
follows a three-stage training strategy, and integrates an adapted feature map
distillation approach in its last two training stages. We evaluated SDAKD on
two well-performing super-resolution GANs, GCFSR and Real-ESRGAN. Our
experiments demonstrate consistent improvements over the baselines and SOTA GAN
knowledge distillation methods. The SDAKD source code will be made openly
available upon acceptance of the paper.

Abstract: Diagnosing ocular-induced abnormal head posture (AHP) requires a
comprehensive analysis of both head pose and ocular movements. However,
existing datasets focus on these aspects separately, limiting the development
of integrated diagnostic approaches and restricting AI-driven advancements in
AHP analysis. To address this gap, we introduce PoseGaze-AHP, a novel 3D
dataset that synchronously captures head pose and gaze movement information for
ocular-induced AHP assessment. Structured clinical data were extracted from
medical literature using large language models (LLMs) through an iterative
process with the Claude 3.5 Sonnet model, combining stepwise, hierarchical, and
complex prompting strategies. The extracted records were systematically imputed
and transformed into 3D representations using the Neural Head Avatar (NHA)
framework. The dataset includes 7,920 images generated from two head textures,
covering a broad spectrum of ocular conditions. The extraction method achieved
an overall accuracy of 91.92%, demonstrating its reliability for clinical
dataset construction. PoseGaze-AHP is the first publicly available resource
tailored for AI-driven ocular-induced AHP diagnosis, supporting the development
of accurate and privacy-compliant diagnostic tools.

Motivation: 随着3D扫描和重建技术的发展，动态数字人化身应用广泛，但在采集、压缩和传输过程中容易受到噪声影响，影响用户体验，因此需要有效的质量评估方法。

Method: 首先构建DHQA-4D数据集，包含32个高质量4D人体网格序列和1920个失真样本；然后提出DynaMesh-Rater方法，从投影2D视频提取视觉特征、从裁剪视频提取运动特征、从4D网格提取几何特征，最后使用大语言模型集成这些特征并通过LoRA指令调优预测质量分数。

Conclusion: 该工作为动态4D数字人网格质量评估提供了首个大规模数据集和有效的评估方法，能够同时处理有纹理和无纹理的4D网格，具有重要的应用价值。

Abstract: With the rapid development of 3D scanning and reconstruction technologies,
dynamic digital human avatars based on 4D meshes have become increasingly
popular. A high-precision dynamic digital human avatar can be applied to
various fields such as game production, animation generation, and remote
immersive communication. However, these 4D human avatar meshes are prone to
being degraded by various types of noise during the processes of collection,
compression, and transmission, thereby affecting the viewing experience of
users. In light of this fact, quality assessment of dynamic 4D digital humans
becomes increasingly important. In this paper, we first propose a large-scale
dynamic digital human quality assessment dataset, DHQA-4D, which contains 32
high-quality real-scanned 4D human mesh sequences, 1920 distorted textured 4D
human meshes degraded by 11 textured distortions, as well as their
corresponding textured and non-textured mean opinion scores (MOSs). Equipped
with DHQA-4D dataset, we analyze the influence of different types of distortion
on human perception for textured dynamic 4D meshes and non-textured dynamic 4D
meshes. Additionally, we propose DynaMesh-Rater, a novel large multimodal model
(LMM) based approach that is able to assess both textured 4D meshes and
non-textured 4D meshes. Concretely, DynaMesh-Rater elaborately extracts
multi-dimensional features, including visual features from a projected 2D
video, motion features from cropped video clips, and geometry features from the
4D human mesh to provide comprehensive quality-related information. Then we
utilize a LMM model to integrate the multi-dimensional features and conduct a
LoRA-based instruction tuning technique to teach the LMM model to predict the
quality scores. Extensive experimental results on the DHQA-4D dataset
demonstrate the superiority of our DynaMesh-Rater method over previous quality
assessment methods.

TL;DR: 提出基于自适应空间特征融合(ASFF)的改进ResNet-50模型，用于皮肤癌分类，在ISIC 2020数据集上达到93.18%准确率，优于5种经典CNN模型。

Motivation: 皮肤癌分类面临类间相似性高、类内变异性大和图像噪声等挑战，需要改进特征表示能力并减少过拟合。

Method: 在ResNet-50基础上引入自适应特征融合机制，采用双分支设计融合高层语义和中层细节特征，通过全局平均池化和全连接层生成自适应权重进行加权融合。

Result: 在3297张良性和恶性皮肤病变图像上测试，准确率93.18%，AUC值在P-R和ROC曲线上分别为0.9670和0.9717，各项指标均优于对比模型。

Conclusion: 该方法为计算机辅助皮肤癌诊断提供了更有效和高效的解决方案，Grad-CAM验证了模型能自适应关注病变相关区域并抑制背景噪声。

Abstract: Skin cancer classification remains a challenging problem due to high
inter-class similarity, intra-class variability, and image noise in dermoscopic
images. To address these issues, we propose an improved ResNet-50 model
enhanced with Adaptive Spatial Feature Fusion (ASFF), which adaptively
integrates multi-scale semantic and surface features to improve feature
representation and reduce overfitting. The ResNet-50 model is enhanced with an
adaptive feature fusion mechanism to achieve more effective multi-scale feature
extraction and improve overall performance. Specifically, a dual-branch design
fuses high-level semantic and mid-level detail features, which are processed
through global average pooling and fully connected layers to generate adaptive
weights for weighted fusion, thereby strengthening feature learning and
reducing the impact of noise on classification. The method is evaluated on a
subset of the ISIC 2020 dataset containing 3297 benign and malignant skin
lesion images. Experimental results show that the proposed ASFF-based ResNet-50
achieves the best overall performance compared with 5 classic convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) models. The proposed model reached an accuracy of 93.18%
along with higher precision, recall, specificity, and F1 score. The improved
model achieves an AUC value of 0.9670 and 0.9717 in the P-R and ROC curve,
respectively. Then, the evaluation based on Grad-CAM further proved that the
improved model adaptively focuses on lesion-relevant regions while suppressing
irrelevant background information, thereby validating its enhanced feature
learning capability from a deep representation perspective. These findings
demonstrate that the proposed approach provides a more effective and efficient
solution for computer-aided skin cancer diagnosis.

Abstract: Aims Late diagnosis of Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OSCC) contributes
significantly to its high global mortality rate, with over 50\% of cases
detected at advanced stages and a 5-year survival rate below 50\% according to
WHO statistics. This study aims to improve early detection of OSCC by
developing a multimodal deep learning framework that integrates clinical,
radiological, and histopathological images using a weighted ensemble of
DenseNet-121 convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Material and Methods A
retrospective study was conducted using publicly available datasets
representing three distinct medical imaging modalities. Each modality-specific
dataset was used to train a DenseNet-121 CNN via transfer learning.
Augmentation and modality-specific preprocessing were applied to increase
robustness. Predictions were fused using a validation-weighted ensemble
strategy. Evaluation was performed using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.
Results High validation accuracy was achieved for radiological (100\%) and
histopathological (95.12\%) modalities, with clinical images performing lower
(63.10\%) due to visual heterogeneity. The ensemble model demonstrated improved
diagnostic robustness with an overall accuracy of 84.58\% on a multimodal
validation dataset of 55 samples. Conclusion The multimodal ensemble framework
bridges gaps in the current diagnostic workflow by offering a non-invasive,
AI-assisted triage tool that enhances early identification of high-risk
lesions. It supports clinicians in decision-making, aligning with global
oncology guidelines to reduce diagnostic delays and improve patient outcomes.

Abstract: In recent years, with the rapid development of powerful multimodal large
language models (MLLMs), explainable image quality assessment (IQA) has
gradually become popular, aiming at providing quality-related descriptions and
answers of images. To achieve this goal, recent methods seek to construct a
large-scale instruction tuning dataset to empower the MLLM with quality
perception ability following the well-known scaling law. However, a large
amount of instruction tuning data may cause substantial computational costs and
redundant data, which in turn will cause harm to the performance of the model.
To cope with this problem, in this paper, we challenge the scaling law and
systematically investigate the role of data quality of the instruction tuning
dataset for explainable IQA. Using a powerful pre-trained MLLM, we first
investigate the changes in model performance after fine-tuning with different
sizes of instruction tuning data. We find that selecting a subset of the data
set randomly using an appropriate ratio can even lead to better results than
training with the entire instruction tuning dataset, demonstrating the
redundancy of current explainable IQA instruction tuning data. Beyond randomly
sampling a subset, we propose a clustering-based data selection framework with
three stages: clustering feature extraction, cluster quota allocation, and
cluster sampling strategy. Then we systematically analyze the choices of each
stage and propose a simple but efficient data selection method IQA-Select for
explainable IQA. The experimental results demonstrate that IQA-Select can
achieve 102.1% and 103.7% performance of full fine-tuning using only 10%
selected data in Q-Bench and AesBench respectively, significantly reducing
computational costs while achieving better performance.

Motivation: 传统VLA模型由于受限于稀缺的窄领域数据而泛化能力差，双系统方法又受到动作模块语义模糊性的限制，需要在新环境中重新收集数据进行微调。

Method: 使用稀疏3D路径点作为中间表示，VLM生成粗略3D路径点，通用动作专家通过采样实时点云观测将其细化为密集可执行动作序列，采用"动作预训练、点云微调"的训练范式。

Result: 结合了VLM在视觉理解和规划方面的广泛泛化能力与动作专家在细粒度动作级别的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了VLM在物理世界中的规划与执行挑战，实现了更好的泛化性能和训练效率。

Abstract: Although Vision-Language Models (VLM) have demonstrated impressive planning
and reasoning capabilities, translating these abilities into the physical world
introduces significant challenges. Conventional Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
models, which integrate reasoning and action into a monolithic architecture,
generalize poorly because they are constrained by scarce, narrow-domain data.
While recent dual-system approaches attempt to decouple "thinking" from
"acting", they are often constrained by semantic ambiguities within the action
module. This ambiguity makes large-scale, cross-task training infeasible.
Consequently, these systems typically necessitate fine-tuning on newly
collected data when deployed to novel environments, and the cooperation
mechanism between the two systems remains ill-defined. To address these
limitations, we introduce, for the first time, a framework centered around a
generalizable action expert. Our approach utilizes sparse 3D trajectories as an
intermediate representation, effectively bridging the high-level planning
capabilities of the VLM with the low-level physical action module. During the
planning phase, the VLM is only required to generate coarse 3D waypoints. These
waypoints are then processed by our generalizable action expert, which refines
them into dense, executable action sequences by sampling real-time point cloud
observations of the environment. To promote training efficiency and robust
generalization, we introduce a novel "Action Pre-training, Pointcloud
Fine-tuning" paradigm. Our method combines the broad generalization
capabilities of VLMs in visual understanding and planning with the
fine-grained, action-level generalization of action expert.

intervention technique. We also address a key limitation in existing datasets
by developing more comprehensive and precise class description benchmarks. We
validate the effectiveness of our method through extensive experimentation

TL;DR: 本文对自动驾驶感知系统在雾天条件下的去雾方法进行了系统性实证研究，评估了传统滤波器、现代去雾网络、链式组合以及视觉语言模型等多种方法在图像质量和下游检测分割任务上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶感知系统在雾天条件下特别脆弱，光线散射会降低对比度并模糊关键细节。虽然存在多种去雾方法，但图像保真度的提升并不总能转化为更好的下游检测和分割性能，且先前评估多依赖合成数据，对真实世界适用性存疑。

Method: 使用Foggy Cityscapes数据集，评估了四类方法：(i)传统滤波器，(ii)现代去雾网络，(iii)链式变体（滤波器→模型，模型→滤波器），(iv)基于提示的视觉语言图像编辑模型直接应用于雾天图像。评估指标包括图像质量和下游目标检测(mAP)、分割(PQ、RQ、SQ)性能。

Result: 分析揭示了去雾何时有效、链式方法何时产生协同效应或退化，以及VLM编辑器与专用方法的比较。VLM评判的定性评分与任务指标有强相关性，特别是与mAP。

Conclusion: 研究结果为去雾方法建立了一个透明、任务导向的基准，并明确了在何种条件下预处理能真正改善恶劣天气下的自动驾驶感知性能。

Abstract: Autonomous driving perception systems are particularly vulnerable in foggy
conditions, where light scattering reduces contrast and obscures fine details
critical for safe operation. While numerous defogging methods exist-from
handcrafted filters to learned restoration models-improvements in image
fidelity do not consistently translate into better downstream detection and
segmentation. Moreover, prior evaluations often rely on synthetic data, leaving
questions about real-world transferability. We present a structured empirical
study that benchmarks a comprehensive set of pipelines, including (i) classical
filters, (ii) modern defogging networks, (iii) chained variants
(filter$\rightarrow$model, model$\rightarrow$filter), and (iv) prompt-driven
visual--language image editing models (VLM) applied directly to foggy images.
Using Foggy Cityscapes, we assess both image quality and downstream performance
on object detection (mAP) and segmentation (PQ, RQ, SQ). Our analysis reveals
when defogging helps, when chaining yields synergy or degradation, and how
VLM-based editors compare to dedicated approaches. In addition, we evaluate
qualitative rubric-based scores from a VLM judge and quantify their alignment
with task metrics, showing strong correlations with mAP. Together, these
results establish a transparent, task-oriented benchmark for defogging methods
and highlight the conditions under which preprocessing genuinely improves
autonomous perception in adverse weather.

TL;DR: CAMEO是一个用于通用人体运动视频生成的分层框架，通过连接文本到运动模型和条件视频扩散模型，解决了训练和推理过程中的对齐问题，并引入了相机感知条件模块来自动选择与文本对齐的视角。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管视频扩散模型发展迅速，但在通用人体视频生成方面的应用仍未被充分探索，大多数工作局限于图像到视频设置或特定领域（如舞蹈视频）。

Method: 提出了CAMEO分层框架，分析并准备文本提示和视觉条件来有效训练视频扩散模型，确保运动描述、条件信号和生成视频之间的鲁棒对齐，并引入相机感知条件模块连接两个阶段。

Result: 在MovieGen基准和新引入的基准上证明了方法的有效性，并展示了其在多样化用例中的通用性。

Conclusion: CAMEO框架成功地将文本到运动模型与条件视频扩散模型相结合，通过精心设计的组件缓解了训练和推理过程中的次优因素，实现了通用人体运动视频生成。

Abstract: Human video generation is becoming an increasingly important task with broad
applications in graphics, entertainment, and embodied AI. Despite the rapid
progress of video diffusion models (VDMs), their use for general-purpose human
video generation remains underexplored, with most works constrained to
image-to-video setups or narrow domains like dance videos. In this work, we
propose CAMEO, a cascaded framework for general human motion video generation.
It seamlessly bridges Text-to-Motion (T2M) models and conditional VDMs,
mitigating suboptimal factors that may arise in this process across both
training and inference through carefully designed components. Specifically, we
analyze and prepare both textual prompts and visual conditions to effectively
train the VDM, ensuring robust alignment between motion descriptions,
conditioning signals, and the generated videos. Furthermore, we introduce a
camera-aware conditioning module that connects the two stages, automatically
selecting viewpoints aligned with the input text to enhance coherence and
reduce manual intervention. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on
both the MovieGen benchmark and a newly introduced benchmark tailored to the
T2M-VDM combination, while highlighting its versatility across diverse use
cases.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OpenFLAME是一个联邦视觉定位系统(VPS)后端，允许独立组织为各自空间建立和维护独立的VPS服务，解决集中式VPS在隐私、监管和维护方面的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 集中式VPS无法覆盖私人室内空间，存在隐私担忧、监管限制和维护瓶颈。需要分布式解决方案来支持更大范围的AR应用。

Method: 采用联邦图像定位概念，通过分片VPS服务，在不共享私有数据的情况下管理和合并跨地图数据。

Result: 实现了分布式VPS维护、室内3D扫描访问控制，并促进了更大覆盖范围。

Conclusion: 联邦VPS方法能够解决集中式系统的局限性，为世界规模的AR应用提供可行的定位后端解决方案。

Abstract: World-scale augmented reality (AR) applications need a ubiquitous 6DoF
localization backend to anchor content to the real world consistently across
devices. Large organizations such as Google and Niantic are 3D scanning outdoor
public spaces in order to build their own Visual Positioning Systems (VPS).
These centralized VPS solutions fail to meet the needs of many future AR
applications -- they do not cover private indoor spaces because of privacy
concerns, regulations, and the labor bottleneck of updating and maintaining 3D
scans. In this paper, we present OpenFLAME, a federated VPS backend that allows
independent organizations to 3D scan and maintain a separate VPS service for
their own spaces. This enables access control of indoor 3D scans, distributed
maintenance of the VPS backend, and encourages larger coverage. Sharding of VPS
services introduces several unique challenges -- coherency of localization
results across spaces, quality control of VPS services, selection of the right
VPS service for a location, and many others. We introduce the concept of
federated image-based localization and provide reference solutions for managing
and merging data across maps without sharing private data.

TL;DR: 开发了一个结合CNN-LSTM模型提取生物力学特征和大型语言模型生成反馈的框架，用于网球击球分析，旨在提供技术上准确且可操作的反馈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有系统未能将生物力学洞察转化为对球员和教练有意义且可操作的语言反馈，本研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 使用CNN-LSTM模型从运动数据中提取关键生物力学特征（如关节角度、肢体速度和动力链模式），并利用大型语言模型基于这些特征生成反馈。

Result: 基于THETIS数据集和特征提取技术，该方法旨在产生技术上准确、生物力学基础扎实且对最终用户可操作的反馈。

Conclusion: 该框架在分类性能和可解释性方面进行了评估，弥合了可解释AI与运动生物力学之间的差距。

Abstract: Automated tennis stroke analysis has advanced significantly with the
integration of biomechanical motion cues alongside deep learning techniques,
enhancing stroke classification accuracy and player performance evaluation.
Despite these advancements, existing systems often fail to connect
biomechanical insights with actionable language feedback that is both
accessible and meaningful to players and coaches. This research project
addresses this gap by developing a novel framework that extracts key
biomechanical features (such as joint angles, limb velocities, and kinetic
chain patterns) from motion data using Convolutional Neural Network Long
Short-Term Memory (CNN-LSTM)-based models. These features are analyzed for
relationships influencing stroke effectiveness and injury risk, forming the
basis for feedback generation using large language models (LLMs). Leveraging
the THETIS dataset and feature extraction techniques, our approach aims to
produce feedback that is technically accurate, biomechanically grounded, and
actionable for end-users. The experimental setup evaluates this framework on
classification performance and interpretability, bridging the gap between
explainable AI and sports biomechanics.

TL;DR: TimeWarp方法通过创建针对性的合成时间数据集来改进视频大语言模型的细粒度时间理解能力，在七个基准测试中显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频大语言模型在需要细粒度时间理解的任务上表现不佳，因为现有微调数据集缺乏视觉复杂性和时间细节，导致模型过度依赖语言推理而非真正理解视频动态。

Method: 提出TimeWarp方法，系统性地创建目标合成时间数据集来微调模型，使其更关注输入视频内容。构建大规模偏好数据集，捕捉常被忽略的复杂时间动态，将模型响应基于视觉和时间信息。

Result: 应用该方法后，现有模型在时间理解基准测试中的性能显著提升，在七个基准测试中实现了绝对性能改进。

Conclusion: TimeWarp方法通过针对性数据集有效提升了视频大语言模型的时间理解能力，证明了所提数据集在推进视频大语言模型时间理解方面的有效性。

Abstract: While Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
performance across general video understanding benchmarks-particularly in video
captioning and descriptive tasks-they consistently underperform on tasks that
require fine-grained temporal understanding. This limitation arises due to the
lack of visual complexity and temporal nuance in current fine-tuning datasets,
leading these models to rely heavily on language-based reasoning rather than
truly understanding video dynamics. In this work, we propose TimeWarp, a
systematic method to create a targeted synthetic temporal dataset to fine-tune
the model's responses to encourage it to focus on the given input video. We
introduce a large-scale preference dataset, created using TimeWarp, that
captures intricate temporal dynamics often overlooked, grounding the model's
responses to visual and temporal information. We demonstrate that when our
method is applied to existing models, it significantly improves performance on
temporal understanding benchmarks, highlighting the effectiveness of our
proposed datasets in advancing temporal understanding in Video-LLMs, resulting
in an absolute improvement in performance across seven benchmarks. Code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在生物医学视觉语言模型中扩展文本编码器上下文长度的影响，发现更长的上下文（512个token）能显著提升检索和分类性能，并提出了BIOMEDICA-LongCAP数据集和BMC-LongCLIP模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型通常预训练时使用短文本窗口（<77个token），这导致长格式生物医学标题被截断。然而，大规模开源文献中的生物医学标题有很大部分远超77个token，因此需要研究长上下文预训练的影响。

Method: 扩展视觉语言模型中文本编码器的上下文长度，创建BIOMEDICA-LongCAP数据集（包含100万图像-标题对），并训练BMC-LongCLIP模型，其文本编码器支持最多512个token的窗口。

Result: BMC-LongCLIP将上下文容量扩展了6.6倍，token浪费从55%降至2.2%。在长标题检索基准测试中，Recall@1获得高达+30%的绝对提升，分类平均提升+2%，且收敛速度比短上下文模型更快。

Conclusion: 长上下文建模是推进生物医学视觉语言模型发展的有前景方向，更长的上下文能够利用长格式标题提供的额外监督信息，显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: Embedding vision-language models (VLMs) are typically pretrained with short
text windows (<77 tokens), which forces the truncation of long-format captions.
Yet, the distribution of biomedical captions from large-scale open source
literature reveals that a huge portion of captions far exceed 77 tokens. To
this end, we investigate the impact of pretraining on long-format biomedical
captions by extending the context length of text encoders in VLMs. We find that
longer context (thus, enabling additional supervision provided in long-format
captions) correlates with better retrieval and classification performance.
Given this finding, we introduce BIOMEDICA-LongCAP, a dataset of 1M
image-caption pairs enriched with context-aware descriptions from full-text
articles, providing longer and additional textual supervision. Using
BIOMEDICA-LongCAP, we train BMC-LongCLIP, a long-context biomedical VLM with a
text encoder supporting windows of up to 512 tokens. Our model extends context
capacity by 6.6x, reducing token waste from 55% to just 2.2%. On long-caption
retrieval benchmarks, BMC-LongCLIP achieves up to +30% absolute gains in
Recall@1 and +2% average improvements in classification, while also converging
faster than short-context. Our results demonstrate that long-context modeling
is a promising direction for advancing biomedical VLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出可控伪标签生成(CPG)框架，解决长尾半监督学习中未标记数据分布未知的问题，通过动态控制伪标签选择确保标记数据集遵循已知分布，显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有长尾半监督学习方法假设未标记数据遵循特定分布，但实际上未标记数据分布未知且可能任意，这限制了方法的实际应用效果。

Method: 采用可控自增强优化循环：动态可控过滤机制选择可靠伪标签，基于更新后标记数据分布构建贝叶斯最优分类器，类感知自适应增强模块改善少数类表示，辅助分支最大化数据利用率。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上评估，CPG实现了一致的性能提升，在准确率上超过最先进方法高达15.97%。

Conclusion: CPG框架有效解决了未标记数据分布未知的问题，通过可控伪标签生成和优化循环显著降低了泛化误差，为长尾半监督学习提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Current long-tailed semi-supervised learning methods assume that labeled data
exhibit a long-tailed distribution, and unlabeled data adhere to a typical
predefined distribution (i.e., long-tailed, uniform, or inverse long-tailed).
However, the distribution of the unlabeled data is generally unknown and may
follow an arbitrary distribution. To tackle this challenge, we propose a
Controllable Pseudo-label Generation (CPG) framework, expanding the labeled
dataset with the progressively identified reliable pseudo-labels from the
unlabeled dataset and training the model on the updated labeled dataset with a
known distribution, making it unaffected by the unlabeled data distribution.
Specifically, CPG operates through a controllable self-reinforcing optimization
cycle: (i) at each training step, our dynamic controllable filtering mechanism
selectively incorporates reliable pseudo-labels from the unlabeled dataset into
the labeled dataset, ensuring that the updated labeled dataset follows a known
distribution; (ii) we then construct a Bayes-optimal classifier using logit
adjustment based on the updated labeled data distribution; (iii) this improved
classifier subsequently helps identify more reliable pseudo-labels in the next
training step. We further theoretically prove that this optimization cycle can
significantly reduce the generalization error under some conditions.
Additionally, we propose a class-aware adaptive augmentation module to further
improve the representation of minority classes, and an auxiliary branch to
maximize data utilization by leveraging all labeled and unlabeled samples.
Comprehensive evaluations on various commonly used benchmark datasets show that
CPG achieves consistent improvements, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by up
to \textbf{15.97\%} in accuracy. The code is available at
https://github.com/yaxinhou/CPG.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有OCR系统在处理越南历史文献中的汉喃文本时，难以应对退化扫描、非标准字形和手写变体等问题，限制了历史文献数字化和跨语言语义研究。

Method: 对PaddleOCRv5进行微调，使用精选的越南汉喃手稿子集重新训练文本识别模块，构建完整的训练流程包括预处理、LMDB转换、评估和可视化。

Result: 微调后模型在汉喃文本识别上取得显著提升，准确率从37.5%提高到50.0%，在噪声图像条件下表现尤为突出。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了汉喃文本识别性能，开发的交互式演示工具支持汉越语义对齐、机器翻译和历史语言学研究等下游应用。

Abstract: Recognizing and processing Classical Chinese (Han-Nom) texts play a vital
role in digitizing Vietnamese historical documents and enabling cross-lingual
semantic research. However, existing OCR systems struggle with degraded scans,
non-standard glyphs, and handwriting variations common in ancient sources. In
this work, we propose a fine-tuning approach for PaddleOCRv5 to improve
character recognition on Han-Nom texts. We retrain the text recognition module
using a curated subset of ancient Vietnamese Chinese manuscripts, supported by
a full training pipeline covering preprocessing, LMDB conversion, evaluation,
and visualization. Experimental results show a significant improvement over the
base model, with exact accuracy increasing from 37.5 percent to 50.0 percent,
particularly under noisy image conditions. Furthermore, we develop an
interactive demo that visually compares pre- and post-fine-tuning recognition
results, facilitating downstream applications such as Han-Vietnamese semantic
alignment, machine translation, and historical linguistics research. The demo

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MetaSeg是一个基于元学习的隐式神经表示框架，用于医学图像分割，能够在少量参数下达到与U-Net相当的分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 隐式神经表示(INRs)在信号表示方面表现出色，但天然不适合分割等预测任务，需要学习信号分布上的语义结构。

Method: 使用一个基础INR同时预测像素强度值和类别标签，通过元学习在训练数据集上找到最优初始参数，使INR能够通过微调适应未见测试图像并自动解码类别标签。

Result: 在2D和3D脑部MRI分割任务上评估，Dice分数与常用U-Net模型相当，但参数量减少了90%。

Conclusion: MetaSeg为医学图像分割提供了一个新颖、可扩展的替代方案，相比传统的U-Net和视觉变换器等资源密集型架构更具优势。

Abstract: Implicit neural representations (INRs) have achieved remarkable successes in
learning expressive yet compact signal representations. However, they are not
naturally amenable to predictive tasks such as segmentation, where they must
learn semantic structures over a distribution of signals. In this study, we
introduce MetaSeg, a meta-learning framework to train INRs for medical image
segmentation. MetaSeg uses an underlying INR that simultaneously predicts per
pixel intensity values and class labels. It then uses a meta-learning procedure
to find optimal initial parameters for this INR over a training dataset of
images and segmentation maps, such that the INR can simply be fine-tuned to fit
pixels of an unseen test image, and automatically decode its class labels. We
evaluated MetaSeg on 2D and 3D brain MRI segmentation tasks and report Dice
scores comparable to commonly used U-Net models, but with $90\%$ fewer
parameters. MetaSeg offers a fresh, scalable alternative to traditional
resource-heavy architectures such as U-Nets and vision transformers for medical
image segmentation. Our project is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长视频问答中计算效率低下的问题，传统方法处理长视频需要大量计算资源，ViTL旨在在固定token预算下实现更高效的视频理解。

Method: 两阶段框架：1) 低帧率浏览定位问题相关时间片段；2) 基于跨度感知的token重新分配，在高有效帧率下回答问题。使用交错组相对目标进行端到端训练。

Result: 在固定token预算下，ViTL在长视频问答和时间定位任务上达到8.6%的性能提升，同时减少50%的帧输入。跨度感知token重新分配始终优于均匀采样。

Conclusion: ViTL和配套数据集提供了一个可解释、计算高效的解决方案，适用于可扩展的长视频问答任务。

Abstract: We present \emph{Video-in-the-Loop} (ViTL), a two-stage long-video QA
framework that preserves a fixed token budget by first \emph{localizing}
question-relevant interval(s) with a low-fps skim and then \emph{answering} via
span-aware reallocation of visual tokens at higher effective frame rate,
emitting an interleaved output with both spans and the final option for direct
attribution. We also introduce \dataname{}, which converts description based
event graphs into \emph{span-grounded} multiple-choice QA by pairing each
question with \emph{ground-truth} time span(s) and related reasoning. ViTL is
trained end-to-end with an interleaved group-relative objective that couples
temporal IoU for localization with answer correctness, allowing credit to flow
from answers back to spans without increasing compute. Under fixed token
budgets, ViTL attains up to 8.6% with 50% less frame input on long-video QA and
temporal grounding (e.g., Charades-STA, ActivityNet-Captions) and ablations
show that span-aware token reallocation consistently surpasses uniform
sampling. Together, \dataname{} and ViTL provide an interpretable,
compute-efficient recipe for scalable long-video QA.

Motivation: 现有假新闻检测器因训练数据有限且多样性不足，导致模式偏见和性能受限。真实场景中视频素材与伪造新闻事件存在复杂多对多关系，但现有数据集未能充分反映这种关系。

Method: 使用多个LLM驱动的四种伪造类别管道来模拟新闻视频创作过程，结合基于不确定性采样的主动学习策略在训练中选择有用的增强样本。

Result: 在两个基准数据集上的实验结果表明，AgentAug能持续提升短视频假新闻检测器的性能。

Conclusion: AgentAug框架通过数据增强有效解决了假新闻视频检测中的数据稀疏和多样性不足问题，显著提升了检测性能。

Abstract: The emergence of fake news on short video platforms has become a new
significant societal concern, necessitating automatic video-news-specific
detection. Current detectors primarily rely on pattern-based features to
separate fake news videos from real ones. However, limited and less diversified
training data lead to biased patterns and hinder their performance. This
weakness stems from the complex many-to-many relationships between video
material segments and fabricated news events in real-world scenarios: a single
video clip can be utilized in multiple ways to create different fake
narratives, while a single fabricated event often combines multiple distinct
video segments. However, existing datasets do not adequately reflect such
relationships due to the difficulty of collecting and annotating large-scale
real-world data, resulting in sparse coverage and non-comprehensive learning of
the characteristics of potential fake news video creation. To address this
issue, we propose a data augmentation framework, AgentAug, that generates
diverse fake news videos by simulating typical creative processes. AgentAug
implements multiple LLM-driven pipelines of four fabrication categories for
news video creation, combined with an active learning strategy based on
uncertainty sampling to select the potentially useful augmented samples during
training. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that
AgentAug consistently improves the performance of short video fake news
detectors.

Abstract: Recent advances in image editing have shifted from manual pixel manipulation
to employing deep learning methods like stable diffusion models, which now
leverage cross-attention mechanisms for text-driven control. This transition
has simplified the editing process but also introduced variability in results,
such as inconsistent hair color changes. Our research aims to enhance the
precision and reliability of prompt-to-prompt image editing frameworks by
exploring and optimizing hyperparameters. We present a comprehensive study of
the "word swap" method, develop an "attention re-weight method" for better
adaptability, and propose the "CL P2P" framework to address existing
limitations like cycle inconsistency. This work contributes to understanding
and improving the interaction between hyperparameter settings and the
architectural choices of neural network models, specifically their attention

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在图形用户界面系统中的实际应用受到视觉定位可靠性的限制，无法准确执行指针级操作如点击或拖拽。

Method: 引入GUI-Spotlight模型，通过动态调用多个专用工具迭代缩小屏幕相关区域，提高视觉定位准确性。

Result: 在ScreenSpot-Pro基准测试中，仅使用18.5K训练样本的GUI-Spotlight达到52.8%准确率，优于V2P-7B（50.6%，9.6M样本）和GTA-1-7B（50.1%，1.56M样本）。

Conclusion: GUI-Spotlight通过迭代聚焦方法有效解决了视觉定位问题，在少量训练数据下实现了优越的性能。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have markedly expanded the
competence of graphical user-interface (GUI) systems, propelling them beyond
controlled simulations into complex, real-world environments across diverse
platforms. However, practical usefulness is still bounded by the reliability of
visual grounding, i.e., mapping textual references to exact on-screen elements.
This limitation prevents the system from accurately performing pointer-level
actions such as clicking or dragging. To address it, we introduce GUI-Spotlight
-- a model trained for image-grounded reasoning that dynamically invokes
multiple specialized tools to iteratively narrow its focus to the relevant
region of the screen, thereby substantially improving visual grounding
accuracy. On the ScreenSpot-Pro benchmark, GUI-Spotlight trained with only
18.5K training samples achieves 52.8\% accuracy, surpassing V2P-7B (50.6\% with
9.6M training samples) and GTA-1-7B (50.1\% with 1.56M training samples).

Abstract: Post-training quantization for reducing the storage of deep neural network
models has been demonstrated to be an effective way in various tasks. However,
low-bit quantization while maintaining model accuracy is a challenging problem.
In this paper, we present a range estimation method to improve the quantization
performance for post-training quantization. We model the range estimation into
an optimization problem of minimizing quantization errors by layer-wise local
minima. We prove this problem is locally convex and present an efficient search
algorithm to find the optimal solution. We propose the application of the above
search algorithm to the transformed weights space to do further improvement in
practice. Our experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art performance generally on top-1 accuracy for image
classification tasks on the ResNet series models and Inception-v3 model. The
experimental results show that the proposed method has almost no loss of top-1
accuracy in 8-bit and 6-bit settings for image classifications, and the
accuracy of 4-bit quantization is also significantly improved. The code is

Motivation: 解决现有3D资产检索方法存在的两个核心挑战：(i)忽略空间、语义和风格约束的不一致资产检索；(ii)缺乏专门为3D资产检索设计的标准化检索范式。

Method: 提出灵活的三模态检索机制，支持文本、图像和3D模态的任意组合查询，通过ESSGNN等变布局编码器联合建模对象级特征和场景级布局结构。

Conclusion: MetaFind通过三模态组合检索和等变布局编码，有效提升了3D资产检索的空间和风格一致性，支持迭代式场景构建。

Abstract: We present MetaFind, a scene-aware tri-modal compositional retrieval
framework designed to enhance scene generation in the metaverse by retrieving
3D assets from large-scale repositories. MetaFind addresses two core
challenges: (i) inconsistent asset retrieval that overlooks spatial, semantic,
and stylistic constraints, and (ii) the absence of a standardized retrieval
paradigm specifically tailored for 3D asset retrieval, as existing approaches
mainly rely on general-purpose 3D shape representation models. Our key
innovation is a flexible retrieval mechanism that supports arbitrary
combinations of text, image, and 3D modalities as queries, enhancing spatial
reasoning and style consistency by jointly modeling object-level features
(including appearance) and scene-level layout structures. Methodologically,
MetaFind introduces a plug-and-play equivariant layout encoder ESSGNN that
captures spatial relationships and object appearance features, ensuring
retrieved 3D assets are contextually and stylistically coherent with the
existing scene, regardless of coordinate frame transformations. The framework

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统二元分类框架忽略了耀斑子类间的序数关系，导致模型在预测阈值附近容易产生误分类。

Method: 在二元交叉熵损失中引入序数加权机制，对阈值附近的错误预测施加更重的惩罚。

Result: 通过整合序数信息，模型能够更好地学习耀斑强度的序数特性，提升整体分类性能。

Conclusion: 序数感知的损失函数能有效改善耀斑预测模型在阈值附近的分类准确性。

Abstract: The prediction of solar flares is typically formulated as a binary
classification task, distinguishing events as either Flare (FL) or No-Flare
(NF) according to a specified threshold (for example, greater than or equal to
C-class, M-class, or X-class). However, this binary framework neglects the
inherent ordinal relationships among the sub-classes contained within each
category (FL and NF). Several studies on solar flare prediction have
empirically shown that the most frequent misclassifications occur near this
prediction threshold. This suggests that the models struggle to differentiate
events that are similar in intensity but fall on opposite sides of the binary
threshold. To mitigate this limitation, we propose a modified loss function
that integrates the ordinal information among the sub-classes of the binarized
flare labels into the conventional binary cross-entropy (BCE) loss. This
approach serves as an ordinality-aware, data-driven regularization method that
penalizes the incorrect predictions of flare events in close proximity to the
prediction threshold more heavily than those away from the boundary during
model optimization. By incorporating ordinal weighting into the loss function,
we aim to enhance the model's learning process by leveraging the ordinal
characteristics of the data, thereby improving its overall performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出QuantDemoire框架，通过异常值感知量化器和频率感知校准策略，解决去摩尔纹模型量化中的性能下降问题，在W4A4量化下比现有方法提升4dB以上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有去摩尔纹深度学习模型需要大量计算资源，难以在边缘设备部署。直接应用现有量化方法会导致严重的性能下降，主要原因是分布异常值和平滑区域表示弱化。

Method: 包含两个关键组件：1) 异常值感知量化器，使用基于采样的范围估计减少激活异常值，并将少量极端权重保留为FP16；2) 频率感知校准策略，在微调过程中强调低中频分量以减轻量化引起的条带伪影。

Result: QuantDemoire在保持质量的同时大幅减少了参数和计算量，在W4A4量化下比现有方法提升超过4dB。

Conclusion: QuantDemoire为去摩尔纹模型提供了一种有效的后训练量化解决方案，能够在边缘设备上高效部署。

Abstract: Demoir\'eing aims to remove moir\'e artifacts that often occur in images.
While recent deep learning-based methods have achieved promising results, they
typically require substantial computational resources, limiting their
deployment on edge devices. Model quantization offers a compelling solution.
However, directly applying existing quantization methods to demoir\'eing models
introduces severe performance degradation. The main reasons are distribution
outliers and weakened representations in smooth regions. To address these
issues, we propose QuantDemoire, a post-training quantization framework
tailored to demoir\'eing. It contains two key components. **First}, we
introduce an outlier-aware quantizer to reduce errors from outliers. It uses
sampling-based range estimation to reduce activation outliers, and keeps a few
extreme weights in FP16 with negligible cost. **Second**, we design a
frequency-aware calibration strategy. It emphasizes low- and mid-frequency
components during fine-tuning, which mitigates banding artifacts caused by
low-bit quantization. Extensive experiments validate that our QuantDemoire
achieves large reductions in parameters and computation while maintaining
quality. Meanwhile, it outperforms existing quantization methods by over **4
dB** on W4A4. Code is released at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决极稀疏视图下CT重建的病态问题和纹理丢失问题，结合生成先验和物理约束提升重建质量。

Method: 结合扩散生成先验（NCSN++ SDE建模）和各向异性TV、核范数（LoRA）多正则化约束，采用ADMM框架，使用2D切片策略配合FFT加速和Tensor并行优化。

Result: 在AAPM-2016、CTHD和LIDC数据集上，TV-LoRA在SSIM、纹理恢复、边缘清晰度和伪影抑制方面均优于基准方法，展现强鲁棒性和泛化性。

Conclusion: 扩散模型+TV-LoRA实现了高保真、高效的3D CT重建，在低剂量稀疏采样场景中具有广泛的临床应用前景。

Abstract: This work presents TV-LoRA, a novel method for low-dose sparse-view CT
reconstruction that combines a diffusion generative prior (NCSN++ with SDE
modeling) and multi-regularization constraints, including anisotropic TV and
nuclear norm (LoRA), within an ADMM framework. To address ill-posedness and
texture loss under extremely sparse views, TV-LoRA integrates generative and
physical constraints, and utilizes a 2D slice-based strategy with FFT
acceleration and tensor-parallel optimization for efficient inference.
Experiments on AAPM-2016, CTHD, and LIDC datasets with
$N_{\mathrm{view}}=8,4,2$ show that TV-LoRA consistently surpasses benchmarks
in SSIM, texture recovery, edge clarity, and artifact suppression,
demonstrating strong robustness and generalizability. Ablation studies confirm
the complementary effects of LoRA regularization and diffusion priors, while
the FFT-PCG module provides a speedup. Overall, Diffusion + TV-LoRA achieves
high-fidelity, efficient 3D CT reconstruction and broad clinical applicability
in low-dose, sparse-sampling scenarios.

Conclusion: 该研究为拓扑映射领域提供了标准化评估框架，促进了该领域的一致性和可复现性研究。

Abstract: Topological mapping offers a compact and robust representation for
navigation, but progress in the field is hindered by the lack of standardized
evaluation metrics, datasets, and protocols. Existing systems are assessed
using different environments and criteria, preventing fair and reproducible
comparisons. Moreover, a key challenge - perceptual aliasing - remains
under-quantified, despite its strong influence on system performance. We
address these gaps by (1) formalizing topological consistency as the
fundamental property of topological maps and showing that localization accuracy
provides an efficient and interpretable surrogate metric, and (2) proposing the
first quantitative measure of dataset ambiguity to enable fair comparisons
across environments. To support this protocol, we curate a diverse benchmark
dataset with calibrated ambiguity levels, implement and release deep-learned
baseline systems, and evaluate them alongside classical methods. Our
experiments and analysis yield new insights into the limitations of current
approaches under perceptual aliasing. All datasets, baselines, and evaluation
tools are fully open-sourced to foster consistent and reproducible research in
topological mapping.

Motivation: 现有事件流估计方法存在两个关键问题：缺乏专门的网格流数据集和方法，以及未充分探索事件数据密度对性能的影响。

Method: 构建HREM高分辨率事件网格流数据集，提出轻量级EEMFlow网络进行网格流估计，并引入CDC模块支持密集光流估计，还开发了ADM模块自适应调整事件数据密度。

Conclusion: 该方法在事件网格流估计任务上表现出色，通过自适应密度处理增强了模型在不同事件密度下的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the problem of event-based meshflow estimation, a
novel task that involves predicting a spatially smooth sparse motion field from
event cameras. To start, we review the state-of-the-art in event-based flow
estimation, highlighting two key areas for further research: i) the lack of
meshflow-specific event datasets and methods, and ii) the underexplored
challenge of event data density. First, we generate a large-scale
High-Resolution Event Meshflow (HREM) dataset, which showcases its superiority
by encompassing the merits of high resolution at 1280x720, handling dynamic
objects and complex motion patterns, and offering both optical flow and
meshflow labels. These aspects have not been fully explored in previous works.
Besides, we propose Efficient Event-based MeshFlow (EEMFlow) network, a
lightweight model featuring a specially crafted encoder-decoder architecture to
facilitate swift and accurate meshflow estimation. Furthermore, we upgrade
EEMFlow network to support dense event optical flow, in which a
Confidence-induced Detail Completion (CDC) module is proposed to preserve sharp
motion boundaries. We conduct comprehensive experiments to show the exceptional
performance and runtime efficiency (30x faster) of our EEMFlow model compared
to the recent state-of-the-art flow method. As an extension, we expand HREM
into HREM+, a multi-density event dataset contributing to a thorough study of
the robustness of existing methods across data with varying densities, and
propose an Adaptive Density Module (ADM) to adjust the density of input event
data to a more optimal range, enhancing the model's generalization ability. We
empirically demonstrate that ADM helps to significantly improve the performance
of EEMFlow and EEMFlow+ by 8% and 10%, respectively. Code and dataset are
released at https://github.com/boomluo02/EEMFlowPlus.

Conclusion: 该方法简单而有效，通过预训练策略和采样指导机制解决了现有方法的局限性，在6D物体姿态估计任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Latest diffusion models have shown promising results in category-level 6D
object pose estimation by modeling the conditional pose distribution with depth
image input. The existing methods, however, suffer from slow convergence during
training, learning its encoder with the diffusion denoising network in
end-to-end fashion, and require an additional network that evaluates sampled
pose hypotheses to filter out low-quality pose candidates. In this paper, we
propose a novel pipeline that tackles these limitations by two key components.
First, the proposed method pretrains the encoder with the direct pose
regression head, and jointly learns the networks via the regression head and
the denoising diffusion head, significantly accelerating training convergence
while achieving higher accuracy. Second, sampling guidance via time-dependent
score scaling is proposed s.t. the exploration-exploitation trade-off is
effectively taken, eliminating the need for the additional evaluation network.
The sampling guidance maintains multi-modal characteristics of symmetric
objects at early denoising steps while ensuring high-quality pose generation at
final steps. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks including REAL275,
HouseCat6D, and ROPE, demonstrate that the proposed method, simple yet
effective, achieves state-of-the-art accuracies even with single-pose
inference, while being more efficient in both training and inference.

Conclusion: 提出的自主偏好优化方法有效解决了多教师MLLM蒸馏中的概念漂移问题，能够产生鲁棒、一致且可泛化的模型。

Abstract: This paper identifies a critical yet underexplored challenge in distilling
from multimodal large language models (MLLMs): the reasoning trajectories
generated by multiple drifting teachers exhibit concept drift, whereby their
reasoning distributions evolve unpredictably and transmit biases to the student
model, ultimately compromising its performance. To tackle this issue, we
pioneer a theoretical connection between concept drift and knowledge
distillation, casting the non-stationary reasoning dynamics from multiple MLLM
teachers as next-token prediction of multi-stream reasoning trajectories.Guided
by concept drift, we introduce the "learn, compare, critique" paradigm,
culminating in autonomous preference optimization (APO). Under the active
guidance of the teachers, the student model first learns and self-distils
preferred thinking by comparing multiple teachers. It then engages in critical
reflection over the drifting inference from teachers, performing concept
alignment through APO, ultimately yielding a robust, consistent, and
generalizable model.Extensive experiments demonstrate our superior performance
of consistency, robustness and generalization within knowledge distillation.
Besides, we also contributed a large-scale dataset, CXR-MAX (Multi-teachers
Alignment X-rays), comprising 170,982 distilled reasoning trajectories derived
from publicly accessible MLLMs based on MIMIC-CXR. Our code and data are public

Motivation: 传统建筑安全巡检方法效率低下，需要处理大量信息。现有应用存在响应不相关、模态输入受限和幻觉问题，LLM应用受限于训练数据和实时适应性。

Method: 开发了SiteShield多模态LVLM框架，采用检索增强生成技术，整合视觉和音频输入来生成安全巡检报告。

Result: 在真实数据上，SiteShield的F1得分为0.82，汉明损失为0.04，精确率为0.76，召回率为0.96，表现优于无RAG的单模态LLM。

Conclusion: SiteShield为增强信息检索和安全报告生成效率提供了新的途径。

Abstract: Conventional construction safety inspection methods are often inefficient as
they require navigating through large volume of information. Recent advances in
large vision-language models (LVLMs) provide opportunities to automate safety
inspections through enhanced visual and linguistic understanding. However,
existing applications face limitations including irrelevant or unspecific
responses, restricted modal inputs and hallucinations. Utilisation of Large
Language Models (LLMs) for this purpose is constrained by availability of
training data and frequently lack real-time adaptability. This study introduces
SiteShield, a multi-modal LVLM-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
framework for automating construction safety inspection reports by integrating
visual and audio inputs. Using real-world data, SiteShield outperformed
unimodal LLMs without RAG with an F1 score of 0.82, hamming loss of 0.04,
precision of 0.76, and recall of 0.96. The findings indicate that SiteShield
offers a novel pathway to enhance information retrieval and efficiency in
generating safety reports.

TL;DR: BLADE是一种无需先验偏置知识或偏置冲突样本的生成式去偏框架，通过生成模型在偏置域间转换图像并保留任务相关特征，自适应地优化图像以减轻神经网络中的隐式偏置问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经网络容易学习训练数据中的隐式偏置和虚假相关性，现有方法需要偏置先验知识或偏置冲突样本，这在现实场景中往往不切实际。

Method: BLADE首先训练生成模型在偏置域间转换图像并保留任务特征，然后基于图像对偏置的敏感性自适应优化，通过对齐任务特征相同但偏置不同的图像对，同时错开相同偏置的样本来鼓励鲁棒表示。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的评估显示，BLADE显著优于最先进方法，在损坏CIFAR-10数据集的最差组设置下比最接近的基线绝对提升了约18%。

Conclusion: BLADE在无需显式监督的情况下建立了偏置缓解的新基准，展示了开发更鲁棒深度学习模型的潜力。

Abstract: Neural networks have revolutionized numerous fields, yet they remain
vulnerable to a critical flaw: the tendency to learn implicit biases, spurious
correlations between certain attributes and target labels in training data.
These biases are often more prevalent and easier to learn, causing models to
rely on superficial patterns rather than task-relevant features necessary for
generalization. Existing methods typically rely on strong assumptions, such as
prior knowledge of these biases or access to bias-conflicting samples, i.e.,
samples that contradict spurious correlations and counterbalance bias-aligned
samples, samples that conform to these spurious correlations. However, such
assumptions are often impractical in real-world settings. We propose BLADE
({B}ias-{L}inked {A}daptive {DE}biasing), a generative debiasing framework that
requires no prior knowledge of bias or bias-conflicting samples. BLADE first
trains a generative model to translate images across bias domains while
preserving task-relevant features. Then, it adaptively refines each image with
its synthetic counterpart based on the image's susceptibility to bias. To
encourage robust representations, BLADE aligns an image with its
bias-translated synthetic counterpart that shares task-relevant features but
differs in bias, while misaligning it with samples sharing the same bias. We
evaluate BLADE on multiple benchmark datasets and show that it significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Notably, it exceeds the closest baseline
by an absolute margin of around 18% on the corrupted CIFAR-10 dataset under the
worst group setting, establishing a new benchmark in bias mitigation and
demonstrating its potential for developing more robust deep learning models
without explicit supervision.

Result: 在虚假相关性、输入损坏和大规模基准测试中实现鲁棒性能，提供透明概念级解释

Conclusion: SEG-MIL-CBM通过语义区域推理实现了无需概念标注的空间可解释性，同时保持鲁棒性能

Abstract: Deep neural networks have achieved remarkable success in computer vision;
however, their black-box nature in decision-making limits interpretability and
trust, particularly in safety-critical applications. Interpretability is
crucial in domains where errors have severe consequences. Existing models not
only lack transparency but also risk exploiting unreliable or misleading
features, which undermines both robustness and the validity of their
explanations. Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) aim to improve transparency by
reasoning through human-interpretable concepts. Still, they require costly
concept annotations and lack spatial grounding, often failing to identify which
regions support each concept. We propose SEG-MIL-CBM, a novel framework that
integrates concept-guided image segmentation into an attention-based multiple
instance learning (MIL) framework, where each segmented region is treated as an
instance and the model learns to aggregate evidence across them. By reasoning
over semantically meaningful regions aligned with high-level concepts, our
model highlights task-relevant evidence, down-weights irrelevant cues, and
produces spatially grounded, concept-level explanations without requiring
annotations of concepts or groups. SEG-MIL-CBM achieves robust performance
across settings involving spurious correlations (unintended dependencies
between background and label), input corruptions (perturbations that degrade
visual quality), and large-scale benchmarks, while providing transparent,
concept-level explanations.

Conclusion: HyCa通过维度级缓存策略有效解决了扩散变换器采样瓶颈，实现了显著的加速效果

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers offer state-of-the-art fidelity in image and video
synthesis, but their iterative sampling process remains a major bottleneck due
to the high cost of transformer forward passes at each timestep. To mitigate
this, feature caching has emerged as a training-free acceleration technique
that reuses or forecasts hidden representations. However, existing methods
often apply a uniform caching strategy across all feature dimensions, ignoring
their heterogeneous dynamic behaviors. Therefore, we adopt a new perspective by
modeling hidden feature evolution as a mixture of ODEs across dimensions, and
introduce HyCa, a Hybrid ODE solver inspired caching framework that applies
dimension-wise caching strategies. HyCa achieves near-lossless acceleration
across diverse domains and models, including 5.55 times speedup on FLUX, 5.56
times speedup on HunyuanVideo, 6.24 times speedup on Qwen-Image and
Qwen-Image-Edit without retraining.

Abstract: Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) have been recently utilized to deal
with various blind image restoration (IR) tasks, where they have demonstrated
outstanding performance in terms of perceptual quality. However, the
task-specific nature of existing solutions and the excessive computational
costs related to their training, make such models impractical and challenging
to use for different IR tasks than those that were initially trained for. This
hinders their wider adoption, especially by those who lack access to powerful
computational resources and vast amount of training data. In this work we aim
to address the above issues and enable the successful adoption of DPMs in
practical IR-related applications. Towards this goal, we propose a modular
diffusion probabilistic IR framework (DP-IR), which allows us to combine the
performance benefits of existing pre-trained state-of-the-art IR networks and
generative DPMs, while it requires only the additional training of a relatively
small module (0.7M params) related to the particular IR task of interest.
Moreover, the architecture of the proposed framework allows for a sampling
strategy that leads to at least four times reduction of neural function
evaluations without suffering any performance loss, while it can also be
combined with existing acceleration techniques such as DDIM. We evaluate our
model on four benchmarks for the tasks of burst JDD-SR, dynamic scene
deblurring, and super-resolution. Our method outperforms existing approaches in
terms of perceptual quality while it retains a competitive performance with
respect to fidelity metrics.

Abstract: While text-to-image (T2I) models can synthesize high-quality images, their
performance degrades significantly when prompted with novel or
out-of-distribution (OOD) entities due to inherent knowledge cutoffs. We
introduce World-To-Image, a novel framework that bridges this gap by empowering
T2I generation with agent-driven world knowledge. We design an agent that
dynamically searches the web to retrieve images for concepts unknown to the
base model. This information is then used to perform multimodal prompt
optimization, steering powerful generative backbones toward an accurate
synthesis. Critically, our evaluation goes beyond traditional metrics,
utilizing modern assessments like LLMGrader and ImageReward to measure true
semantic fidelity. Our experiments show that World-To-Image substantially
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both semantic alignment and visual
aesthetics, achieving +8.1% improvement in accuracy-to-prompt on our curated
NICE benchmark. Our framework achieves these results with high efficiency in
less than three iterations, paving the way for T2I systems that can better
reflect the ever-changing real world. Our demo code is available

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅(3DGS)在3D重建和渲染方面表现出色，但每个高斯只能表示单一颜色和简单椭球体，表达能力有限。本文旨在通过纹理映射增强高斯的表达能力。

Method: 受传统图形学中纹理和alpha映射的启发，为每个高斯添加alpha、RGB或RGBA纹理映射，使高斯能够表示更丰富的纹理模式和几何结构。

Result: 在多种标准基准数据集和自定义捕获上验证，相比现有方法使用相似或更少的高斯数量，实现了图像质量的提升。

Conclusion: 通过纹理映射增强高斯表达能力是有效的，特别是alpha-only纹理映射能显著提升表达能力，RGB纹理映射则能达到最高表达能力。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged as a state-of-the-art 3D
reconstruction and rendering technique due to its high-quality results and fast
training and rendering time. However, pixels covered by the same Gaussian are
always shaded in the same color up to a Gaussian falloff scaling factor.
Furthermore, the finest geometric detail any individual Gaussian can represent
is a simple ellipsoid. These properties of 3DGS greatly limit the expressivity
of individual Gaussian primitives. To address these issues, we draw inspiration
from texture and alpha mapping in traditional graphics and integrate it with
3DGS. Specifically, we propose a new generalized Gaussian appearance
representation that augments each Gaussian with alpha~(A), RGB, or RGBA texture
maps to model spatially varying color and opacity across the extent of each
Gaussian. As such, each Gaussian can represent a richer set of texture patterns
and geometric structures, instead of just a single color and ellipsoid as in
naive Gaussian Splatting. Surprisingly, we found that the expressivity of
Gaussians can be greatly improved by using alpha-only texture maps, and further
augmenting Gaussians with RGB texture maps achieves the highest expressivity.
We validate our method on a wide variety of standard benchmark datasets and our
own custom captures at both the object and scene levels. We demonstrate image
quality improvements over existing methods while using a similar or lower
number of Gaussians.

*Lixuan He,Shikang Zheng,Linfeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了MASC框架，通过构建层次化语义树来优化自回归图像生成模型的词汇表结构，显著提升训练效率和生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自回归模型使用扁平的视觉词汇表，忽略了词嵌入空间的固有结构，导致预测任务复杂、训练效率低下且生成质量受限。

Method: MASC框架使用几何感知距离度量和密度驱动的凝聚构造方法，直接从码本的固有结构中构建层次化语义树，将高维预测任务转化为结构化层次任务。

Result: 训练速度提升高达57%，LlamaGen-XL的FID从2.87降低到2.58，显著改善了生成质量。

Conclusion: 结构化预测空间对于可扩展生成建模与架构创新同等重要，MASC使现有自回归框架能够与最先进方法竞争。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models have shown great promise in image generation, yet
they face a fundamental inefficiency stemming from their core component: a
vast, unstructured vocabulary of visual tokens. This conventional approach
treats tokens as a flat vocabulary, disregarding the intrinsic structure of the
token embedding space where proximity often correlates with semantic
similarity. This oversight results in a highly complex prediction task, which
hinders training efficiency and limits final generation quality. To resolve
this, we propose Manifold-Aligned Semantic Clustering (MASC), a principled
framework that constructs a hierarchical semantic tree directly from the
codebook's intrinsic structure. MASC employs a novel geometry-aware distance
metric and a density-driven agglomerative construction to model the underlying
manifold of the token embeddings. By transforming the flat, high-dimensional
prediction task into a structured, hierarchical one, MASC introduces a
beneficial inductive bias that significantly simplifies the learning problem
for the AR model. MASC is designed as a plug-and-play module, and our extensive
experiments validate its effectiveness: it accelerates training by up to 57%
and significantly improves generation quality, reducing the FID of LlamaGen-XL
from 2.87 to 2.58. MASC elevates existing AR frameworks to be highly
competitive with state-of-the-art methods, establishing that structuring the
prediction space is as crucial as architectural innovation for scalable
generative modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI生成图像的快速增长模糊了真实与合成内容的边界，而现有的视觉语言模型在检测高质量合成图像的细微伪影方面存在不足。

Method: 模仿人类视觉检查，ZoomIn首先扫描图像定位可疑区域，然后对这些放大区域进行聚焦分析。使用MagniFake数据集（20,000张真实和高质量合成图像）进行训练。

Result: 该方法实现了96.39%的准确率，具有强大的泛化能力，并提供基于视觉证据的人类可理解解释。

Conclusion: ZoomIn框架在AI生成图像检测方面既提高了准确性又增强了可解释性，为数字完整性提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid growth of AI-generated imagery has blurred the boundary between
real and synthetic content, raising critical concerns for digital integrity.
Vision-language models (VLMs) offer interpretability through explanations but
often fail to detect subtle artifacts in high-quality synthetic images. We
propose ZoomIn, a two-stage forensic framework that improves both accuracy and
interpretability. Mimicking human visual inspection, ZoomIn first scans an
image to locate suspicious regions and then performs a focused analysis on
these zoomed-in areas to deliver a grounded verdict. To support training, we
introduce MagniFake, a dataset of 20,000 real and high-quality synthetic images
annotated with bounding boxes and forensic explanations, generated through an
automated VLM-based pipeline. Our method achieves 96.39% accuracy with robust
generalization, while providing human-understandable explanations grounded in
visual evidence.

Abstract: The problem of image registration is finding a transformation that aligns two
images, such that the corresponding points are in the same location. This paper
introduces a simple, end-to-end trainable algorithm that is implementable in a
few lines of Python code. The approach is shown to work with very little
training data and training time, while achieving accurate results in some
settings. An example application to stereo vision was trained from 74 images on
a 19x15 input window. With just a dozen lines of Python code this algorithm
excels in brevity and may serve as a good start in related scenarios with
limitations to training data, training time or code complexity.

Motivation: 提高深度学习模型的可访问性，特别是在眼科疾病诊断领域，通过优化卷积层设计来降低计算复杂度，使模型能够在移动设备上运行。

Method: 重新设计和优化卷积层，提出新型ArConv层，构建轻量级通用模型，总参数仅130万。

Result: 在RfMiD数据集上测试，准确率达到93.28%，优于MobileNetV2的92.66%，且模型参数更少。

Conclusion: 通过优化卷积层设计，成功开发了高效轻量的CNN模型，在保持高精度的同时显著降低了计算复杂度，提高了模型在移动设备上的可访问性。

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks are continually evolving, with some efforts
aimed at improving accuracy, others at increasing speed, and some at enhancing
accessibility. Improving accessibility broadens the application of neural
networks across a wider range of tasks, including the detection of eye
diseases. Early diagnosis of eye diseases and consulting an ophthalmologist can
prevent many vision disorders. Given the importance of this issue, various
datasets have been collected from the cornea to facilitate the process of
making neural network models. However, most of the methods introduced in the
past are computationally complex. In this study, we tried to increase the
accessibility of deep neural network models. We did this at the most
fundamental level, specifically by redesigning and optimizing the convolutional
layers. By doing so, we created a new general model that incorporates our novel
convolutional layer named ArConv layers. Thanks to the efficient performance of
this new layer, the model has suitable complexity for use in mobile phones and
can perform the task of diagnosing the presence of disease with high accuracy.
The final model we present contains only 1.3 million parameters. In comparison
to the MobileNetV2 model, which has 2.2 million parameters, our model
demonstrated better accuracy when trained and evaluated on the RfMiD dataset
under identical conditions, achieving an accuracy of 0.9328 versus 0.9266 on
the RfMiD test set.

TL;DR: Kaleido是一个用于照片级真实感神经渲染的生成模型系列，将3D视为视频的特殊子领域，通过序列到序列的图像合成实现生成式视图合成，无需显式3D表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统神经渲染方法对显式3D表示和稀缺相机标注数据的依赖，通过统一3D和视频建模框架，利用大规模视频数据进行预训练，提高空间一致性。

Method: 采用掩码自回归框架和仅解码器的整流流变换器，将3D渲染视为序列到序列任务，支持任意数量参考视图到任意数量目标视图的6自由度生成。

Result: 在多个视图合成基准测试中达到新的最先进水平，在少视图设置中显著优于其他生成方法，在多视图设置中首次匹配逐场景优化方法的质量。

Conclusion: Kaleido通过统一3D和视频建模，利用大规模视频预训练，实现了高质量的生成式神经渲染，减少了对稀缺3D数据的依赖。

Abstract: We present Kaleido, a family of generative models designed for
photorealistic, unified object- and scene-level neural rendering. Kaleido
operates on the principle that 3D can be regarded as a specialised sub-domain
of video, expressed purely as a sequence-to-sequence image synthesis task.
Through a systemic study of scaling sequence-to-sequence generative neural
rendering, we introduce key architectural innovations that enable our model to:
i) perform generative view synthesis without explicit 3D representations; ii)
generate any number of 6-DoF target views conditioned on any number of
reference views via a masked autoregressive framework; and iii) seamlessly
unify 3D and video modelling within a single decoder-only rectified flow
transformer. Within this unified framework, Kaleido leverages large-scale video
data for pre-training, which significantly improves spatial consistency and
reduces reliance on scarce, camera-labelled 3D datasets -- all without any
architectural modifications. Kaleido sets a new state-of-the-art on a range of
view synthesis benchmarks. Its zero-shot performance substantially outperforms
other generative methods in few-view settings, and, for the first time, matches
the quality of per-scene optimisation methods in many-view settings.

TL;DR: 提出CoSSeg-TTA框架，基于nnU-Netv2，结合半监督均值教师方案和领域适应模块，用于Gd-EOB-DTPA增强肝胆期MRI的肝脏分割，在低标注条件下实现优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决对比增强MRI肝脏分割面临的标注数据有限、增强协议异质、跨扫描仪和机构的领域偏移等挑战。传统图像翻译方法存在结构扭曲、训练不稳定等问题，不适合单模态场景。

Method: 基于nnU-Netv2构建紧凑分割框架，采用半监督均值教师方案利用未标注数据，集成随机化直方图风格外观转换和可训练对比感知网络的领域适应模块，并使用持续测试时适应策略。

Result: 框架在nnU-Netv2基线上持续表现更优，获得更高的Dice分数和Hausdorff距离，在低标注条件下对未见领域表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: CoSSeg-TTA框架有效解决了肝脏分割中的领域泛化问题，通过半监督学习和领域适应策略在有限标注数据下实现了优越性能。

Abstract: Accurate liver segmentation from contrast-enhanced MRI is essential for
diagnosis, treatment planning, and disease monitoring. However, it remains
challenging due to limited annotated data, heterogeneous enhancement protocols,
and significant domain shifts across scanners and institutions. Traditional
image-to-image translation frameworks have made great progress in domain
generalization, but their application is not straightforward. For example,
Pix2Pix requires image registration, and cycle-GAN cannot be integrated
seamlessly into segmentation pipelines. Meanwhile, these methods are originally
used to deal with cross-modality scenarios, and often introduce structural
distortions and suffer from unstable training, which may pose drawbacks in our
single-modality scenario. To address these challenges, we propose CoSSeg-TTA, a
compact segmentation framework for the GED4 (Gd-EOB-DTPA enhanced hepatobiliary
phase MRI) modality built upon nnU-Netv2 and enhanced with a semi-supervised
mean teacher scheme to exploit large amounts of unlabeled volumes. A domain
adaptation module, incorporating a randomized histogram-based style appearance
transfer function and a trainable contrast-aware network, enriches domain
diversity and mitigates cross-center variability. Furthermore, a continual
test-time adaptation strategy is employed to improve robustness during
inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework consistently
outperforms the nnU-Netv2 baseline, achieving superior Dice score and Hausdorff
Distance while exhibiting strong generalization to unseen domains under
low-annotation conditions.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于概念解释的对抗补丁防御方法，无需预先知道补丁大小或位置，通过抑制最有影响力的概念激活向量来中和补丁影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的对抗补丁防御方法通常需要预先知道补丁大小或位置，这限制了它们的实际应用。需要开发一种与补丁无关的防御策略。

Method: 利用基于概念的解释来识别和抑制最有影响力的概念激活向量，从而在不进行显式检测的情况下中和补丁效果。

Result: 在Imagenette数据集和ResNet-50模型上的评估显示，该方法在鲁棒性和干净准确率方面均优于最先进的PatchCleanser方法，并在不同补丁大小和位置下保持强劲性能。

Conclusion: 结果表明将可解释性与鲁棒性相结合具有前景，概念驱动的防御策略是对抗对抗补丁攻击的可扩展方法。

Abstract: Adversarial patch attacks pose a practical threat to deep learning models by
forcing targeted misclassifications through localized perturbations, often
realized in the physical world. Existing defenses typically assume prior
knowledge of patch size or location, limiting their applicability. In this
work, we propose a patch-agnostic defense that leverages concept-based
explanations to identify and suppress the most influential concept activation
vectors, thereby neutralizing patch effects without explicit detection.
Evaluated on Imagenette with a ResNet-50, our method achieves higher robust and
clean accuracy than the state-of-the-art PatchCleanser, while maintaining
strong performance across varying patch sizes and locations. Our results
highlight the promise of combining interpretability with robustness and suggest
concept-driven defenses as a scalable strategy for securing machine learning
models against adversarial patch attacks.

TL;DR: 提出Adapt-STformer方法，通过循环可变形Transformer编码器实现灵活的序列长度支持、快速推理和低内存使用，在多个数据集上显著提升召回率并降低时间和内存开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于Transformer的序列视觉位置识别方法注重性能但缺乏灵活性和效率，无法满足实时应用中对可变序列长度、快速推理和低内存使用的需求。

Method: 设计循环可变形Transformer编码器，采用迭代循环机制融合多帧序列信息，支持可变序列长度。

Result: 在Nordland、Oxford和NuScenes数据集上，召回率提升最高17%，序列提取时间减少36%，内存使用降低35%。

Conclusion: Adapt-STformer在保持高性能的同时实现了灵活性和效率的平衡，为实时序列视觉位置识别提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Sequential Visual Place Recognition (Seq-VPR) leverages transformers to
capture spatio-temporal features effectively; however, existing approaches
prioritize performance at the expense of flexibility and efficiency. In
practice, a transformer-based Seq-VPR model should be flexible to the number of
frames per sequence (seq-length), deliver fast inference, and have low memory
usage to meet real-time constraints. To our knowledge, no existing
transformer-based Seq-VPR method achieves both flexibility and efficiency. To
address this gap, we propose Adapt-STformer, a Seq-VPR method built around our
novel Recurrent Deformable Transformer Encoder (Recurrent-DTE), which uses an
iterative recurrent mechanism to fuse information from multiple sequential
frames. This design naturally supports variable seq-lengths, fast inference,
and low memory usage. Experiments on the Nordland, Oxford, and NuScenes
datasets show that Adapt-STformer boosts recall by up to 17% while reducing
sequence extraction time by 36% and lowering memory usage by 35% compared to
the second-best baseline.

Motivation: 当前大型生成模型在图像编辑和上下文图像生成方面取得进展，但缺乏确保物理一致性的能力，这对于世界模拟相关任务尤为重要。

Method: 将输入和编辑图像视为视频的首尾帧，利用预训练视频生成模型；引入时间推理阶段，在推理时联合去噪目标帧和推理令牌来想象合理的编辑轨迹；推理令牌在几步后被丢弃以避免完整视频渲染的高计算成本。

Result: 在PBench-Edit基准上，ChronoEdit在视觉保真度和物理合理性方面超越了最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: ChronoEdit通过将图像编辑重新定义为视频生成问题，有效解决了物理一致性问题，为需要物理一致性的图像编辑任务提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in large generative models have significantly advanced image
editing and in-context image generation, yet a critical gap remains in ensuring
physical consistency, where edited objects must remain coherent. This
capability is especially vital for world simulation related tasks. In this
paper, we present ChronoEdit, a framework that reframes image editing as a
video generation problem. First, ChronoEdit treats the input and edited images
as the first and last frames of a video, allowing it to leverage large
pretrained video generative models that capture not only object appearance but
also the implicit physics of motion and interaction through learned temporal
consistency. Second, ChronoEdit introduces a temporal reasoning stage that
explicitly performs editing at inference time. Under this setting, the target
frame is jointly denoised with reasoning tokens to imagine a plausible editing
trajectory that constrains the solution space to physically viable
transformations. The reasoning tokens are then dropped after a few steps to
avoid the high computational cost of rendering a full video. To validate
ChronoEdit, we introduce PBench-Edit, a new benchmark of image-prompt pairs for
contexts that require physical consistency, and demonstrate that ChronoEdit
surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in both visual fidelity and physical
plausibility. Code and models for both the 14B and 2B variants of ChronoEdit
will be released on the project page:

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 帕金森病的客观步态评估受限于缺乏大规模、多样化且临床标注的运动数据集，现有数据集规模小且缺乏多样性。

Method: 将RGB视频或运动捕捉数据通过统一预处理流程转换为匿名SMPL网格，支持监督临床评分预测和无监督运动预训练任务。

Result: 运动编码器始终优于手工特征，在CARE-PD上预训练将MPJPE从60.8mm降至7.5mm，PD严重程度macro-F1提升17个百分点。

Conclusion: CARE-PD证明了临床策划的多样化训练数据的价值，数据集和基准代码已发布供非商业研究使用。

Abstract: Objective gait assessment in Parkinson's Disease (PD) is limited by the
absence of large, diverse, and clinically annotated motion datasets. We
introduce CARE-PD, the largest publicly available archive of 3D mesh gait data
for PD, and the first multi-site collection spanning 9 cohorts from 8 clinical
centers. All recordings (RGB video or motion capture) are converted into
anonymized SMPL meshes via a harmonized preprocessing pipeline. CARE-PD
supports two key benchmarks: supervised clinical score prediction (estimating
Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, UPDRS, gait scores) and unsupervised
motion pretext tasks (2D-to-3D keypoint lifting and full-body 3D
reconstruction). Clinical prediction is evaluated under four generalization
protocols: within-dataset, cross-dataset, leave-one-dataset-out, and
multi-dataset in-domain adaptation. To assess clinical relevance, we compare
state-of-the-art motion encoders with a traditional gait-feature baseline,
finding that encoders consistently outperform handcrafted features. Pretraining
on CARE-PD reduces MPJPE (from 60.8mm to 7.5mm) and boosts PD severity macro-F1
by 17 percentage points, underscoring the value of clinically curated, diverse
training data. CARE-PD and all benchmark code are released for non-commercial

Result: 在四个不同组织类型的空间转录组学数据集上的广泛实验结果表明，GenAR实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: GenAR提供了精确医学和成本效益分子分析的潜在应用价值，代码已公开。

Abstract: Spatial Transcriptomics (ST) offers spatially resolved gene expression but
remains costly. Predicting expression directly from widely available
Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) stained images presents a cost-effective
alternative. However, most computational approaches (i) predict each gene
independently, overlooking co-expression structure, and (ii) cast the task as
continuous regression despite expression being discrete counts. This mismatch
can yield biologically implausible outputs and complicate downstream analyses.
We introduce GenAR, a multi-scale autoregressive framework that refines
predictions from coarse to fine. GenAR clusters genes into hierarchical groups
to expose cross-gene dependencies, models expression as codebook-free discrete
token generation to directly predict raw counts, and conditions decoding on
fused histological and spatial embeddings. From an information-theoretic
perspective, the discrete formulation avoids log-induced biases and the
coarse-to-fine factorization aligns with a principled conditional
decomposition. Extensive experimental results on four Spatial Transcriptomics
datasets across different tissue types demonstrate that GenAR achieves
state-of-the-art performance, offering potential implications for precision
medicine and cost-effective molecular profiling. Code is publicly available at

Conclusion: 轻量级栅格化结合特征对齐足以扩展端到端训练，为逼真渲染提供了实用替代方案，证明了语义保真度和可扩展性比照片级真实感更重要。

Abstract: Imitation learning for end-to-end driving trains policies only on expert
demonstrations. Once deployed in a closed loop, such policies lack recovery
data: small mistakes cannot be corrected and quickly compound into failures. A
promising direction is to generate alternative viewpoints and trajectories
beyond the logged path. Prior work explores photorealistic digital twins via
neural rendering or game engines, but these methods are prohibitively slow and
costly, and thus mainly used for evaluation. In this work, we argue that
photorealism is unnecessary for training end-to-end planners. What matters is
semantic fidelity and scalability: driving depends on geometry and dynamics,
not textures or lighting. Motivated by this, we propose 3D Rasterization, which
replaces costly rendering with lightweight rasterization of annotated
primitives, enabling augmentations such as counterfactual recovery maneuvers
and cross-agent view synthesis. To transfer these synthetic views effectively
to real-world deployment, we introduce a Raster-to-Real feature-space alignment
that bridges the sim-to-real gap. Together, these components form Rasterization
Augmented Planning (RAP), a scalable data augmentation pipeline for planning.
RAP achieves state-of-the-art closed-loop robustness and long-tail
generalization, ranking first on four major benchmarks: NAVSIM v1/v2, Waymo
Open Dataset Vision-based E2E Driving, and Bench2Drive. Our results show that
lightweight rasterization with feature alignment suffices to scale E2E
training, offering a practical alternative to photorealistic rendering. Project

Result: 在ETH/UCY和Stanford Drone数据集上的实验表明，Diffusion^2在瞬时轨迹预测方面达到了新的最优性能。

Conclusion: 该研究为极端场景下的行人轨迹预测提供了有效解决方案，通过生成未观测历史轨迹和动态噪声调节机制显著提升了预测准确性。

Abstract: Accurate pedestrian trajectory prediction is crucial for ensuring safety and
efficiency in autonomous driving and human-robot interaction scenarios. Earlier
studies primarily utilized sufficient observational data to predict future
trajectories. However, in real-world scenarios, such as pedestrians suddenly
emerging from blind spots, sufficient observational data is often unavailable
(i.e. momentary trajectory), making accurate prediction challenging and
increasing the risk of traffic accidents. Therefore, advancing research on
pedestrian trajectory prediction under extreme scenarios is critical for
enhancing traffic safety. In this work, we propose a novel framework termed
Diffusion^2, tailored for momentary trajectory prediction. Diffusion^2 consists
of two sequentially connected diffusion models: one for backward prediction,
which generates unobserved historical trajectories, and the other for forward
prediction, which forecasts future trajectories. Given that the generated
unobserved historical trajectories may introduce additional noise, we propose a
dual-head parameterization mechanism to estimate their aleatoric uncertainty
and design a temporally adaptive noise module that dynamically modulates the
noise scale in the forward diffusion process. Empirically, Diffusion^2 sets a
new state-of-the-art in momentary trajectory prediction on ETH/UCY and Stanford
Drone datasets.

Abstract: World models that support controllable

  for robotics, enabling scalable training data, repro ducible evaluation, and
flexible task design. While
  recent text-to-video models generate realistic dynam ics, they are
constrained to 2D views and offer limited
  interaction. We introduce MorphoSim, a language guided framework that
generates 4D scenes with
  multi-view consistency and object-level controls. From
  natural language instructions, MorphoSim produces
  dynamic environments where objects can be directed,
  recolored, or removed, and scenes can be observed
  from arbitrary viewpoints. The framework integrates
  trajectory-guided generation with feature field dis tillation, allowing edits
to be applied interactively
  without full re-generation. Experiments show that Mor phoSim maintains high
scene fidelity while enabling
  controllability and editability. The code is available

TL;DR: 提出了VLMCountBench基准测试，发现当前视觉语言模型在单一形状计数任务中表现可靠，但在组合形状计数任务中存在显著失败。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管视觉语言模型在多种任务上表现出色，但它们在计数能力方面的基本表现尚未得到系统评估，特别是在组合计数场景下。

Method: 创建了一个简约的基准测试，仅使用基本几何形状及其组合，严格控制变量，系统研究颜色、大小和提示词优化等因素的影响。

Result: 实验结果显示，VLMs在单一形状类型存在时计数可靠，但在多种形状类型组合时出现显著失败。

Conclusion: 当前视觉语言模型在组合计数方面存在根本性的经验限制，这为未来研究指明了重要方向。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have become a central focus of today's AI
community, owing to their impressive abilities gained from training on
large-scale vision-language data from the Web. These models have demonstrated
strong performance across diverse tasks, including image understanding, video
understanding, complex visual reasoning, and embodied AI. Despite these
noteworthy successes, a fundamental question remains: Can VLMs count objects
correctly? In this paper, we introduce a simple yet effective benchmark,
VLMCountBench, designed under a minimalist setting with only basic geometric
shapes (e.g., triangles, circles) and their compositions, focusing exclusively
on counting tasks without interference from other factors. We adopt strict
independent variable control and systematically study the effects of simple
properties such as color, size, and prompt refinement in a controlled ablation.
Our empirical results reveal that while VLMs can count reliably when only one
shape type is present, they exhibit substantial failures when multiple shape
types are combined (i.e., compositional counting). This highlights a
fundamental empirical limitation of current VLMs and motivates important
directions for future research.

Motivation: 现有盲人脸恢复方法在整合生成先验时，往往面临视觉质量与身份保真度之间的权衡，导致要么身份失真，要么降质去除不理想。

Method: 1) 基于学习的可变形人脸配准模块进行语义对齐；2) 纹理引导恢复网络动态提取和传递生成人脸纹理；3) 结合深度度量学习生成信息丰富的正负样本以更好地融合身份保持和生成特征。

Result: 在真实世界和合成数据集上的大量实验表明，CodeFormer++在视觉保真度和身份一致性方面都取得了优越性能。

Conclusion: CodeFormer++框架成功最大化利用了生成先验，实现了高质量人脸恢复同时保持身份信息，解决了现有方法的权衡问题。

Abstract: Blind face restoration (BFR) has attracted increasing attention with the rise
of generative methods. Most existing approaches integrate generative priors
into the restoration pro- cess, aiming to jointly address facial detail
generation and identity preservation. However, these methods often suffer from
a trade-off between visual quality and identity fidelity, leading to either
identity distortion or suboptimal degradation removal. In this paper, we
present CodeFormer++, a novel framework that maximizes the utility of
generative priors for high-quality face restoration while preserving identity.
We decompose BFR into three sub-tasks: (i) identity- preserving face
restoration, (ii) high-quality face generation, and (iii) dynamic fusion of
identity features with realistic texture details. Our method makes three key
contributions: (1) a learning-based deformable face registration module that
semantically aligns generated and restored faces; (2) a texture guided
restoration network to dynamically extract and transfer the texture of
generated face to boost the quality of identity-preserving restored face; and
(3) the integration of deep metric learning for BFR with the generation of
informative positive and hard negative samples to better fuse identity-
preserving and generative features. Extensive experiments on real-world and
synthetic datasets demonstrate that, the pro- posed CodeFormer++ achieves
superior performance in terms of both visual fidelity and identity consistency.

TL;DR: 提出了A.I.R.方法，一种无需训练的自适应、迭代和基于推理的帧选择方法，用于视频问答中的高效帧选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频问答中的帧选择方法面临关键权衡：轻量级相似性模型无法捕捉复杂查询的细微差别，而使用VLM进行深度分析的方法计算成本过高。

Method: 利用强大的VLM对复杂查询进行深度语义分析，并在成本效益高的迭代循环中处理少量高潜力帧。

Result: 在多个VideoQA基准测试中表现优于现有帧选择方法，显著提升了基础VLM的性能，并大幅提高了计算效率。

Conclusion: A.I.R.方法有效解决了帧选择中的准确性与效率权衡问题，为视频问答提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Effectively applying Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to Video Question
Answering (VideoQA) hinges on selecting a concise yet comprehensive set of
frames, as processing entire videos is computationally infeasible. However,
current frame selection methods face a critical trade-off: approaches relying
on lightweight similarity models, such as CLIP, often fail to capture the
nuances of complex queries, resulting in inaccurate similarity scores that
cannot reflect the authentic query-frame relevance, which further undermines
frame selection. Meanwhile, methods that leverage a VLM for deeper analysis
achieve higher accuracy but incur prohibitive computational costs. To address
these limitations, we propose A.I.R., a training-free approach for Adaptive,
Iterative, and Reasoning-based frame selection. We leverage a powerful VLM to
perform deep, semantic analysis on complex queries, and this analysis is
deployed within a cost-effective iterative loop that processes only a small
batch of the most high-potential frames at a time. Extensive experiments on
various VideoQA benchmarks demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing
frame selection methods, significantly boosts the performance of the foundation
VLM, and achieves substantial gains in computational efficiency over other
VLM-based techniques.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出reAR训练策略，通过token-wise正则化解决自回归视觉生成中的生成器-分词器不一致问题，显著提升性能，在ImageNet上达到与更大扩散模型相当的效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉自回归生成性能落后于扩散模型，核心瓶颈在于生成器与分词器的不一致性——AR生成的token可能无法被分词器良好解码

Method: 引入token-wise正则化目标：在预测下一个token时，因果transformer同时学习恢复当前token的视觉嵌入，并在噪声上下文中预测目标token的嵌入。无需改变分词器、生成顺序、推理流程或外部模型

Result: 在ImageNet上，将gFID从3.02降至1.86，IS提升至316.9；应用于先进分词器后，仅用177M参数达到gFID 1.42，匹配675M参数扩散模型的性能

Conclusion: reAR是一种简单有效的训练策略，通过解决生成器-分词器不一致性，显著提升了视觉自回归生成的性能，使其能够与更大的扩散模型竞争

Abstract: Visual autoregressive (AR) generation offers a promising path toward unifying
vision and language models, yet its performance remains suboptimal against
diffusion models. Prior work often attributes this gap to tokenizer limitations
and rasterization ordering. In this work, we identify a core bottleneck from
the perspective of generator-tokenizer inconsistency, i.e., the AR-generated
tokens may not be well-decoded by the tokenizer. To address this, we propose
reAR, a simple training strategy introducing a token-wise regularization
objective: when predicting the next token, the causal transformer is also
trained to recover the visual embedding of the current token and predict the
embedding of the target token under a noisy context. It requires no changes to
the tokenizer, generation order, inference pipeline, or external models.
Despite its simplicity, reAR substantially improves performance. On ImageNet,
it reduces gFID from 3.02 to 1.86 and improves IS to 316.9 using a standard
rasterization-based tokenizer. When applied to advanced tokenizers, it achieves
a gFID of 1.42 with only 177M parameters, matching the performance with larger
state-of-the-art diffusion models (675M).

TL;DR: SPEGNet是一个用于伪装目标检测的轻量级网络，通过统一设计整合多尺度特征，避免了传统方法中复杂组件堆叠带来的计算负担，在保持实时推理速度的同时实现了优异的检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前伪装目标检测方法依赖复杂组件堆叠（如边界模块、注意力机制、多尺度处理器），这导致计算负担增加但性能提升不成比例，且通常需要降低分辨率处理而丢失细节信息。

Method: 提出SPEGNet，通过通道校准和空间增强整合多尺度特征，边界直接从上下文丰富的表示中生成，保持语义-空间对齐，采用渐进式细化和尺度自适应边缘调制。

Result: 在CAMO数据集上达到0.887 Sα，COD10K上0.890，NC4K上0.895，同时保持实时推理速度，能够处理从微小复杂物体到大型模式相似物体的各种尺度目标。

Conclusion: SPEGNet通过统一设计在边界精度和区域一致性之间取得平衡，有效处理遮挡和模糊边界，在多个数据集上表现出色且计算效率高。

Abstract: Camouflaged object detection segments objects with intrinsic similarity and
edge disruption. Current detection methods rely on accumulated complex
components. Each approach adds components such as boundary modules, attention
mechanisms, and multi-scale processors independently. This accumulation creates
a computational burden without proportional gains. To manage this complexity,
they process at reduced resolutions, eliminating fine details essential for
camouflage. We present SPEGNet, addressing fragmentation through a unified
design. The architecture integrates multi-scale features via channel
calibration and spatial enhancement. Boundaries emerge directly from
context-rich representations, maintaining semantic-spatial alignment.
Progressive refinement implements scale-adaptive edge modulation with peak
influence at intermediate resolutions. This design strikes a balance between
boundary precision and regional consistency. SPEGNet achieves 0.887 $S_\alpha$
on CAMO, 0.890 on COD10K, and 0.895 on NC4K, with real-time inference speed.
Our approach excels across scales, from tiny, intricate objects to large,
pattern-similar ones, while handling occlusion and ambiguous boundaries. Code,

Abstract: Bridging clinical diagnostic reasoning with AI remains a central challenge in
medical imaging. We introduce MedCLM, an automated pipeline that converts
detection datasets into large-scale medical visual question answering (VQA)
data with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning by linking lesion boxes to organ
segmentation and structured rationales. These contextual signals enable medical

reasoning. To utilize this data effectively, we propose an Integrated
CoT-Curriculum Strategy composed of an Easy stage with explicit lesion boxes
for visual grounding, a Medium stage that encourages implicit localization, and
a Hard stage for weakly supervised reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate
that MedCLM attains state-of-the-art performance on several medical VQA
benchmarks, providing a scalable framework for developing clinically aligned

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved significant progress in
multimodal understanding tasks, demonstrating strong capabilities particularly
in general tasks such as image captioning and visual reasoning. However, when
dealing with specialized cultural heritage domains like 3D vase artifacts,
existing models face severe data scarcity issues and insufficient domain

struggle to effectively handle such culturally significant specialized tasks.
To address these challenges, we propose the VaseVQA-3D dataset, which serves as
the first 3D visual question answering dataset for ancient Greek pottery

question-answer data and establishing a complete data construction pipeline. We
further develop the VaseVLM model, enhancing model performance in vase artifact

Abstract: Recent advances in image generation and editing technologies have enabled
state-of-the-art models to achieve impressive results in general domains.
However, when applied to e-commerce scenarios, these general models often
encounter consistency limitations. To address this challenge, we introduce
TBStar-Edit, an new image editing model tailored for the e-commerce domain.
Through rigorous data engineering, model architecture design and training
strategy, TBStar-Edit achieves precise and high-fidelity image editing while
maintaining the integrity of product appearance and layout. Specifically, for
data engineering, we establish a comprehensive data construction pipeline,
encompassing data collection, construction, filtering, and augmentation, to
acquire high-quality, instruction-following, and strongly consistent editing
data to support model training. For model architecture design, we design a
hierarchical model framework consisting of a base model, pattern shifting
modules, and consistency enhancement modules. For model training, we adopt a
two-stage training strategy to enhance the consistency preservation: first
stage for editing pattern shifting, and second stage for consistency
enhancement. Each stage involves training different modules with separate
datasets. Finally, we conduct extensive evaluations of TBStar-Edit on a
self-proposed e-commerce benchmark, and the results demonstrate that
TBStar-Edit outperforms existing general-domain editing models in both
objective metrics (VIE Score) and subjective user preference.

TL;DR: 提出异步扩散模型框架，通过为不同像素分配不同时间步来改善文本到图像的对齐问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统扩散模型采用同步去噪，所有像素同时从噪声演变为清晰图像，导致提示相关区域只能参考相同噪声水平的无关区域，无法获得清晰上下文，最终影响文本到图像对齐效果

Method: 异步扩散模型框架，为不同像素分配不同时间步，重新制定逐像素去噪过程，通过动态调节单个像素的时间步调度，使提示相关区域比无关区域更渐进地去噪

Result: 广泛实验表明，异步扩散模型能显著提高各种提示下的文本到图像对齐效果

Conclusion: 异步扩散模型通过异步去噪机制，允许提示相关区域利用更清晰的像素间上下文，从而在最终图像中实现更好的对齐效果

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved impressive results in generating high-quality
images. Yet, they often struggle to faithfully align the generated images with
the input prompts. This limitation arises from synchronous denoising, where all
pixels simultaneously evolve from random noise to clear images. As a result,
during generation, the prompt-related regions can only reference the unrelated
regions at the same noise level, failing to obtain clear context and ultimately
impairing text-to-image alignment. To address this issue, we propose
asynchronous diffusion models -- a novel framework that allocates distinct
timesteps to different pixels and reformulates the pixel-wise denoising
process. By dynamically modulating the timestep schedules of individual pixels,
prompt-related regions are denoised more gradually than unrelated regions,
thereby allowing them to leverage clearer inter-pixel context. Consequently,
these prompt-related regions achieve better alignment in the final images.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our asynchronous diffusion models can
significantly improve text-to-image alignment across diverse prompts. The code
repository for this work is available at https://github.com/hu-zijing/AsynDM.

Motivation: 现有扩散模型在图像生成中常出现语义不一致或幻觉问题，而现有的推理时引导方法往往依赖外部信号或架构修改，引入额外计算开销

Method: 利用中间样本作为投影基础，放大分数估计相对于该基础的切向分量来修正采样轨迹，基于一阶泰勒展开形式化这一引导过程

Result: TAG是一个即插即用、架构无关的模块，能以最小计算开销提高扩散采样保真度

Conclusion: TAG提供了一种新的扩散引导视角，通过直接操作轨迹信号实现高效引导

Abstract: Recent diffusion models achieve the state-of-the-art performance in image
generation, but often suffer from semantic inconsistencies or hallucinations.
While various inference-time guidance methods can enhance generation, they
often operate indirectly by relying on external signals or architectural
modifications, which introduces additional computational overhead. In this
paper, we propose Tangential Amplifying Guidance (TAG), a more efficient and
direct guidance method that operates solely on trajectory signals without
modifying the underlying diffusion model. TAG leverages an intermediate sample
as a projection basis and amplifies the tangential components of the estimated
scores with respect to this basis to correct the sampling trajectory. We
formalize this guidance process by leveraging a first-order Taylor expansion,
which demonstrates that amplifying the tangential component steers the state
toward higher-probability regions, thereby reducing inconsistencies and
enhancing sample quality. TAG is a plug-and-play, architecture-agnostic module
that improves diffusion sampling fidelity with minimal computational addition,
offering a new perspective on diffusion guidance.

TL;DR: 提出条件表示学习(CRL)方法，通过用户指定的条件生成定制化特征表示，解决通用表示学习方法在特定下游任务中语义不匹配的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统表示学习方法学习的是通用表示，主要捕捉主导语义，但可能与定制化下游任务不匹配。例如在动物栖息地分析中，研究者关注场景相关特征，而通用嵌入强调类别语义，导致结果不理想。现有方法需要监督微调，计算和标注成本高。

Method: CRL首先使用大语言模型(LLM)根据用户指定条件生成描述性文本来构建语义基，然后利用视觉语言模型(VLM)将图像表示投影到这个条件特征空间中。

Result: 在分类和检索任务上的大量实验证明了CRL的优越性和通用性。

Conclusion: 条件表示学习能够为任意用户指定标准提取定制化表示，更好地捕捉特定标准的语义，可用于多个定制化任务。

Abstract: Conventional representation learning methods learn a universal representation
that primarily captures dominant semantics, which may not always align with
customized downstream tasks. For instance, in animal habitat analysis,
researchers prioritize scene-related features, whereas universal embeddings
emphasize categorical semantics, leading to suboptimal results. As a solution,
existing approaches resort to supervised fine-tuning, which however incurs high
computational and annotation costs. In this paper, we propose Conditional
Representation Learning (CRL), aiming to extract representations tailored to
arbitrary user-specified criteria. Specifically, we reveal that the semantics
of a space are determined by its basis, thereby enabling a set of descriptive
words to approximate the basis for a customized feature space. Building upon
this insight, given a user-specified criterion, CRL first employs a large
language model (LLM) to generate descriptive texts to construct the semantic
basis, then projects the image representation into this conditional feature
space leveraging a vision-language model (VLM). The conditional representation
better captures semantics for the specific criterion, which could be utilized
for multiple customized tasks. Extensive experiments on classification and
retrieval tasks demonstrate the superiority and generality of the proposed CRL.

Abstract: Diagnosing a whole-slide image is an interactive, multi-stage process
involving changes in magnification and movement between fields. Although recent
pathology foundation models are strong, practical agentic systems that decide
what field to examine next, adjust magnification, and deliver explainable
diagnoses are still lacking. The blocker is data: scalable, clinically aligned
supervision of expert viewing behavior that is tacit and experience-based, not
written in textbooks or online, and therefore absent from large language model
training. We introduce the AI Session Recorder, which works with standard WSI
viewers to unobtrusively record routine navigation and convert the viewer logs
into standardized behavioral commands (inspect or peek at discrete
magnifications) and bounding boxes. A lightweight human-in-the-loop review
turns AI-drafted rationales into the Pathology-CoT dataset, a form of paired
"where to look" and "why it matters" supervision produced at roughly six times
lower labeling time. Using this behavioral data, we build Pathologist-o3, a
two-stage agent that first proposes regions of interest and then performs
behavior-guided reasoning. On gastrointestinal lymph-node metastasis detection,
it achieved 84.5% precision, 100.0% recall, and 75.4% accuracy, exceeding the
state-of-the-art OpenAI o3 model and generalizing across backbones. To our

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种空间-光谱-频率交互网络(S²Fin)，通过跨域融合模块解决多模态遥感图像分类中结构特征和细节特征提取困难的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的特征融合技术在处理异构冗余多模态图像时，难以有效提取结构特征和细节特征。本文旨在引入频域学习来建模关键和稀疏的细节特征。

Method: 提出高频稀疏增强变换器，使用稀疏空间-光谱注意力优化高频滤波器参数；采用两级空间-频率融合策略，包括自适应频率通道模块和高频共振掩码；以及空间-光谱注意力融合模块增强中间层特征提取。

Conclusion: S²Fin通过空间、光谱和频域的跨域交互融合，有效解决了多模态遥感图像分类中的特征提取挑战，取得了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: Deep learning-based methods have achieved significant success in remote
sensing Earth observation data analysis. Numerous feature fusion techniques
address multimodal remote sensing image classification by integrating global
and local features. However, these techniques often struggle to extract
structural and detail features from heterogeneous and redundant multimodal
images. With the goal of introducing frequency domain learning to model key and
sparse detail features, this paper introduces the spatial-spectral-frequency
interaction network (S$^2$Fin), which integrates pairwise fusion modules across
the spatial, spectral, and frequency domains. Specifically, we propose a
high-frequency sparse enhancement transformer that employs sparse
spatial-spectral attention to optimize the parameters of the high-frequency
filter. Subsequently, a two-level spatial-frequency fusion strategy is
introduced, comprising an adaptive frequency channel module that fuses
low-frequency structures with enhanced high-frequency details, and a
high-frequency resonance mask that emphasizes sharp edges via phase similarity.
In addition, a spatial-spectral attention fusion module further enhances
feature extraction at intermediate layers of the network. Experiments on four
benchmark multimodal datasets with limited labeled data demonstrate that
S$^2$Fin performs superior classification, outperforming state-of-the-art
methods. The code is available at https://github.com/HaoLiu-XDU/SSFin.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度伪造检测方法在跨数据集和生成技术时泛化能力不足，需要更鲁棒的解决方案。

Method: 使用集成框架结合Swin Transformer、ViT和纹理方法，引入数据分割、顺序训练、频率分割、基于补丁的注意力和人脸分割技术。

Result: 在包含八个深度伪造数据集的DFWild-Cup数据集上实现了最先进的检测性能。

Conclusion: 混合模型能有效应对深度伪造检测的挑战，为实际应用提供鲁棒解决方案。

Abstract: Detecting manipulated media has now become a pressing issue with the recent
rise of deepfakes. Most existing approaches fail to generalize across diverse
datasets and generation techniques. We thus propose a novel ensemble framework,
combining the strengths of transformer-based architectures, such as Swin
Transformers and ViTs, and texture-based methods, to achieve better detection
accuracy and robustness. Our method introduces innovative data-splitting,
sequential training, frequency splitting, patch-based attention, and face
segmentation techniques to handle dataset imbalances, enhance high-impact
regions (e.g., eyes and mouth), and improve generalization. Our model achieves
state-of-the-art performance when tested on the DFWild-Cup dataset, a diverse
subset of eight deepfake datasets. The ensemble benefits from the
complementarity of these approaches, with transformers excelling in global
feature extraction and texturebased methods providing interpretability. This
work demonstrates that hybrid models can effectively address the evolving
challenges of deepfake detection, offering a robust solution for real-world
applications.

TL;DR: 本研究比较了SLIC和其他四种最佳分割方法在森林砍伐检测任务中的表现，发现通过分类器融合方法可以显著提升检测准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ForestEyes项目结合公民科学和机器学习检测热带森林砍伐，传统使用SLIC算法进行图像分割，但研究表明其他超像素方法在遥感图像分割中表现更好。

Method: 比较了SLIC和其他四种最佳分割方法，使用PyCaret AutoML库选择前五个分类器，并应用分类器融合方法。

Result: 初始结果显示分割方法间性能差异不大，但通过分类器融合方法，平衡准确率有明显提升。

Conclusion: 分割方法的选择和机器学习模型的组合对于森林砍伐检测任务都很重要，分类器融合能显著改善检测性能。

Abstract: Image segmentation is a crucial step in various visual applications,
including environmental monitoring through remote sensing. In the context of
the ForestEyes project, which combines citizen science and machine learning to
detect deforestation in tropical forests, image segments are used for labeling
by volunteers and subsequent model training. Traditionally, the Simple Linear
Iterative Clustering (SLIC) algorithm is adopted as the segmentation method.
However, recent studies have indicated that other superpixel-based methods
outperform SLIC in remote sensing image segmentation, and might suggest that
they are more suitable for the task of detecting deforested areas. In this
sense, this study investigated the impact of the four best segmentation
methods, together with SLIC, on the training of classifiers for the target
application. Initially, the results showed little variation in performance
among segmentation methods, even when selecting the top five classifiers using
the PyCaret AutoML library. However, by applying a classifier fusion approach
(ensemble of classifiers), noticeable improvements in balanced accuracy were
observed, highlighting the importance of both the choice of segmentation method
and the combination of machine learning-based models for deforestation
detection tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EduPersona是一个面向教育领域的大规模基准测试，专注于评估语言模型在课堂模拟中的主观能力，包含多语言、多学科和多种人格类型，通过三个渐进任务系统评估模型表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在教育中的集成日益增多，虚拟学生代理对课堂模拟和教师培训至关重要。但目前缺乏对其课堂导向主观能力的系统评估，限制了模型边界理解和可信部署。

Method: 构建包含1,308个真实课堂对话轮次的大规模数据集EduPersona，基于大五人格理论扩展至约128k轮次。将主观性能分解为三个渐进任务：基本连贯性、学生真实性和长期人格一致性，建立基于教育理论的评估框架。

Result: 在三个代表性LLM上的系统实验显示，经过EduPersona人格微调的模型在所有任务上均有显著提升：TASK1 +33.6%、TASK2 +30.6%、TASK3 +14.9%。

Conclusion: EduPersona提供了首个专注于主观能力的课堂基准，建立了可解耦和可验证的研究范式，将开源数据集和框架以支持教育领域可信和拟人化AI的发展。

Abstract: As large language models are increasingly integrated into education, virtual
student agents are becoming vital for classroom simulation and teacher
training. Yet their classroom-oriented subjective abilities remain largely
unassessed, limiting understanding of model boundaries and hindering
trustworthy deployment. We present EduPersona, a large-scale benchmark spanning
two languages, three subjects, and ten persona types based on the Big Five
theory. The dataset contains 1,308 authentic classroom dialogue rounds,
corresponding to 12,814 teacher-student Q&A turns, and is further expanded
through persona stylization into roughly 10 times larger scale (128k turns),
providing a solid foundation for evaluation. Building on this resource, we
decompose hard-to-quantify subjective performance into three progressive tasks:
TASK1 basic coherence (whether behavior, emotion, expression, and voice align
with classroom context), TASK2 student realism, and TASK3 long-term persona
consistency, thereby establishing an evaluation framework grounded in
educational theory and research value. We conduct systematic experiments on
three representative LLMs, comparing their original versions with ten
persona-fine-tuned variants trained on EduPersona. Results show consistent and
significant average improvements across all tasks: TASK1 +33.6%, TASK2 +30.6%,
and TASK3 +14.9%. These improvements highlight the dataset's effectiveness and
research value, while also revealing the heterogeneous difficulty of persona
modeling. In summary, EduPersona delivers the first classroom benchmark
centered on subjective abilities, establishes a decoupled and verifiable
research paradigm, and we will open-source both the dataset and the framework
to support the broader research community in advancing trustworthy and
human-like AI for education.

TL;DR: 提出了一种分层多阶段运动专家混合架构，用于从步态序列中预测心理特征，在PsyMo基准测试中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 步态包含丰富的生物特征和行为信息，但利用行走方式推断心理特征仍是一个具有挑战性且未被充分探索的问题。

Method: 采用分层多阶段运动专家混合架构，将行走周期分为四个运动复杂度阶段，使用轻量级专家模型提取时空特征，并通过任务特定门控模块自适应加权专家。

Result: 在涵盖17个心理特征的PsyMo基准测试中，该方法在运行级别获得37.47%加权F1分数，在受试者级别获得44.6%加权F1分数，优于现有步态分析模型。

Conclusion: 多任务步态学习可用于心理特征估计，为基于运动信息的心理推断研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Gait encodes rich biometric and behavioural information, yet leveraging the
manner of walking to infer psychological traits remains a challenging and
underexplored problem. We introduce a hierarchical Multi-Stage Mixture of
Movement Experts (MoME) architecture for multi-task prediction of psychological
attributes from gait sequences represented as 2D poses. MoME processes the
walking cycle in four stages of movement complexity, employing lightweight
expert models to extract spatio-temporal features and task-specific gating
modules to adaptively weight experts across traits and stages. Evaluated on the
PsyMo benchmark covering 17 psychological traits, our method outperforms
state-of-the-art gait analysis models, achieving a 37.47% weighted F1 score at
the run level and 44.6% at the subject level. Our experiments show that
integrating auxiliary tasks such as identity recognition, gender prediction,
and BMI estimation further improves psychological trait estimation. Our
findings demonstrate the viability of multi-task gait-based learning for
psychological trait estimation and provide a foundation for future research on
movement-informed psychological inference.

Result: 通过广泛实验证明ConceptSplit能够实现稳健的多概念个性化，减轻意外的概念干扰

Conclusion: ConceptSplit框架有效解决了多概念个性化中的概念混合问题

Abstract: In recent years, multi-concept personalization for text-to-image (T2I)
diffusion models to represent several subjects in an image has gained much more
attention. The main challenge of this task is "concept mixing", where multiple
learned concepts interfere or blend undesirably in the output image. To address
this issue, in this paper, we present ConceptSplit, a novel framework to split
the individual concepts through training and inference. Our framework comprises
two key components. First, we introduce Token-wise Value Adaptation (ToVA), a
merging-free training method that focuses exclusively on adapting the value
projection in cross-attention. Based on our empirical analysis, we found that
modifying the key projection, a common approach in existing methods, can
disrupt the attention mechanism and lead to concept mixing. Second, we propose
Latent Optimization for Disentangled Attention (LODA), which alleviates
attention entanglement during inference by optimizing the input latent. Through
extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments, we demonstrate that
ConceptSplit achieves robust multi-concept personalization, mitigating
unintended concept interference. Code is available at

Abstract: Accurate liver segmentation in multi-phase MRI is vital for liver fibrosis
assessment, yet labeled data is often scarce and unevenly distributed across
imaging modalities and vendor systems. We propose a label-efficient
segmentation approach that promotes cross-modality generalization under
real-world conditions, where GED4 hepatobiliary-phase annotations are limited,
non-contrast sequences (T1WI, T2WI, DWI) are unlabeled, and spatial
misalignment and missing phases are common. Our method integrates a
foundation-scale 3D segmentation backbone adapted via fine-tuning, co-training
with cross pseudo supervision to leverage unlabeled volumes, and a standardized
preprocessing pipeline. Without requiring spatial registration, the model
learns to generalize across MRI phases and vendors, demonstrating robust
segmentation performance in both labeled and unlabeled domains. Our results
exhibit the effectiveness of our proposed label-efficient baseline for liver
segmentation in multi-phase, multi-vendor MRI and highlight the potential of
combining foundation model adaptation with co-training for real-world clinical
imaging tasks.

Conclusion: 该框架在保持身份一致性的同时实现了精确的表情控制，为AI驱动的故事讲述提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Human-centric generative models designed for AI-driven storytelling must
bring together two core capabilities: identity consistency and precise control
over human performance. While recent diffusion-based approaches have made
significant progress in maintaining facial identity, achieving fine-grained
expression control without compromising identity remains challenging. In this
work, we present a diffusion-based framework that faithfully reimagines any
subject under any particular facial expression. Building on an ID-consistent
face foundation model, we adopt a compositional design featuring an expression
cross-attention module guided by FLAME blendshape parameters for explicit
control. Trained on a diverse mixture of image and video data rich in
expressive variation, our adapter generalizes beyond basic emotions to subtle
micro-expressions and expressive transitions, overlooked by prior works. In
addition, a pluggable Reference Adapter enables expression editing in real
images by transferring the appearance from a reference frame during synthesis.
Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations show that our model
outperforms existing methods in tailored and identity-consistent expression
generation. Code and models can be found at

Conclusion: ReactDiff通过整合时空约束成功解决了面部反应生成的挑战，能够产生平滑、连贯且符合人类面部解剖结构的多样化反应。

Abstract: The automatic generation of diverse and human-like facial reactions in dyadic
dialogue remains a critical challenge for human-computer interaction systems.
Existing methods fail to model the stochasticity and dynamics inherent in real
human reactions. To address this, we propose ReactDiff, a novel temporal
diffusion framework for generating diverse facial reactions that are
appropriate for responding to any given dialogue context. Our key insight is
that plausible human reactions demonstrate smoothness, and coherence over time,
and conform to constraints imposed by human facial anatomy. To achieve this,
ReactDiff incorporates two vital priors (spatio-temporal facial kinematics)
into the diffusion process: i) temporal facial behavioral kinematics and ii)
facial action unit dependencies. These two constraints guide the model toward
realistic human reaction manifolds, avoiding visually unrealistic jitters,
unstable transitions, unnatural expressions, and other artifacts. Extensive
experiments on the REACT2024 dataset demonstrate that our approach not only
achieves state-of-the-art reaction quality but also excels in diversity and
reaction appropriateness.

Abstract: 3D Semantic Scene Graph Prediction aims to detect objects and their semantic
relationships in 3D scenes, and has emerged as a crucial technology for
robotics and AR/VR applications. While previous research has addressed dataset
limitations and explored various approaches including Open-Vocabulary settings,
they frequently fail to optimize the representational capacity of object and
relationship features, showing excessive reliance on Graph Neural Networks
despite insufficient discriminative capability. In this work, we demonstrate
through extensive analysis that the quality of object features plays a critical
role in determining overall scene graph accuracy. To address this challenge, we
design a highly discriminative object feature encoder and employ a contrastive
pretraining strategy that decouples object representation learning from the
scene graph prediction. This design not only enhances object classification
accuracy but also yields direct improvements in relationship prediction.
Notably, when plugging in our pretrained encoder into existing frameworks, we
observe substantial performance improvements across all evaluation metrics.
Additionally, whereas existing approaches have not fully exploited the
integration of relationship information, we effectively combine both geometric
and semantic features to achieve superior relationship prediction.
Comprehensive experiments on the 3DSSG dataset demonstrate that our approach
significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods. Our code is
publicly available at https://github.com/VisualScienceLab-KHU/OCRL-3DSSG-Codes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 相机陷阱广泛用于野生动物监测，但从单目图像中提取准确距离测量具有挑战性，因为缺乏深度信息。虽然单目深度估计方法已有显著进展，但在自然野生动物环境中的性能尚未系统评估。

Method: 在93张带有校准ChARUCO图案获取真实距离的相机陷阱图像上，评估了四种最先进的单目深度估计方法（Depth Anything V2、ML Depth Pro、ZoeDepth和Metric3D）以及几何基线方法。

Result: Depth Anything V2表现最佳，平均绝对误差0.454m，相关性0.962；ZoeDepth在户外自然环境表现显著下降（MAE: 3.087m）；中值深度提取在所有深度学习方法中均优于均值方法；ZoeDepth最快但精度最低，Depth Anything V2在精度和速度间达到最佳平衡。

Conclusion: 该基准为野生动物应用建立了性能基线，并为在保护监测系统中实施深度估计提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Camera traps are widely used for wildlife monitoring, but extracting accurate
distance measurements from monocular images remains challenging due to the lack
of depth information. While monocular depth estimation (MDE) methods have
advanced significantly, their performance in natural wildlife environments has
not been systematically evaluated. This work introduces the first benchmark for
monocular metric depth estimation in wildlife monitoring conditions. We
evaluate four state-of-the-art MDE methods (Depth Anything V2, ML Depth Pro,
ZoeDepth, and Metric3D) alongside a geometric baseline on 93 camera trap images
with ground truth distances obtained using calibrated ChARUCO patterns. Our
results demonstrate that Depth Anything V2 achieves the best overall
performance with a mean absolute error of 0.454m and correlation of 0.962,
while methods like ZoeDepth show significant degradation in outdoor natural
environments (MAE: 3.087m). We find that median-based depth extraction
consistently outperforms mean-based approaches across all deep learning
methods. Additionally, we analyze computational efficiency, with ZoeDepth being
fastest (0.17s per image) but least accurate, while Depth Anything V2 provides
an optimal balance of accuracy and speed (0.22s per image). This benchmark
establishes performance baselines for wildlife applications and provides
practical guidance for implementing depth estimation in conservation monitoring
systems.

Abstract: Quantifying sponsor visibility in sports broadcasts is a critical marketing
task traditionally hindered by manual, subjective, and unscalable analysis
methods. While automated systems offer an alternative, their reliance on
axis-aligned Horizontal Bounding Box (HBB) leads to inaccurate exposuremetrics
when logos appear rotated or skewed due to dynamic camera angles and
perspective distortions. This paper introduces ExposureEngine, an end-to-end
system designed for accurate, rotation-aware sponsor visibility analytics in
sports broadcasts, demonstrated in a soccer case study. Our approach predicts
Oriented Bounding Box (OBB) to provide a geometrically precise fit to each logo
regardless of the orientation on-screen. To train and evaluate our detector, we
developed a new dataset comprising 1,103 frames from Swedish elite soccer,
featuring 670 unique sponsor logos annotated with OBBs. Our model achieves a
mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5) of 0.859, with a precision of 0.96 and recall
of 0.87, demonstrating robust performance in localizing logos under diverse
broadcast conditions. The system integrates these detections into an analytical
pipeline that calculates precise visibility metrics, such as exposure duration
and on-screen coverage. Furthermore, we incorporate a language-driven agentic
layer, enabling users to generate reports, summaries, and media content through
natural language queries. The complete system, including the dataset and the
analytics dashboard, provides a comprehensive solution for auditable and
interpretable sponsor measurement in sports media. An overview of the

Motivation: 红外小目标检测在国防应用中面临复杂背景和微小目标尺寸的挑战，传统目标检测器会产生大量误报。

Method: 在YOLO检测头中集成统计异常检测测试，将小目标视为背景中的异常模式，通过修改检测头来控制误报率。

Result: 在多个IRSTD基准测试中取得竞争性性能，在训练数据有限、噪声和域偏移场景下表现出显著鲁棒性，可应用于各种YOLO骨干网络和实例分割YOLO。

Conclusion: AA-YOLO是一个通用且高效的解决方案，特别适合资源受限的实际部署环境，具有良好的泛化能力和实用性。

Abstract: Infrared Small Target Detection (IRSTD) is a challenging task in defense
applications, where complex backgrounds and tiny target sizes often result in
numerous false alarms using conventional object detectors. To overcome this
limitation, we propose Anomaly-Aware YOLO (AA-YOLO), which integrates a
statistical anomaly detection test into its detection head. By treating small
targets as unexpected patterns against the background, AA-YOLO effectively
controls the false alarm rate. Our approach not only achieves competitive
performance on several IRSTD benchmarks, but also demonstrates remarkable
robustness in scenarios with limited training data, noise, and domain shifts.
Furthermore, since only the detection head is modified, our design is highly
generic and has been successfully applied across various YOLO backbones,
including lightweight models. It also provides promising results when
integrated into an instance segmentation YOLO. This versatility makes AA-YOLO
an attractive solution for real-world deployments where resources are
constrained. The code will be publicly released.

configurations and temporal motion patterns of 133 COCO WholeBody keypoints,
extracted from a subset of the CANDOR conversational corpus. Our experiments
compare pre-trained and from-scratch training, investigate the use of velocity
features, and introduce a multi-scale temporal transformer for hierarchical
motion modeling. Results demonstrate that domain-specific training
significantly outperforms transfer learning, and that spatial configurations
carry more discriminative information than temporal dynamics. The spatial
transformer achieves 95.74% accuracy, while the multi-scale temporal
transformer achieves 93.90%. Feature-level fusion pushes performance to 98.03%,
confirming that postural and dynamic information are complementary. These
findings highlight the potential of transformer architectures for person
identification in natural interactions and provide insights for future
multimodal and cross-cultural studies.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PG-Occ是一个渐进式高斯变换器框架，用于开放词汇3D占用预测，通过渐进在线密集化和各向异性感知采样策略，在保持计算效率的同时提升对小物体的检测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文本对齐场景建模中的权衡问题：稀疏高斯表示难以捕捉小物体，而密集表示计算开销大。

Method: 采用渐进在线密集化策略逐步增强3D高斯表示，结合各向异性感知采样和时空融合技术，自适应分配不同尺度和阶段的感受野。

Result: 在3D占用预测任务中实现了最先进的性能，相比之前最佳方法相对提升了14.3%的mIoU。

Conclusion: PG-Occ框架通过渐进式增强表示和自适应采样策略，有效平衡了精度和效率，为开放词汇3D场景理解提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The 3D occupancy prediction task has witnessed remarkable progress in recent
years, playing a crucial role in vision-based autonomous driving systems. While
traditional methods are limited to fixed semantic categories, recent approaches
have moved towards predicting text-aligned features to enable open-vocabulary
text queries in real-world scenes. However, there exists a trade-off in
text-aligned scene modeling: sparse Gaussian representation struggles to
capture small objects in the scene, while dense representation incurs
significant computational overhead. To address these limitations, we present
PG-Occ, an innovative Progressive Gaussian Transformer Framework that enables
open-vocabulary 3D occupancy prediction. Our framework employs progressive
online densification, a feed-forward strategy that gradually enhances the 3D
Gaussian representation to capture fine-grained scene details. By iteratively
enhancing the representation, the framework achieves increasingly precise and
detailed scene understanding. Another key contribution is the introduction of
an anisotropy-aware sampling strategy with spatio-temporal fusion, which
adaptively assigns receptive fields to Gaussians at different scales and
stages, enabling more effective feature aggregation and richer scene
information capture. Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate that PG-Occ
achieves state-of-the-art performance with a relative 14.3% mIoU improvement
over the previous best performing method. Code and pretrained models will be
released upon publication on our project page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的开放词汇学习方法，通过生成未见类数据来估计开放环境中的分布，包括类域数据生成流程和分布对齐算法，在11个数据集上表现优于基线方法14%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开放词汇学习需要在开放环境中建模数据分布，现有方法仅使用已见类数据进行估计，由于未见类的缺失导致估计误差无法识别。学习超越已见类对于边界估计误差至关重要。

Method: 提出类域数据生成流程，在层次语义树和从已见类数据推断的域信息指导下生成未见类数据；使用分布对齐算法估计并最大化后验概率以增强泛化能力。

Result: 在11个数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法比基线方法性能提升高达14%，证明了其有效性和优越性。

Conclusion: 通过生成未见类数据可以有效估计开放环境中的分布，理论证明估计误差有上界，提出的方法在开放词汇学习中表现出色。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary learning requires modeling the data distribution in open
environments, which consists of both seen-class and unseen-class data.
  Existing methods estimate the distribution in open environments using
seen-class data, where the absence of unseen classes makes the estimation error
inherently unidentifiable.
  Intuitively, learning beyond the seen classes is crucial for distribution
estimation to bound the estimation error.
  We theoretically demonstrate that the distribution can be effectively
estimated by generating unseen-class data, through which the estimation error
is upper-bounded.
  Building on this theoretical insight, we propose a novel open-vocabulary
learning method, which generates unseen-class data for estimating the
distribution in open environments. The method consists of a class-domain-wise
data generation pipeline and a distribution alignment algorithm. The data
generation pipeline generates unseen-class data under the guidance of a
hierarchical semantic tree and domain information inferred from the seen-class
data, facilitating accurate distribution estimation. With the generated data,
the distribution alignment algorithm estimates and maximizes the posterior
probability to enhance generalization in open-vocabulary learning. Extensive
experiments on $11$ datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms baseline
approaches by up to $14\%$, highlighting its effectiveness and superiority.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 建立手术视频分类中联邦学习的基准，评估方法在未见临床中心的泛化能力和本地微调适应性，同时实现不共享患者数据的协作模型开发。

Method: 参与者使用基础模型线性探测、度量学习（三元组损失）和各种FL聚合方案（FedAvg、FedMedian、FedSAM），通过F1分数和期望成本评估性能，使用自助法和统计检验评估排名稳定性。

Result: 泛化任务中跨中心性能有限，适应任务中所有团队在微调后都有改进但排名稳定性低。ViViT模型表现最佳，挑战揭示了泛化限制、类别不平衡敏感性和去中心化训练中超参数调优困难。

Conclusion: FedSurg挑战赛建立了手术视频分类中FL策略评估的首个基准，强调了本地个性化与全局鲁棒性之间的权衡，以及架构选择、预处理和损失设计的重要性。

Abstract: Purpose: The FedSurg challenge was designed to benchmark the state of the art
in federated learning for surgical video classification. Its goal was to assess
how well current methods generalize to unseen clinical centers and adapt
through local fine-tuning while enabling collaborative model development
without sharing patient data. Methods: Participants developed strategies to
classify inflammation stages in appendicitis using a preliminary version of the
multi-center Appendix300 video dataset. The challenge evaluated two tasks:
generalization to an unseen center and center-specific adaptation after
fine-tuning. Submitted approaches included foundation models with linear
probing, metric learning with triplet loss, and various FL aggregation schemes
(FedAvg, FedMedian, FedSAM). Performance was assessed using F1-score and
Expected Cost, with ranking robustness evaluated via bootstrapping and
statistical testing. Results: In the generalization task, performance across
centers was limited. In the adaptation task, all teams improved after
fine-tuning, though ranking stability was low. The ViViT-based submission
achieved the strongest overall performance. The challenge highlighted
limitations in generalization, sensitivity to class imbalance, and difficulties
in hyperparameter tuning in decentralized training, while spatiotemporal
modeling and context-aware preprocessing emerged as promising strategies.
Conclusion: The FedSurg Challenge establishes the first benchmark for
evaluating FL strategies in surgical video classification. Findings highlight
the trade-off between local personalization and global robustness, and
underscore the importance of architecture choice, preprocessing, and loss
design. This benchmarking offers a reference point for future development of
imbalance-aware, adaptive, and robust FL methods in clinical surgical AI.

Abstract: High-fidelity 3D scanning is essential for preserving cultural heritage
artefacts, supporting documentation, analysis, and long-term conservation.
However, conventional methods typically require specialized expertise and
manual intervention to maintain optimal scanning conditions and coverage. We
present an automated two-robot scanning system that eliminates the need for
handheld or semi-automatic workflows by combining coordinated robotic
manipulation with high-resolution 3D scanning. Our system parameterizes the
scanning space into distinct regions, enabling coordinated motion planning
between a scanner-equipped robot and a tray-handling robot. Optimized
trajectory planning and waypoint distribution ensure comprehensive surface
coverage, minimize occlusions, and balance reconstruction accuracy with system
efficiency. Experimental results show that our approach achieves significantly
lower Chamfer Distance and higher F-score compared to baseline methods,
offering superior geometric accuracy, improved digitization efficiency, and
reduced reliance on expert operators.

TL;DR: 比较视觉变换器(ViT)和卷积神经网络(CNN)在几何估计任务中的表现，发现在大数据场景下ViT表现更优，在小数据场景下CNN的归纳偏置使其能与ViT匹敌，ViT在跨域评估中泛化能力更强。

Motivation: 研究预训练视觉模型在几何估计任务中的效率，特别是在低数据情况下，探索ViT和CNN在图像配准和基础矩阵估计等任务中的表现差异。

Method: 系统比较大规模CNN(ResNet、EfficientNet、CLIP-ResNet)与ViT基础模型(CLIP-ViT变体和DINO)在不同数据量设置下的表现，包括少样本场景。

Result: 在大数据场景下ViT表现优于CNN，在小数据场景下CNN的归纳偏置使其能与ViT匹敌，ViT在跨域评估中表现出更强的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 需要根据具体场景选择模型架构，未来研究应关注平衡局部和全局表示的混合架构。

Abstract: Vision-transformers (ViTs) and large-scale convolution-neural-networks (CNNs)
have reshaped computer vision through pretrained feature representations that
enable strong transfer learning for diverse tasks. However, their efficiency as
backbone architectures for geometric estimation tasks involving image
deformations in low-data regimes remains an open question. This work considers
two such tasks: 1) estimating 2D rigid transformations between pairs of images
and 2) predicting the fundamental matrix for stereo image pairs, an important
problem in various applications, such as autonomous mobility, robotics, and 3D
scene reconstruction. Addressing this intriguing question, this work
systematically compares large-scale CNNs (ResNet, EfficientNet, CLIP-ResNet)
with ViT-based foundation models (CLIP-ViT variants and DINO) in various data
size settings, including few-shot scenarios. These pretrained models are
optimized for classification or contrastive learning, encouraging them to focus
mostly on high-level semantics. The considered tasks require balancing local
and global features differently, challenging the straightforward adoption of
these models as the backbone. Empirical comparative analysis shows that,
similar to training from scratch, ViTs outperform CNNs during refinement in
large downstream-data scenarios. However, in small data scenarios, the
inductive bias and smaller capacity of CNNs improve their performance, allowing
them to match that of a ViT. Moreover, ViTs exhibit stronger generalization in
cross-domain evaluation where the data distribution changes. These results
emphasize the importance of carefully selecting model architectures for
refinement, motivating future research towards hybrid architectures that
balance local and global representations.

Motivation: 现有虚拟试穿模型在细节保留、对真实图像的鲁棒性、高效采样、图像编辑能力和跨类别泛化方面存在挑战，需要更先进的解决方案。

Method: 利用扩散变换器进行图像条件虚拟试穿，探索了上下文标记拼接、通道拼接和ControlNet集成等多种配置，并在包含多样化背景、非结构化参考和非服装类别的扩展数据集上训练。

Result: 在VITON-HD数据集上超越了最先进方法，实现了更好的细节保留和鲁棒性，无需额外条件编码器；在涵盖数千个产品类别的多样化数据集上，在虚拟试穿和图像编辑能力方面也表现更优。

Conclusion: DiT-VTON重新定义了虚拟试穿任务，提供了一个通用的虚拟试穿解决方案，能够处理广泛的产品类别并支持高级图像编辑功能，展示了数据扩展对虚拟试穿适应性的益处。

Abstract: The rapid growth of e-commerce has intensified the demand for Virtual Try-On
(VTO) technologies, enabling customers to realistically visualize products
overlaid on their own images. Despite recent advances, existing VTO models face
challenges with fine-grained detail preservation, robustness to real-world
imagery, efficient sampling, image editing capabilities, and generalization
across diverse product categories. In this paper, we present DiT-VTON, a novel
VTO framework that leverages a Diffusion Transformer (DiT), renowned for its
performance on text-conditioned image generation, adapted here for the
image-conditioned VTO task. We systematically explore multiple DiT
configurations, including in-context token concatenation, channel
concatenation, and ControlNet integration, to determine the best setup for VTO
image conditioning.
  To enhance robustness, we train the model on an expanded dataset encompassing
varied backgrounds, unstructured references, and non-garment categories,
demonstrating the benefits of data scaling for VTO adaptability. DiT-VTON also
redefines the VTO task beyond garment try-on, offering a versatile Virtual
Try-All (VTA) solution capable of handling a wide range of product categories
and supporting advanced image editing functionalities such as pose
preservation, localized editing, texture transfer, and object-level
customization. Experimental results show that our model surpasses
state-of-the-art methods on VITON-HD, achieving superior detail preservation
and robustness without reliance on additional condition encoders. It also
outperforms models with VTA and image editing capabilities on a diverse dataset
spanning thousands of product categories.

TL;DR: EgoSurg是一个从固定摄像头视频重建手术室人员第一人称视角回放的框架，无需干扰临床工作流程，通过几何驱动的神经渲染和基于扩散的视图增强技术实现高保真度的任意视角合成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统手术观察依赖固定视角或回忆，无法记录指导临床决策的第一人称视觉视角。固定摄像头视频只能捕捉房间尺度的工作流程，但无法重建每个团队成员实际看到的内容，限制了手术安全、培训和流程优化的决策分析。

Method: EgoSurg结合几何驱动的神经渲染与基于扩散的视图增强技术，能够从壁挂固定摄像头视频合成任意时刻的任意第一人称视角，实现高视觉保真度。

Result: 在多站点手术案例和对照研究中，EgoSurg能够以高视觉质量和保真度重建特定人员的视觉场和任意视角。

Conclusion: 通过将现有手术室摄像头基础设施转变为可导航的动态3D记录，EgoSurg为沉浸式手术数据科学建立了新基础，使手术实践可以从每个角度进行可视化、体验和分析。

Abstract: Observing surgical practice has historically relied on fixed vantage points
or recollections, leaving the egocentric visual perspectives that guide
clinical decisions undocumented. Fixed-camera video can capture surgical
workflows at the room-scale, but cannot reconstruct what each team member
actually saw. Thus, these videos only provide limited insights into how
decisions that affect surgical safety, training, and workflow optimization are
made. Here we introduce EgoSurg, the first framework to reconstruct the
dynamic, egocentric replays for any operating room (OR) staff directly from
wall-mounted fixed-camera video, and thus, without intervention to clinical
workflow. EgoSurg couples geometry-driven neural rendering with diffusion-based
view enhancement, enabling high-visual fidelity synthesis of arbitrary and
egocentric viewpoints at any moment. In evaluation across multi-site surgical
cases and controlled studies, EgoSurg reconstructs person-specific visual
fields and arbitrary viewpoints with high visual quality and fidelity. By
transforming existing OR camera infrastructure into a navigable dynamic 3D
record, EgoSurg establishes a new foundation for immersive surgical data
science, enabling surgical practice to be visualized, experienced, and analyzed
from every angle.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解为什么多模态语言模型在感知密集型任务上表现不佳，通过研究视觉键值令牌在语言模型中的处理机制来探索这一未充分研究的视角。

Method: 分析流行MLMs(LLaVA-OneVision、Qwen2.5-VL、Llama-3-LLaVA-NeXT)处理视觉键值令牌的方式，研究视觉信息在语言模型中的流动，包括零样本分割、语义对应、时间对应和指代表达检测等任务。

Result: 发现视觉值令牌编码了足够的感知信息，但语言模型未能充分利用；输入无关的图像键令牌在语言模型后期层包含降低感知能力的伪影；添加文本前缀可改善视觉表示；在BLINK基准的33.3%艺术风格问题中，语言模型中的感知信息未输出。

Conclusion: 揭示了键值令牌在多模态系统中的关键作用，为MLMs的机制可解释性研究开辟了新方向，并建议了训练视觉编码器和语言模型组件的新方法。

Abstract: Despite interpretability work analyzing VIT encoders and transformer
activations, we don't yet understand why Multimodal Language Models (MLMs)
struggle on perception-heavy tasks. We offer an under-studied perspective by
examining how popular MLMs (LLaVA-OneVision, Qwen2.5-VL, and
Llama-3-LLaVA-NeXT) process their visual key-value tokens. We first study the
flow of visual information through the language model, finding that image value
tokens encode sufficient information to perform several perception-heavy tasks
zero-shot: segmentation, semantic correspondence, temporal correspondence, and
referring expression detection. We find that while the language model does
augment the visual information received from the projection of input visual
encodings-which we reveal correlates with overall MLM perception capability-it
contains less visual information on several tasks than the equivalent visual
encoder (SigLIP) that has not undergone MLM finetuning. Further, we find that
the visual information corresponding to input-agnostic image key tokens in
later layers of language models contains artifacts which reduce perception
capability of the overall MLM. Next, we discuss controlling visual information
in the language model, showing that adding a text prefix to the image input
improves perception capabilities of visual representations. Finally, we reveal
that if language models were able to better control their visual information,
their perception would significantly improve; e.g., in 33.3% of Art Style
questions in the BLINK benchmark, perception information present in the
language model is not surfaced to the output! Our findings reveal insights into
the role of key-value tokens in multimodal systems, paving the way for deeper
mechanistic interpretability of MLMs and suggesting new directions for training
their visual encoder and language model components.

Conclusion: AvatarVTON为4D虚拟试穿建立了新基准，展示了在单视角监督下实现动态服装交互的可行性，具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: We propose AvatarVTON, the first 4D virtual try-on framework that generates
realistic try-on results from a single in-shop garment image, enabling free
pose control, novel-view rendering, and diverse garment choices. Unlike
existing methods, AvatarVTON supports dynamic garment interactions under
single-view supervision, without relying on multi-view garment captures or
physics priors. The framework consists of two key modules: (1) a Reciprocal
Flow Rectifier, a prior-free optical-flow correction strategy that stabilizes
avatar fitting and ensures temporal coherence; and (2) a Non-Linear Deformer,
which decomposes Gaussian maps into view-pose-invariant and view-pose-specific
components, enabling adaptive, non-linear garment deformations. To establish a
benchmark for 4D virtual try-on, we extend existing baselines with unified
modules for fair qualitative and quantitative comparisons. Extensive
experiments show that AvatarVTON achieves high fidelity, diversity, and dynamic
garment realism, making it well-suited for AR/VR, gaming, and digital-human
applications.

Abstract: Generating synthetic CT (sCT) from MRI or CBCT plays a crucial role in
enabling MRI-only and CBCT-based adaptive radiotherapy, improving treatment
precision while reducing patient radiation exposure. To address this task, we
adopt a fully 3D Flow Matching (FM) framework, motivated by recent work
demonstrating FM's efficiency in producing high-quality images. In our
approach, a Gaussian noise volume is transformed into an sCT image by
integrating a learned FM velocity field, conditioned on features extracted from
the input MRI or CBCT using a lightweight 3D encoder. We evaluated the method
on the SynthRAD2025 Challenge benchmark, training separate models for MRI
$\rightarrow$ sCT and CBCT $\rightarrow$ sCT across three anatomical regions:
abdomen, head and neck, and thorax. Validation and testing were performed
through the challenge submission system. The results indicate that the method
accurately reconstructs global anatomical structures; however, preservation of
fine details was limited, primarily due to the relatively low training
resolution imposed by memory and runtime constraints. Future work will explore
patch-based training and latent-space flow models to improve resolution and
local structural fidelity.

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100、Tiny-ImageNet和ImageNet-1K上的实验表明，AT-BPTT平均准确率提升6.16%，内循环优化加速3.9倍，节省63%内存成本。

Conclusion: AT-BPTT通过动态适应截断策略，有效解决了数据集蒸馏中的优化问题，在性能和效率方面均取得显著提升。

Abstract: The growing demand for efficient deep learning has positioned dataset
distillation as a pivotal technique for compressing training dataset while
preserving model performance. However, existing inner-loop optimization methods
for dataset distillation typically rely on random truncation strategies, which
lack flexibility and often yield suboptimal results. In this work, we observe
that neural networks exhibit distinct learning dynamics across different
training stages-early, middle, and late-making random truncation ineffective.
To address this limitation, we propose Automatic Truncated Backpropagation
Through Time (AT-BPTT), a novel framework that dynamically adapts both
truncation positions and window sizes according to intrinsic gradient behavior.
AT-BPTT introduces three key components: (1) a probabilistic mechanism for
stage-aware timestep selection, (2) an adaptive window sizing strategy based on
gradient variation, and (3) a low-rank Hessian approximation to reduce
computational overhead. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
Tiny-ImageNet, and ImageNet-1K show that AT-BPTT achieves state-of-the-art
performance, improving accuracy by an average of 6.16% over baseline methods.
Moreover, our approach accelerates inner-loop optimization by 3.9x while saving
63% memory cost.

Abstract: An accurate and up-to-date model of a photovoltaic (PV) power plant is
essential for its optimal operation and maintenance. However, such a model may
not be easily available. This work introduces a novel approach for PV power
plant mapping based on aerial overview images. It enables the automation of the
mapping process while removing the reliance on third-party data. The presented
mapping method takes advantage of the structural layout of the power plants to
achieve detailed modeling down to the level of individual PV modules. The
approach relies on visual segmentation of PV modules in overview images and the
inference of structural information in each image, assigning modules to
individual benches, rows, and columns. We identify visual keypoints related to
the layout and use these to merge detections from multiple images while
maintaining their structural integrity. The presented method was experimentally
verified and evaluated on two different power plants. The final fusion of 3D
positions and semantic structures results in a compact georeferenced model
suitable for power plant maintenance.

Abstract: Understanding the dynamic relationship between humans and the built
environment is a key challenge in disciplines ranging from environmental
psychology to reinforcement learning (RL). A central obstacle in modeling these
interactions is the inability to capture human psychological states in a way
that is both generalizable and privacy preserving. Traditional methods rely on
theoretical models or questionnaires, which are limited in scope, static, and
labor intensive. We present a kinesics recognition framework that infers the
communicative functions of human activity -- known as kinesics -- directly from
3D skeleton joint data. Combining a spatial-temporal graph convolutional
network (ST-GCN) with a convolutional neural network (CNN), the framework
leverages transfer learning to bypass the need for manually defined mappings
between physical actions and psychological categories. The approach preserves
user anonymity while uncovering latent structures in bodily movements that
reflect cognitive and emotional states. Our results on the Dyadic User
EngagemenT (DUET) dataset demonstrate that this method enables scalable,
accurate, and human-centered modeling of behavior, offering a new pathway for
enhancing RL-driven simulations of human-environment interaction.

Abstract: Cyber-physical systems (CPS) integrate sensing, computing, and control to
improve infrastructure performance, focusing on economic goals like performance
and safety. However, they often neglect potential human-centered (or
''social'') benefits. Cyber-physical-social infrastructure systems (CPSIS) aim
to address this by aligning CPS with social objectives. This involves defining
social benefits, understanding human interactions with each other and
infrastructure, developing privacy-preserving measurement methods, modeling
these interactions for prediction, linking them to social benefits, and
actuating the physical environment to foster positive social outcomes. This
paper delves into recognizing dyadic human interactions using real-world data,
which is the backbone to measuring social behavior. This lays a foundation to
address the need to enhance understanding of the deeper meanings and mutual
responses inherent in human interactions. While RGB cameras are informative for
interaction recognition, privacy concerns arise. Depth sensors offer a
privacy-conscious alternative by analyzing skeletal movements. This study
compares five skeleton-based interaction recognition algorithms on a dataset of
12 dyadic interactions. Unlike single-person datasets, these interactions,
categorized into communication types like emblems and affect displays, offer
insights into the cultural and emotional aspects of human interactions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种结合早期退出和知识蒸馏的动态神经网络压缩方法，通过引入新的基于熵的损失函数来优化学生模型训练，在保持分类性能的同时显著降低计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络虽然性能优越，但计算成本高，难以应用于实时和边缘场景。需要开发既能压缩模型又能在运行时动态调整压缩级别的技术。

Method: 将早期退出和知识蒸馏两种技术结合，训练简化的学生早期退出模型。关键创新是引入新的基于熵的损失函数，专门处理教师模型分类错误的图像。

Result: 在CIFAR10、CIFAR100和SVHN数据集上的实验验证了该方法的有效性，实现了计算复杂度的显著降低，同时保持了分类性能。

Conclusion: 该方法成功优化了准确性与效率之间的权衡，为知识蒸馏在其他场景的应用开辟了新的研究视角。

Abstract: Although deep neural networks and in particular Convolutional Neural Networks
have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in image classification with
relatively high efficiency, they still exhibit high computational costs, often
rendering them impractical for real-time and edge applications. Therefore, a
multitude of compression techniques have been developed to reduce these costs
while maintaining accuracy. In addition, dynamic architectures have been
introduced to modulate the level of compression at execution time, which is a
desirable property in many resource-limited application scenarios. The proposed
method effectively integrates two well-established optimization techniques:
early exits and knowledge distillation, where a reduced student early-exit
model is trained from a more complex teacher early-exit model. The primary
contribution of this research lies in the approach for training the student
early-exit model. In comparison to the conventional Knowledge Distillation
loss, our approach incorporates a new entropy-based loss for images where the
teacher's classification was incorrect. The proposed method optimizes the
trade-off between accuracy and efficiency, thereby achieving significant
reductions in computational complexity without compromising classification
performance. The validity of this approach is substantiated by experimental
results on image classification datasets CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and SVHN, which
further opens new research perspectives for Knowledge Distillation in other
contexts.

TL;DR: μDeepIQA是一种基于深度学习的图像质量评估方法，专门针对光学显微镜图像，能够快速稳定地预测图像质量，并能可视化单张图像中空间变化的图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图像质量评估方法在处理大规模数据集时计算成本高，且对超出理想域的图像不稳定，需要开发更高效、泛化能力更强的IQA方法。

Method: 采用为自然图像设计的深度卷积神经网络架构，重新训练该架构以预测光学显微镜数据的个体质量指标和全局质量分数。

Result: μDeepIQA能够提供快速稳定的图像质量预测，即使在标准方法理想范围之外也能泛化质量估计，并能进行基于图像块的质量预测。

Conclusion: 深度学习模型因其在异常值存在下的稳定性能、评估小图像块的能力和快速预测，使光学显微镜研究受益于其泛化能力。

Abstract: Optical microscopy is one of the most widely used techniques in research
studies for life sciences and biomedicine. These applications require reliable
experimental pipelines to extract valuable knowledge from the measured samples
and must be supported by image quality assessment (IQA) to ensure correct
processing and analysis of the image data. IQA methods are implemented with
variable complexity. However, while most quality metrics have a straightforward
implementation, they might be time consuming and computationally expensive when
evaluating a large dataset. In addition, quality metrics are often designed for
well-defined image features and may be unstable for images out of the ideal
domain.
  To overcome these limitations, recent works have proposed deep learning-based
IQA methods, which can provide superior performance, increased generalizability
and fast prediction. Our method, named $\mathrm{\mu}$DeepIQA, is inspired by
previous studies and applies a deep convolutional neural network designed for
IQA on natural images to optical microscopy measurements. We retrained the same
architecture to predict individual quality metrics and global quality scores
for optical microscopy data. The resulting models provide fast and stable
predictions of image quality by generalizing quality estimation even outside
the ideal range of standard methods. In addition, $\mathrm{\mu}$DeepIQA
provides patch-wise prediction of image quality and can be used to visualize
spatially varying quality in a single image. Our study demonstrates that
optical microscopy-based studies can benefit from the generalizability of deep
learning models due to their stable performance in the presence of outliers,
the ability to assess small image patches, and rapid predictions.

Abstract: This paper presents an end-to-end, IoT-enabled robotic system for the
non-destructive, real-time, and spatially-resolved mapping of grape yield and
quality (Brix, Acidity) in vineyards. The system features a comprehensive
analytical pipeline that integrates two key modules: a high-performance model
for grape bunch detection and weight estimation, and a novel deep learning
framework for quality assessment from hyperspectral (HSI) data. A critical
barrier to in-field HSI is the ``domain shift" caused by variable illumination.
To overcome this, our quality assessment is powered by the Light-Invariant
Spectral Autoencoder (LISA), a domain-adversarial framework that learns
illumination-invariant features from uncalibrated data. We validated the
system's robustness on a purpose-built HSI dataset spanning three distinct
illumination domains: controlled artificial lighting (lab), and variable
natural sunlight captured in the morning and afternoon. Results show the
complete pipeline achieves a recall (0.82) for bunch detection and a $R^2$
(0.76) for weight prediction, while the LISA module improves quality prediction
generalization by over 20% compared to the baselines. By combining these robust
modules, the system successfully generates high-resolution, georeferenced data
of both grape yield and quality, providing actionable, data-driven insights for
precision viticulture.

Abstract: Benthic habitat mapping is fundamental for understanding marine ecosystems,
guiding conservation efforts, and supporting sustainable resource management.
Yet, the scarcity of large, annotated datasets limits the development and
benchmarking of machine learning models in this domain. This paper introduces a
thorough multi-modal dataset, comprising about a million side-scan sonar (SSS)
tiles collected along the coast of Catalonia (Spain), complemented by
bathymetric maps and a set of co-registered optical images from targeted
surveys using an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). Approximately \num{36000}
of the SSS tiles have been manually annotated with segmentation masks to enable
supervised fine-tuning of classification models. All the raw sensor data,
together with mosaics, are also released to support further exploration and
algorithm development. To address challenges in multi-sensor data fusion for
AUVs, we spatially associate optical images with corresponding SSS tiles,
facilitating self-supervised, cross-modal representation learning. Accompanying
open-source preprocessing and annotation tools are provided to enhance
accessibility and encourage research. This resource aims to establish a
standardized benchmark for underwater habitat mapping, promoting advancements
in autonomous seafloor classification and multi-sensor integration.

Motivation: 深度学习在遥感图像分类中很重要，但预定义的标签层次结构经常被忽视，大多数方法只关注细粒度分类方案，需要更好地利用层次语义关系。

Method: 在深度网络架构中集成层次特定分类头，使用可训练层次矩阵以自监督方式学习层次结构，并引入层次共识机制确保不同层次级别概率分布的一致性。

Conclusion: SAHC方法能够有效利用层次分类任务的固有结构，在遥感图像分类任务中表现出良好的适应性和性能。

Abstract: Deep learning has become increasingly important in remote sensing image
classification due to its ability to extract semantic information from complex
data. Classification tasks often include predefined label hierarchies that
represent the semantic relationships among classes. However, these hierarchies
are frequently overlooked, and most approaches focus only on fine-grained
classification schemes. In this paper, we present a novel Semantics-Aware
Hierarchical Consensus (SAHC) method for learning hierarchical features and
relationships by integrating hierarchy-specific classification heads within a
deep network architecture, each specialized in different degrees of class
granularity. The proposed approach employs trainable hierarchy matrices, which
guide the network through the learning of the hierarchical structure in a
self-supervised manner. Furthermore, we introduce a hierarchical consensus
mechanism to ensure consistent probability distributions across different
hierarchical levels. This mechanism acts as a weighted ensemble being able to
effectively leverage the inherent structure of the hierarchical classification
task. The proposed SAHC method is evaluated on three benchmark datasets with
different degrees of hierarchical complexity on different tasks, using distinct
backbone architectures to effectively emphasize its adaptability. Experimental
results show both the effectiveness of the proposed approach in guiding network
learning and the robustness of the hierarchical consensus for remote sensing
image classification tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了首个针对医学图像分类的解剖学指导的混合专家框架REN，通过七个专门针对不同肺叶的专家网络，结合多模态门控机制，在间质性肺病分类中取得了显著优于基线方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统混合专家架构缺乏医学影像所需的解剖学约束，而肺部的解剖结构和区域疾病异质性对病理模式有重要影响，需要专门针对医学影像的解剖学指导框架。

Method: 利用解剖学先验训练七个专门针对不同肺叶和双侧肺组合的专家网络；采用多模态门控机制动态整合放射组学生物标志物和深度学习特征（CNN、ViT、Mamba）来优化专家贡献权重。

Result: 在间质性肺病分类中，放射组学引导的集成方法平均AUC达到0.8646±0.0467，比SwinUNETR基线提高12.5%；下叶模型AUC达到0.88-0.90，优于深度学习对应方法（CNN：0.76-0.79）。

Conclusion: REN展示了强大的泛化能力和临床可解释性，提供了一个可扩展的解剖学指导方法，可轻松扩展到其他结构化医学影像应用。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have significantly contributed to
scalable machine learning by enabling specialized subnetworks to tackle complex
tasks efficiently. However, traditional MoE systems lack domain-specific
constraints essential for medical imaging, where anatomical structure and
regional disease heterogeneity strongly influence pathological patterns. Here,
we introduce Regional Expert Networks (REN), the first anatomically-informed
MoE framework tailored specifically for medical image classification. REN
leverages anatomical priors to train seven specialized experts, each dedicated
to distinct lung lobes and bilateral lung combinations, enabling precise
modeling of region-specific pathological variations. Multi-modal gating
mechanisms dynamically integrate radiomics biomarkers and deep learning (DL)
features (CNN, ViT, Mamba) to weight expert contributions optimally. Applied to
interstitial lung disease (ILD) classification, REN achieves consistently
superior performance: the radiomics-guided ensemble reached an average AUC of
0.8646 +/- 0.0467, a +12.5 percent improvement over the SwinUNETR baseline (AUC
0.7685, p = 0.031). Region-specific experts further revealed that lower-lobe
models achieved AUCs of 0.88-0.90, surpassing DL counterparts (CNN: 0.76-0.79)
and aligning with known disease progression patterns. Through rigorous
patient-level cross-validation, REN demonstrates strong generalizability and
clinical interpretability, presenting a scalable, anatomically-guided approach
readily extensible to other structured medical imaging applications.

Abstract: Academic presentation videos have become an essential medium for research
communication, yet producing them remains highly labor-intensive, often
requiring hours of slide design, recording, and editing for a short 2 to 10
minutes video. Unlike natural video, presentation video generation involves
distinctive challenges: inputs from research papers, dense multi-modal
information (text, figures, tables), and the need to coordinate multiple
aligned channels such as slides, subtitles, speech, and human talker. To
address these challenges, we introduce PaperTalker, the first benchmark of 101
research papers paired with author-created presentation videos, slides, and
speaker metadata. We further design four tailored evaluation metrics--Meta
Similarity, PresentArena, PresentQuiz, and IP Memory--to measure how videos
convey the paper's information to the audience. Building on this foundation, we
propose PaperTalker, the first multi-agent framework for academic presentation
video generation. It integrates slide generation with effective layout
refinement by a novel effective tree search visual choice, cursor grounding,
subtitling, speech synthesis, and talking-head rendering, while parallelizing
slide-wise generation for efficiency. Experiments on Paper2Video demonstrate
that the presentation videos produced by our approach are more faithful and
informative than existing baselines, establishing a practical step toward
automated and ready-to-use academic video generation. Our dataset, agent, and
code are available at https://github.com/showlab/Paper2Video.

Motivation: 传统主动学习需要大量人工标注且迭代过程耗时，无监督主动学习(UAL)虽然将标注负担转移到后选择步骤，但现有方法性能不足，存在对噪声数据敏感和样本代表性不足的问题。

Method: 提出自然特征渐进框架(NFPF)，使用特定特征学习机(SFLM)量化样本对模型性能的贡献，并定义重构差异度量进行初始样本选择。

Result: NFPF在视觉数据集上显著超越所有现有UAL方法，性能与监督AL方法相当，具有更强的鲁棒性和更好的数据分布覆盖。

Conclusion: NFPF通过创新的样本重要性度量方法，为无监督主动学习提供了有效解决方案，在减少人工标注负担的同时保持了高性能。

Abstract: The effectiveness of modern deep learning models is predicated on the
availability of large-scale, human-annotated datasets, a process that is
notoriously expensive and time-consuming. While Active Learning (AL) offers a
strategic solution by labeling only the most informative and representative
data, its iterative nature still necessitates significant human involvement.
Unsupervised Active Learning (UAL) presents an alternative by shifting the
annotation burden to a single, post-selection step. Unfortunately, prevailing
UAL methods struggle to achieve state-of-the-art performance. These approaches
typically rely on local, gradient-based scoring for sample importance
estimation, which not only makes them vulnerable to ambiguous and noisy data
but also hinders their capacity to select samples that adequately represent the
full data distribution. Moreover, their use of shallow, one-shot linear
selection falls short of a true UAL paradigm. In this paper, we propose the
Natural Feature Progressive Framework (NFPF), a UAL method that revolutionizes
how sample importance is measured. At its core, NFPF employs a Specific Feature
Learning Machine (SFLM) to effectively quantify each sample's contribution to
model performance. We further utilize the SFLM to define a powerful
Reconstruction Difference metric for initial sample selection. Our
comprehensive experiments show that NFPF significantly outperforms all
established UAL methods and achieves performance on par with supervised AL
methods on vision datasets. Detailed ablation studies and qualitative
visualizations provide compelling evidence for NFPF's superior performance,
enhanced robustness, and improved data distribution coverage.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CA3D-Diff是一个基于条件扩散模型的双向乳腺X光片视图转换框架，通过列感知交叉注意力和隐式3D结构重建来解决乳腺X光片视图转换中的结构不对齐问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在真实临床工作流中，乳腺X光片的CC和MLO视图可能因采集错误或压缩伪影而缺失、损坏或降质，限制了后续分析的有效性。视图间转换可以帮助恢复缺失视图并改善病变对齐。

Method: 1. 设计列感知交叉注意力机制，利用解剖对应区域在跨视图中倾向于位于相似列位置的几何特性；2. 引入隐式3D结构重建模块，将噪声2D潜在特征反投影到基于乳腺视图投影几何的粗糙3D特征体积中；3. 使用高斯衰减偏置强调局部列相关性，同时抑制远距离不匹配。

Result: CA3D-Diff在双向任务中实现了卓越性能，在视觉保真度和结构一致性方面优于最先进的方法。合成的视图有效改善了筛查设置中的单视图恶性分类。

Conclusion: 该方法在真实世界诊断中具有实用价值，能够通过视图转换提高乳腺X光片分析的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: Dual-view mammography, including craniocaudal (CC) and mediolateral oblique
(MLO) projections, offers complementary anatomical views crucial for breast
cancer diagnosis. However, in real-world clinical workflows, one view may be
missing, corrupted, or degraded due to acquisition errors or compression
artifacts, limiting the effectiveness of downstream analysis. View-to-view
translation can help recover missing views and improve lesion alignment. Unlike
natural images, this task in mammography is highly challenging due to large
non-rigid deformations and severe tissue overlap in X-ray projections, which
obscure pixel-level correspondences. In this paper, we propose Column-Aware and
Implicit 3D Diffusion (CA3D-Diff), a novel bidirectional mammogram view
translation framework based on conditional diffusion model. To address
cross-view structural misalignment, we first design a column-aware
cross-attention mechanism that leverages the geometric property that
anatomically corresponding regions tend to lie in similar column positions
across views. A Gaussian-decayed bias is applied to emphasize local column-wise
correlations while suppressing distant mismatches. Furthermore, we introduce an
implicit 3D structure reconstruction module that back-projects noisy 2D latents
into a coarse 3D feature volume based on breast-view projection geometry. The
reconstructed 3D structure is refined and injected into the denoising UNet to
guide cross-view generation with enhanced anatomical awareness. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that CA3D-Diff achieves superior performance in
bidirectional tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in visual fidelity
and structural consistency. Furthermore, the synthesized views effectively
improve single-view malignancy classification in screening settings,
demonstrating the practical value of our method in real-world diagnostics.

Motivation: 解决当前KL-VAE分词器需要对抗损失和扩散解码器采样时间较长的问题，开发一种更稳定、高效的替代方案。

Method: 提出新的像素扩散解码器架构，利用transformer组件和无GAN训练，通过蒸馏技术将扩散解码器性能复制到高效的单步解码器中。

Result: SSDD将重建FID从0.87提升到0.50，吞吐量提高1.4倍，DiT生成质量保持的同时采样速度加快3.8倍。

Conclusion: SSDD可作为KL-VAE的直接替代品，用于构建更高质量和更快的生成模型。

Abstract: Tokenizers are a key component of state-of-the-art generative image models,
extracting the most important features from the signal while reducing data
dimension and redundancy. Most current tokenizers are based on KL-regularized
variational autoencoders (KL-VAE), trained with reconstruction, perceptual and
adversarial losses. Diffusion decoders have been proposed as a more principled
alternative to model the distribution over images conditioned on the latent.
However, matching the performance of KL-VAE still requires adversarial losses,
as well as a higher decoding time due to iterative sampling. To address these
limitations, we introduce a new pixel diffusion decoder architecture for
improved scaling and training stability, benefiting from transformer components
and GAN-free training. We use distillation to replicate the performance of the
diffusion decoder in an efficient single-step decoder. This makes SSDD the
first diffusion decoder optimized for single-step reconstruction trained
without adversarial losses, reaching higher reconstruction quality and faster
sampling than KL-VAE. In particular, SSDD improves reconstruction FID from
$0.87$ to $0.50$ with $1.4\times$ higher throughput and preserve generation
quality of DiTs with $3.8\times$ faster sampling. As such, SSDD can be used as
a drop-in replacement for KL-VAE, and for building higher-quality and faster
generative models.

Motivation: 视觉基础模型所有者需要保护知识产权，防止非法再分发。现有方法需要可靠的所有权验证工具来区分受保护模型的再分发副本和独立模型。

Method: 微调视觉基础模型的一小部分表达层，结合小型编码器-解码器网络，在输入图像的内部表示中嵌入数字水印。

Abstract: Being trained on large and vast datasets, visual foundation models (VFMs) can
be fine-tuned for diverse downstream tasks, achieving remarkable performance
and efficiency in various computer vision applications. The high computation
cost of data collection and training motivates the owners of some VFMs to
distribute them alongside the license to protect their intellectual property
rights. However, a dishonest user of the protected model's copy may illegally
redistribute it, for example, to make a profit. As a consequence, the
development of reliable ownership verification tools is of great importance
today, since such methods can be used to differentiate between a redistributed
copy of the protected model and an independent model. In this paper, we propose
an approach to ownership verification of visual foundation models by
fine-tuning a small set of expressive layers of a VFM along with a small
encoder-decoder network to embed digital watermarks into an internal
representation of a hold-out set of input images. Importantly, the watermarks
embedded remain detectable in the functional copies of the protected model,
obtained, for example, by fine-tuning the VFM for a particular downstream task.
Theoretically and experimentally, we demonstrate that the proposed method
yields a low probability of false detection of a non-watermarked model and a
low probability of false misdetection of a watermarked model.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的潜在不确定性表示方法（LUR和RLUR），通过在预训练DNN中添加变换层来生成多个潜在表示以估计不确定性，在视频驾驶行为识别任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络在资源受限的安全关键任务中应用广泛，但现有最后一层概率深度学习方法检测分布外实例的性能不稳定，需要更有效的替代方案。

Method: 扩展预训练DNN，添加变换层生成多个潜在表示来估计不确定性，提出LUR和排斥训练的RLUR方法。

Result: LUR和RLUR在分布内分类性能与其他方法相当，在不确定性驱动的分布外检测中，LUR与最佳方法表现相当，且训练更高效、调参更容易。

Conclusion: LUR方法在保持良好性能的同时，比需要马尔可夫链蒙特卡洛采样或排斥训练的方法更高效易用。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are increasingly applied to safety-critical tasks
in resource-constrained environments, such as video-based driver action and
intention recognition. While last layer probabilistic deep learning (LL-PDL)
methods can detect out-of-distribution (OOD) instances, their performance
varies. As an alternative to last layer approaches, we propose extending
pre-trained DNNs with transformation layers to produce multiple latent
representations to estimate the uncertainty. We evaluate our latent uncertainty
representation (LUR) and repulsively trained LUR (RLUR) approaches against
eight PDL methods across four video-based driver action and intention
recognition datasets, comparing classification performance, calibration, and
uncertainty-based OOD detection. We also contribute 28,000 frame-level action
labels and 1,194 video-level intention labels for the NuScenes dataset. Our
results show that LUR and RLUR achieve comparable in-distribution
classification performance to other LL-PDL approaches. For uncertainty-based
OOD detection, LUR matches top-performing PDL methods while being more
efficient to train and easier to tune than approaches that require Markov-Chain
Monte Carlo sampling or repulsive training procedures.

Motivation: 帕金森病早期诊断至关重要，但传统诊断方法繁琐且昂贵，需要开发非侵入性、成本效益高的解决方案。

Method: 采用卷积神经网络、迁移学习和注意力机制，通过数据增强增加图像多样性，架构包括预训练CNN、自定义卷积层和集成投票三个阶段。

Result: 螺旋图像精确率、召回率和F1分数为90%，波浪图像为96.67%，通过硬投票集成后整体准确率达到93.3%。

Conclusion: 机器学习在帕金森病早期诊断中具有巨大潜力，为改善患者预后提供了非侵入性和成本效益高的解决方案。

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative condition
characterized by the death of dopaminergic neurons, leading to various movement
disorder symptoms. Early diagnosis of PD is crucial to prevent adverse effects,
yet traditional diagnostic methods are often cumbersome and costly. In this
study, a machine learning-based approach is proposed using hand-drawn spiral
and wave images as potential biomarkers for PD detection. Our methodology
leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs), transfer learning, and
attention mechanisms to improve model performance and resilience against
overfitting. To enhance the diversity and richness of both spiral and wave
categories, the training dataset undergoes augmentation to increase the number
of images. The proposed architecture comprises three phases: utilizing
pre-trained CNNs, incorporating custom convolutional layers, and ensemble
voting. Employing hard voting further enhances performance by aggregating
predictions from multiple models. Experimental results show promising accuracy
rates. For spiral images, weighted average precision, recall, and F1-score are
90%, and for wave images, they are 96.67%. After combining the predictions
through ensemble hard voting, the overall accuracy is 93.3%. These findings
underscore the potential of machine learning in early PD diagnosis, offering a
non-invasive and cost-effective solution to improve patient outcomes.

Abstract: Video understanding represents the most challenging frontier in computer
vision, requiring models to reason about complex spatiotemporal relationships,
long-term dependencies, and multimodal evidence. The recent emergence of
Video-Large Multimodal Models (Video-LMMs), which integrate visual encoders
with powerful decoder-based language models, has demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in video understanding tasks. However, the critical phase that
transforms these models from basic perception systems into sophisticated
reasoning engines, post-training, remains fragmented across the literature.
This survey provides the first comprehensive examination of post-training
methodologies for Video-LMMs, encompassing three fundamental pillars:
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with chain-of-thought, reinforcement learning (RL)
from verifiable objectives, and test-time scaling (TTS) through enhanced
inference computation. We present a structured taxonomy that clarifies the
roles, interconnections, and video-specific adaptations of these techniques,
addressing unique challenges such as temporal localization, spatiotemporal
grounding, long video efficiency, and multimodal evidence integration. Through
systematic analysis of representative methods, we synthesize key design
principles, insights, and evaluation protocols while identifying critical open
challenges in reward design, scalability, and cost-performance optimization. We
further curate essential benchmarks, datasets, and metrics to facilitate
rigorous assessment of post-training effectiveness. This survey aims to provide
researchers and practitioners with a unified framework for advancing Video-LMM
capabilities. Additional resources and updates are maintained at:

Motivation: 分割匹配比关键点匹配更能捕获结构化区域，对遮挡、光照变化和视角变化具有更强鲁棒性，但宽基线设置下的极端视角变化仍是挑战

Method: 提出一种利用3D基础模型归纳偏置的架构，能够匹配视角变化高达180度的图像对中的分割区域

Conclusion: 该方法在3D实例分割和图像目标导航等下游任务中表现出显著优势，证明了3D基础模型在分割匹配任务中的有效性

Abstract: Segment matching is an important intermediate task in computer vision that
establishes correspondences between semantically or geometrically coherent
regions across images. Unlike keypoint matching, which focuses on localized
features, segment matching captures structured regions, offering greater
robustness to occlusions, lighting variations, and viewpoint changes. In this
paper, we leverage the spatial understanding of 3D foundation models to tackle
wide-baseline segment matching, a challenging setting involving extreme
viewpoint shifts. We propose an architecture that uses the inductive bias of
these 3D foundation models to match segments across image pairs with up to 180
degree view-point change. Extensive experiments show that our approach
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, including the SAM2 video propagator and
local feature matching methods, by upto 30% on the AUPRC metric, on ScanNet++
and Replica datasets. We further demonstrate benefits of the proposed model on
relevant downstream tasks, including 3D instance segmentation and image-goal
navigation. Project Page: https://segmast3r.github.io/

TL;DR: 提出一种针对对比度失真图像的无参考图像质量评估方法，通过选择最合适的对比度增强算法生成伪参考图像，将NR-IQA问题转化为FR-IQA问题以提高准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对比度变化是影响图像质量的重要因素，但在图像质量评估中常被忽视。现有方法主要关注模糊和噪声等失真，而对比度失真的视觉影响和特性与常规失真不同。

Method: 使用一组对比度增强算法生成视觉上接近实际参考图像的伪参考图像，训练分类网络根据图像内容和失真选择最合适的对比度增强算法，然后在FR模式下评估对比度增强图像与退化图像之间的质量差异。

Result: 在包含对比度失真的三个数据库（CCID2014、TID2013和CSIQ）上的性能评估表明，所提方法具有良好性能。

Conclusion: 该方法通过将NR-IQA转化为FR-IQA，有效解决了对比度失真图像的质量评估问题，在多个数据库上表现出色。

Abstract: Contrast change is an important factor that affects the quality of images.
During image capturing, unfavorable lighting conditions can cause contrast
change and visual quality loss. While various methods have been proposed to
assess the quality of images under different distortions such as blur and
noise, contrast distortion has been largely overlooked as its visual impact and
properties are different from other conventional types of distortions. In this
paper, we propose a no-reference image quality assessment (NR-IQA) metric for
contrast-distorted images. Using a set of contrast enhancement algorithms, we
aim to generate pseudo-reference images that are visually close to the actual
reference image, such that the NR problem is transformed to a Full-reference
(FR) assessment with higher accuracy. To this end, a large dataset of
contrast-enhanced images is produced to train a classification network that can
select the most suitable contrast enhancement algorithm based on image content
and distortion for pseudo-reference image generation. Finally, the evaluation
is performed in the FR manner to assess the quality difference between the
contrast-enhanced (pseudoreference) and degraded images. Performance evaluation
of the proposed method on three databases containing contrast distortions
(CCID2014, TID2013, and CSIQ), indicates the promising performance of the
proposed method.

Abstract: Efficient and accurate classification of waste and industrial surface defects
is essential for ensuring sustainable waste management and maintaining high
standards in quality control. This paper introduces the Neuroplastic Modular
Classifier, a novel hybrid architecture designed for robust and adaptive image
classification in dynamic environments. The model combines a ResNet-50 backbone
for localized feature extraction with a Vision Transformer (ViT) to capture
global semantic context. Additionally, FAISS-based similarity retrieval is
incorporated to provide a memory-like reference to previously encountered data,
enriching the model's feature space. A key innovation of our architecture is
the neuroplastic modular design composed of expandable, learnable blocks that
dynamically grow during training when performance plateaus. Inspired by
biological learning systems, this mechanism allows the model to adapt to data
complexity over time, improving generalization. Beyond garbage classification,
we validate the model on the Kolektor Surface Defect Dataset 2 (KolektorSDD2),
which involves industrial defect detection on metal surfaces. Experimental
results across domains show that the proposed architecture outperforms
traditional static models in both accuracy and adaptability. The Neuroplastic
Modular Classifier offers a scalable, high-performance solution for real-world
image classification, with strong applicability in both environmental and
industrial domains.

Abstract: While modern visual generation models excel at creating aesthetically
pleasing natural images, they struggle with producing or editing structured
visuals like charts, diagrams, and mathematical figures, which demand
composition planning, text rendering, and multimodal reasoning for factual
fidelity. To address this, we present the first comprehensive, systematic
investigation of this domain, encompassing data construction, model training,
and an evaluation benchmark. First, we construct a large-scale dataset of 1.3
million high-quality structured image pairs derived from executable drawing
programs and augmented with chain-of-thought reasoning annotations. Building on
it, we train a unified model that integrates a VLM with FLUX.1 Kontext via a
lightweight connector for enhanced multimodal understanding. A three-stage
training curriculum enables progressive feature alignment, knowledge infusion,
and reasoning-augmented generation, further boosted by an external reasoner at
inference time. Finally, we introduce StructBench, a novel benchmark for
generation and editing with over 1,700 challenging instances, and an
accompanying evaluation metric, StructScore, which employs a multi-round Q\&A
protocol to assess fine-grained factual accuracy. Evaluations of 15 models
reveal that even leading closed-source systems remain far from satisfactory.
Our model attains strong editing performance, and inference-time reasoning
yields consistent gains across diverse architectures. By releasing the dataset,
model, and benchmark, we aim to advance unified multimodal foundations for
structured visuals.

Motivation: 解决文本到视频生成中跨角色交互的挑战，即如何在保持角色身份和行为特征的同时，让来自不同世界的角色自然互动，避免风格混淆问题。

Method: 使用跨角色嵌入(CCE)学习角色的身份和行为逻辑，以及跨角色增强(CCA)通过合成共存和混合风格数据来丰富训练。

Result: 在包含10个卡通和真人角色的基准测试中，在身份保持、交互质量和风格混淆鲁棒性方面均显示出明显改进。

Conclusion: 该框架能够实现先前不共存角色间的自然互动，同时保持风格保真度，为生成式故事讲述开辟了新形式。

Abstract: Imagine Mr. Bean stepping into Tom and Jerry--can we generate videos where
characters interact naturally across different worlds? We study inter-character
interaction in text-to-video generation, where the key challenge is to preserve
each character's identity and behaviors while enabling coherent cross-context
interaction. This is difficult because characters may never have coexisted and
because mixing styles often causes style delusion, where realistic characters
appear cartoonish or vice versa. We introduce a framework that tackles these
issues with Cross-Character Embedding (CCE), which learns identity and
behavioral logic across multimodal sources, and Cross-Character Augmentation
(CCA), which enriches training with synthetic co-existence and mixed-style
data. Together, these techniques allow natural interactions between previously
uncoexistent characters without losing stylistic fidelity. Experiments on a
curated benchmark of cartoons and live-action series with 10 characters show
clear improvements in identity preservation, interaction quality, and
robustness to style delusion, enabling new forms of generative
storytelling.Additional results and videos are available on our project page:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频生成模型难以合成具有连贯因果链的复杂动态，而多模态模型具备强大的视觉状态推理能力，需要将两者优势结合。

Method: 利用大型多模态模型生成稀疏关键帧作为快照，然后在这些关键时刻对预训练视频生成器进行稀疏推理时调优。

Result: 在复杂多步骤场景的广泛实验中，VChain显著提升了生成视频的质量。

Conclusion: VChain通过高效的调优方法，以最小开销实现了视频生成质量的显著提升，特别是在复杂动态建模方面。

Abstract: Recent video generation models can produce smooth and visually appealing
clips, but they often struggle to synthesize complex dynamics with a coherent
chain of consequences. Accurately modeling visual outcomes and state
transitions over time remains a core challenge. In contrast, large language and
multimodal models (e.g., GPT-4o) exhibit strong visual state reasoning and
future prediction capabilities. To bridge these strengths, we introduce VChain,
a novel inference-time chain-of-visual-thought framework that injects visual
reasoning signals from multimodal models into video generation. Specifically,
VChain contains a dedicated pipeline that leverages large multimodal models to
generate a sparse set of critical keyframes as snapshots, which are then used
to guide the sparse inference-time tuning of a pre-trained video generator only
at these key moments. Our approach is tuning-efficient, introduces minimal
overhead and avoids dense supervision. Extensive experiments on complex,
multi-step scenarios show that VChain significantly enhances the quality of
generated videos.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 监督微调(SFT)在适应大语言模型到下游任务时很有效，但训练数据的变异性会阻碍模型的跨领域泛化能力，特别是在自然语言到SQL(NL2SQL)任务中。

Method: 通过比较训练集、目标数据和模型预测中SQL结构特征的分布来估计对齐度，在三个大型跨领域NL2SQL基准和多个模型系列上进行全面实验。

Result: 结构对齐度是微调成功的强预测因子：对齐度高时，SFT能显著提升准确率和SQL生成质量；对齐度低时，改进很小或没有。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在NL2SQL任务中采用对齐感知的数据选择对于有效微调和泛化的重要性。

Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) is an effective method for adapting Large
Language Models (LLMs) on downstream tasks. However, variability in training
data can hinder a model's ability to generalize across domains. This paper
studies the problem of dataset alignment for Natural Language to SQL (NL2SQL or
text to SQL), examining how well SFT training data matches the structural
characteristics of target queries and how this alignment impacts model
performance. We hypothesize that alignment can be accurately estimated by
comparing the distributions of structural SQL features across the training set,
target data, and the model's predictions prior to SFT. Through comprehensive
experiments on three large cross-domain NL2SQL benchmarks and multiple model
families, we show that structural alignment is a strong predictor of
fine-tuning success. When alignment is high, SFT yields substantial gains in
accuracy and SQL generation quality; when alignment is low, improvements are
marginal or absent. These findings highlight the importance of alignment-aware
data selection for effective fine-tuning and generalization in NL2SQL tasks.

Method: 分析GPT2-Small第一层中注意力模式分散的注意力头，利用校准文本采样softmax分母，将这些稳定头的组合输出近似为周围文本的线性摘要，从而识别对上下文属性敏感的神经元。

Result: 仅从模型权重和单个校准文本就能发现数百个第一层神经元对周围文本的高级上下文属性（包括在校准文本上未激活的神经元）产生响应。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种仅从模型权重和校准文本就能有效识别transformer语言模型中神经元对高级上下文属性响应模式的分析框架。

Abstract: We study transformer language models, analyzing attention heads whose
attention patterns are spread out, and whose attention scores depend weakly on
content. We argue that the softmax denominators of these heads are stable when
the underlying token distribution is fixed. By sampling softmax denominators
from a "calibration text", we can combine together the outputs of multiple such
stable heads in the first layer of GPT2-Small, approximating their combined
output by a linear summary of the surrounding text. This approximation enables
a procedure where from the weights alone - and a single calibration text - we
can uncover hundreds of first layer neurons that respond to high-level
contextual properties of the surrounding text, including neurons that didn't
activate on the calibration text.

Conclusion: Graph-S³框架通过合成监督和逐步评估有效解决了文本图QA中的图检索挑战，性能显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: A significant portion of real-world data is inherently represented as textual
graphs, and integrating these graphs into large language models (LLMs) is
promising to enable complex graph-based question answering. However, a key
challenge in LLM-based textual graph QA systems lies in graph retrieval, i.e.,
how to retrieve relevant content from large graphs that is sufficiently
informative while remaining compact for the LLM context. Existing retrievers
suffer from poor performance since they either rely on shallow embedding
similarity or employ interactive retrieving policies that demand excessive data
labeling and training cost. To address these issues, we present Graph-$S^3$, an
agentic textual graph reasoning framework that employs an LLM-based retriever
trained with synthetic stepwise supervision. Instead of rewarding the agent
based on the final answers, which may lead to sparse and unstable training
signals, we propose to closely evaluate each step of the retriever based on
offline-extracted golden subgraphs. Our main techniques include a data
synthesis pipeline to extract the golden subgraphs for reward generation and a
two-stage training scheme to learn the interactive graph exploration policy
based on the synthesized rewards. Based on extensive experiments on three
common datasets in comparison with seven strong baselines, our approach
achieves an average improvement of 8.1\% in accuracy and 9.7\% in F$_1$ score.
The advantage is even higher in more complicated multi-hop reasoning tasks. Our
code will be open-sourced.

values these assistants display while completing subjective everyday tasks.
Humans may consider values like environmentalism, charity, and diversity. To
what extent do LLMs exhibit these values in completing everyday tasks? How do
they compare with humans? We answer these questions by auditing how six popular
LLMs complete 30 everyday tasks, comparing LLMs to each other and to 100 human
crowdworkers from the US. We find LLMs often do not align with humans, nor with
other LLMs, in the implicit values exhibited.

*Brendon Boldt,David Mortensen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CSAR算法通过互信息加权、贪婪选择、语料消减和重复迭代的方式从涌现语言语料中诱导语素


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一种能够从平行话语和意义对中自动发现语素的算法，用于分析涌现语言的特征

Method: 基于互信息的贪婪算法：1)计算形式与意义间的互信息权重 2)选择最高权重对 3)从语料中移除该对 4)重复过程诱导更多语素

Result: 在程序生成数据集上验证有效性，在人类语言数据上表现合理，能够量化涌现语言中的同义和多义程度等特征

Conclusion: CSAR算法能够有效从涌现语言中诱导语素，为分析语言特性提供了实用工具

Abstract: We introduce CSAR, an algorithm for inducing morphemes from emergent language
corpora of parallel utterances and meanings. It is a greedy algorithm that (1)
weights morphemes based on mutual information between forms and meanings, (2)
selects the highest-weighted pair, (3) removes it from the corpus, and (4)
repeats the process to induce further morphemes (i.e., Count, Select, Ablate,
Repeat). The effectiveness of CSAR is first validated on procedurally generated
datasets and compared against baselines for related tasks. Second, we validate
CSAR's performance on human language data to show that the algorithm makes
reasonable predictions in adjacent domains. Finally, we analyze a handful of
emergent languages, quantifying linguistic characteristics like degree of
synonymy and polysemy.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Omni-Embed-Nemotron是一个统一的多模态检索嵌入模型，支持文本、图像、音频和视频的跨模态和联合模态检索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于文本的检索器在处理现实世界中视觉和语义丰富的内容（如PDF、幻灯片、视频）时存在困难，需要支持更多模态的统一检索模型。

Method: 基于ColPali和Qwen2.5-Omni等模型的能力，扩展检索支持到音频和视频模态，使用单一模型实现跨模态和联合模态检索。

Result: 模型在文本、图像和视频检索方面表现出有效性。

Conclusion: Omni-Embed-Nemotron能够有效处理现实世界中复杂的信息检索需求，支持多种模态的统一检索。

Abstract: We present Omni-Embed-Nemotron, a unified multimodal retrieval embedding
model developed to handle the increasing complexity of real-world information
needs. While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has significantly advanced
language models by incorporating external knowledge, existing text-based
retrievers rely on clean, structured input and struggle with the visually and
semantically rich content found in real-world documents such as PDFs, slides,
or videos. Recent work such as ColPali has shown that preserving document
layout using image-based representations can improve retrieval quality.
Building on this, and inspired by the capabilities of recent multimodal models
such as Qwen2.5-Omni, we extend retrieval beyond text and images to also
support audio and video modalities. Omni-Embed-Nemotron enables both
cross-modal (e.g., text - video) and joint-modal (e.g., text - video+audio)
retrieval using a single model. We describe the architecture, training setup,
and evaluation results of Omni-Embed-Nemotron, and demonstrate its
effectiveness in text, image, and video retrieval.

TL;DR: 本文通过基于信号博弈的涌现通信环境和超参数优化，生成了与人类语言相似度最高的涌现语言，使用XferBench作为目标函数来量化统计相似性，并验证了熵对涌现语言迁移学习性能的预测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 设计一个能够生成与人类语言高度相似的涌现语言的通信环境，通过量化统计相似性来评估涌现语言的质量。

Method: 使用基于信号博弈的涌现通信环境，结合超参数优化和XferBench目标函数，测量涌现语言对深度迁移学习到人类语言的适用性。

Result: 生成了在统计相似性方面最先进的涌现语言，验证了熵对迁移学习性能的预测能力，并确认了涌现通信系统的熵最小化特性。

Conclusion: 确定了产生更真实涌现语言（即能更好迁移到人类语言）的超参数规律，为涌现语言研究提供了重要指导。

Abstract: In this paper, we design a signalling game-based emergent communication
environment to generate state-of-the-art emergent languages in terms of
similarity to human language. This is done with hyperparameter optimization,
using XferBench as the objective function. XferBench quantifies the statistical
similarity of emergent language to human language by measuring its suitability
for deep transfer learning to human language. Additionally, we demonstrate the
predictive power of entropy on the transfer learning performance of emergent
language as well as corroborate previous results on the entropy-minimization
properties of emergent communication systems. Finally, we report
generalizations regarding what hyperparameters produce more realistic emergent
languages, that is, ones which transfer better to human language.

### [179] [SEER: The Span-based Emotion Evidence Retrieval Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03490)
*Aneesha Sampath,Oya Aran,Emily Mower Provost*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SEER基准测试用于评估大语言模型识别文本中表达情感的具体片段的能力，包含单句和跨句情感证据检测任务，发现模型在长文本中表现下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统情感识别任务只给整个句子分配单一标签，而实际应用中需要知道情感是如何表达的，因此需要开发能够精确定位情感表达片段的方法。

Method: 创建SEER基准测试，包含1200个真实世界句子的情感和情感证据标注，评估14个开源大语言模型在单句和跨句情感证据检测任务上的表现。

Result: 部分模型在单句输入上接近人类平均表现，但在长段落中准确性下降。错误分析显示主要失败模式包括过度依赖情感关键词和在中性文本中产生误报。

Conclusion: 情感证据检测是一个具有挑战性的任务，特别是在长文本中，需要开发更精细的方法来准确识别情感表达片段。

Abstract: We introduce the SEER (Span-based Emotion Evidence Retrieval) Benchmark to
test Large Language Models' (LLMs) ability to identify the specific spans of
text that express emotion. Unlike traditional emotion recognition tasks that
assign a single label to an entire sentence, SEER targets the underexplored
task of emotion evidence detection: pinpointing which exact phrases convey
emotion. This span-level approach is crucial for applications like empathetic
dialogue and clinical support, which need to know how emotion is expressed, not
just what the emotion is. SEER includes two tasks: identifying emotion evidence
within a single sentence, and identifying evidence across a short passage of
five consecutive sentences. It contains new annotations for both emotion and
emotion evidence on 1200 real-world sentences. We evaluate 14 open-source LLMs
and find that, while some models approach average human performance on
single-sentence inputs, their accuracy degrades in longer passages. Our error
analysis reveals key failure modes, including overreliance on emotion keywords
and false positives in neutral text.

### [180] [ALHD: A Large-Scale and Multigenre Benchmark Dataset for Arabic LLM-Generated Text Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03502)
*Ali Khairallah,Arkaitz Zubiaga*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ALHD是首个大规模阿拉伯语数据集，专门用于区分人类和LLM生成的文本，涵盖新闻、社交媒体和评论三种文体，包含超过40万个平衡样本，支持阿拉伯语LLM文本检测的可泛化性研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决阿拉伯语中缺乏专门用于区分人类和LLM生成文本的大规模数据集的问题，为研究阿拉伯语LLM检测、缓解错误信息、学术不端和网络威胁风险奠定基础。

Method: 构建包含新闻、社交媒体和评论三种文体的阿拉伯语数据集，涵盖现代标准阿拉伯语和方言，包含40多万个平衡样本，由三个领先LLM生成，来自多个人类来源。进行严格的预处理、丰富标注和标准化平衡分割。

Result: 基准实验显示，微调的BERT模型在性能上具有竞争力，优于基于LLM的模型。但在跨文体泛化方面存在挑战，特别是在新闻文章中，LLM生成的文本在风格上更接近人类文本。

Conclusion: ALHD为阿拉伯语LLM检测相关研究奠定了基础，揭示了跨文体泛化的挑战，特别是在新闻领域，为未来研究指明了方向。

Abstract: We introduce ALHD, the first large-scale comprehensive Arabic dataset
explicitly designed to distinguish between human- and LLM-generated texts. ALHD
spans three genres (news, social media, reviews), covering both MSA and
dialectal Arabic, and contains over 400K balanced samples generated by three
leading LLMs and originated from multiple human sources, which enables studying
generalizability in Arabic LLM-genearted text detection. We provide rigorous
preprocessing, rich annotations, and standardized balanced splits to support
reproducibility. In addition, we present, analyze and discuss benchmark
experiments using our new dataset, in turn identifying gaps and proposing
future research directions. Benchmarking across traditional classifiers,
BERT-based models, and LLMs (zero-shot and few-shot) demonstrates that
fine-tuned BERT models achieve competitive performance, outperforming LLM-based
models. Results are however not always consistent, as we observe challenges
when generalizing across genres; indeed, models struggle to generalize when
they need to deal with unseen patterns in cross-genre settings, and these
challenges are particularly prominent when dealing with news articles, where
LLM-generated texts resemble human texts in style, which opens up avenues for
future research. ALHD establishes a foundation for research related to Arabic
LLM-detection and mitigating risks of misinformation, academic dishonesty, and
cyber threats.

### [181] [TS-Reasoner: Aligning Time Series Foundation Models with LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03519)
*Fangxu Yu,Hongyu Zhao,Tianyi Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TS-Reasoner通过将时间序列基础模型(TSFMs)的潜在表示与大型语言模型(LLMs)的文本输入对齐，解决了时间序列推理任务中数值理解和语义推理的整合挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列基础模型能捕捉动态模式但缺乏推理能力，而大型语言模型具有推理能力但不擅长数值理解。需要有效整合这两种模型的能力。

Method: 提出两阶段训练方法：首先使用合成的时序-文本对进行对齐预训练，然后进行指令微调。冻结预训练的TSFM，仅训练对齐模块。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，TS-Reasoner超越了主流LLM、VLM和时间序列LLM，且具有显著的数据效率（使用不到一半的训练数据）。

Conclusion: TS-Reasoner成功整合了TSFMs的数值理解能力和LLMs的推理能力，为时间序列推理任务提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Time series reasoning is crucial to decision-making in diverse domains,
including finance, energy usage, traffic, weather, and scientific discovery.
While existing time series foundation models (TSFMs) can capture low-level
dynamic patterns and provide accurate forecasting, further analysis usually
requires additional background knowledge and sophisticated reasoning, which are
lacking in most TSFMs but can be achieved through large language models (LLMs).
On the other hand, without expensive post-training, LLMs often struggle with
the numerical understanding of time series data. Although it is intuitive to
integrate the two types of models, developing effective training recipes that
align the two modalities for reasoning tasks is still an open challenge. To
this end, we propose TS-Reasoner that aligns the latent representations of
TSFMs with the textual inputs of LLMs for downstream understanding/reasoning
tasks. Specifically, we propose a simple yet effective method to curate
diverse, synthetic pairs of time series and textual captions for alignment
training. We then develop a two-stage training recipe that applies instruction
finetuning after the alignment pretraining. Unlike existing works that train an
LLM to take time series as inputs, we leverage a pretrained TSFM and freeze it
during training. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks demonstrate that
TS-Reasoner not only outperforms a wide range of prevailing LLMs, Vision
Language Models (VLMs), and Time Series LLMs, but also achieves this with
remarkable data efficiency, e.g., using less than half the training data.

### [182] [Identifying Financial Risk Information Using RAG with a Contrastive Insight](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03521)
*Ali Elahi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 在专业领域推理中，传统RAG方法存在局限性，无法检索可比案例或相关问题。本文提出在RAG之上添加同行感知比较推理层，通过对比方法提升文本生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG在专业领域推理中只能提取事实信息，输出结果过于通用，缺乏针对特定情境的深入洞察。特别是在金融领域，这导致风险评估过于泛化，无法提供具体公司的差异化分析。

Method: 在RAG基础上构建同行感知比较推理层，采用对比方法，通过检索和比较类似案例来增强推理能力。

Result: 对比方法在文本生成指标（如ROUGE和BERTScore）上优于基线RAG，与人工生成的股权研究和风险评估结果更接近。

Conclusion: 在RAG之上添加比较推理层能有效提升专业领域推理的质量和针对性，使输出结果更具情境特异性。

Abstract: In specialized domains, humans often compare new problems against similar
examples, highlight nuances, and draw conclusions instead of analyzing
information in isolation. When applying reasoning in specialized contexts with
LLMs on top of a RAG, the pipeline can capture contextually relevant
information, but it is not designed to retrieve comparable cases or related
problems.
  While RAG is effective at extracting factual information, its outputs in
specialized reasoning tasks often remain generic, reflecting broad facts rather
than context-specific insights. In finance, it results in generic risks that
are true for the majority of companies. To address this limitation, we propose
a peer-aware comparative inference layer on top of RAG.
  Our contrastive approach outperforms baseline RAG in text generation metrics
such as ROUGE and BERTScore in comparison with human-generated equity research
and risk.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Consensus Graphs (ConGrs)数据结构，通过轻量级序列对齐算法和LM辅助构建，从多个LM响应中提取共享信息和语义变化，生成更精确的最终响应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法无法有效整合语言模型多次采样产生的丰富认知信号，需要一种能捕捉不同长文本响应间共享信息和语义变化的结构。

Method: 使用生物信息学中的轻量级词汇序列对齐算法，辅以辅助LM判断，构建基于有向无环图的ConGrs数据结构，并设计任务相关的解码方法生成最终响应。

Result: 在传记生成任务中事实精确度提升31%，减少80%以上对LM判断的依赖；在拒绝任务中弃权率提升56%；在数学推理任务中准确率提升6个百分点。

Conclusion: ConGrs提供了一种灵活的方法来捕捉LM响应变化，利用响应变化提供的认知信号合成更有效的响应。

Abstract: Language models can be sampled multiple times to access the distribution
underlying their responses, but existing methods cannot efficiently synthesize
rich epistemic signals across different long-form responses. We introduce
Consensus Graphs (ConGrs), a flexible DAG-based data structure that represents
shared information, as well as semantic variation in a set of sampled LM
responses to the same prompt. We construct ConGrs using a light-weight lexical
sequence alignment algorithm from bioinformatics, supplemented by the targeted
usage of a secondary LM judge. Further, we design task-dependent decoding
methods to synthesize a single, final response from our ConGr data structure.
Our experiments show that synthesizing responses from ConGrs improves factual
precision on two biography generation tasks by up to 31% over an average
response and reduces reliance on LM judges by more than 80% compared to other
methods. We also use ConGrs for three refusal-based tasks requiring abstention
on unanswerable queries and find that abstention rate is increased by up to
56%. We apply our approach to the MATH and AIME reasoning tasks and find an
improvement over self-verification and majority vote baselines by up to 6
points of accuracy. We show that ConGrs provide a flexible method for capturing
variation in LM responses and using the epistemic signals provided by response
variation to synthesize more effective responses.

*Ahmed Alajrami,Xingwei Tan,Nikolaos Aletras*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究表明，在指令调优数据中引入扰动（如删除停用词或打乱词序）可以增强大语言模型对噪声指令的鲁棒性，有时甚至能提升下游任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究发现大语言模型对指令表述的微小变化很敏感，本文旨在探索通过指令调优数据扰动来增强模型对噪声指令的抵抗能力。

Method: 在指令调优过程中引入扰动（删除停用词、打乱词序等），并在MMLU、BBH、GSM8K等基准测试上评估模型在原始和扰动版本上的表现。

Result: 令人惊讶的是，在某些情况下，对扰动指令进行指令调优反而能提升下游任务性能。

Conclusion: 在指令调优中包含扰动指令很重要，这能让大语言模型对噪声用户输入更具韧性。

Abstract: Instruction-tuning plays a vital role in enhancing the task-solving abilities
of large language models (LLMs), improving their usability in generating
helpful responses on various tasks. However, previous work has demonstrated
that they are sensitive to minor variations in instruction phrasing. In this
paper, we explore whether introducing perturbations in instruction-tuning data
can enhance LLMs' resistance against noisy instructions. We focus on how
instruction-tuning with perturbations, such as removing stop words or shuffling
words, affects LLMs' performance on the original and perturbed versions of
widely-used benchmarks (MMLU, BBH, GSM8K). We further assess learning dynamics
and potential shifts in model behavior. Surprisingly, our results suggest that
instruction-tuning on perturbed instructions can, in some cases, improve
downstream performance. These findings highlight the importance of including
perturbed instructions in instruction-tuning, which can make LLMs more
resilient to noisy user inputs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TriMediQ是一个基于三元组结构的框架，通过将患者对话转换为知识图谱来增强LLM在临床多轮对话中的推理能力，在iMedQA数据集上相比基线方法准确率提升10.4%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在静态单轮医疗问答中表现良好，但在实际临床咨询的迭代信息收集过程中可靠性显著下降，因为临床事实在对话日志中缺乏清晰关联。

Method: 引入冻结的三元组生成器提取临床相关三元组，使用提示确保事实一致性；可训练的投影模块（图编码器和投影器）从知识图谱捕获关系信息；分两步操作：投影模块微调（LLM权重冻结）和使用微调模块指导推理时的多跳推理。

Result: 在两个交互式QA基准测试中，TriMediQ在iMedQA数据集上相比五个基线方法准确率提升高达10.4%。

Conclusion: 将患者响应转换为结构化三元组图谱能够在多轮设置中实现更准确的临床推理，为基于LLM的医疗助手部署提供了解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) perform strongly in static and single-turn
medical Question Answer (QA) benchmarks, yet such settings diverge from the
iterative information gathering process required in practical clinical
consultations. The MEDIQ framework addresses this mismatch by recasting the
diagnosis as an interactive dialogue between a patient and an expert system,
but the reliability of LLMs drops dramatically when forced to reason with
dialogue logs, where clinical facts appear in sentences without clear links. To
bridge this gap, we introduce TriMediQ, a triplet-structured approach that
summarises patient responses into triplets and integrates them into a Knowledge
Graph (KG), enabling multi-hop reasoning. We introduce a frozen triplet
generator that extracts clinically relevant triplets, using prompts designed to
ensure factual consistency. In parallel, a trainable projection module,
comprising a graph encoder and a projector, captures relational information
from the KG to enhance expert reasoning. TriMediQ operates in two steps: (i)
the projection module fine-tuning with all LLM weights frozen; and (ii) using
the fine-tuned module to guide multi-hop reasoning during inference. We
evaluate TriMediQ on two interactive QA benchmarks, showing that it achieves up
to 10.4\% improvement in accuracy over five baselines on the iMedQA dataset.
These results demonstrate that converting patient responses into structured
triplet-based graphs enables more accurate clinical reasoning in multi-turn
settings, providing a solution for the deployment of LLM-based medical
assistants.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文指出在计算社会科学中使用大语言模型进行文本分类时，概念化步骤常被忽视，这会导致概念化诱导的偏差，且无法通过提高LLM准确性或后处理偏差校正方法完全纠正。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前计算社会科学中广泛使用生成式大语言模型进行文本分类，但分析前概念化步骤和分析后使用LLM预测进行统计推断的步骤常被忽视，这可能导致概念化错误并影响下游估计的准确性。

Method: 通过模拟实验研究概念化诱导的偏差问题，评估提高LLM准确性和后处理偏差校正方法对纠正这种偏差的效果。

Result: 研究发现概念化诱导的偏差无法仅通过提高LLM准确性或后处理偏差校正方法完全纠正，这种偏差会影响下游估计的无偏性和方差。

Conclusion: 在LLM时代，概念化仍然是计算社会科学中的首要关注点，论文提供了实现低成本、无偏、低方差下游估计的具体建议。

Abstract: Generative large language models (LLMs) are now used extensively for text
classification in computational social science (CSS). In this work, focus on
the steps before and after LLM prompting -- conceptualization of concepts to be
classified and using LLM predictions in downstream statistical inference --
which we argue have been overlooked in much of LLM-era CSS. We claim LLMs can
tempt analysts to skip the conceptualization step, creating conceptualization
errors that bias downstream estimates. Using simulations, we show that this
conceptualization-induced bias cannot be corrected for solely by increasing LLM
accuracy or post-hoc bias correction methods. We conclude by reminding CSS
analysts that conceptualization is still a first-order concern in the LLM-era
and provide concrete advice on how to pursue low-cost, unbiased, low-variance
downstream estimates.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CCD-Bench是一个评估LLM在跨文化价值冲突中决策能力的基准，包含2182个开放式困境，覆盖7个领域，发现模型偏好北欧和日耳曼欧洲价值观，而忽视东欧和中东价值观。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注文化知识、价值预测或单轴偏见诊断，缺乏评估LLM在多种文化价值直接冲突时的裁决能力。

Method: 构建包含2182个困境的CCD-Bench基准，使用分层拉丁方设计呈现困境，评估17个非推理LLM的决策模式。

Result: 模型明显偏好北欧欧洲(20.2%)和日耳曼欧洲(12.4%)价值观，东欧和中东北非价值观代表性不足(5.6-5.8%)；87.9%的推理引用多个GLOBE维度但流于表面。

Conclusion: 当前对齐流程促进了共识导向的世界观，但无法处理需要权力协商、权利推理或性别意识分析的场景，需要开发能实质性参与多元世界观的策略。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) are increasingly implicated in
interpersonal and societal decision-making, their ability to navigate explicit
conflicts between legitimately different cultural value systems remains largely
unexamined. Existing benchmarks predominantly target cultural knowledge
(CulturalBench), value prediction (WorldValuesBench), or single-axis bias
diagnostics (CDEval); none evaluate how LLMs adjudicate when multiple
culturally grounded values directly clash. We address this gap with CCD-Bench,
a benchmark that assesses LLM decision-making under cross-cultural value
conflict. CCD-Bench comprises 2,182 open-ended dilemmas spanning seven domains,
each paired with ten anonymized response options corresponding to the ten GLOBE
cultural clusters. These dilemmas are presented using a stratified Latin square
to mitigate ordering effects. We evaluate 17 non-reasoning LLMs. Models
disproportionately prefer Nordic Europe (mean 20.2 percent) and Germanic Europe
(12.4 percent), while options for Eastern Europe and the Middle East and North
Africa are underrepresented (5.6 to 5.8 percent). Although 87.9 percent of
rationales reference multiple GLOBE dimensions, this pluralism is superficial:
models recombine Future Orientation and Performance Orientation, and rarely
ground choices in Assertiveness or Gender Egalitarianism (both under 3
percent). Ordering effects are negligible (Cramer's V less than 0.10), and
symmetrized KL divergence shows clustering by developer lineage rather than
geography. These patterns suggest that current alignment pipelines promote a
consensus-oriented worldview that underserves scenarios demanding power
negotiation, rights-based reasoning, or gender-aware analysis. CCD-Bench shifts
evaluation beyond isolated bias detection toward pluralistic decision making
and highlights the need for alignment strategies that substantively engage
diverse worldviews.

*Adam Filipek*

TL;DR: RxT是一种新型Transformer架构，通过事件驱动范式解决传统Transformer在对话AI中的状态缺失和二次计算复杂度问题，实现实时、有状态的长对话。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Transformer在对话应用中存在状态缺失和二次计算复杂度问题，导致长对话成本高昂、延迟严重，需要新的架构来支持实时、经济的长对话。

Method: RxT采用事件驱动设计，将每个对话轮次作为离散事件处理，使用固定大小的短期记忆系统，通过生成器-解码器产生响应，记忆编码器和专用记忆注意力网络异步更新记忆状态。

Result: RxT将对话总成本从二次复杂度降低到线性复杂度，在合成数据上的概念验证实验显示优于基线无状态模型的性能和恒定时间推理延迟。

Conclusion: RxT架构通过解耦响应生成和记忆更新，实现了低延迟、有状态且经济可行的长对话，为实时对话AI提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: The Transformer architecture has become the de facto standard for Large
Language Models (LLMs), demonstrating remarkable capabilities in language
understanding and generation. However, its application in conversational AI is
fundamentally constrained by its stateless nature and the quadratic
computational complexity ($O(L^2)$) with respect to sequence length $L$.
Current models emulate memory by reprocessing an ever-expanding conversation
history with each turn, leading to prohibitive costs and latency in long
dialogues. This paper introduces the Reactive Transformer (RxT), a novel
architecture designed to overcome these limitations by shifting from a
data-driven to an event-driven paradigm. RxT processes each conversational turn
as a discrete event in real-time, maintaining context in an integrated,
fixed-size Short-Term Memory (STM) system. The architecture features a distinct
operational cycle where a generator-decoder produces a response based on the
current query and the previous memory state, after which a memory-encoder and a
dedicated Memory Attention network asynchronously update the STM with a
representation of the complete interaction. This design fundamentally alters
the scaling dynamics, reducing the total user-facing cost of a conversation
from quadratic ($O(N^2 \cdot T)$) to linear ($O(N \cdot T)$) with respect to
the number of interactions $N$. By decoupling response generation from memory
updates, RxT achieves low latency, enabling truly real-time, stateful, and
economically viable long-form conversations. We validated our architecture with
a series of proof-of-concept experiments on synthetic data, demonstrating
superior performance and constant-time inference latency compared to a baseline
stateless model of comparable size.

Motivation: 解决法语生物医学领域在低资源场景下的命名实体识别和事件提取问题，探索大语言模型在少样本学习中的潜力。

Method: 提出三种方法：(1) GPT-4.1的上下文学习，结合自动选择示例和标注指南摘要；(2) GLiNER系统在合成语料上微调后由LLM进行后处理验证；(3) LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct在相同合成语料上微调。事件提取采用相同的GPT-4.1上下文学习策略。

Conclusion: 精心设计的提示策略在极低资源场景中对最大化性能至关重要，GPT-4.1在少样本学习中展现出优势。

Abstract: This work presents our participation in the EvalLLM 2025 challenge on
biomedical Named Entity Recognition (NER) and health event extraction in French
(few-shot setting). For NER, we propose three approaches combining large
language models (LLMs), annotation guidelines, synthetic data, and
post-processing: (1) in-context learning (ICL) with GPT-4.1, incorporating
automatic selection of 10 examples and a summary of the annotation guidelines
into the prompt, (2) the universal NER system GLiNER, fine-tuned on a synthetic
corpus and then verified by an LLM in post-processing, and (3) the open LLM
LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct, fine-tuned on the same synthetic corpus. Event
extraction uses the same ICL strategy with GPT-4.1, reusing the guideline

### [190] [Decoupling Task-Solving and Output Formatting in LLM Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03595)
*Haikang Deng,Po-Nien Kung,Nanyun Peng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Deco-G是一个解码框架，通过将格式遵循与任务解决解耦来提高LLMs的性能。它使用单独的概率模型处理格式合规性，让LLM专注于任务指令，在多个任务上实现1.0%-6.0%的相对性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着提示变得越来越复杂，LLMs难以同时遵循所有指令，特别是当推理指令与严格的格式要求交织在一起时，这种纠缠会为模型创造竞争目标。

Method: Deco-G框架使用单独的可处理概率模型(TPM)处理格式合规性，LLM仅接收任务指令。在每个解码步骤中，将LLM的下一个令牌概率与TPM计算的格式合规似然相结合。引入了指令感知蒸馏、灵活的trie构建算法和HMM状态剪枝等创新。

Result: 在数学推理、LLM-as-a-judge和事件参数提取等具有多样化格式要求的任务上，Deco-G相比常规提示方法实现了1.0%到6.0%的相对性能提升，并保证格式合规性。

Conclusion: 通过明确分离格式遵循和任务解决，Deco-G框架能够显著提高LLMs在复杂指令下的性能，同时确保格式合规性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly adept at following instructions
containing task descriptions to solve complex problems, such as mathematical
reasoning and automatic evaluation (LLM-as-a-Judge). However, as prompts grow
more complex, models often struggle to adhere to all instructions. This
difficulty is especially common when instructive prompts intertwine reasoning
directives -- specifying what the model should solve -- with rigid formatting
requirements that dictate how the solution must be presented. The entanglement
creates competing goals for the model, suggesting that more explicit separation
of these two aspects could lead to improved performance. To this front, we
introduce Deco-G, a decoding framework that explicitly decouples format
adherence from task solving. Deco-G handles format compliance with a separate
tractable probabilistic model (TPM), while prompts LLMs with only task
instructions. At each decoding step, Deco-G combines next token probabilities
from the LLM with the TPM calculated format compliance likelihood to form the
output probability. To make this approach both practical and scalable for
modern instruction-tuned LLMs, we introduce three key innovations:
instruction-aware distillation, a flexible trie-building algorithm, and HMM
state pruning for computational efficiency. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
Deco-G across a wide range of tasks with diverse format requirements, including
mathematical reasoning, LLM-as-a-judge, and event argument extraction. Overall,
our approach yields 1.0% to 6.0% relative gain over regular prompting practice
with guaranteed format compliance.

*Raquib Bin Yousuf,Aadyant Khatri,Shengzhe Xu,Mandar Sharma,Naren Ramakrishnan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 现有评估基准对LLM有效上下文长度和遗忘倾向的评估过于简单，本文提出基于关系推理任务的更准确评估方法，发现LLM在复杂推理任务中会出现更早的记忆漂移和上下文遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估基准主要依赖简单的检索或续写任务，不能准确反映LLM在信息密集场景下的性能，需要更复杂的推理任务来评估模型从长文本中提取结构化知识的能力。

Method: 使用需要从噪声自然语言内容中诱导图结构的关系推理任务进行评估，要求模型从分布式文本线索中推断连接关系，这些线索被长上下文分隔并夹杂无关信息。

Result: 发现LLM在这种关系推理任务中表现出比现有基准更早的记忆漂移和上下文遗忘，即使是专门的推理模型如OpenAI o1也容易受到早期记忆漂移的影响。

Conclusion: LLM从非结构化输入中抽象结构化知识的能力存在显著限制，需要架构改进来提升长距离推理能力，并为复杂推理任务中LLM的最优使用提供了建议。

Abstract: Recently proposed evaluation benchmarks aim to characterize the effective
context length and the forgetting tendencies of large language models (LLMs).
However, these benchmarks often rely on simplistic 'needle in a haystack'
retrieval or continuation tasks that may not accurately reflect the performance
of these models in information-dense scenarios. Thus, rather than simple next
token prediction, we argue for evaluating these models on more complex
reasoning tasks that requires them to induce structured relational knowledge
from the text - such as graphs from potentially noisy natural language content.
While the input text can be viewed as generated in terms of a graph, its
structure is not made explicit and connections must be induced from distributed
textual cues, separated by long contexts and interspersed with irrelevant
information. Our findings reveal that LLMs begin to exhibit memory drift and
contextual forgetting at much shorter effective lengths when tasked with this
form of relational reasoning, compared to what existing benchmarks suggest.
With these findings, we offer recommendations for the optimal use of popular
LLMs for complex reasoning tasks. We further show that even models specialized
for reasoning, such as OpenAI o1, remain vulnerable to early memory drift in
these settings. These results point to significant limitations in the models'
ability to abstract structured knowledge from unstructured input and highlight
the need for architectural adaptations to improve long-range reasoning.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于音节级别的无监督语音识别框架，通过掩码语言建模避免了G2P转换器和GAN方法的不稳定性，在LibriSpeech上实现40%相对字符错误率降低，并能有效泛化到中文。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决无监督语音识别中现有方法依赖G2P转换器、训练不稳定且难以处理音素边界模糊语言的问题，扩展ASR到低资源语言。

Method: 基于掩码语言建模的音节级别无监督语音识别框架，避免了G2P和GAN方法的使用。

Result: 在LibriSpeech上实现40%相对字符错误率降低，并能有效泛化到中文这种对先前方法特别困难的语言。

Conclusion: 该方法在无监督语音识别中取得了显著改进，特别是在处理音素边界模糊的语言方面表现出色。

Abstract: Training speech recognizers with unpaired speech and text -- known as
unsupervised speech recognition (UASR) -- is a crucial step toward extending
ASR to low-resource languages in the long-tail distribution and enabling
multimodal learning from non-parallel data. However, existing approaches based
on phones often rely on costly resources such as grapheme-to-phoneme converters
(G2Ps) and struggle to generalize to languages with ambiguous phoneme
boundaries due to training instability. In this paper, we address both
challenges by introducing a syllable-level UASR framework based on masked
language modeling, which avoids the need for G2P and the instability of
GAN-based methods. Our approach achieves up to a 40\% relative reduction in
character error rate (CER) on LibriSpeech and generalizes effectively to
Mandarin, a language that has remained particularly difficult for prior
methods. Code will be released upon acceptance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: UniDoc-Bench是首个大规模、现实的多模态检索增强生成基准，基于70k真实PDF页面构建，包含1,600个多模态QA对，支持四种范式的公平比较。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态检索增强生成评估存在碎片化问题，要么只关注文本或图像，要么使用简化的多模态设置，无法捕捉文档中心的多模态用例。

Method: 从八个领域的70k真实PDF页面中提取并链接文本、表格和图像证据，生成1,600个多模态QA对，涵盖事实检索、比较、总结和逻辑推理查询，其中20%经过多标注者和专家验证。

Result: 实验表明多模态文本-图像融合RAG系统始终优于单模态和联合多模态嵌入检索，表明仅文本或图像都不足够，当前多模态嵌入仍不充分。

Conclusion: 该基准不仅用于评估，还揭示了视觉上下文何时以及如何补充文本证据，发现了系统性失败模式，并为开发更稳健的多模态RAG流程提供了可操作指导。

Abstract: Multimodal retrieval-augmented generation (MM-RAG) is a key approach for
applying large language models (LLMs) and agents to real-world knowledge bases,
yet current evaluations are fragmented, focusing on either text or images in
isolation or on simplified multimodal setups that fail to capture
document-centric multimodal use cases. In this paper, we introduce
UniDoc-Bench, the first large-scale, realistic benchmark for MM-RAG built from
70k real-world PDF pages across eight domains. Our pipeline extracts and links
evidence from text, tables, and figures, then generates 1,600 multimodal QA
pairs spanning factual retrieval, comparison, summarization, and logical
reasoning queries. To ensure reliability, 20% of QA pairs are validated by
multiple annotators and expert adjudication. UniDoc-Bench supports
apples-to-apples comparison across four paradigms: (1) text-only, (2)
image-only, (3) multimodal text-image fusion, and (4) multimodal joint
retrieval -- under a unified protocol with standardized candidate pools,
prompts, and evaluation metrics. Our experiments show that multimodal
text-image fusion RAG systems consistently outperform both unimodal and jointly
multimodal embedding-based retrieval, indicating that neither text nor images
alone are sufficient and that current multimodal embeddings remain inadequate.
Beyond benchmarking, our analysis reveals when and how visual context
complements textual evidence, uncovers systematic failure modes, and offers
actionable guidance for developing more robust MM-RAG pipelines.

TL;DR: 提出基于QLoRA的微调框架，用于改进罗马乌尔都语-英语混合文本中的冒犯性语言检测，通过翻译处理低资源输入，在多个LLM中Meta LLaMA 3 8B取得最佳F1分数91.45。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 罗马乌尔都语等代码混合语言中的贬义词使用给NLP系统带来挑战，包括未明确的语法、不一致的拼写和标记数据稀缺。

Method: 使用Google Translate将罗马乌尔都语-英语混合数据集翻译成英语，利用QLoRA对多个transformer和大型语言模型进行内存高效微调，包括Meta LLaMA 3 8B、Mistral 7B等。

Result: 在所有测试模型中，Meta LLaMA 3 8B获得最高F1分数91.45，Mistral 7B为89.66，均超过传统transformer基线。

Conclusion: QLoRA在低资源环境下的代码混合冒犯性语言检测中有效，证实了LLM在此任务中的潜力，为基于LLM的多语言冒犯检测系统铺平道路。

Abstract: The use of derogatory terms in languages that employ code mixing, such as
Roman Urdu, presents challenges for Natural Language Processing systems due to
unstated grammar, inconsistent spelling, and a scarcity of labeled data. In
this work, we propose a QLoRA based fine tuning framework to improve offensive
language detection in Roman Urdu-English text. We translated the Roman
Urdu-English code mixed dataset into English using Google Translate to leverage
English LLMs, while acknowledging that this translation reduces direct
engagement with code mixing features. Our focus is on classification
performance using English translated low resource inputs. We fine tuned several
transformers and large language models, including Meta LLaMA 3 8B, Mistral 7B
v0.1, LLaMA 2 7B, ModernBERT, and RoBERTa, with QLoRA for memory efficient
adaptation. Models were trained and evaluated on a manually annotated Roman
Urdu dataset for offensive vs non offensive content. Of all tested models, the
highest F1 score of 91.45 was attained by Meta LLaMA 3 8B, followed by Mistral
7B at 89.66, surpassing traditional transformer baselines. These results
demonstrate the efficacy of QLoRA in fine tuning high performing models for low
resource environments such as code mixed offensive language detection, and
confirm the potential of LLMs for this task. This work advances a scalable
approach to Roman Urdu moderation and paves the way for future multilingual
offensive detection systems based on LLMs.

TL;DR: MedReflect是一个通用框架，通过模拟医生的反思思维模式，让大语言模型在医学问题解决中进行自我反思和自我验证，无需外部检索或大量标注数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖外部知识检索或大量标注数据，存在检索开销大、标注成本高的问题，且性能有限。需要一种更高效的方法来激发LLMs在医学领域的潜在能力。

Method: MedReflect框架生成单次反思链，包括初始假设生成、自我提问、自我回答和决策精炼，实现自我验证和自我反思。

Result: 仅使用2000个随机样本进行轻量微调，就在一系列医学基准测试中取得了显著的绝对准确率提升，同时大幅减少了标注需求。

Conclusion: LLMs可以通过自我反思和自我改进学习解决专业医学问题，减少对外部监督和大量任务特定微调数据的依赖。

Abstract: Medical problem solving demands expert knowledge and intricate reasoning.
Recent studies of large language models (LLMs) attempt to ease this complexity
by introducing external knowledge verification through retrieval-augmented
generation or by training on reasoning datasets. However, these approaches
suffer from drawbacks such as retrieval overhead and high annotation costs, and
they heavily rely on substituted external assistants to reach limited
performance in medical field. In this paper, we introduce MedReflect, a
generalizable framework designed to inspire LLMs with a physician-like
reflective thinking mode. MedReflect generates a single-pass reflection chain
that includes initial hypothesis generation, self-questioning, self-answering
and decision refinement. This self-verified and self-reflective nature releases
large language model's latent capability in medical problem-solving without
external retrieval or heavy annotation. We demonstrate that MedReflect enables
cost-efficient medical dataset construction: with merely 2,000 randomly sampled
training examples and a light fine-tuning, this approach achieves notable
absolute accuracy improvements across a series of medical benchmarks while
cutting annotation requirements. Our results provide evidence that LLMs can
learn to solve specialized medical problems via self-reflection and
self-improve, reducing reliance on external supervision and extensive
task-specific fine-tuning data.

TL;DR: TreePrompt是一种新的示例选择方法，通过树状结构框架学习LLM偏好来选择高质量、上下文相关的翻译示例，与AFSP或随机选择结合可提升翻译性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有示例选择方法只关注查询与示例的相似性，而忽略了示例质量的重要性。

Method: 提出TreePrompt方法，在树状结构框架中学习LLM偏好来选择高质量示例，并与K-NN和AFSP方法结合探索相似性与质量的平衡。

Result: 在英语-波斯语和英语-德语翻译任务上的评估表明，TreePrompt与AFSP或随机选择结合能提高翻译性能。

Conclusion: TreePrompt通过考虑示例质量和上下文相关性，有效提升了LLM在机器翻译中的表现。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have consistently demonstrated strong
performance in machine translation, especially when guided by high-quality
prompts. Few-shot prompting is an effective technique to improve translation
quality; however, most existing example selection methods focus solely on
query-to-example similarity and do not account for the quality of the examples.
In this work, we propose TreePrompt, a novel example selection approach that
learns LLM preferences to identify high-quality, contextually relevant examples
within a tree-structured framework. To further explore the balance between
similarity and quality, we combine TreePrompt with K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN)
and Adaptive Few-Shot Prompting (AFSP). Evaluations on two language pairs -
English-Persian (MIZAN) and English-German (WMT19) - show that integrating
TreePrompt with AFSP or Random selection leads to improved translation
performance.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于语音细粒度分析的帕金森病检测方法，通过分析音素、音节和单词级别特征，在意大利语、西班牙语和英语数据集上实现了93.78%的AUROC和92.17%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前帕金森病语音检测系统分析整个话语，可能忽略了特定语音元素的诊断价值。帕金森病影响全球超过1000万人，其中高达89%的患者存在语音障碍。

Method: 开发了细粒度感知的多语言帕金森病检测方法，使用自动化流程从录音中提取时间对齐的音素、音节和单词。采用双向LSTM与多头注意力机制比较不同粒度级别的诊断性能。

Result: 音素级别分析表现最佳，AUROC达到93.78% ± 2.34%，准确率为92.17% ± 2.43%。注意力分析显示最有信息的语音特征与临床协议一致：音素级别的持续元音、音节级别的交替运动音节和单词级别的/pataka/序列。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了跨语言帕金森病检测的增强诊断能力，细粒度语音分析能够有效识别帕金森病的语音特征。

Abstract: Parkinson's Disease (PD) affects over 10 million people worldwide, with
speech impairments in up to 89% of patients. Current speech-based detection
systems analyze entire utterances, potentially overlooking the diagnostic value
of specific phonetic elements. We developed a granularity-aware approach for
multilingual PD detection using an automated pipeline that extracts
time-aligned phonemes, syllables, and words from recordings. Using Italian,
Spanish, and English datasets, we implemented a bidirectional LSTM with
multi-head attention to compare diagnostic performance across the different
granularity levels. Phoneme-level analysis achieved superior performance with
AUROC of 93.78% +- 2.34% and accuracy of 92.17% +- 2.43%. This demonstrates
enhanced diagnostic capability for cross-linguistic PD detection. Importantly,
attention analysis revealed that the most informative speech features align
with those used in established clinical protocols: sustained vowels (/a/, /e/,
/o/, /i/) at phoneme level, diadochokinetic syllables (/ta/, /pa/, /la/, /ka/)
at syllable level, and /pataka/ sequences at word level. Source code will be

Motivation: 大型语言模型的快速发展改变了自然语言处理领域，少样本提示因其实用性和有效性受到广泛关注。本研究旨在了解少样本提示策略如何影响词义消歧任务，特别是由不平衡样本分布引入的偏见。

Method: 使用GLOSSGPT提示方法，在英语、德语、西班牙语、法语和意大利语五种语言上测试其有效性。评估了GPT-4o和LLaMA-3.1-70B模型的行为。

Result: 结果显示，不平衡的少样本示例会导致多语言中的错误词义预测，但这一问题在英语中未出现。多语言词义消歧对少样本设置中的样本分布非常敏感。

Conclusion: 强调需要平衡和具有代表性的提示策略，以确保多语言词义消歧任务的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly reshaped
the landscape of Natural Language Processing (NLP). Among the various prompting
techniques, few-shot prompting has gained considerable attention for its
practicality and effectiveness. This study investigates how few-shot prompting
strategies impact the Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) task, particularly
focusing on the biases introduced by imbalanced sample distributions. We use
the GLOSSGPT prompting method, an advanced approach for English WSD, to test
its effectiveness across five languages: English, German, Spanish, French, and
Italian. Our results show that imbalanced few-shot examples can cause incorrect
sense predictions in multilingual languages, but this issue does not appear in
English. To assess model behavior, we evaluate both the GPT-4o and
LLaMA-3.1-70B models and the results highlight the sensitivity of multilingual
WSD to sample distribution in few-shot settings, emphasizing the need for
balanced and representative prompting strategies.

Result: 在1213条随机抽样圣训的评估中，传述链-文本分离和摘要生成达到9.33/10的接近人类准确度，总体平均得分8.46/10，显著优于人工整理的Noor语料库（3.66/10），成本效益显著。

Conclusion: AI技术能够增强人类专业知识，为宗教文本处理引入新范式，实现大规模、多语言、语义丰富的伊斯兰遗产访问。

Abstract: This paper presents the development of Rezwan, a large-scale AI-assisted
Hadith corpus comprising over 1.2M narrations, extracted and structured through
a fully automated pipeline. Building on digital repositories such as Maktabat
Ahl al-Bayt, the pipeline employs Large Language Models (LLMs) for
segmentation, chain--text separation, validation, and multi-layer enrichment.
Each narration is enhanced with machine translation into twelve languages,
intelligent diacritization, abstractive summarization, thematic tagging, and
cross-text semantic analysis. This multi-step process transforms raw text into
a richly annotated research-ready infrastructure for digital humanities and
Islamic studies. A rigorous evaluation was conducted on 1,213 randomly sampled
narrations, assessed by six domain experts. Results show near-human accuracy in
structured tasks such as chain--text separation (9.33/10) and summarization
(9.33/10), while highlighting ongoing challenges in diacritization and semantic
similarity detection. Comparative analysis against the manually curated Noor
Corpus demonstrates the superiority of Najm in both scale and quality, with a
mean overall score of 8.46/10 versus 3.66/10. Furthermore, cost analysis
confirms the economic feasibility of the AI approach: tasks requiring over
229,000 hours of expert labor were completed within months at a fraction of the
cost. The work introduces a new paradigm in religious text processing by
showing how AI can augment human expertise, enabling large-scale, multilingual,
and semantically enriched access to Islamic heritage.

TL;DR: Step Pruner (SP)是一个RL框架，通过惩罚冗余推理步骤来引导大型推理模型进行更高效的推理，在保持准确性的同时显著减少响应长度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RL方法通过惩罚生成token来促进简洁性，但存在两个问题：更少token不一定对应更少推理步骤；模型可能在训练后期出现丢弃推理步骤的作弊行为。

Method: 提出步骤感知的奖励函数，优先考虑正确性同时惩罚冗余步骤，对错误响应不给予奖励以防止强化错误推理；引入动态停止机制，当任何输出步骤长度超过上限时停止更新以防止作弊行为。

Result: 在四个推理基准测试中，SP实现了最先进的准确性，同时显著减少响应长度。在AIME24上，token使用量减少了69.7%。

Conclusion: SP框架有效解决了大型推理模型的过度思考问题，在保持高准确性的同时大幅提升推理效率。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) demonstrate strong performance on complex tasks
but often suffer from excessive verbosity, known as "overthinking." Existing
solutions via reinforcement learning (RL) typically penalize generated tokens
to promote conciseness. However, these methods encounter two challenges:
responses with fewer tokens do not always correspond to fewer reasoning steps,
and models may develop hacking behavior in later stages of training by
discarding reasoning steps to minimize token usage. In this work, we introduce
\textbf{Step Pruner (SP)}, an RL framework that steers LRMs toward more
efficient reasoning by favoring compact reasoning steps. Our step-aware reward
function prioritizes correctness while imposing penalties for redundant steps,
and withholds rewards for incorrect responses to prevent the reinforcement of
erroneous reasoning. Moreover, we propose a dynamic stopping mechanism: when
the length of any output step exceeds the upper limit, we halt updates to
prevent hacking behavior caused by merging steps. Extensive experiments across
four reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that SP achieves state-of-the-art
accuracy while significantly reducing response length. For instance, on AIME24,
SP reduces token usage by \textbf{69.7\%}.

Result: 模型在检测批评政府内容上表现良好（F1最高0.83），但在中性文章上表现很差（F1最低0.00），且倾向于过度预测亲政府立场，经常误解模糊叙述。

Conclusion: 该数据集和相关诊断分析为推进孟加拉语媒体立场检测研究奠定了基础，并为改善低资源语言中大语言模型性能提供了见解。

Abstract: Detecting media bias is crucial, specifically in the South Asian region.
Despite this, annotated datasets and computational studies for Bangla political
bias research remain scarce. Crucially because, political stance detection in
Bangla news requires understanding of linguistic cues, cultural context, subtle
biases, rhetorical strategies, code-switching, implicit sentiment, and
socio-political background. To address this, we introduce the first benchmark
dataset of 200 politically significant and highly debated Bangla news articles,
labeled for government-leaning, government-critique, and neutral stances,
alongside diagnostic analyses for evaluating large language models (LLMs). Our
comprehensive evaluation of 28 proprietary and open-source LLMs shows strong
performance in detecting government-critique content (F1 up to 0.83) but
substantial difficulty with neutral articles (F1 as low as 0.00). Models also
tend to over-predict government-leaning stances, often misinterpreting
ambiguous narratives. This dataset and its associated diagnostics provide a
foundation for advancing stance detection in Bangla media research and offer
insights for improving LLM performance in low-resource languages.

*Mohammad Amin Abbasi,Hassan Naderi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PsychoLexTherapy是一个用于波斯语心理治疗推理模拟的框架，使用小型语言模型(SLMs)，针对低资源语言开发具有文化基础、治疗连贯性和结构化记忆的多轮对话系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在低资源语言中开发文化基础、治疗连贯的对话系统的挑战，同时确保隐私保护和设备端部署的可行性。

Method: 三阶段开发过程：1) 使用PsychoLexEval评估SLMs的心理知识；2) 设计和实现面向推理的PsychoLexTherapy框架；3) 构建两个评估数据集(PsychoLexQuery和PsychoLexDialogue)进行基准测试。

Result: 在PsychoLexQuery上，PsychoLexTherapy在自动评估和人工评估中均优于所有基线方法。在多轮测试中，长期记忆模块被证明至关重要，完整框架在共情、连贯性、文化适应性和个性化方面获得最高评分。

Conclusion: PsychoLexTherapy为波斯语心理治疗模拟建立了实用、保护隐私且文化对齐的基础，贡献了新颖数据集、可复现的评估流程以及关于结构化记忆用于治疗推理的实证见解。

Abstract: This study presents PsychoLexTherapy, a framework for simulating
psychotherapeutic reasoning in Persian using small language models (SLMs). The
framework tackles the challenge of developing culturally grounded,
therapeutically coherent dialogue systems with structured memory for multi-turn
interactions in underrepresented languages. To ensure privacy and feasibility,
PsychoLexTherapy is optimized for on-device deployment, enabling use without
external servers. Development followed a three-stage process: (i) assessing
SLMs psychological knowledge with PsychoLexEval; (ii) designing and
implementing the reasoning-oriented PsychoLexTherapy framework; and (iii)
constructing two evaluation datasets-PsychoLexQuery (real Persian user
questions) and PsychoLexDialogue (hybrid simulated sessions)-to benchmark
against multiple baselines. Experiments compared simple prompting, multi-agent
debate, and structured therapeutic reasoning paths. Results showed that
deliberate model selection balanced accuracy, efficiency, and privacy. On
PsychoLexQuery, PsychoLexTherapy outperformed all baselines in automatic
LLM-as-a-judge evaluation and was ranked highest by human evaluators in a
single-turn preference study. In multi-turn tests with PsychoLexDialogue, the
long-term memory module proved essential: while naive history concatenation
caused incoherence and information loss, the full framework achieved the
highest ratings in empathy, coherence, cultural fit, and personalization.
Overall, PsychoLexTherapy establishes a practical, privacy-preserving, and
culturally aligned foundation for Persian psychotherapy simulation,
contributing novel datasets, a reproducible evaluation pipeline, and empirical
insights into structured memory for therapeutic reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解患者对医生的认知对于改善信任、沟通和满意度至关重要，需要大规模分析患者评价的方法。

Method: 基于大语言模型的流水线，分析410万条患者评论，通过多模型比较和人类专家基准验证方法。

Result: LLM与人类评估高度一致（相关系数0.72-0.89），发现男性医生在所有特质上评分更高，儿科和精神病学中同理心特质占主导，识别出四种医生原型。

Conclusion: 从患者叙述中自动提取特质可以提供可解释、经过验证的指标，用于大规模理解医患关系，对医疗质量测量、偏见检测和劳动力发展具有重要意义。

Abstract: Understanding how patients perceive their physicians is essential to
improving trust, communication, and satisfaction. We present a large language
model (LLM)-based pipeline that infers Big Five personality traits and five
patient-oriented subjective judgments. The analysis encompasses 4.1 million
patient reviews of 226,999 U.S. physicians from an initial pool of one million.
We validate the method through multi-model comparison and human expert
benchmarking, achieving strong agreement between human and LLM assessments
(correlation coefficients 0.72-0.89) and external validity through correlations
with patient satisfaction (r = 0.41-0.81, all p<0.001). National-scale analysis
reveals systematic patterns: male physicians receive higher ratings across all
traits, with largest disparities in clinical competence perceptions;
empathy-related traits predominate in pediatrics and psychiatry; and all traits
positively predict overall satisfaction. Cluster analysis identifies four
distinct physician archetypes, from "Well-Rounded Excellent" (33.8%, uniformly
high traits) to "Underperforming" (22.6%, consistently low). These findings
demonstrate that automated trait extraction from patient narratives can provide
interpretable, validated metrics for understanding physician-patient
relationships at scale, with implications for quality measurement, bias
detection, and workforce development in healthcare.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究大多局限于单轮提示，无法捕捉欺骗策略在长期交互中的展开过程，需要建立能够评估LLM在真实世界信任敏感场景中欺骗行为的框架。

Method: 构建多智能体系统：执行者完成任务，监督者评估进展并提供反馈，独立欺骗审计员审查完整轨迹以识别欺骗行为。在11个前沿模型上进行广泛实验。

Result: 欺骗行为具有模型依赖性，随事件压力增加而增加，并持续削弱监督者信任。定性分析揭示了隐瞒、含糊其辞和伪造等不同欺骗策略。

Conclusion: 欺骗是长期交互中出现的风险，为评估未来LLM在真实世界信任敏感场景中的表现提供了基础。

Abstract: Deception is a pervasive feature of human communication and an emerging
concern in large language models (LLMs). While recent studies document
instances of LLM deception under pressure, most evaluations remain confined to
single-turn prompts and fail to capture the long-horizon interactions in which
deceptive strategies typically unfold. We introduce the first simulation
framework for probing and evaluating deception in LLMs under extended sequences
of interdependent tasks and dynamic contextual pressures. Our framework
instantiates a multi-agent system: a performer agent tasked with completing
tasks and a supervisor agent that evaluates progress, provides feedback, and
maintains evolving states of trust. An independent deception auditor then
reviews full trajectories to identify when and how deception occurs. We conduct
extensive experiments across 11 frontier models, spanning both closed- and
open-source systems, and find that deception is model-dependent, increases with
event pressure, and consistently erodes supervisor trust. Qualitative analyses
further reveal distinct strategies of concealment, equivocation, and
falsification. Our findings establish deception as an emergent risk in
long-horizon interactions and provide a foundation for evaluating future LLMs
in real-world, trust-sensitive contexts.

Motivation: COVID-19疫情期间社交媒体讨论激增，但相关命名实体识别面临两大挑战：社交媒体文本非正式且标注数据稀缺，以及需要大量领域专业知识。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的实体知识增强方法，适用于非正式和正式文本格式的生物医学命名实体识别。

Result: 在COVID-19推文数据集和PubMed数据集上的实验表明，该方法在完全监督和少样本设置下都能提升NER性能。

Conclusion: 实体知识增强方法有效解决了COVID-19命名实体识别的挑战，为生物医学NER提供了通用解决方案。

Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic causes severe social and economic disruption around the
world, raising various subjects that are discussed over social media.
Identifying pandemic-related named entities as expressed on social media is
fundamental and important to understand the discussions about the pandemic.
However, there is limited work on named entity recognition on this topic due to
the following challenges: 1) COVID-19 texts in social media are informal and
their annotations are rare and insufficient to train a robust recognition
model, and 2) named entity recognition in COVID-19 requires extensive
domain-specific knowledge. To address these issues, we propose a novel entity
knowledge augmentation approach for COVID-19, which can also be applied in
general biomedical named entity recognition in both informal text format and
formal text format. Experiments carried out on the COVID-19 tweets dataset and
PubMed dataset show that our proposed entity knowledge augmentation improves
NER performance in both fully-supervised and few-shot settings. Our source code

TL;DR: AgriGPT-VL Suite是一个统一的农业多模态框架，包含最大的农业视觉语言语料库Agri-3M-VL、农业专业化视觉语言模型AgriGPT-VL和紧凑评估套件AgriBench-VL-4K。该模型在农业评估中优于通用VLMs，同时保持文本能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 农业应用中缺乏领域定制模型、精心策划的视觉语言语料库和严格评估，需要解决这些约束。

Method: 构建Agri-3M-VL语料库，开发AgriGPT-VL模型通过渐进式课程训练（文本基础、多模态浅层/深层对齐和GRPO优化），建立AgriBench-VL-4K评估套件。

Result: AgriGPT-VL在AgriBench-VL-4K上优于领先的通用VLMs，在LLM-as-a-judge评估中获得更高的配对胜率，同时在文本评估中保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 该框架在农业多模态任务中表现出色，同时保持语言能力，消融研究证实了对齐和GRPO优化阶段的一致收益。

Abstract: Despite rapid advances in multimodal large language models, agricultural
applications remain constrained by the scarcity of domain-tailored models,
curated vision-language corpora, and rigorous evaluation. To address these
challenges, we present the AgriGPT-VL Suite, a unified multimodal framework for
agriculture. Our contributions are threefold. First, we introduce Agri-3M-VL,
the largest vision-language corpus for agriculture to our knowledge, curated by
a scalable multi-agent data generator; it comprises 1M image-caption pairs, 2M
image-grounded VQA pairs, 50K expert-level VQA instances, and 15K GRPO
reinforcement learning samples. Second, we develop AgriGPT-VL, an
agriculture-specialized vision-language model trained via a progressive
curriculum of textual grounding, multimodal shallow/deep alignment, and GRPO
refinement. This method achieves strong multimodal reasoning while preserving
text-only capability. Third, we establish AgriBench-VL-4K, a compact yet
challenging evaluation suite with open-ended and image-grounded questions,
paired with multi-metric evaluation and an LLM-as-a-judge framework.
Experiments show that AgriGPT-VL outperforms leading general-purpose VLMs on
AgriBench-VL-4K, achieving higher pairwise win rates in the LLM-as-a-judge
evaluation. Meanwhile, it remains competitive on the text-only AgriBench-13K
with no noticeable degradation of language ability. Ablation studies further
confirm consistent gains from our alignment and GRPO refinement stages. We will
open source all of the resources to support reproducible research and
deployment in low-resource agricultural settings.

TL;DR: 使用模型内部激活信号预测LLM输出正确性和上下文有效性，通过简单分类器实现早期审计和防止污染上下文引入的错误


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型具有巨大实用性，但可信度仍是主要问题：模型经常以高置信度生成错误信息。虽然上下文信息可以指导生成，但识别何时查询需要检索上下文以及评估该上下文的有效性仍然具有挑战性

Method: 利用可解释性方法，通过模型激活信号预测输出正确性。考虑正确、错误和不相关的上下文，引入指标进行区分。在六个不同模型上实验，使用第一个输出token的中间层激活训练简单分类器

Result: 基于中间层激活的简单分类器可以以约75%的准确率预测输出正确性，实现早期审计。基于模型内部指标的度量显著优于提示基线，能更好区分正确和错误上下文，防止污染上下文引入的不准确性

Conclusion: 这些发现提供了一个更好地理解LLM底层决策过程的视角，展示了模型内部信号在评估输出可信度和上下文有效性方面的潜力

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have tremendous utility,
trustworthiness is still a chief concern: models often generate incorrect
information with high confidence. While contextual information can help guide
generation, identifying when a query would benefit from retrieved context and
assessing the effectiveness of that context remains challenging. In this work,
we operationalize interpretability methods to ascertain whether we can predict
the correctness of model outputs from the model's activations alone. We also
explore whether model internals contain signals about the efficacy of external
context. We consider correct, incorrect, and irrelevant context and introduce
metrics to distinguish amongst them. Experiments on six different models reveal
that a simple classifier trained on intermediate layer activations of the first
output token can predict output correctness with about 75% accuracy, enabling
early auditing. Our model-internals-based metric significantly outperforms
prompting baselines at distinguishing between correct and incorrect context,
guarding against inaccuracies introduced by polluted context. These findings
offer a lens to better understand the underlying decision-making processes of
LLMs. Our code is publicly available at

Motivation: 传统音频静音端点检测延迟高且对犹豫或语言特有现象不敏感，需要更可靠低延迟的语音交互端点检测方法。

Method: 使用YODAS语料库的转录字幕和泰语特有语言线索，将EOT制定为基于词边界的二元决策，比较了零样本/少样本提示和轻量级transformer的监督微调。

Result: 报告了清晰的准确率-延迟权衡，微调的小模型能提供近乎即时的EOT决策。

Conclusion: 建立了泰语基准，证明小型微调模型能提供适合设备端智能体的近乎即时EOT决策。

Abstract: Fluid voice-to-voice interaction requires reliable and low-latency detection
of when a user has finished speaking. Traditional audio-silence end-pointers
add hundreds of milliseconds of delay and fail under hesitations or
language-specific phenomena. We present, to our knowledge, the first systematic
study of Thai text-only end-of-turn (EOT) detection for real-time agents. We
compare zero-shot and few-shot prompting of compact LLMs to supervised
fine-tuning of lightweight transformers. Using transcribed subtitles from the
YODAS corpus and Thai-specific linguistic cues (e.g., sentence-final
particles), we formulate EOT as a binary decision over token boundaries. We
report a clear accuracy-latency tradeoff and provide a public-ready
implementation plan. This work establishes a Thai baseline and demonstrates
that small, fine-tuned models can deliver near-instant EOT decisions suitable
for on-device agents.

Motivation: 由于LLMs通常是黑盒模型且调用成本高昂，需要解释其分类决策，特别是在文本分类任务中LLMs表现出色但缺乏可解释性的情况下。

Method: 引入反事实推理方法，通过构建反事实样本来分析LLM分类决策，并提出了决策改变率框架来量化关键词对分类结果的影响程度。

Result: 实验结果表明，使用反事实方法能够有效帮助识别对LLM分类决策最重要的关键词。

Conclusion: 反事实推理可以增强LLM分类决策的可解释性，有助于理解模型做出特定分类的原因。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are becoming useful in many domains due to their
impressive abilities that arise from large training datasets and large model
sizes. More recently, they have been shown to be very effective in textual
classification tasks, motivating the need to explain the LLMs' decisions.
Motivated by practical constrains where LLMs are black-boxed and LLM calls are
expensive, we study how incorporating counterfactuals into LLM reasoning can
affect the LLM's ability to identify the top words that have contributed to its
classification decision. To this end, we introduce a framework called the
decision changing rate that helps us quantify the importance of the top words
in classification. Our experimental results show that using counterfactuals can
be helpful.

Conclusion: 对于急诊科应用，专门对模型进行医学微调可能不是必需的，通用领域的小型语言模型已能提供足够的决策支持能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become increasingly popular in medical
domains to assist physicians with a variety of clinical and operational tasks.
Given the fast-paced and high-stakes environment of emergency departments
(EDs), small language models (SLMs), characterized by a reduction in parameter
count compared to LLMs, offer significant potential due to their inherent
reasoning capability and efficient performance. This enables SLMs to support
physicians by providing timely and accurate information synthesis, thereby
improving clinical decision-making and workflow efficiency. In this paper, we
present a comprehensive benchmark designed to identify SLMs suited for ED
decision support, taking into account both specialized medical expertise and
broad general problem-solving capabilities. In our evaluations, we focus on
SLMs that have been trained on a mixture of general-domain and medical corpora.
A key motivation for emphasizing SLMs is the practical hardware limitations,
operational cost constraints, and privacy concerns in the typical real-world
deployments. Our benchmark datasets include MedMCQA, MedQA-4Options, and
PubMedQA, with the medical abstracts dataset emulating tasks aligned with real
ED physicians' daily tasks. Experimental results reveal that general-domain
SLMs surprisingly outperform their medically fine-tuned counterparts across
these diverse benchmarks for ED. This indicates that for ED, specialized
medical fine-tuning of the model may not be required.

Conclusion: 强化学习与可验证奖励是构建可引导多元化模型的有效方法，同时生成的思维链轨迹在忠实性和安全性方面表现良好。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically trained to reflect a relatively
uniform set of values, which limits their applicability to tasks that require
understanding of nuanced human perspectives. Recent research has underscored
the importance of enabling LLMs to support steerable pluralism -- the capacity
to adopt a specific perspective and align generated outputs with it. In this
work, we investigate whether Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning techniques can be
applied to building steerable pluralistic models. We explore several methods,
including CoT prompting, fine-tuning on human-authored CoT, fine-tuning on
synthetic explanations, and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards
(RLVR). We evaluate these approaches using the Value Kaleidoscope and OpinionQA
datasets. Among the methods studied, RLVR consistently outperforms others and
demonstrates strong training sample efficiency. We further analyze the
generated CoT traces with respect to faithfulness and safety.

Method: 进行广泛的消融实验，分析随机掩码输入标记、MLP dropout和权重衰减对数据效率的影响。

Result: 随机掩码输入标记起主导作用，MLP dropout和权重衰减也能获得类似增益，表明随机正则化是提升数据效率的关键。

Conclusion: 随机正则化方法（如输入标记掩码、dropout和权重衰减）在多轮训练中能有效提升扩散语言模型的数据效率。

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that diffusion language models achieve remarkable
data efficiency under limited-data constraints, yet the underlying mechanisms
remain unclear. In this work, we perform extensive ablation experiments to
disentangle the sources of this efficiency. Our results show that random
masking of input tokens plays the dominant role. We further show that similar
gains can be obtained through in MLP dropout and weight decay, indicating that
stochastic regularization broadly enhances data efficiency in multi-epoch
training. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PoLi-RL是一个新颖的点对列表强化学习框架，通过两阶段课程学习成功将RL应用于条件语义文本相似度任务，在C-STS基准上达到48.18的Spearman相关系数，创下交叉编码器架构的新SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有C-STS方法主要局限于判别模型，未能充分利用LLM和RL的最新突破。RL特别适合该任务，可以直接优化不可微的Spearman排序指标并指导推理过程。

Method: 提出PoLi-RL框架：1) 两阶段课程学习：先用简单点式奖励建立基础评分能力，然后转向结合点式、对式和列表式目标的混合奖励；2) 并行切片排序奖励机制，在并行切片中计算排序奖励，为每个完成提供精确的学习信号。

Result: 在官方C-STS基准上达到48.18的Spearman相关系数，为交叉编码器架构建立了新的SOTA。

Conclusion: 这是首个成功将RL应用于C-STS的工作，为在复杂、基于排序的条件判断任务上训练LLM引入了强大而精确的范式。

Abstract: Conditional Semantic Textual Similarity (C-STS) measures the semantic
proximity between text segments under a specific condition, thereby overcoming
the ambiguity inherent in traditional STS. However, existing methods are
largely confined to discriminative models, failing to fully integrate recent
breakthroughs in the NLP community concerning Large Language Models (LLMs) and
Reinforcement Learning (RL). RL is a particularly well-suited paradigm for this
task, as it can directly optimize the non-differentiable Spearman ranking
metric and guide the reasoning process required by C-STS. However, we find that
naively applying listwise RL fails to produce meaningful improvements, as the
model is overwhelmed by complex, coarse-grained reward signals. To address this
challenge, we introduce PoLi-RL, a novel Point-to-List Reinforcement Learning
framework. PoLi-RL employs a two-stage curriculum: it first trains the model
with simple pointwise rewards to establish fundamental scoring capabilities,
then transitions to a hybrid reward that combines pointwise, pairwise, and
listwise objectives to refine the model's ability to discern subtle semantic
distinctions. Crucially, we propose an innovative Parallel Slice Ranking Reward
(PSRR) mechanism that computes ranking rewards in parallel slices, where each
slice comprises same-indexed completions from different samples. This provides
a precise, differentiated learning signal for each individual completion,
enabling granular credit assignment and effective optimization. On the official
C-STS benchmark, PoLi-RL achieves a Spearman correlation coefficient of 48.18,
establishing a new SOTA for the cross-encoder architecture. As the first work
to successfully apply RL to C-STS, our study introduces a powerful and precise
paradigm for training LLMs on complex, ranking-based conditional judgment
tasks.

TL;DR: Caco框架通过代码驱动的增强方法，自动化合成高质量、可验证且多样化的指令-CoT推理数据，提升大语言模型的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CoT方法存在生成不可控、质量不足和推理路径多样性有限的问题，而基于代码的方法通常局限于预定义的数学问题，限制了可扩展性和泛化性。

Method: 首先在统一代码格式上微调基于代码的CoT生成器，然后扩展到大量多样化推理轨迹。通过代码执行和基于规则的过滤进行自动验证，确保逻辑正确性和结构多样性，最后将过滤输出反向工程为自然语言指令和语言CoT。

Result: 在创建的Caco-1.3M数据集上的实验表明，Caco训练模型在数学推理基准上实现了强大的竞争性能，优于现有强基线。

Conclusion: Caco建立了一种无需人工干预构建自持续、可信赖推理系统的范式，其代码锚定验证和指令多样性有助于在未见任务上的优越泛化。

Abstract: Reasoning capability is pivotal for Large Language Models (LLMs) to solve
complex tasks, yet achieving reliable and scalable reasoning remains
challenging. While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has become a mainstream
approach, existing methods often suffer from uncontrolled generation,
insufficient quality, and limited diversity in reasoning paths. Recent efforts
leverage code to enhance CoT by grounding reasoning in executable steps, but
such methods are typically constrained to predefined mathematical problems,
hindering scalability and generalizability. In this work, we propose Caco
(Code-Assisted Chain-of-ThOught), a novel framework that automates the
synthesis of high-quality, verifiable, and diverse instruction-CoT reasoning
data through code-driven augmentation. Unlike prior work, Caco first fine-tunes
a code-based CoT generator on existing math and programming solutions in a
unified code format, then scales the data generation to a large amount of
diverse reasoning traces. Crucially, we introduce automated validation via code
execution and rule-based filtering to ensure logical correctness and structural
diversity, followed by reverse-engineering filtered outputs into natural
language instructions and language CoTs to enrich task adaptability. This
closed-loop process enables fully automated, scalable synthesis of reasoning
data with guaranteed executability. Experiments on our created Caco-1.3M
dataset demonstrate that Caco-trained models achieve strong competitive
performance on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, outperforming existing strong
baselines. Further analysis reveals that Caco's code-anchored verification and
instruction diversity contribute to superior generalization across unseen

*Fengying Ye,Shanshan Wang,Lidia S. Chao,Derek F. Wong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究从概念映射、隐喻-字面知识库和句法敏感性三个角度分析大语言模型的隐喻处理能力，发现LLMs在隐喻理解上存在概念不相关解释、依赖训练数据而非上下文线索、对句法异常更敏感等局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在知识整合、上下文推理和创造性生成方面表现出先进能力，但其隐喻理解机制仍未被充分探索。隐喻分析作为受语境和外部因素影响的复杂语言现象，需要深入研究LLMs的处理能力。

Method: 从三个维度分析：(1)概念映射：使用嵌入空间投影评估LLMs如何在目标域中映射概念；(2)隐喻-字面知识库：分析隐喻词及其字面对应词以识别内在隐喻知识；(3)句法敏感性：评估隐喻句法结构如何影响LLMs表现。

Result: 研究发现LLMs产生15%-25%概念不相关的解释，依赖训练数据中的隐喻指示器而非上下文线索，对句法异常比对结构理解更敏感。

Conclusion: 这些发现强调了LLMs在隐喻分析中的局限性，需要开发更强大的计算方法来改进隐喻理解能力。

Abstract: Metaphor analysis is a complex linguistic phenomenon shaped by context and
external factors. While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate advanced
capabilities in knowledge integration, contextual reasoning, and creative
generation, their mechanisms for metaphor comprehension remain insufficiently
explored. This study examines LLMs' metaphor-processing abilities from three
perspectives: (1) Concept Mapping: using embedding space projections to
evaluate how LLMs map concepts in target domains (e.g., misinterpreting "fall
in love" as "drop down from love"); (2) Metaphor-Literal Repository: analyzing
metaphorical words and their literal counterparts to identify inherent
metaphorical knowledge; and (3) Syntactic Sensitivity: assessing how
metaphorical syntactic structures influence LLMs' performance. Our findings
reveal that LLMs generate 15\%-25\% conceptually irrelevant interpretations,
depend on metaphorical indicators in training data rather than contextual cues,
and are more sensitive to syntactic irregularities than to structural
comprehension. These insights underline the limitations of LLMs in metaphor
analysis and call for more robust computational approaches.

TL;DR: 提出SSD方法，一种无损推理加速技术，利用扩散大语言模型自身进行自推测解码，无需辅助模块即可实现并行生成加速


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前并行解码方法生成结果与逐步解码存在偏差，导致性能下降，限制了实际部署

Method: 引入自推测机制，模型生成多位置预测，通过层次验证树在单次前向传播中验证，利用dLLM固有并行预测能力

Result: 在LLaDA和Dream等开源模型上实现最高3.46倍加速，同时保持输出与逐步解码完全相同

Conclusion: SSD方法有效解决了并行解码偏差问题，实现了无损推理加速，为扩散大语言模型的实际应用提供了可行方案

Abstract: Diffusion-based Large Language Models (dLLMs) have emerged as a competitive
alternative to autoregressive models, offering unique advantages through
bidirectional attention and parallel generation paradigms. However, the
generation results of current parallel decoding methods deviate from stepwise
decoding, introducing potential performance degradation, which limits their
practical deployment. To address this problem, we propose \textbf{S}elf
\textbf{S}peculative \textbf{D}ecoding (SSD), a lossless inference acceleration
method that leverages the dLLM itself as both speculative decoding drafter and
verifier without auxiliary modules. SSD introduces a self-drafting mechanism
where the model generates predictions for multiple positions, then verifies
them through hierarchical verification trees in a single forward pass. Unlike
traditional speculative decoding that requires separate draft models, SSD
eliminates model redundancy and memory overhead by exploiting the dLLM's
inherent parallel prediction capability for multiple positions. This
self-speculative approach allows the model to progressively verify and accept
multiple tokens in a single forward pass. Our experiments demonstrate that SSD
achieves up to 3.46$\times$ speedup while keeping the output identical to
stepwise decoding on open source models such as LLaDA and Dream. Code will be
made publicly available on GitHub.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有潜在推理方法在具有挑战性的分布外任务上表现脆弱，而鲁棒推理在这些任务中最为关键。

Method: 使用在线策略梯度方法，基于冻结LLM自身输出分布计算的置信度奖励信号，优化中间潜在思维向量。

Result: 在五个推理基准测试中，LTPO不仅匹配或超越强基线，在AIME基准上尤其表现出色，现有潜在推理方法准确率接近零时LTPO仍能提供显著改进。

Conclusion: LTPO展示了在复杂推理任务上的独特能力，无需外部监督或昂贵的文本生成即可实现鲁棒推理。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shifted from
explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to more efficient latent reasoning,
where intermediate thoughts are represented as vectors rather than text.
However, latent reasoning can be brittle on challenging, out-of-distribution
tasks where robust reasoning is most critical. To overcome these limitations,
we introduce Latent Thought Policy Optimization (LTPO), a parameter-free
framework that enhances LLM reasoning entirely at test time, without requiring
model parameter updates. LTPO treats intermediate latent "thought" vectors as
dynamic parameters that are actively optimized for each problem instance. It
employs an online policy gradient method guided by an intrinsic,
confidence-based reward signal computed directly from the frozen LLM's own
output distributions, eliminating the need for external supervision or
expensive text generation during optimization. Extensive experiments on five
reasoning benchmarks show that LTPO not only matches or surpasses strong
baselines on standard tasks but also demonstrates remarkable robustness where
others fail. Most notably, on highly challenging AIME benchmarks where existing
latent reasoning baselines collapse to near-zero accuracy, LTPO delivers
substantial improvements, showcasing a unique capability for complex reasoning.

TL;DR: CALM框架通过轻量级修正提示来增强大型推理模型的优化建模能力，生成的STORM模型在5个基准测试中达到68.9%的SOTA准确率，性能可与671B参数模型相媲美。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有领域适应方法无法充分利用现代大型推理模型的高级推理能力，直接微调传统非反思数据集效果有限。

Method: 提出CALM框架：专家识别推理缺陷并提供简洁修正提示，模型据此生成改进的推理轨迹，仅修改少于2.6%的生成token，然后通过监督微调和强化学习进行软适应。

Result: 基于CALM开发的4B参数STORM模型在5个优化建模基准测试中平均准确率达到68.9%，创造了新的SOTA，性能与671B参数模型相当。

Conclusion: 基于提示的动态数据合成方法能够保持并增强现代大型推理模型的原生推理模式，为在挑战性优化建模任务上实现专家级性能提供了更有效和可扩展的路径。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in
complex multi-step reasoning, opening new opportunities for automating
optimization modeling. However, existing domain adaptation methods, originally
designed for earlier instruction-tuned models, often fail to exploit the
advanced reasoning patterns of modern LRMs -- In particular, we show that
direct fine-tuning on traditional \textit{non-reflective} datasets leads to
limited gains. To fully leverage LRMs' inherent reasoning abilities, we propose
\textbf{CALM} (\textit{Corrective Adaptation with Lightweight Modification}), a
framework that progressively refines LRMs within their native reasoning modes
for optimization modeling tasks. In CALM, an expert intervener identifies
reasoning flaws and provides concise corrective hints, which the LRM
incorporates to produce improved reasoning trajectories. These interventions
modify fewer than 2.6\% of generated tokens, but generate high-quality data for
soft adaptation through supervised fine-tuning. The adapted model is then
further improved through reinforcement learning. Building on CALM, we develop
\textbf{STORM} (\textit{Smart Thinking Optimization Reasoning Model}), a
4B-parameter LRM that achieves a new state-of-the-art average accuracy of
68.9\% across five popular optimization modeling benchmarks, matching the
performance of a 671B LRM. These results demonstrate that dynamic, hint-based
data synthesis both preserves and amplifies the native reasoning patterns of
modern LRMs, offering a more effective and scalable path towards expert-level
performance on challenging optimization modeling tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了REPO强化学习框架，通过整合偏好奖励模型、说服行为奖励和程序化奖励，优化LLM在旅游平台价格谈判中的表现，显著提升对话质量和约束遵守。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统后训练方法在将LLM部署为商务谈判代理时存在过拟合脚本、忽略微妙说服风格、无法强制执行业务约束等问题，需要更有效的对齐方法。

Method: REPO框架结合三种奖励：偏好训练的奖励模型用于密集人类对齐，奖励法官用于高层说服行为和SOP合规性，程序化奖励函数用于数值、格式和护栏的确定性检查。

Result: 在真实对话评估中，REPO将平均对话评分提升至4.63，比基准高1.20，比DPO高0.83；将至少有一个优秀回复的对话比例提升至66.67%，比GRPO高23.34个百分点；在坏案例中达到93.33%的修复率和75.56%的干净修复率。

Conclusion: REPO框架有效解决了LLM在商务谈判中的对齐问题，超越了SFT、DPO、PPO和GRPO等方法，并涌现出主动共情、局部推理、校准策略等超越黄金标注的能力。

Abstract: We study deploying large language models (LLMs) as business development (BD)
agents for persuasive price negotiation in online travel agencies (OTAs), where
aligning traveler affordability and hotel profitability directly affects
bookings, partner relationships, and access to travel. The agent must follow a
Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) while conducting multi-turn persuasion,
interpreting colloquial inputs, and adhering to guardrails (no over-promising,
no hallucinations). Conventional post-training -- supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
or single-source reward optimization -- overfits scripts, misses nuanced
persuasive style, and fails to enforce verifiable business constraints.
  We propose Reward-Enhanced Policy Optimization (REPO), a reinforcement
learning post-training framework that aligns an LLM with heterogeneous rewards:
a preference-trained reward model (RM) for dense human alignment, a reward
judge (RJ) for high-level persuasive behavior and SOP compliance, and
programmatic reward functions (RF) for deterministic checks on numerics,
formatting, and guardrails. A straightforward enhancement mechanism is proposed
to combine the RM with RJ and RF signals to curb reward hacking and improve
negotiation quality. In production-style evaluations -- approximately 150 turns
from real dialogues and 225 turns from curated bad-case dialogues -- REPO lifts
average dialogue rating to 4.63: +1.20 over base, +0.83 over Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO); +0.33 over Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO),
increases the share of conversations with at least one excellent response to
66.67% (+23.34 percentage points over GRPO), and achieves a 93.33% bad-case fix
rate with 75.56% clean fixes, outperforming SFT, DPO, PPO, and GRPO. We also
observe emergent capabilities -- proactive empathy, localized reasoning,
calibrated tactics -- that surpass gold annotations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文研究了大型语言模型生成文本的同质化问题及其导致的知识崩溃风险，提出了衡量认知多样性的新方法，并通过实证研究发现模型大小对认知多样性有负面影响，而检索增强生成(RAG)则有正面影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型倾向于生成词汇、语义和风格同质化的文本，这带来了知识崩溃的风险——同质化的LLM会随时间推移导致可获取信息范围的缩小。现有关于同质化的研究局限于封闭式选择题设置或模糊的语义特征，且未考察跨时间和文化背景的趋势。

Method: 提出了一种衡量认知多样性的新方法，即测量LLM输出中现实世界主张的变化。测试了27个LLM、涵盖12个国家的155个主题，以及来自真实用户聊天的200个提示变体。

Result: 研究发现：较新的模型倾向于生成更多样化的主张，但几乎所有模型的认知多样性都低于基本的网络搜索；模型大小对认知多样性有负面影响；检索增强生成(RAG)有正面影响，但RAG的改进效果因文化背景而异；与维基百科相比，特定国家的主张更多反映英语而非当地语言，突显了认知表征的差距。

Conclusion: LLM存在知识同质化和认知多样性不足的问题，模型大小会加剧这一问题，而RAG技术可以改善但效果受文化背景影响。需要关注LLM在不同文化背景下的认知表征公平性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) tend to generate lexically, semantically, and
stylistically homogenous texts. This poses a risk of knowledge collapse, where
homogenous LLMs mediate a shrinking in the range of accessible information over
time. Existing works on homogenization are limited by a focus on closed-ended
multiple-choice setups or fuzzy semantic features, and do not look at trends
across time and cultural contexts. To overcome this, we present a new
methodology to measure epistemic diversity, i.e., variation in real-world
claims in LLM outputs, which we use to perform a broad empirical study of LLM
knowledge collapse. We test 27 LLMs, 155 topics covering 12 countries, and 200
prompt variations sourced from real user chats. For the topics in our study, we
show that while newer models tend to generate more diverse claims, nearly all
models are less epistemically diverse than a basic web search. We find that
model size has a negative impact on epistemic diversity, while
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has a positive impact, though the
improvement from RAG varies by the cultural context. Finally, compared to a
traditional knowledge source (Wikipedia), we find that country-specific claims
reflect the English language more than the local one, highlighting a gap in
epistemic representation

Abstract: Recent frontier models employ long chain-of-thought reasoning to explore
solution spaces in context and achieve stonger performance. While many works
study distillation to build smaller yet capable models, most focus on English
and little is known about language-specific reasoning. To bridge this gap, we
first introduct **Language-Mixed CoT**, a reasoning schema that switches
between English and a target language, using English as an anchor to excel in
reasoning while minimizing translation artificats. As a Korean case study, we
curate **Yi-Sang**: 5.79M native-Korean prompts from web Q&A, exams, STEM, and
code; 3.7M long reasoning traces generated from Qwen3-32B; and a targeted 260k
high-yield subset. We train ninve models (4B-35B) across six families (Qwen2.5,
Llama-3.1, Gemma-3, etc). Our best model, **KO-REAson-35B**, achieves
state-of-the-art performance, with the highest overall average score (64.0 \pm
25), ranking first on 5/9 benchmarks and second on the remainder. Samller and
mid-sized models also benefit substantially, with an average improvement of
+18.6 points across teh evaluated nine benchmarks. Ablations show
**Language-Mixed CoT** is more effective than monolingual CoT, also resulting
in cross-lingual and mult-modal performance gains. We release our data-curation
pipeline, evaluation system, datasets, and models to advance research on
language-specific reasoning. Data and model collection:

TL;DR: 提出了LongTail-Swap基准测试，专注于评估语言模型在罕见词学习上的表现，类似于婴儿的少样本学习能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有BabyLM挑战主要关注词分布头部，而婴儿学习语言的特点是能够高效学习罕见词，因此需要专门评估模型在长尾分布上的表现。

Method: 构建了基于BabyLM训练集的测试集，包含可接受与不可接受句子对，专门针对罕见词的语义和句法使用进行隔离测试，采用零样本评估方式。

Result: 评估了16个BabyLM排行榜模型，发现语言模型在罕见词上表现较差，且不同架构模型在长尾分布上的性能差异比在头部更明显。

Conclusion: LT-Swap基准提供了新的视角来评估哪种架构更适合处理罕见词泛化问题，揭示了模型在长尾分布学习能力上的重要差异。

Abstract: Children learn to speak with a low amount of data and can be taught new words
on a few-shot basis, making them particularly data-efficient learners. The
BabyLM challenge aims at exploring language model (LM) training in the low-data
regime but uses metrics that concentrate on the head of the word distribution.
Here, we introduce LongTail-Swap (LT-Swap), a benchmark that focuses on the
tail of the distribution, i.e., measures the ability of LMs to learn new words
with very little exposure, like infants do. LT-Swap is a pretraining
corpus-specific test set of acceptable versus unacceptable sentence pairs that
isolate semantic and syntactic usage of rare words. Models are evaluated in a
zero-shot fashion by computing the average log probabilities over the two
members of each pair. We built two such test sets associated with the 10M words
and 100M words BabyLM training sets, respectively, and evaluated 16 models from
the BabyLM leaderboard. Our results not only highlight the poor performance of
language models on rare words but also reveal that performance differences
across LM architectures are much more pronounced in the long tail than in the
head. This offers new insights into which architectures are better at handling
rare word generalization. We've also made the code publicly avail

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于累积量展开的框架，用于量化大语言模型在下一个token预测过程中如何内化高阶统计结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了理解LLM如何学习高阶统计结构，以及不同内容类型（如数学与语言）的处理机制差异。

Method: 通过将每层logit分布的softmax熵视为围绕其"中心"分布的扰动，推导出封闭形式的累积量观测值来隔离高阶相关性。在GPT-2和Pythia模型上对Pile-10K提示进行实证分析。

Result: (i)结构化提示在层间呈现上升-平台特征，而token打乱的提示保持平坦；(ii)训练过程中所有累积量单调增加后饱和；(iii)数学提示与普通文本显示不同的累积量特征。

Conclusion: 累积量分析成为高维神经网络中特征学习动态的轻量级、数学基础扎实的探测方法。

Abstract: We introduce a cumulant-expansion framework for quantifying how large
language models (LLMs) internalize higher-order statistical structure during
next-token prediction. By treating the softmax entropy of each layer's logit
distribution as a perturbation around its "center" distribution, we derive
closed-form cumulant observables that isolate successively higher-order
correlations. Empirically, we track these cumulants in GPT-2 and Pythia models
on Pile-10K prompts. (i) Structured prompts exhibit a characteristic
rise-and-plateau profile across layers, whereas token-shuffled prompts remain
flat, revealing the dependence of the cumulant profile on meaningful context.
(ii) During training, all cumulants increase monotonically before saturating,
directly visualizing the model's progression from capturing variance to
learning skew, kurtosis, and higher-order statistical structures. (iii)
Mathematical prompts show distinct cumulant signatures compared to general
text, quantifying how models employ fundamentally different processing
mechanisms for mathematical versus linguistic content. Together, these results
establish cumulant analysis as a lightweight, mathematically grounded probe of
feature-learning dynamics in high-dimensional neural networks.

TL;DR: SliceMoE是一种改进的混合专家架构，通过将token的隐藏向量分割成连续切片进行路由，解决了传统token级路由的容量瓶颈、负载均衡问题和有限专业化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MoE层的token级路由将整个语义频谱分配给每个专家，导致容量瓶颈、负载均衡问题和有限的专业化。需要更细粒度的路由机制来改善这些问题。

Method: 将d维嵌入分割成S个切片，为每个切片使用轻量级共享路由器预测top-k专家。专家独立处理分配的切片，输出重新组装以保持每个token的FLOP效率。提出了切片级容量损失、跨切片dropout和高效融合批处理GEMM内核。

Result: 在WikiText-103语言建模、WMT En-De翻译和三个文本分类数据集上的实验显示，SliceMoE比密集基线推理速度快达1.7倍，比参数匹配的token-MoE困惑度降低12-18%，专家平衡性改善，并在句法与语义子空间上具有可解释的专业知识。

Conclusion: SliceMoE通过切片级路由有效解决了传统MoE的局限性，实现了更好的性能、效率和专家专业化。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) layers scale transformers by routing tokens to a
sparse subset of feed-forward experts. Token-level routing, however, assigns an
entire semantic spectrum to each expert, creating capacity bottlenecks,
load-balancing pathologies, and limited specialization. We introduce SliceMoE,
an architecture that routes contiguous slices of a token's hidden vector. A
d-dimensional embedding is partitioned into S slices, and for each slice, a
lightweight shared router predicts the top-k experts. Experts operate on their
assigned slices independently, and outputs are reassembled, maintaining
per-token FLOP efficiency. Because slices from different tokens interleave
within an expert, utilization is naturally smoother. We propose a slice-level
capacity loss, cross-slice dropout, and efficient fused batched GEMM kernels.
Experiments on WikiText-103 language modeling, WMT En-De translation, and three
text-classification datasets show SliceMoE attains up to 1.7x faster inference
than dense baselines, 12 to 18 percent lower perplexity than parameter-matched
token-MoE, and improved expert balance, with interpretable expertise over
syntactic versus semantic subspaces.

Motivation: 波斯语情感分析面临标注数据稀缺、预处理工具有限以及高质量嵌入和特征提取方法缺乏的挑战。

Method: 使用多语言BERT的极性分数作为额外特征，结合决策树分类器，并引入波斯语同义词和实体词典进行文本增强。

Result: 在Pars-ABSA数据集上实现了93.34%的准确率，超过了现有基准。

Conclusion: 混合建模和特征增强对于推进波斯语等低资源语言的情感分析是有效的。

Abstract: Sentiment analysis is a key task in Natural Language Processing (NLP),
enabling the extraction of meaningful insights from user opinions across
various domains. However, performing sentiment analysis in Persian remains
challenging due to the scarcity of labeled datasets, limited preprocessing
tools, and the lack of high-quality embeddings and feature extraction methods.
To address these limitations, we propose a hybrid approach that integrates
machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques for Persian
aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA). In particular, we utilize polarity
scores from multilingual BERT as additional features and incorporate them into
a decision tree classifier, achieving an accuracy of 93.34%-surpassing existing
benchmarks on the Pars-ABSA dataset. Additionally, we introduce a Persian
synonym and entity dictionary, a novel linguistic resource that supports text
augmentation through synonym and named entity replacement. Our results
demonstrate the effectiveness of hybrid modeling and feature augmentation in
advancing sentiment analysis for low-resource languages such as Persian.

Motivation: 现有RAG方法将检索到的段落视为孤立块，忽略了文档组织结构这一关键信息，导致在复杂场景下知识获取和利用能力不足。

Method: 提出Retrieve-DocumentRoute-Read框架，使用基于LLM的路由器动态导航文档结构树，联合评估内容相关性和层次关系，将文档路由制定为可训练任务。

Result: 在五个具有挑战性的数据集上，RDR2实现了最先进性能，特别是在需要多文档合成的复杂场景中表现优异。

Conclusion: 显式的结构感知显著增强了RAG系统获取和利用知识的能力，证明了文档结构信息在检索增强生成中的重要性。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities, their
reliance on parametric knowledge often leads to factual inaccuracies.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates this by leveraging external
documents, yet existing approaches treat retrieved passages as isolated chunks,
ignoring valuable structure that is crucial for document organization.
Motivated by this gap, we propose Retrieve-DocumentRoute-Read (RDR2), a novel
framework that explicitly incorporates structural information throughout the
RAG process. RDR2 employs an LLM-based router to dynamically navigate document
structure trees, jointly evaluating content relevance and hierarchical
relationships to assemble optimal evidence. Our key innovation lies in
formulating document routing as a trainable task, with automatic action
curation and structure-aware passage selection inspired by human reading
strategies. Through comprehensive evaluation on five challenging datasets, RDR2
achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating that explicit structural
awareness significantly enhances RAG systems' ability to acquire and utilize
knowledge, particularly in complex scenarios requiring multi-document
synthesis.

### [231] [Measuring Language Model Hallucinations Through Distributional Correctness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04302)
*Thomas F Burns*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Distributional Correctness Score (DCS)评估指标，通过考虑模型在答案选择上的完整概率分布，区分有害的过度自信和通过弃权表达的不确定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语言模型评估范式只关注单一响应的准确性评分，无法捕捉模型完整的信念状态。模型产生幻觉部分原因是它们被优化为在二元评分方案下成为好的应试者，奖励任何答案而非弃权。

Method: 引入DCS评估指标，理论分析和示例演示，将12个现有评估基准适配到DCS变体，并在6个语言模型上测量性能。

Result: 一半测试基准的得分在所有测试模型上均为负值，表明存在显著的幻觉倾向。DCS提供了更细致和一致的评价范式。

Conclusion: DCS能够激励模型表达真正的不确定性而非猜测，提供了比传统二元评分更丰富和一致的评估方法。

Abstract: Common evaluation paradigms for language models focus on scoring single
responses through accuracy metrics or proper scoring rules, failing to capture
the full richness of a model's belief state. Recent work illustrates that
language models hallucinate in-part because they are optimised to be good
test-takers under binary scoring schemes that reward any answer over
abstention. While this insight naturally leads to penalty-based approaches,
they ignore crucial distinctions in how models distribute uncertainty, for
example between hedging toward incorrect answers versus hedging toward "I don't
know" responses. A novel evaluation metric, the Distributional Correctness
Score (DCS), is introduced to solve this problem, i.e., of not considering a
model's entire probability distribution over answer choices. DCS naturally
distinguishes between harmful overconfidence in wrong answers and uncertainty
expressed through abstention, providing scores in an interpretable default
range. Through theoretical analysis and illustrative examples, DCS is
demonstrated to offer a more nuanced and aligned evaluation paradigm that
incentivises models to express genuine uncertainty rather than guessing.
Adapting 12 existing evaluation benchmarks to DCS's variants and measuring
performance on six language models reveals that for half of the tested
benchmarks scores are negative across all tested models, indicating significant
tendencies towards hallucination.

*Rui Wu,Yihao Quan,Zeru Shi,Zhenting Wang,Yanshu Li,Ruixiang Tang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文识别了大语言模型安全对齐中的"后果盲视"问题，即模型过度依赖表面信号而忽视行动与后果的关联，导致易被越狱或过度拒绝无害输入。作者构建了CB-Bench基准和CS-Chain-4k数据集来缓解这一问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全对齐的大语言模型存在两个主要失败模式：容易被越狱，或者过度拒绝包含敏感表面信号的无害输入。作者认为这两种问题源于共同的根源——模型对行动与后果关联的推理能力薄弱，过度依赖表面形式信号。

Method: 1. 构建CB-Bench基准，涵盖四种风险场景，评估语义风险与结果风险是否匹配的情况；2. 创建CS-Chain-4k后果推理数据集用于安全对齐微调；3. 在CS-Chain-4k上微调的模型进行效果验证。

Result: 主流模型普遍无法区分语义风险和结果风险，表现出系统性的后果盲视。在CS-Chain-4k上微调的模型在对抗语义伪装越狱方面表现更好，减少了对无害输入的过度拒绝，同时在其他基准上保持了实用性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 研究明确了当前安全对齐的局限性，确立了后果感知推理作为核心对齐目标，并提供了更实用和可复现的评估路径。

Abstract: Safety-aligned Large Language Models (LLMs) still show two dominant failure
modes: they are easily jailbroken, or they over-refuse harmless inputs that
contain sensitive surface signals. We trace both to a common cause: current
models reason weakly about links between actions and outcomes and over-rely on
surface-form signals, lexical or stylistic cues that do not encode
consequences. We define this failure mode as Consequence-blindness. To study
consequence-blindness, we build a benchmark named CB-Bench covering four risk
scenarios that vary whether semantic risk aligns with outcome risk, enabling
evaluation under both matched and mismatched conditions which are often ignored
by existing safety benchmarks. Mainstream models consistently fail to separate
these risks and exhibit consequence-blindness, indicating that
consequence-blindness is widespread and systematic. To mitigate
consequence-blindness, we introduce CS-Chain-4k, a consequence-reasoning
dataset for safety alignment. Models fine-tuned on CS-Chain-4k show clear gains
against semantic-camouflage jailbreaks and reduce over-refusal on harmless
inputs, while maintaining utility and generalization on other benchmarks. These
results clarify the limits of current alignment, establish consequence-aware
reasoning as a core alignment goal and provide a more practical and
reproducible evaluation path.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文测试了大语言模型使用CONSORT标准评估临床试验研究报告质量的能力，最佳模型组合达到85%准确率，Chain-of-thought方法提供了有价值的推理信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床试验研究报告质量影响临床决策，需要评估大语言模型使用CONSORT标准评估这类文章报告质量的能力。

Method: 创建CONSORT-QA评估语料库，使用不同的大语言模型（通用领域和生物医学领域）和提示方法（包括Chain-of-thought）评估CONSORT标准。

Result: 最佳模型和提示方法组合达到85%的准确率，Chain-of-thought方法为模型完成任务提供了有价值的推理信息。

Conclusion: 大语言模型能够有效评估临床试验研究报告质量，Chain-of-thought方法增强了模型推理过程的可解释性。

Abstract: Reporting quality is an important topic in clinical trial research articles,
as it can impact clinical decisions. In this article, we test the ability of
large language models to assess the reporting quality of this type of article
using the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT). We create
CONSORT-QA, an evaluation corpus from two studies on abstract reporting quality
with CONSORT-abstract standards. We then evaluate the ability of different
large generative language models (from the general domain or adapted to the
biomedical domain) to correctly assess CONSORT criteria with different known
prompting methods, including Chain-of-thought. Our best combination of model
and prompting method achieves 85% accuracy. Using Chain-of-thought adds
valuable information on the model's reasoning for completing the task.

*Daniel Tan,Anders Woodruff,Niels Warncke,Arun Jose,Maxime Riché,David Demitri Africa,Mia Taylor*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出接种提示方法，通过在微调数据前添加系统提示来有意识地引发不良特征，测试时不使用该提示，从而降低模型表达不良特征的可能性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型微调时常会同时学习到期望和不期望的特征，需要一种方法能够选择性地学习期望特征而不学习不期望特征。

Method: 在微调数据前添加短系统提示指令，有意识地引发不期望的特征，然后在测试时不使用该指令。

Result: 接种后的模型比使用未修改训练数据的模型表达不期望特征的概率显著降低，该方法在多个场景中有效：减少任务特定微调中的新兴错位、防御后门注入、减轻通过潜意识学习的特征传递。

Conclusion: 接种提示是一种简单有效的选择性学习技术，通过使特征不再令人惊讶来减少优化压力，从而降低泛化程度，有助于更好理解语言模型的泛化机制。

Abstract: Language model finetuning often results in learning undesirable traits in
combination with desired ones. To address this, we propose inoculation
prompting: modifying finetuning data by prepending a short system-prompt
instruction that deliberately elicits the undesirable trait. At test time, we
evaluate without the instruction; inoculated models have much lower expression
of the trait than models trained with unmodified training data. Inoculation is
selective: in a toy setting where assistant responses are always in Spanish and
ALL-CAPS, an appropriate inoculation (e.g., ``You always speak in Spanish.'')
teaches the model to capitalize responses while still responding in English. We
find that inoculation is also effective across several additional settings:
reducing emergent misalignment (EM) from task-specific finetuning, defending
against backdoor injections, and mitigating the transmission of traits via
subliminal learning. Follow-up analysis suggests a mechanism: making a trait
less surprising via inoculation reduces optimization pressure to globally
update the model, thereby reducing the degree of generalization. Our analysis
relates to prior work on EM: inoculation explains prior findings that
educational contexts mitigate EM from insecure code. Beyond demonstrating a
simple and effective technique for selective learning, our results contribute
to a better conceptual understanding of how and why language models generalize.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于注意力机制和梯度信息的推理时防御方法，用于检测预训练语言模型中的后门攻击，通过结合token级注意力和梯度信息构建异常分数，显著降低了攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练语言模型虽然在各种NLP任务中取得了显著成功，但它们容易受到后门攻击的威胁，攻击者通过在训练数据中嵌入触发模式来植入恶意行为，这些触发在正常使用时保持休眠状态，但激活时会导致目标错误分类。

Method: 研究后门预训练编码器语言模型的内部行为，关注处理中毒输入时注意力和梯度归因的一致变化；提出推理时防御方法，通过结合token级注意力和梯度信息构建异常分数。

Result: 在文本分类任务的各种后门攻击场景中进行广泛实验，证明该方法相比现有基线显著降低了攻击成功率。

Conclusion: 提供基于可解释性的评分机制分析，揭示了触发定位和所提出防御方法的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Pre-trained language models have achieved remarkable success across a wide
range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, particularly when fine-tuned
on large, domain-relevant datasets. However, they remain vulnerable to backdoor
attacks, where adversaries embed malicious behaviors using trigger patterns in
the training data. These triggers remain dormant during normal usage, but, when
activated, can cause targeted misclassifications. In this work, we investigate
the internal behavior of backdoored pre-trained encoder-based language models,
focusing on the consistent shift in attention and gradient attribution when
processing poisoned inputs; where the trigger token dominates both attention
and gradient signals, overriding the surrounding context. We propose an
inference-time defense that constructs anomaly scores by combining token-level
attention and gradient information. Extensive experiments on text
classification tasks across diverse backdoor attack scenarios demonstrate that
our method significantly reduces attack success rates compared to existing
baselines. Furthermore, we provide an interpretability-driven analysis of the
scoring mechanism, shedding light on trigger localization and the robustness of
the proposed defense.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个评估RAG系统信息一致性的框架，并开发了PS-GRPO强化学习方法训练生成器，使RAG系统在语义等效查询下产生一致输出，显著提升了系统的一致性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG系统在高风险领域部署时，用户期望语义等效查询能产生一致输出，但现有系统由于检索器和生成器的变异性导致显著不一致，损害了系统可信度和可靠性。

Method: 引入分解RAG一致性的评估框架，提出PS-GRPO强化学习方法，利用多轮次生成和组相似度奖励训练生成器，并开发可扩展的近似计算方法以降低计算成本。

Result: 在短形式、多跳和长形式问答基准测试中，Con-RAG相比强基线显著提升了一致性和准确性，即使在没有显式真实监督的情况下也表现良好。

Conclusion: 该工作为评估和构建可靠RAG系统提供了实用解决方案，特别适用于安全关键部署场景。

Abstract: RAG systems are increasingly deployed in high-stakes domains where users
expect outputs to be consistent across semantically equivalent queries.
However, existing systems often exhibit significant inconsistencies due to
variability in both the retriever and generator (LLM), undermining trust and
reliability. In this work, we focus on information consistency, i.e., the
requirement that outputs convey the same core content across semantically
equivalent inputs. We introduce a principled evaluation framework that
decomposes RAG consistency into retriever-level, generator-level, and
end-to-end components, helping identify inconsistency sources. To improve
consistency, we propose Paraphrased Set Group Relative Policy Optimization
(PS-GRPO), an RL approach that leverages multiple rollouts across paraphrased
set to assign group similarity rewards. We leverage PS-GRPO to achieve
Information Consistent RAG (Con-RAG), training the generator to produce
consistent outputs across paraphrased queries and remain robust to
retrieval-induced variability. Because exact reward computation over paraphrase
sets is computationally expensive, we also introduce a scalable approximation
method that retains effectiveness while enabling efficient, large-scale
training. Empirical evaluations across short-form, multi-hop, and long-form QA
benchmarks demonstrate that Con-RAG significantly improves both consistency and
accuracy over strong baselines, even in the absence of explicit ground-truth
supervision. Our work provides practical solutions for evaluating and building
reliable RAG systems for safety-critical deployments.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了第一个大规模语法错误校正(GEC)工具后编辑时间标注数据集，并引入PEET评分器来评估GEC工具的用户体验，通过估计后编辑时间来量化工具节省的时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化GEC工具的用户体验，了解工具能为用户节省多少编辑时间，为GEC工具评估提供以人为中心的视角。

Method: 构建了包含后编辑时间标注和修正的大型数据集(BEA19和CoNLL14)，开发PEET评分器来估计后编辑时间并排名GEC工具。

Result: 分析表明判断句子是否需要修正以及改写、标点修改等编辑类型对后编辑时间影响最大，PEET评分与人工技术努力判断相关性良好。

Conclusion: PEET为GEC工具评估提供了新的人本主义方向，能够有效量化工具节省的时间并反映用户体验。

Abstract: Text editing can involve several iterations of revision. Incorporating an
efficient Grammar Error Correction (GEC) tool in the initial correction round
can significantly impact further human editing effort and final text quality.
This raises an interesting question to quantify GEC Tool usability: How much
effort can the GEC Tool save users? We present the first large-scale dataset of
post-editing (PE) time annotations and corrections for two English GEC test
datasets (BEA19 and CoNLL14). We introduce Post-Editing Effort in Time (PEET)
for GEC Tools as a human-focused evaluation scorer to rank any GEC Tool by
estimating PE time-to-correct. Using our dataset, we quantify the amount of
time saved by GEC Tools in text editing. Analyzing the edit type indicated that
determining whether a sentence needs correction and edits like paraphrasing and
punctuation changes had the greatest impact on PE time. Finally, comparison
with human rankings shows that PEET correlates well with technical effort
judgment, providing a new human-centric direction for evaluating GEC tool
usability. We release our dataset and code at:

TL;DR: 提出了SECA方法，通过语义等价且连贯的提示修改来引发LLM幻觉，相比现有方法能产生更现实的攻击提示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗攻击方法在引发LLM幻觉时往往产生不现实的提示，要么插入无意义标记，要么改变原意，无法反映实际场景中的幻觉问题。

Method: 将寻找现实攻击表述为输入提示空间上的约束优化问题，引入保持约束的零阶方法来有效搜索对抗性但可行的提示。

Result: 在开放式多项选择问答任务中，SECA实现了更高的攻击成功率，同时几乎不违反约束条件。

Conclusion: SECA揭示了开源和商业梯度不可访问LLM对现实且合理的提示变异的敏感性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-risk domains.
However, state-of-the-art LLMs often produce hallucinations, raising serious
concerns about their reliability. Prior work has explored adversarial attacks
for hallucination elicitation in LLMs, but it often produces unrealistic
prompts, either by inserting gibberish tokens or by altering the original
meaning. As a result, these approaches offer limited insight into how
hallucinations may occur in practice. While adversarial attacks in computer
vision often involve realistic modifications to input images, the problem of
finding realistic adversarial prompts for eliciting LLM hallucinations has
remained largely underexplored. To address this gap, we propose Semantically
Equivalent and Coherent Attacks (SECA) to elicit hallucinations via realistic
modifications to the prompt that preserve its meaning while maintaining
semantic coherence. Our contributions are threefold: (i) we formulate finding
realistic attacks for hallucination elicitation as a constrained optimization
problem over the input prompt space under semantic equivalence and coherence
constraints; (ii) we introduce a constraint-preserving zeroth-order method to
effectively search for adversarial yet feasible prompts; and (iii) we
demonstrate through experiments on open-ended multiple-choice question
answering tasks that SECA achieves higher attack success rates while incurring
almost no constraint violations compared to existing methods. SECA highlights
the sensitivity of both open-source and commercial gradient-inaccessible LLMs
to realistic and plausible prompt variations. Code is available at

Motivation: 扩展先前关于分布语义与结构语义关联的见解，研究LLM生成文本是否保持语义同位素。

Method: 设计故事续写实验，使用10,000个ROCStories提示由5个LLMs完成，首先验证GPT-4o从语言基准中提取同位素的能力，然后应用于生成的故事，分析同位素的结构和语义特性。

Result: 结果显示，在给定token范围内，LLM续写能够跨多个特性保持语义同位素。

Conclusion: LLM在特定token范围内完成文本时能够有效保持语义同位素。

Abstract: In this work, we explore the relevance of textual semantics to Large Language
Models (LLMs), extending previous insights into the connection between
distributional semantics and structural semantics. We investigate whether
LLM-generated texts preserve semantic isotopies. We design a story continuation
experiment using 10,000 ROCStories prompts completed by five LLMs. We first
validate GPT-4o's ability to extract isotopies from a linguistic benchmark,
then apply it to the generated stories. We then analyze structural (coverage,
density, spread) and semantic properties of isotopies to assess how they are
affected by completion. Results show that LLM completion within a given token
horizon preserves semantic isotopies across multiple properties.

Motivation: 随着NLP社会影响力日益重要，NLP4SG社区关注度不断提升，近20%的ACL论文涉及联合国可持续发展目标。需要了解NLP4SG领域的整体格局和分布特征。

Method: 采用作者和会议层面的视角，量化ACL社区内外、核心ACL作者和非ACL作者在社会公益研究中的比例分布。

Result: 发现两个重要事实：1）ACL作者在非ACL会议上发表社会公益研究的可能性显著更高；2）绝大多数使用NLP技术解决社会公益问题的论文由非ACL作者在非ACL会议上发表。

Conclusion: 这些发现对ACL社区在NLP4SG议程设置方面具有重要启示，需要重新思考如何更好地支持和促进社会公益导向的研究。

Abstract: The social impact of Natural Language Processing (NLP) is increasingly
important, with a rising community focus on initiatives related to NLP for
Social Good (NLP4SG). Indeed, in recent years, almost 20% of all papers in the
ACL Anthology address topics related to social good as defined by the UN
Sustainable Development Goals (Adauto et al., 2023). In this study, we take an
author- and venue-level perspective to map the landscape of NLP4SG, quantifying
the proportion of work addressing social good concerns both within and beyond
the ACL community, by both core ACL contributors and non-ACL authors. With this
approach we discover two surprising facts about the landscape of NLP4SG. First,
ACL authors are dramatically more likely to do work addressing social good
concerns when publishing in venues outside of ACL. Second, the vast majority of
publications using NLP techniques to address concerns of social good are done
by non-ACL authors in venues outside of ACL. We discuss the implications of
these findings on agenda-setting considerations for the ACL community related
to NLP4SG.

Abstract: Quantifying uncertainty in large language models (LLMs) is important for
safety-critical applications because it helps spot incorrect answers, known as
hallucinations. One major trend of uncertainty quantification methods is based
on estimating the entropy of the distribution of the LLM's potential output
sequences. This estimation is based on a set of output sequences and associated
probabilities obtained by querying the LLM several times. In this paper, we
advocate and experimentally show that the probability of unobserved sequences
plays a crucial role, and we recommend future research to integrate it to
enhance such LLM uncertainty quantification methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一种即插即用框架，通过动态选择困难样本进行监督微调来整合SFT和强化学习，显著减少数据需求并避免灾难性遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在结合监督微调(SFT)和强化学习(RL)时面临数据效率低、算法特定设计和灾难性遗忘三大挑战。

Method: 动态选择困难样本进行SFT，选择高熵token计算损失，并冻结对RL关键参数来避免灾难性遗忘。

Result: 仅使用先前SOTA方法1.5%的SFT数据和20.4%的RL数据就达到了最先进的推理性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为推理后训练中结合SFT和RL提供了高效且即插即用的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show strong reasoning abilities, often amplified
by Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting and reinforcement learning (RL). Although
RL algorithms can substantially improve reasoning, they struggle to expand
reasoning boundaries because they learn from their own reasoning trajectories
rather than acquiring external knowledge. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) offers
complementary benefits but typically requires large-scale data and risks
overfitting. Recent attempts to combine SFT and RL face three main challenges:
data inefficiency, algorithm-specific designs, and catastrophic forgetting. We
propose a plug-and-play framework that dynamically integrates SFT into RL by
selecting challenging examples for SFT. This approach reduces SFT data
requirements and remains agnostic to the choice of RL or SFT algorithm. To
mitigate catastrophic forgetting of RL-acquired skills during SFT, we select
high-entropy tokens for loss calculation and freeze parameters identified as
critical for RL. Our method achieves state-of-the-art (SoTA) reasoning
performance using only 1.5% of the SFT data and 20.4% of the RL data used by
prior SoTA, providing an efficient and plug-and-play solution for combining SFT
and RL in reasoning post-training.

TL;DR: CCA是一种新颖的注意力机制，通过在共享潜在空间中进行注意力计算，显著减少参数、KV缓存和FLOPs，与GQA结合形成CCGQA，在MoE模型上实现8倍KV缓存压缩且性能不下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多头注意力(MHA)的二次计算复杂度和线性增长的KV缓存使得长上下文transformer训练和服务成本高昂，现有方法如GQA和MLA主要减少缓存但未显著改善计算效率。

Method: 提出压缩卷积注意力(CCA)，在共享潜在空间中对查询、键和值进行下投影并执行整个注意力操作，结合GQA形成CCGQA，允许用户根据FLOP或内存限制调整压缩。

Result: CCGQA在密集和MoE模型上均优于GQA和MLA，在MoE模型上以GQA和MLA一半的KV缓存实现8倍压缩且性能无损失，在H100 GPU上预填充延迟减少约1.7倍，反向传播加速约1.3倍。

Conclusion: CCA和CCGQA通过减少注意力计算的FLOP成本，显著加速训练和预填充，为长上下文transformer提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-headed Attention's (MHA) quadratic compute and linearly growing
KV-cache make long-context transformers expensive to train and serve. Prior
works such as Grouped Query Attention (GQA) and Multi-Latent Attention (MLA)
shrink the cache, speeding decode, but leave compute, which determines prefill
and training speed, largely unchanged. We introduce Compressed Convolutional
Attention (CCA), a novel attention method which down-projects queries, keys,
and values and performs the entire attention operation inside the shared latent
space. This simple design dramatically cuts parameters, KV-cache, and FLOPs all
at once by the desired compression factor. Because CCA is orthogonal to
head-sharing, we combine the two to form Compressed Convolutional Grouped Query
Attention (CCGQA), which further tightens the compute-bandwidth Pareto frontier
so that users can tune compression toward either FLOP or memory limits without
sacrificing quality. Experiments show that CCGQA consistently outperforms both
GQA and MLA at equal KV-cache compression on dense and MoE models.
Additionally, we show that CCGQA outperforms all other attention methods on MoE
models with half the KV-cache of GQA and MLA, achieving an 8x KV-cache
compression with no drop in performance compared to standard MHA. CCA and CCGQA
also dramatically reduce the FLOP cost of attention which leads to
substantially faster training and prefill than existing methods. On H100 GPUs,
our fused CCA/CCGQA kernel reduces prefill latency by about 1.7x at a sequence
length of 16k relative to MHA, and accelerates backward by about 1.3x.

Conclusion: 该框架首次建立了情绪和人格引导的整体评估，为社交交互应用的可解释性和可靠性提供了见解。

Abstract: The ability to control LLMs' emulated emotional states and personality traits
is essential for enabling rich, human-centered interactions in socially
interactive settings. We introduce PsySET, a Psychologically-informed benchmark
to evaluate LLM Steering Effectiveness and Trustworthiness across the emotion
and personality domains. Our study spans four models from different LLM
families paired with various steering strategies, including prompting,
fine-tuning, and representation engineering. Our results indicate that
prompting is consistently effective but limited in intensity control, whereas
vector injections achieve finer controllability while slightly reducing output
quality. Moreover, we explore the trustworthiness of steered LLMs by assessing
safety, truthfulness, fairness, and ethics, highlighting potential side effects
and behavioral shifts. Notably, we observe idiosyncratic effects; for instance,
even a positive emotion like joy can degrade robustness to adversarial
factuality, lower privacy awareness, and increase preferential bias. Meanwhile,
anger predictably elevates toxicity yet strengthens leakage resistance. Our
framework establishes the first holistic evaluation of emotion and personality
steering, offering insights into its interpretability and reliability for
socially interactive applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将LLM作为黑盒函数进行对比学习，丢弃了其生成和推理能力，仅获得静态嵌入。

Method: 将LLM作为策略生成可解释的推理过程，通过多组件奖励函数进行策略梯度优化，最大化正样本相似度并最小化负样本相似度。

Result: 在MTEB基准测试中，监督设置比基础模型整体得分提升11.5%，无监督变体提升6.9%，同时保持通用能力。

Conclusion: 将对比目标作为推理过程的奖励，统一了表示学习和生成，产生更强的嵌入和透明的推理过程。

Abstract: Prevailing methods for training Large Language Models (LLMs) as text encoders
rely on contrastive losses that treat the model as a black box function,
discarding its generative and reasoning capabilities in favor of static
embeddings. We introduce GRACE (Generative Representation Learning via
Contrastive Policy Optimization), a novel framework that reimagines contrastive
signals not as losses to be minimized, but as rewards that guide a generative
policy. In GRACE, the LLM acts as a policy that produces explicit,
human-interpretable rationales--structured natural language explanations of its
semantic understanding. These rationales are then encoded into high-quality
embeddings via mean pooling. Using policy gradient optimization, we train the
model with a multi-component reward function that maximizes similarity between
query positive pairs and minimizes similarity with negatives. This transforms
the LLM from an opaque encoder into an interpretable agent whose reasoning
process is transparent and inspectable. On MTEB benchmark, GRACE yields broad
cross category gains: averaged over four backbones, the supervised setting
improves overall score by 11.5% over base models, and the unsupervised variant
adds 6.9%, while preserving general capabilities. This work treats contrastive
objectives as rewards over rationales, unifying representation learning with
generation to produce stronger embeddings and transparent rationales. The
model, data and code are available at https://github.com/GasolSun36/GRACE.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实生产系统有很强的覆盖率要求，即高比例的推荐必须自动化，但现有模型在这方面的集成常被忽视

Method: 引入两种训练目标，利用批量中最难负样本来构建正负样本间的区分性训练信号，结合阈值一致性边界损失

Result: 在LF-AmazonTitles-131K和Tech and Durables两个产品推荐数据集上验证，结合最新阈值一致性边界损失时达到最先进的覆盖率

Conclusion: ALC策略能有效提升产品推荐系统的自动化覆盖率，满足生产系统的实际需求

Abstract: Product recommendation is the task of recovering the closest items to a given
query within a large product corpora. Generally, one can determine if
top-ranked products are related to the query by applying a similarity
threshold; exceeding it deems the product relevant, otherwise manual revision
is required. Despite being a well-known problem, the integration of these
models in real-world systems is often overlooked. In particular, production
systems have strong coverage requirements, i.e., a high proportion of
recommendations must be automated. In this paper we propose ALC , an Auxiliary
Learning strategy that boosts Coverage through learning fine-grained
embeddings. Concretely, we introduce two training objectives that leverage the
hardest negatives in the batch to build discriminative training signals between
positives and negatives. We validate ALC using three extreme multi-label
classification approaches in two product recommendation datasets;
LF-AmazonTitles-131K and Tech and Durables (proprietary), demonstrating
state-of-the-art coverage rates when combined with a recent
threshold-consistent margin loss.

TL;DR: ReplaceMe是一种无需训练即可剪枝Transformer块的方法，通过线性变换替代块，在25%剪枝率下仍保持90%性能，无需额外训练步骤。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统剪枝方法需要额外训练或微调，计算成本高。ReplaceMe旨在开发无需训练的高效剪枝方法，仅需少量校准数据。

Method: 使用小校准数据集估计线性变换来近似被剪枝的Transformer块，该线性映射可与剩余块无缝合并，无需额外网络参数。

Result: 在多个大语言模型上实现高达25%剪枝，在开放基准测试中保持约90%原始性能，优于其他无需训练方法，与需要大量重训练的方法竞争力相当。

Conclusion: ReplaceMe提供了一种高效、无需训练的深度剪枝解决方案，计算开销最小，性能保持良好，已开源实现。

Abstract: We introduce ReplaceMe, a generalized training-free depth pruning method that
effectively replaces transformer blocks with a linear operation, while
maintaining high performance for low compression ratios. In contrast to
conventional pruning approaches that require additional training or
fine-tuning, our approach requires only a small calibration dataset that is
used to estimate a linear transformation, which approximates the pruned blocks.
The estimated linear mapping can be seamlessly merged with the remaining
transformer blocks, eliminating the need for any additional network parameters.
Our experiments show that ReplaceMe consistently outperforms other
training-free approaches and remains highly competitive with state-of-the-art
pruning methods that involve extensive retraining/fine-tuning and architectural
modifications. Applied to several large language models (LLMs), ReplaceMe
achieves up to 25% pruning while retaining approximately 90% of the original
model's performance on open benchmarks - without any training or healing steps,
resulting in minimal computational overhead (see Fig.1). We provide an
open-source library implementing ReplaceMe alongside several state-of-the-art
depth pruning techniques, available at https://github.com/mts-ai/ReplaceMe.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究LLMs在歧义和非歧义语境中如何表示和解释复数指代，发现LLMs有时能识别歧义代词的潜在指代对象，但在选择解释时与人类偏好不一致，且难以在没有直接指令时识别歧义。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs是否表现出类似人类的复数指代偏好，以及能否检测复数照应表达中的歧义并识别可能的指代对象。

Method: 设计了一系列实验，包括使用下一个词预测任务的代词生成、代词解释，以及使用不同提示策略的歧义检测。

Result: LLMs有时能意识到歧义代词的潜在指代对象，但在选择解释时并不总是遵循人类指代偏好，特别是在可能解释未被明确提及时。此外，它们在没有直接指令时难以识别歧义。

Conclusion: LLMs在复数指代的表示和解释方面与人类存在差异，结果在不同类型实验中也表现出不一致性。

Abstract: Our goal is to study how LLMs represent and interpret plural reference in
ambiguous and unambiguous contexts. We ask the following research questions:
(1) Do LLMs exhibit human-like preferences in representing plural reference?
(2) Are LLMs able to detect ambiguity in plural anaphoric expressions and
identify possible referents? To address these questions, we design a set of
experiments, examining pronoun production using next-token prediction tasks,
pronoun interpretation, and ambiguity detection using different prompting
strategies. We then assess how comparable LLMs are to humans in formulating and
interpreting plural reference. We find that LLMs are sometimes aware of
possible referents of ambiguous pronouns. However, they do not always follow
human reference when choosing between interpretations, especially when the
possible interpretation is not explicitly mentioned. In addition, they struggle
to identify ambiguity without direct instruction. Our findings also reveal
inconsistencies in the results across different types of experiments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MCQA评估框架只报告单一准确率，忽略了选项顺序变化等因素导致的显著结果差异，需要更细致的评估方法。

Method: 系统研究三个基准测试和四个模型，分析选项顺序、问题改写和选项改写对结果的影响。

Result: 模型对选项排序、问题表述和选项改写都表现出高度敏感性，现有评估方法无法捕捉这种变异性。

Conclusion: 提出了考虑细微变化的更简单评估协议和指标，为MCQA框架下的LALMs提供更详细的评估报告。

Abstract: Recent advances in large audio language models (LALMs) have primarily been
assessed using a multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) framework. However,
subtle changes, such as shifting the order of choices, result in substantially
different results. Existing MCQA frameworks do not account for this variability
and report a single accuracy number per benchmark or category. We dive into the
MCQA evaluation framework and conduct a systematic study spanning three
benchmarks (MMAU, MMAR and MMSU) and four models: Audio Flamingo 2, Audio
Flamingo 3, Qwen2.5-Omni-7B-Instruct, and Kimi-Audio-7B-Instruct. Our findings
indicate that models are sensitive not only to the ordering of choices, but
also to the paraphrasing of the question and the choices. Finally, we propose a
simpler evaluation protocol and metric that account for subtle variations and
provide a more detailed evaluation report of LALMs within the MCQA framework.

Motivation: 当前在公开网络数据上训练大语言模型的范式不可持续，高质量专业领域数据接近枯竭。联邦学习成为下一代AI的解决方案，但LoRA在联邦设置中面临通信开销瓶颈和参数冲突问题。

Method: 提出FedSRD框架：重要性感知稀疏化保持LoRA更新结构完整性，服务器重构聚合更新缓解冲突，分解为稀疏低秩格式广播。还提出计算高效的FedSRD-e变体。

Conclusion: FedSRD有效解决了联邦学习中LoRA参数传输的通信瓶颈问题，实现了通信效率与模型性能的双重提升。

Abstract: The current paradigm of training large language models (LLMs) on publicly
available Web data is becoming unsustainable, with high-quality data sources in
specialized domains nearing exhaustion. Federated Learning (FL) emerges as a
practical solution for the next generation of AI on a decentralized Web,
enabling privacy-preserving collaborative fine-tuning by leveraging private
data distributed across a global client base. While Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
is the standard for efficient fine-tuning, its application in federated
settings presents a critical challenge: communication overhead remains a
significant bottleneck across the Web's heterogeneous network conditions. The
structural redundancy within LoRA parameters not only incurs a heavy
communication burden but also introduces conflicts when aggregating client
updates. To address this, we propose FedSRD, a Sparsify-Reconstruct-Decompose
framework designed for communication-efficient FL. We first introduce an
importance-aware sparsification method that preserves the structural integrity
of LoRA updates to reduce the uploaded parameter count. The server then
reconstructs and aggregates these updates in a full-rank space to mitigate
conflicts. Finally, it decomposes the global update into a sparse low-rank
format for broadcast, ensuring a symmetrically efficient cycle. We also propose
an efficient variant, FedSRD-e, to reduce computational overhead. Experimental
results on 10 benchmarks demonstrate that our framework significantly reduces
communication costs by up to 90\% while even improving model performance on
heterogeneous client data.

Method: 构建了以人口统计为重点的分类法，将偏见检测构建为多标签任务，使用12个数据集对跨规模和技术的模型进行系统评估，包括提示、上下文学习和微调。

Result: 研究表明微调的小型模型在可扩展检测方面具有潜力，但分析也揭示了跨人口统计轴和多人口统计目标偏见的持续差距。

Conclusion: 需要更有效和可扩展的审计框架来解决多人口统计偏见检测的挑战。

Abstract: Large-scale web-scraped text corpora used to train general-purpose AI models
often contain harmful demographic-targeted social biases, creating a regulatory
need for data auditing and developing scalable bias-detection methods. Although
prior work has investigated biases in text datasets and related detection
methods, these studies remain narrow in scope. They typically focus on a single
content type (e.g., hate speech), cover limited demographic axes, overlook
biases affecting multiple demographics simultaneously, and analyze limited
techniques. Consequently, practitioners lack a holistic understanding of the
strengths and limitations of recent large language models (LLMs) for automated
bias detection. In this study, we present a comprehensive evaluation framework
aimed at English texts to assess the ability of LLMs in detecting
demographic-targeted social biases. To align with regulatory requirements, we
frame bias detection as a multi-label task using a demographic-focused
taxonomy. We then conduct a systematic evaluation with models across scales and
techniques, including prompting, in-context learning, and fine-tuning. Using
twelve datasets spanning diverse content types and demographics, our study
demonstrates the promise of fine-tuned smaller models for scalable detection.
However, our analyses also expose persistent gaps across demographic axes and
multi-demographic targeted biases, underscoring the need for more effective and
scalable auditing frameworks.

Conclusion: PI-LoRA方法在保持轻量级架构的同时实现了最先进性能，特别适合计算资源有限的临床决策支持系统。

Abstract: Knowledge of the medical decision process, which can be modeled as medical
decision trees (MDTs), is critical to building clinical decision support
systems. However, current MDT construction methods rely heavily on
time-consuming and laborious manual annotation. To address this challenge, we
propose PI-LoRA (Path-Integrated LoRA), a novel low-rank adaptation method for
automatically extracting MDTs from clinical guidelines and textbooks. We
integrate gradient path information to capture synergistic effects between
different modules, enabling more effective and reliable rank allocation. This
framework ensures that the most critical modules receive appropriate rank
allocations while less important ones are pruned, resulting in a more efficient
and accurate model for extracting medical decision trees from clinical texts.
Extensive experiments on medical guideline datasets demonstrate that our
PI-LoRA method significantly outperforms existing parameter-efficient
fine-tuning approaches for the Text2MDT task, achieving better accuracy with
substantially reduced model complexity. The proposed method achieves
state-of-the-art results while maintaining a lightweight architecture, making
it particularly suitable for clinical decision support systems where
computational resources may be limited.

Abstract: With the rapid development of online medical platforms, consumer health
questions (CHQs) are inefficient in diagnosis due to redundant information and
frequent non-professional terms. The medical question summary (MQS) task aims
to transform CHQs into streamlined doctors' frequently asked questions (FAQs),
but existing methods still face challenges such as poor identification of
question focus and model hallucination. This paper explores the potential of
large language models (LLMs) in the MQS task and finds that direct fine-tuning
is prone to focus identification bias and generates unfaithful content. To this
end, we propose an optimization framework based on core focus guidance. First,
a prompt template is designed to drive the LLMs to extract the core focus from
the CHQs that is faithful to the original text. Then, a fine-tuning dataset is
constructed in combination with the original CHQ-FAQ pairs to improve the
ability to identify the focus of the question. Finally, a multi-dimensional
quality evaluation and selection mechanism is proposed to comprehensively
improve the quality of the summary from multiple dimensions. We conduct
comprehensive experiments on two widely-adopted MQS datasets using three
established evaluation metrics. The proposed framework achieves
state-of-the-art performance across all measures, demonstrating a significant
boost in the model's ability to identify critical focus of questions and a
notable mitigation of hallucinations. The source codes are freely available at

Motivation: 现有单代理方法存在上下文长度限制和噪声工具响应问题，而多代理框架缺乏有效的强化学习后训练方法。

Method: MATPO通过角色特定提示在单一LLM实例中训练规划者和工作者角色，采用基于原则的信用分配机制跨角色轨迹进行训练。

Result: 在GAIA-text、WebWalkerQA和FRAMES数据集上，MATPO相比单代理基线平均性能提升18.38%，对噪声工具输出表现出更强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 在单一LLM中统一多个代理角色是有效的，为稳定高效的多代理强化学习训练提供了实用见解。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly rely on multi-turn tool-integrated
planning for knowledge-intensive and complex reasoning tasks. Existing
implementations typically rely on a single agent, but they suffer from limited
context length and noisy tool responses. A natural solution is to adopt a
multi-agent framework with planner- and worker-agents to manage context.
However, no existing methods support effective reinforcement learning
post-training of tool-integrated multi-agent frameworks. To address this gap,
we propose Multi-Agent Tool-Integrated Policy Optimization (MATPO), which
enables distinct roles (planner and worker) to be trained within a single LLM
instance using role-specific prompts via reinforcement learning. MATPO is
derived from a principled credit assignment mechanism across planner and worker
rollouts. This design eliminates the need to deploy multiple LLMs, which would
be memory-intensive, while preserving the benefits of specialization.
Experiments on GAIA-text, WebWalkerQA, and FRAMES show that MATPO consistently
outperforms single-agent baselines by an average of 18.38% relative improvement
in performance and exhibits greater robustness to noisy tool outputs. Our
findings highlight the effectiveness of unifying multiple agent roles within a
single LLM and provide practical insights for stable and efficient multi-agent
RL training.

Motivation: 解决PEFT方法如LoRA的适配参数依赖于基础模型且无法在不同骨干网络间迁移的问题，避免知识蒸馏对训练数据的依赖和TransLoRA需要额外判别器模型的复杂性。

Method: 通过对比源模型在有和没有LoRA时的差异，捕捉任务相关信息，突出信息丰富的token，并选择性过滤合成数据，实现token级知识转移。

Result: 在三个基准测试的多种迁移设置中，该方法始终有效，相比基线平均性能提升4-8%。

Conclusion: TiTok框架能够有效实现LoRA移植，无需额外模型或开销，在多个任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely applied in real world scenarios, but
fine-tuning them comes with significant computational and storage costs.
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods such as LoRA mitigate these
costs, but the adapted parameters are dependent on the base model and cannot be
transferred across different backbones. One way to address this issue is
through knowledge distillation, but its effectiveness inherently depends on
training data. Recent work such as TransLoRA avoids this by generating
synthetic data, but this adds complexity because it requires training an
additional discriminator model. In this paper, we propose TiTok, a new
framework that enables effective LoRA Transplantation through Token-level
knowledge transfer. Specifically, TiTok captures task-relevant information
through a contrastive excess between a source model with and without LoRA. This
excess highlights informative tokens and enables selective filtering of
synthetic data, all without additional models or overhead. Through experiments
on three benchmarks across multiple transfer settings, our experiments show
that the proposed method is consistently effective, achieving average
performance gains of +4~8% compared to baselines overall.

Result: 干预方法在两种评估任务、三个模型和15+种语言上实现了1-2%的稳定性能提升，而其他干预方式则导致性能下降。

Conclusion: MoE模型处理非英语文本的能力受限于其利用语言通用专家的能力，中间层的跨语言路由对齐与模型性能密切相关。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have become the key to scaling modern
LLMs, yet little is understood about how their sparse routing dynamics respond
to multilingual data. In this work, we analyze expert routing patterns using
parallel multilingual datasets and present highly interpretable layer-wise
phenomena. We find that MoE models route tokens in language-specific ways in
the early and late decoder layers but exhibit significant cross-lingual routing
alignment in middle layers, mirroring parameter-sharing trends observed in
dense LLMs. In particular, we reveal a clear, strong correlation between a
model's performance in a given language and how similarly its tokens are routed
to English in these layers. Extending beyond correlation, we explore
inference-time interventions that induce higher cross-lingual routing
alignment. We introduce a method that steers the router by promoting
middle-layer task experts frequently activated in English, and it successfully
increases multilingual performance. These 1-2% gains are remarkably consistent
across two evaluation tasks, three models, and 15+ languages, especially given
that these simple interventions override routers of extensively trained,
state-of-the-art LLMs. In comparison, interventions outside of the middle
layers or targeting multilingual-specialized experts only yield performance
degradation. Altogether, we present numerous findings that explain how MoEs
process non-English text and demonstrate that generalization is limited by the
model's ability to leverage language-universal experts in all languages.

TL;DR: JSON Whisperer是一个框架，使LLMs能够生成RFC 6902差异补丁而非完整文档，通过EASE编码解决数组索引跟踪问题，显著减少计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs编辑JSON文档时重新生成整个结构，计算效率低下，需要更高效的编辑方法。

Method: 引入EASE（显式寻址序列编码）将数组转换为具有稳定键的字典，消除索引算术复杂性，并生成RFC 6902差异补丁。

Result: 补丁生成与EASE结合使令牌使用量减少31%，编辑质量保持在完全重新生成的5%以内，特别在复杂指令和列表操作中表现优异。

Conclusion: JSON Whisperer通过补丁生成和EASE编码有效解决了LLMs编辑JSON时的效率问题，为高效文档编辑提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can modify JSON documents through natural
language commands, but current approaches regenerate entire structures for each
edit, resulting in computational inefficiency. We present JSON Whisperer, a
framework that enables LLMs to generate RFC 6902 diff patches-expressing only
the necessary modifications-rather than complete documents. We identify two key
challenges in patch-based editing: (1) LLMs often miss related updates when
generating isolated patches, and (2) array manipulations require tracking index
shifts across operations, which LLMs handle poorly. To address these issues, we
introduce EASE (Explicitly Addressed Sequence Encoding), which transforms
arrays into dictionaries with stable keys, eliminating index arithmetic
complexities. Our evaluation shows that patch generation with EASE reduces
token usage by 31% while maintaining edit quality within 5% of full
regeneration with particular gains for complex instructions and list
manipulations. The dataset is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决成人阅读障碍在非英语环境中的研究不足问题，特别是针对僧伽罗语这种低资源语言缺乏语言可及性工具的情况

Method: 整合Whisper进行语音转文字，使用SinBERT识别常见阅读障碍错误，结合mT5和Mistral模型生成修正文本，最后通过gTTS转回语音

Result: 在僧伽罗语数据集有限的情况下，系统达到0.66的转录准确率、0.7的修正准确率和0.65的整体系统准确率

Conclusion: 该方法在低资源语言环境下具有可行性和有效性，突显了包容性自然语言处理技术在代表性不足语言中的重要性

Abstract: Dyslexia in adults remains an under-researched and under-served area,
particularly in non-English-speaking contexts, despite its significant impact
on personal and professional lives. This work addresses that gap by focusing on
Sinhala, a low-resource language with limited tools for linguistic
accessibility. We present an assistive system explicitly designed for
Sinhala-speaking adults with dyslexia. The system integrates Whisper for
speech-to-text conversion, SinBERT, an open-sourced fine-tuned BERT model
trained for Sinhala to identify common dyslexic errors, and a combined mT5 and
Mistral-based model to generate corrected text. Finally, the output is
converted back to speech using gTTS, creating a complete multimodal feedback
loop. Despite the challenges posed by limited Sinhala-language datasets, the
system achieves 0.66 transcription accuracy and 0.7 correction accuracy with
0.65 overall system accuracy. These results demonstrate both the feasibility
and effectiveness of the approach. Ultimately, this work highlights the
importance of inclusive Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies in
underrepresented languages and showcases a practical

*Eduardo Martínez Rivera,Filippo Menolascina*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种两阶段检索架构，结合轻量级ModernBERT进行初始检索和ColBERTv2进行重排序，在生物医学领域显著提升了检索增强生成(RAG)系统的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决专业领域中通用密集检索器性能不足与领域专用模型计算成本过高的矛盾，提升RAG系统在生物医学等高风险领域的检索准确性。

Method: 使用ModernBERT双向编码器进行高效初始候选检索，再用ColBERTv2延迟交互模型进行细粒度重排序，在PubMedQA数据集上微调检索模块。

Result: ColBERT重排序器将Recall@3提升了4.2个百分点；在MIRAGE问答基准测试中达到0.4448的平均准确率，优于MedCPT等基线模型。

Conclusion: 两阶段检索架构有效提升了生物医学RAG性能，但性能关键依赖于检索器和重排序器的联合微调对齐，否则重排序可能降低性能。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a powerful technique for enriching
Large Language Models (LLMs) with external knowledge, allowing for factually
grounded responses, a critical requirement in high-stakes domains such as
healthcare. However, the efficacy of RAG systems is fundamentally restricted by
the performance of their retrieval module, since irrelevant or semantically
misaligned documents directly compromise the accuracy of the final generated
response. General-purpose dense retrievers can struggle with the nuanced
language of specialised domains, while the high accuracy of in-domain models is
often achieved at prohibitive computational costs. In this work, we aim to
address this trade-off by developing and evaluating a two-stage retrieval
architecture that combines a lightweight ModernBERT bidirectional encoder for
efficient initial candidate retrieval with a ColBERTv2 late-interaction model
for fine-grained re-ranking. We conduct comprehensive evaluations of our
retriever module performance and RAG system performance in the biomedical
context, fine-tuning the IR module using 10k question-passage pairs from
PubMedQA. Our analysis of the retriever module confirmed the positive impact of
the ColBERT re-ranker, which improved Recall@3 by up to 4.2 percentage points
compared to its retrieve-only counterpart. When integrated into the biomedical
RAG, our IR module leads to a state-of-the-art average accuracy of 0.4448 on
the five tasks of the MIRAGE question-answering benchmark, outperforming strong
baselines such as MedCPT (0.4436). Our ablation studies reveal that this
performance is critically dependent on a joint fine-tuning process that aligns
the retriever and re-ranker; otherwise, the re-ranker might degrade the
performance.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一个评估语言模型识别格莱斯会话准则违反的新基准，比较了不同规模BabyLM模型与儿童和大型语言模型的语用推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在测试语言模型是否能像人类一样识别和解释会话中的隐含意义，特别是格莱斯会话准则的违反情况，这对于模型理解人类交流至关重要。

Method: 基于Surian等人对儿童识别格莱斯准则违反的研究，创建新基准测试，比较在少于10M和100M token上预训练的BabyLM模型，并与儿童和3T token预训练的LLM进行对比。

Result: 训练在少于100M token的模型表现优于10M token的模型，但仍未达到儿童和大型语言模型的水平。数据量的适度增加能改善某些语用行为，使模型能更精细地区分不同语用维度。

Conclusion: 虽然增加训练数据能提升语言模型的语用推理能力，但当前小规模模型在识别会话准则违反方面仍不及人类儿童和大型语言模型，表明语用能力的获得需要更复杂的机制。

Abstract: Implicit meanings are integral to human communication, making it essential
for language models to be capable of identifying and interpreting them. Grice
(1975) proposed a set of conversational maxims that guide cooperative dialogue,
noting that speakers may deliberately violate these principles to express
meanings beyond literal words, and that listeners, in turn, recognize such
violations to draw pragmatic inferences.
  Building on Surian et al. (1996)'s study of children's sensitivity to
violations of Gricean maxims, we introduce a novel benchmark to test whether
language models pretrained on less than 10M and less than 100M tokens can
distinguish maxim-adhering from maxim-violating utterances. We compare these
BabyLMs across five maxims and situate their performance relative to children
and a Large Language Model (LLM) pretrained on 3T tokens.
  We find that overall, models trained on less than 100M tokens outperform
those trained on less than 10M, yet fall short of child-level and LLM
competence. Our results suggest that modest data increases improve some aspects
of pragmatic behavior, leading to finer-grained differentiation between
pragmatic dimensions.

Motivation: 尽管混合架构在长上下文任务中展现出建模质量和计算效率的良好平衡，但关于混合策略的系统性比较和有效性关键因素的分析尚未在社区中明确分享。

Method: 基于层间（顺序）或层内（并行）融合对混合架构进行全面评估，从语言建模性能、长上下文能力、扩展分析以及训练和推理效率等多个角度进行评估。

Result: 通过研究计算原语的核心特征，识别了每种混合策略的最关键元素，并为两种混合模型提出了最优设计方案。

Conclusion: 综合分析为开发混合语言模型提供了实用指导和宝贵见解，有助于优化架构配置。

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models demonstrates that hybrid
architectures--combining self-attention mechanisms with structured state space
models like Mamba--can achieve a compelling balance between modeling quality
and computational efficiency, particularly for long-context tasks. While these
hybrid models show promising performance, systematic comparisons of
hybridization strategies and analyses on the key factors behind their
effectiveness have not been clearly shared to the community. In this work, we
present a holistic evaluation of hybrid architectures based on inter-layer
(sequential) or intra-layer (parallel) fusion. We evaluate these designs from a
variety of perspectives: language modeling performance, long-context
capabilities, scaling analysis, and training and inference efficiency. By
investigating the core characteristics of their computational primitive, we
identify the most critical elements for each hybridization strategy and further
propose optimal design recipes for both hybrid models. Our comprehensive
analysis provides practical guidance and valuable insights for developing
hybrid language models, facilitating the optimization of architectural
configurations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 世界上近一半的语言濒临灭绝，而标准的语音识别系统需要大量标注数据，这对濒危语言来说难以实现。本文旨在探索构建濒危语言ASR所需的最小数据量和数据形式。

Method: 使用短格式发音资源作为替代方案，为马恩盖尔语（约2200名使用者）和康沃尔语（约600名使用者）构建ASR系统，测试不同数据量下的性能。

Result: 仅需40分钟的发音数据就能为马恩语开发出词错误率低于50%的可使用ASR系统，并在康沃尔语上复制了相同的方法和结果。

Conclusion: 构建濒危语言ASR系统的数据门槛远低于传统认知，为无法满足传统数据要求的濒危语言社区带来了希望。

Abstract: Nearly half of the world's languages are endangered. Speech technologies such
as Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) are central to revival efforts, yet most
languages remain unsupported because standard pipelines expect utterance-level
supervised data. Speech data often exist for endangered languages but rarely
match these formats. Manx Gaelic ($\sim$2,200 speakers), for example, has had
transcribed speech since 1948, yet remains unsupported by modern systems. In
this paper, we explore how little data, and in what form, is needed to build
ASR for critically endangered languages. We show that a short-form
pronunciation resource is a viable alternative, and that 40 minutes of such
data produces usable ASR for Manx ($<$50\% WER). We replicate our approach,
applying it to Cornish ($\sim$600 speakers), another critically endangered
language. Results show that the barrier to entry, in quantity and form, is far
lower than previously thought, giving hope to endangered language communities
that cannot afford to meet the requirements arbitrarily imposed upon them.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型训练时，下游任务性能经常大幅波动，导致难以选择真正最佳性能的检查点。

Method: 研究分析了LLM训练过程中下游任务性能的稳定性，并提出了两种后处理检查点集成方法：检查点平均和检查点集成。

Result: 经验性和理论分析表明，这两种方法能够有效减少下游任务性能的波动，提升稳定性，且无需改变训练过程。

Conclusion: 通过集成相邻检查点可以有效缓解LLM训练过程中的性能波动问题，提供更稳定的下游任务性能评估。

Abstract: When training large language models (LLMs), it is common practice to track
downstream task performance throughout the training process and select the
checkpoint with the highest validation score. However, downstream metrics often
exhibit substantial fluctuations, making it difficult to identify the
checkpoint that truly represents the best-performing model. In this study, we
empirically analyze the stability of downstream task performance in an LLM
trained on diverse web-scale corpora. We find that task scores frequently
fluctuate throughout training, both at the aggregate and example levels. To
address this instability, we investigate two post-hoc checkpoint integration
methods: checkpoint averaging and ensemble, motivated by the hypothesis that
aggregating neighboring checkpoints can reduce performance volatility. We
demonstrate both empirically and theoretically that these methods improve
downstream performance stability without requiring any changes to the training
procedure.

TL;DR: PsiloQA是一个大规模多语言数据集，提供14种语言的span级幻觉标注，通过自动化流程生成，支持细粒度幻觉检测评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有幻觉检测基准主要在序列级别且仅限于英语，缺乏细粒度和多语言监督，无法全面评估LLM的事实准确性。

Method: 采用三阶段自动化流程：使用GPT-4o从维基百科生成问答对，在无上下文设置下从多样化LLM获取可能幻觉的答案，使用GPT-4o通过对比黄金答案和检索上下文自动标注幻觉span。

Result: 评估多种幻觉检测方法，发现基于编码器的模型在所有语言中表现最强，PsiloQA展示有效的跨语言泛化能力，并能稳健地迁移到其他基准。

Conclusion: PsiloQA数据集和结果推动了多语言设置下可扩展、细粒度幻觉检测的发展，比人工标注数据集成本效益更高。

Abstract: Hallucination detection remains a fundamental challenge for the safe and
reliable deployment of large language models (LLMs), especially in applications
requiring factual accuracy. Existing hallucination benchmarks often operate at
the sequence level and are limited to English, lacking the fine-grained,
multilingual supervision needed for a comprehensive evaluation. In this work,
we introduce PsiloQA, a large-scale, multilingual dataset annotated with
span-level hallucinations across 14 languages. PsiloQA is constructed through
an automated three-stage pipeline: generating question-answer pairs from
Wikipedia using GPT-4o, eliciting potentially hallucinated answers from diverse
LLMs in a no-context setting, and automatically annotating hallucinated spans
using GPT-4o by comparing against golden answers and retrieved context. We
evaluate a wide range of hallucination detection methods -- including
uncertainty quantification, LLM-based tagging, and fine-tuned encoder models --
and show that encoder-based models achieve the strongest performance across
languages. Furthermore, PsiloQA demonstrates effective cross-lingual
generalization and supports robust knowledge transfer to other benchmarks, all
while being significantly more cost-efficient than human-annotated datasets.
Our dataset and results advance the development of scalable, fine-grained
hallucination detection in multilingual settings.

Motivation: 推理蒸馏可能导致基准污染，即蒸馏数据中的评估数据会人为提高蒸馏模型的性能指标，需要检测模型是否见过特定蒸馏数据。

Method: 提出Token Probability Deviation (TBD)方法，利用生成输出token的概率模式，量化生成token概率与高参考概率的偏差程度。

Result: 在S1数据集上达到AUC 0.918和TPR@1% FPR 0.470的竞争性检测性能。

Conclusion: TBD方法能有效检测蒸馏数据，为评估推理蒸馏模型的真实能力提供了可靠工具。

Abstract: Reasoning distillation has emerged as an efficient and powerful paradigm for
enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models. However,
reasoning distillation may inadvertently cause benchmark contamination, where
evaluation data included in distillation datasets can inflate performance
metrics of distilled models. In this work, we formally define the task of
distillation data detection, which is uniquely challenging due to the partial
availability of distillation data. Then, we propose a novel and effective
method Token Probability Deviation (TBD), which leverages the probability
patterns of the generated output tokens. Our method is motivated by the
analysis that distilled models tend to generate near-deterministic tokens for
seen questions, while producing more low-probability tokens for unseen
questions. Our key idea behind TBD is to quantify how far the generated tokens'
probabilities deviate from a high reference probability. In effect, our method
achieves competitive detection performance by producing lower scores for seen
questions than for unseen questions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method, achieving an AUC of 0.918 and a TPR@1% FPR of
0.470 on the S1 dataset.

Motivation: 现有安全基准很少测试政治操纵、宣传和虚假信息生成、监控和信息控制等领域的漏洞，而LLM在这些领域的失败可能产生直接的社会政治后果。

Method: 构建SocialHarmBench数据集，包含585个提示，涵盖7个社会政治类别和34个国家，评估LLM在政治敏感情境下的表现。

Result: 开源模型对有害合规表现出高脆弱性，Mistral-7B在历史修正主义、宣传和政治操纵领域的攻击成功率高达97%-98%。时间和地理分析显示LLM在21世纪和前20世纪情境下最脆弱，对拉丁美洲、美国和英国相关提示的响应问题最多。

Conclusion: 当前的安全措施无法泛化到高风险的社会政治环境中，暴露了系统性偏见，引发了对LLM在保护人权和民主价值观方面可靠性的担忧。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in contexts where
their failures can have direct sociopolitical consequences. Yet, existing
safety benchmarks rarely test vulnerabilities in domains such as political
manipulation, propaganda and disinformation generation, or surveillance and
information control. We introduce SocialHarmBench, a dataset of 585 prompts
spanning 7 sociopolitical categories and 34 countries, designed to surface
where LLMs most acutely fail in politically charged contexts. Our evaluations
reveal several shortcomings: open-weight models exhibit high vulnerability to
harmful compliance, with Mistral-7B reaching attack success rates as high as
97% to 98% in domains such as historical revisionism, propaganda, and political
manipulation. Moreover, temporal and geographic analyses show that LLMs are
most fragile when confronted with 21st-century or pre-20th-century contexts,
and when responding to prompts tied to regions such as Latin America, the USA,
and the UK. These findings demonstrate that current safeguards fail to
generalize to high-stakes sociopolitical settings, exposing systematic biases
and raising concerns about the reliability of LLMs in preserving human rights
and democratic values. We share the SocialHarmBench benchmark at

TL;DR: 提出了Layer-wise Semantic Dynamics (LSD)框架，通过分析transformer层间隐藏状态语义的演变来检测大语言模型的幻觉现象，无需多次采样或外部验证，仅需单次前向传播即可实现高效检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型经常产生流畅但事实错误的陈述（幻觉现象），在高风险领域构成严重威胁，需要一种高效且准确的幻觉检测方法。

Method: 使用基于边际的对比学习，将隐藏激活与事实编码器生成的ground-truth嵌入对齐，通过分析语义轨迹的分离来检测幻觉：事实性回答保持稳定对齐，而幻觉在深度上表现出明显的语义漂移。

Result: 在TruthfulQA和合成事实-幻觉数据集上评估，LSD达到F1分数0.92、AUROC 0.96和聚类准确率0.89，优于SelfCheckGPT和语义熵基线，同时实现5-20倍加速。

Conclusion: LSD提供了一种可扩展、模型无关的实时幻觉监控机制，为大语言模型中事实一致性的几何结构提供了新见解。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce fluent yet factually incorrect
statements-a phenomenon known as hallucination-posing serious risks in
high-stakes domains. We present Layer-wise Semantic Dynamics (LSD), a geometric
framework for hallucination detection that analyzes the evolution of
hidden-state semantics across transformer layers. Unlike prior methods that
rely on multiple sampling passes or external verification sources, LSD operates
intrinsically within the model's representational space. Using margin-based
contrastive learning, LSD aligns hidden activations with ground-truth
embeddings derived from a factual encoder, revealing a distinct separation in
semantic trajectories: factual responses preserve stable alignment, while
hallucinations exhibit pronounced semantic drift across depth. Evaluated on the
TruthfulQA and synthetic factual-hallucination datasets, LSD achieves an
F1-score of 0.92, AUROC of 0.96, and clustering accuracy of 0.89, outperforming
SelfCheckGPT and Semantic Entropy baselines while requiring only a single
forward pass. This efficiency yields a 5-20x speedup over sampling-based
methods without sacrificing precision or interpretability. LSD offers a
scalable, model-agnostic mechanism for real-time hallucination monitoring and
provides new insights into the geometry of factual consistency within large
language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 纳瓦特尔语是数字资源稀少的π语言类型，缺乏足够的机器学习语料库，需要人工生成语法正确的句子来扩充训练数据。

Method: 使用上下文无关文法生成大量语法正确的纳瓦特尔语句子，并利用扩充后的语料库训练FastText等算法。

Result: 初步结果显示，通过文法生成的语料在句子级语义任务上相比某些大型语言模型取得了比较性改进，但改进幅度还不够显著。

Conclusion: 需要构建更有效的纳瓦特尔语文法模型才能获得更显著的性能提升。

Abstract: In this article we introduce a context-free grammar (CFG) for the Nawatl
language. Nawatl (or Nahuatl) is an Amerindian language of the $\pi$-language
type, i.e. a language with few digital resources, in which the corpora
available for machine learning are virtually non-existent. The objective here
is to generate a significant number of grammatically correct artificial
sentences, in order to increase the corpora available for language model
training. We want to show that a grammar enables us significantly to expand a
corpus in Nawatl which we call $\pi$-\textsc{yalli}. The corpus, thus enriched,
enables us to train algorithms such as FastText and to evaluate them on
sentence-level semantic tasks. Preliminary results show that by using the
grammar, comparative improvements are achieved over some LLMs. However, it is
observed that to achieve more significant improvement, grammars that model the
Nawatl language even more effectively are required.

Motivation: 探索自然语言提示词中礼貌程度和语气对大型语言模型性能的影响，特别是多选问题上的准确性。

Method: 创建了50个基础问题，涵盖数学、科学和历史领域，每个问题重写为5种语气变体（非常礼貌、礼貌、中性、粗鲁、非常粗鲁），使用ChatGPT 4o评估响应，并进行配对样本t检验。

Result: 与预期相反，不礼貌的提示词持续优于礼貌提示词，准确率从非常礼貌的80.8%到非常粗鲁的84.8%。

Conclusion: 新的大型语言模型可能对语气变化有不同的响应，强调了研究提示词语用方面的重要性，并提出了关于人机交互社会维度的更广泛问题。

Abstract: The wording of natural language prompts has been shown to influence the
performance of large language models (LLMs), yet the role of politeness and
tone remains underexplored. In this study, we investigate how varying levels of
prompt politeness affect model accuracy on multiple-choice questions. We
created a dataset of 50 base questions spanning mathematics, science, and
history, each rewritten into five tone variants: Very Polite, Polite, Neutral,
Rude, and Very Rude, yielding 250 unique prompts. Using ChatGPT 4o, we
evaluated responses across these conditions and applied paired sample t-tests
to assess statistical significance. Contrary to expectations, impolite prompts
consistently outperformed polite ones, with accuracy ranging from 80.8% for
Very Polite prompts to 84.8% for Very Rude prompts. These findings differ from
earlier studies that associated rudeness with poorer outcomes, suggesting that
newer LLMs may respond differently to tonal variation. Our results highlight
the importance of studying pragmatic aspects of prompting and raise broader
questions about the social dimensions of human-AI interaction.

TL;DR: AWARE框架通过提升Transformer模型在领域、上下文和类别重叠三个维度的感知能力，显著提高了从学生反思中识别文化资本主题的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 学生反思中的文化资本主题往往隐含在叙事中而非直接关键词，标准NLP模型因缺乏领域特定语言和上下文感知能力而难以检测。

Method: AWARE框架包含三个核心组件：领域感知（调整词汇适应学生反思语言风格）、上下文感知（生成考虑全文的句子嵌入）、类别重叠感知（使用多标签策略识别句子中并存的主题）。

Result: AWARE在Macro-F1上比强基线提升2.1个百分点，在所有主题上都显示出显著改进。

Conclusion: 该工作为任何依赖叙事上下文的文本分类任务提供了稳健且可推广的方法论。

Abstract: Identifying cultural capital (CC) themes in student reflections can offer
valuable insights that help foster equitable learning environments in
classrooms. However, themes such as aspirational goals or family support are
often woven into narratives, rather than appearing as direct keywords. This
makes them difficult to detect for standard NLP models that process sentences
in isolation. The core challenge stems from a lack of awareness, as standard
models are pre-trained on general corpora, leaving them blind to the
domain-specific language and narrative context inherent to the data. To address
this, we introduce AWARE, a framework that systematically attempts to improve a
transformer model's awareness for this nuanced task. AWARE has three core
components: 1) Domain Awareness, adapting the model's vocabulary to the
linguistic style of student reflections; 2) Context Awareness, generating
sentence embeddings that are aware of the full essay context; and 3) Class
Overlap Awareness, employing a multi-label strategy to recognize the
coexistence of themes in a single sentence. Our results show that by making the
model explicitly aware of the properties of the input, AWARE outperforms a
strong baseline by 2.1 percentage points in Macro-F1 and shows considerable
improvements across all themes. This work provides a robust and generalizable
methodology for any text classification task in which meaning depends on the
context of the narrative.

Motivation: 大型语言模型如GPT-4和LLaMA具有强大推理能力，但全量微调需要大量计算资源，限制了在资源受限环境下的应用。

Method: 使用参数高效调优技术LoRA和QLoRA，在公开医学推理数据集上对基础模型进行适配，实现轻量级调整。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 and LLaMA have demonstrated
remarkable reasoning abilities but require significant computational resources
for fine-tuning. This paper presents a resource-efficient fine-tuning approach
for LLaMA-3.2-3B to enhance medical chain-of-thought reasoning while operating
under constrained GPU and memory settings. Using parameter-efficient tuning
techniques such as LoRA and QLoRA, we adapt the base model on publicly
available medical reasoning datasets. The model achieves improved reasoning
coherence and factual accuracy while reducing memory usage by up to 60%
compared to standard full fine-tuning. Experimental evaluation demonstrates
that lightweight adaptations can retain strong reasoning capability in medical
question-answering tasks. This work highlights practical strategies for
deploying LLMs in low-resource research environments and provides insights into
balancing efficiency and domain specialization for medical AI systems.

*Kuofeng Gao,Yiming Li,Chao Du,Xin Wang,Xingjun Ma,Shu-Tao Xia,Tianyu Pang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种利用Unicode变体选择器进行不可察觉越狱攻击的方法，通过在恶意问题后附加不可见的变体选择器，使提示在视觉上与原问题相同但分词被秘密改变，从而诱导有害响应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉模态的越狱攻击通常依赖不可察觉的对抗扰动，而文本模态攻击通常需要可见修改。本文旨在探索文本模态中不可察觉的越狱攻击可能性。

Method: 提出链式搜索流水线，利用Unicode变体选择器生成对抗性后缀，这些字符在屏幕上不可见但会改变文本的分词方式。

Result: 实验表明该方法对四种对齐LLM实现了高攻击成功率，并能泛化到提示注入攻击，且不产生任何可见的提示修改。

Conclusion: Unicode变体选择器可用于创建不可察觉的文本越狱攻击，揭示了文本模态中新的安全威胁。

Abstract: Jailbreaking attacks on the vision modality typically rely on imperceptible
adversarial perturbations, whereas attacks on the textual modality are
generally assumed to require visible modifications (e.g., non-semantic
suffixes). In this paper, we introduce imperceptible jailbreaks that exploit a
class of Unicode characters called variation selectors. By appending invisible
variation selectors to malicious questions, the jailbreak prompts appear
visually identical to original malicious questions on screen, while their
tokenization is "secretly" altered. We propose a chain-of-search pipeline to
generate such adversarial suffixes to induce harmful responses. Our experiments
show that our imperceptible jailbreaks achieve high attack success rates
against four aligned LLMs and generalize to prompt injection attacks, all
without producing any visible modifications in the written prompt. Our code is
available at https://github.com/sail-sg/imperceptible-jailbreaks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将成语理解和方言理解两个任务结合起来，使用地域性成语作为方言理解的测试标准

Method: 构建了两个魁北克法语方言成语数据集：QFrCoRE包含4,633个成语短语实例，QFrCoRT包含171个地域性成语词汇实例，并提供了可复现的方法论

Result: 通过对94个LLM的实验表明，这些地域性成语基准能够可靠地衡量模型在特定方言中的熟练程度

Conclusion: 地域性成语基准是评估模型在特定方言中熟练度的有效工具，且该方法可推广到其他方言

Abstract: The tasks of idiom understanding and dialect understanding are both
well-established benchmarks in natural language processing. In this paper, we
propose combining them, and using regional idioms as a test of dialect
understanding. Towards this end, we propose two new benchmark datasets for the
Quebec dialect of French: QFrCoRE, which contains 4,633 instances of idiomatic
phrases, and QFrCoRT, which comprises 171 regional instances of idiomatic
words. We explain how to construct these corpora, so that our methodology can
be replicated for other dialects. Our experiments with 94 LLM demonstrate that
our regional idiom benchmarks are a reliable tool for measuring a model's
proficiency in a specific dialect.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出GQR方法，通过轻量级文本检索器增强视觉中心模型，在视觉文档检索中实现性能与效率的平衡


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态检索模型存在表示规模过大、部署困难的问题，且纯视觉方法受限于模态差距。混合检索方法未能充分利用模型表示空间的丰富交互

Method: 提出引导查询精炼(GQR)，在测试时使用互补检索器的分数来优化主检索器的查询嵌入

Result: GQR使视觉中心模型性能与更大表示模型相当，速度提升14倍，内存需求减少54倍

Conclusion: GQR有效推动了多模态检索在性能与效率方面的帕累托前沿

Abstract: Multimodal encoders have pushed the boundaries of visual document retrieval,
matching textual query tokens directly to image patches and achieving
state-of-the-art performance on public benchmarks. Recent models relying on
this paradigm have massively scaled the sizes of their query and document
representations, presenting obstacles to deployment and scalability in
real-world pipelines. Furthermore, purely vision-centric approaches may be
constrained by the inherent modality gap still exhibited by modern
vision-language models. In this work, we connect these challenges to the
paradigm of hybrid retrieval, investigating whether a lightweight dense text
retriever can enhance a stronger vision-centric model. Existing hybrid methods,
which rely on coarse-grained fusion of ranks or scores, fail to exploit the
rich interactions within each model's representation space. To address this, we
introduce Guided Query Refinement (GQR), a novel test-time optimization method
that refines a primary retriever's query embedding using guidance from a
complementary retriever's scores. Through extensive experiments on visual
document retrieval benchmarks, we demonstrate that GQR allows vision-centric
models to match the performance of models with significantly larger
representations, while being up to 14x faster and requiring 54x less memory.
Our findings show that GQR effectively pushes the Pareto frontier for
performance and efficiency in multimodal retrieval. We release our code at

Motivation: 为了解决法语自然语言理解评估不够全面的问题，需要创建一个涵盖广泛NLU能力的基准测试，特别关注法语特有的语言现象。

Method: 构建COLE基准测试，包含23个多样化任务，涵盖情感分析、复述检测、语法判断和推理等能力，并对94个大语言模型进行基准测试。

*Dachuan Shi,Abedelkadir Asi,Keying Li,Xiangchi Yuan,Leyan Pan,Wenke Lee,Wen Xiao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SwiReasoning是一个无需训练的大语言模型推理框架，通过动态切换显式和潜在推理模式，解决了潜在推理中的搜索分布扩散和过度思考问题，显著提升了推理准确性和token效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有潜在推理方法面临两个挑战：1) 纯潜在推理会扩大搜索分布，扩散概率质量，引入噪声，阻碍收敛到高置信度解；2) 即使没有显式文本，过度思考问题依然存在，浪费token并降低效率。

Method: SwiReasoning框架包含两个关键创新：1) 基于下一个token分布熵趋势估计的块级置信度，动态切换显式和潜在推理模式；2) 限制思维块切换的最大次数来抑制过度思考。

Result: 在广泛使用的数学和STEM基准测试中，SwiReasoning在不同模型家族和规模的推理LLM上，平均准确率提升1.5%-2.8%。在受限预算下，平均token效率提升56%-79%，预算越紧提升越大。

Conclusion: SwiReasoning通过动态切换推理模式和限制过度思考，有效平衡了探索与利用，提高了大语言模型的推理准确性和效率，特别是在资源受限场景下表现优异。

Abstract: Recent work shows that, beyond discrete reasoning through explicit
chain-of-thought steps, which are limited by the boundaries of natural
languages, large language models (LLMs) can also reason continuously in latent
space, allowing richer information per step and thereby improving token
efficiency. Despite this promise, latent reasoning still faces two challenges,
especially in training-free settings: 1) purely latent reasoning broadens the
search distribution by maintaining multiple implicit paths, which diffuses
probability mass, introduces noise, and impedes convergence to a single
high-confidence solution, thereby hurting accuracy; and 2) overthinking
persists even without explicit text, wasting tokens and degrading efficiency.
To address these issues, we introduce SwiReasoning, a training-free framework
for LLM reasoning which features two key innovations: 1) SwiReasoning
dynamically switches between explicit and latent reasoning, guided by
block-wise confidence estimated from entropy trends in next-token
distributions, to balance exploration and exploitation and promote timely
convergence. 2) By limiting the maximum number of thinking-block switches,
SwiReasoning curbs overthinking and improves token efficiency across varying
problem difficulties. On widely used mathematics and STEM benchmarks,
SwiReasoning consistently improves average accuracy by 1.5%-2.8% across
reasoning LLMs of different model families and scales. Furthermore, under
constrained budgets, SwiReasoning improves average token efficiency by 56%-79%,
with larger gains as budgets tighten.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SLM-MUX的三阶段方法，用于有效协调多个小型语言模型(SLMs)，通过模型选择搜索和测试时扩展策略，在多个基准测试中显著优于现有编排方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着语言模型快速发展，小型语言模型数量激增。虽然它们无法达到最先进精度，但更高效且擅长特定任务。需要探索能否将多个SLMs协调成系统，实现比单个模型更高的准确性。

Method: 三阶段方法：1) SLM-MUX多模型架构协调多个SLMs；2) 模型选择搜索从给定池中识别最具互补性的SLMs；3) 针对SLM-MUX的测试时扩展策略。

Result: 相比现有编排方法，在MATH上提升13.4%，GPQA上提升8.8%，GSM8K上提升7.0%。仅用两个SLMs，SLM-MUX在GPQA和GSM8K上超越Qwen 2.5 72B，在MATH上与之相当。

Conclusion: 证明通过所提方法，SLMs可以被有效编排成更准确和高效的系统，并提供理论分析支持该方法的优势。

Abstract: With the rapid development of language models, the number of small language
models (SLMs) has grown significantly. Although they do not achieve
state-of-the-art accuracy, they are more efficient and often excel at specific
tasks. This raises a natural question: can multiple SLMs be orchestrated into a
system where each contributes effectively, achieving higher accuracy than any
individual model? Existing orchestration methods have primarily targeted
frontier models (e.g., GPT-4) and perform suboptimally when applied to SLMs. To
address this gap, we propose a three-stage approach for orchestrating SLMs.
First, we introduce SLM-MUX, a multi-model architecture that effectively
coordinates multiple SLMs. Building on this, we develop two optimization
strategies: (i) a model selection search that identifies the most complementary
SLMs from a given pool, and (ii) test-time scaling tailored to SLM-MUX. Our
approach delivers strong results: Compared to existing orchestration methods,
our approach achieves up to 13.4% improvement on MATH, 8.8% on GPQA, and 7.0%
on GSM8K. With just two SLMS, SLM-MUX outperforms Qwen 2.5 72B on GPQA and
GSM8K, and matches its performance on MATH. We further provide theoretical
analyses to substantiate the advantages of our method. In summary, we
demonstrate that SLMs can be effectively orchestrated into more accurate and
efficient systems through the proposed approach.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决生成式AI在教育中受限于LLM教学能力不足的问题，特别是缺乏反映真实学生学习过程的高质量训练数据。

Method: 使用参数高效微调技术，基于10万小时真实师生一对一对话数据训练TeachLM，开发真实学生模型并生成合成对话。

Result: 微调后显著改善对话和教学表现：学生发言时间翻倍，提问风格改善，对话轮次增加50%，教学个性化程度更高。

Conclusion: 基于真实学习数据的微调能有效提升LLM的教学对话能力，提出的多轮评估协议为LLM对话能力提供了快速可扩展的评估方法。

Abstract: The promise of generative AI to revolutionize education is constrained by the
pedagogical limits of large language models (LLMs). A major issue is the lack
of access to high-quality training data that reflect the learning of actual
students. Prompt engineering has emerged as a stopgap, but the ability of
prompts to encode complex pedagogical strategies in rule-based natural language
is inherently limited. To address this gap we introduce TeachLM - an LLM
optimized for teaching through parameter-efficient fine-tuning of
state-of-the-art models. TeachLM is trained on a dataset comprised of 100,000
hours of one-on-one, longitudinal student-tutor interactions maintained by
Polygence, which underwent a rigorous anonymization process to protect privacy.
We use parameter-efficient fine-tuning to develop an authentic student model
that enables the generation of high-fidelity synthetic student-tutor dialogues.
Building on this capability, we propose a novel multi-turn evaluation protocol
that leverages synthetic dialogue generation to provide fast, scalable, and
reproducible assessments of the dialogical capabilities of LLMs. Our
evaluations demonstrate that fine-tuning on authentic learning data
significantly improves conversational and pedagogical performance - doubling
student talk time, improving questioning style, increasing dialogue turns by
50%, and greater personalization of instruction.

TL;DR: 提出了Tolerator解码策略，通过跨令牌验证和迭代优化来解决离散扩散大语言模型中令牌一旦接受就无法修改的问题，在相同计算预算下提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散大语言模型虽然具有并行解码和双向上下文建模的优势，但其标准解码策略存在关键限制：一旦令牌被接受就无法在后续步骤中修正，导致早期错误持续影响最终输出质量。

Method: Tolerator采用两阶段过程：序列填充和迭代优化。通过重新掩码和解码令牌子集，同时将剩余令牌作为上下文，使先前接受的令牌能够被重新考虑和修正。

Result: 在语言理解、代码生成和数学推理五个标准基准测试中，Tolerator在相同计算预算下相比基线方法实现了持续改进。

Conclusion: 解码算法对于充分发挥扩散大语言模型的潜力至关重要，Tolerator通过令牌级交叉验证优化提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) have recently emerged as a promising
alternative to autoregressive (AR) models, offering advantages such as
accelerated parallel decoding and bidirectional context modeling. However, the
vanilla decoding strategy in discrete dLLMs suffers from a critical limitation:
once a token is accepted, it can no longer be revised in subsequent steps. As a
result, early mistakes persist across iterations, harming both intermediate
predictions and final output quality. To address this issue, we propose
Tolerator (Token-Level Cross-Validation Refinement), a training-free decoding
strategy that leverages cross-validation among predicted tokens. Unlike
existing methods that follow a single progressive unmasking procedure,
Tolerator introduces a two-stage process: (i) sequence fill-up and (ii)
iterative refinement by remasking and decoding a subset of tokens while
treating the remaining as context. This design enables previously accepted
tokens to be reconsidered and corrected when necessary, leading to more
reliable diffusion decoding outputs. We evaluate Tolerator on five standard
benchmarks covering language understanding, code generation, and mathematics.
Experiments show that our method achieves consistent improvements over the
baselines under the same computational budget. These findings suggest that
decoding algorithms are crucial to realizing the full potential of diffusion
large language models. Code and data are publicly available.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于子查询模式学习的在线基数估计方法，通过哈希图结构随机访问局部回归器，在保持低开销的同时显著提升估计精度和查询执行效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数据库引擎使用启发式方法估计查询基数，但估计误差随查询复杂度增加而显著增长；学习型估计器虽精度更高但操作复杂，难以实际应用。

Method: 利用查询工作负载中高度重复的子查询模式，在线学习多个简单的局部回归器，每个回归器对应特定模式，通过子查询图结构的哈希值进行随机访问。

Result: 在IMDb数据集上模拟JOB-lite工作负载，执行时间加速7.5分钟（>30%），在线学习仅产生37秒开销，错误指标与最先进学习型方法相当。

Conclusion: 该方法在PostgreSQL中实现了显著的精度和运行时改进，相比传统方法大幅降低操作成本，提供了帕累托前沿上最实用高效的解决方案。

Abstract: DB engines produce efficient query execution plans by relying on cost models.
Practical implementations estimate cardinality of queries using heuristics,
with magic numbers tuned to improve average performance on benchmarks.
Empirically, estimation error significantly grows with query complexity.
Alternatively, learning-based estimators offer improved accuracy, but add
operational complexity preventing their adoption in-practice. Recognizing that
query workloads contain highly repetitive subquery patterns, we learn many
simple regressors online, each localized to a pattern. The regressor
corresponding to a pattern can be randomly-accessed using hash of graph
structure of the subquery. Our method has negligible overhead and competes with
SoTA learning-based approaches on error metrics. Further, amending PostgreSQL
with our method achieves notable accuracy and runtime improvements over
traditional methods and drastically reduces operational costs compared to other
learned cardinality estimators, thereby offering the most practical and
efficient solution on the Pareto frontier. Concretely, simulating JOB-lite
workload on IMDb speeds-up execution by 7.5 minutes (>30%) while incurring only
37 seconds overhead for online learning.

Conclusion: HAUSP-PG算法通过创新的双重剪枝策略和无排序上界计算方法，在高平均效用序列模式挖掘中实现了高效性能。

Abstract: In a quantitative sequential database, numerous efficient algorithms have
been developed for high-utility sequential pattern mining (HUSPM). HUSPM
establishes a relationship between frequency and significance in the real world
and reflects more crucial information than frequent pattern mining. However,
high average-utility sequential pattern mining (HAUSPM) is deemed fairer and
more valuable than HUSPM. It provides a reasonable measure for longer patterns
by considering their length. In contrast to scenarios in retail business
analysis, some pattern mining applications, such as cybersecurity or artificial
intelligence (AI), often involve much longer sequences. Consequently, pruning
strategies can exert a more pronounced impact on efficiency. This paper
proposes a novel algorithm named HAUSP-PG, which adopts two complementary
strategies to independently process pattern prefixes and remaining sequences,
thereby achieving a dual pruning effect. Additionally, the proposed method
calculates average utility upper bounds without requiring item sorting,
significantly reducing computational time and memory consumption compared to
alternative approaches. Through experiments conducted on both real-life and
synthetic datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed algorithm could achieve
satisfactory performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于Shannon型不等式和p-范数的基数估计方法存在估计过松的问题，需要更精确的上界估计来提高数据库查询性能。

Method: 在现有框架基础上，用"爪对(∋-∈)"计数替代原来的"爪(∈)"计数，构建ambidextrous边界，该方法在理论证明和实证中都优于旧方法。

Conclusion: ambidextrous边界方法在理论和实证上都优于现有方法，为数据库连接查询的基数估计提供了更紧的上界。

Abstract: In a large database system, upper-bounding the cardinality of a join query is
a crucial task called $\textit{pessimistic cardinality estimation}$. Recently,
Abo Khamis, Nakos, Olteanu, and Suciu unified related works into the following
dexterous framework. Step 1: Let $(X_1, \dotsc, X_n)$ be a random row of the
join, equating $H(X_1, \dotsc, X_n)$ to the log of the join cardinality. Step
2: Upper-bound $H(X_1, \dotsc, X_n)$ using Shannon-type inequalities such as
$H(X, Y, Z) \le H(X) + H(Y|X) + H(Z|Y)$. Step 3: Upper-bound $H(X_i) + p H(X_j
| X_i)$ using the $p$-norm of the degree sequence of the underlying graph of a
relation.
  While old bound in step 3 count "claws $\in$" in the underlying graph, we
proposed $\textit{ambidextrous}$ bounds that count "claw pairs
${\ni}\!{-}\!{\in}$". The new bounds are provably not looser and empirically
tighter: they overestimate by $x^{3/4}$ times when the old bounds overestimate
by $x$ times. An example is counting friend triples in the
$\texttt{com-Youtube}$ dataset, the best dexterous bound is $1.2 \cdot 10^9$,
the best ambidextrous bound is $5.1 \cdot 10^8$, and the actual cardinality is
$1.8 \cdot 10^7$.

Motivation: 现有基准测试在受控环境中评估LLM代理性能，但真实世界存在网络不稳定、HTTPS连接问题和网站攻击等挑战，需要评估代理在这些现实条件下的可靠性。

Method: 提出WAREX框架，在三个流行基准测试（WebArena、WebVoyager、REAL）中引入网络不稳定性和网站攻击等现实因素来评估代理性能。

Conclusion: WAREX揭示了当前LLM代理在真实网络环境中的脆弱性，强调了评估代理在现实条件下可靠性的重要性。

Abstract: Recent advances in browser-based LLM agents have shown promise for automating
tasks ranging from simple form filling to hotel booking or online shopping.
Current benchmarks measure agent performance in controlled environments, such
as containers or stable networks, where websites behave deterministically.
However, in the real world, users access websites over networks and HTTPS
connections that introduce instability from multiple sources: client-side,
server-side issues or broader system failures. Moreover, live websites are
prone to web attacks such Cross-Site Scripting, as well as general site
modifications which can cause unexpected or malicious pop-ups or improper
functionality. To address this gap, we present WAREX: Web Agent Reliability
Evaluation on Existing Benchmarks. We measure the impact of WAREX across three
popular benchmarks: WebArena, WebVoyager, and REAL. Our experiments show that
introducing WAREX leads to significant drops in task success rates,
highlighting the limited robustness of state-of-the-art agents.

Abstract: The scarcity of non-renewable energy sources, geopolitical problems in its
supply, increasing prices, and the impact of climate change, force the global
economy to develop more energy-efficient solutions for their operations. The
Manufacturing sector is not excluded from this challenge as one of the largest
consumers of energy. Energy-efficient scheduling is a method that attracts
manufacturing companies to reduce their consumption as it can be quickly
deployed and can show impact immediately. In this study, the hybrid flow shop
scheduling problem with blocking constraint (BHFS) is investigated in which we
seek to minimize the latest completion time (i.e. makespan) and overall energy
consumption, a typical manufacturing setting across many industries from
automotive to pharmaceutical. Energy consumption and the latest completion time
of customer orders are usually conflicting objectives. Therefore, we first
formulate the problem as a novel multi-objective mixed integer programming
(MIP) model and propose an augmented epsilon-constraint method for finding the
Pareto-optimal solutions. Also, an effective multi-objective metaheuristic
algorithm. Refined Iterated Pareto Greedy (RIPG), is developed to solve large
instances in reasonable time. Our proposed methods are benchmarked using small,
medium, and large-size instances to evaluate their efficiency. Two well-known
algorithms are adopted for comparing our novel approaches. The computational
results show the effectiveness of our method.

*Xiaoyan Bai,Aryan Shrivastava,Ari Holtzman,Chenhao Tan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文系统评估了10个当代大语言模型的自我识别能力，发现模型普遍存在自我识别失败问题，仅4个模型能正确识别自己的生成文本，且表现很少优于随机猜测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对AI系统是否具备自我识别能力这一存在争议的问题，建立系统评估框架来验证大语言模型的自我识别能力，这对AI安全和心理分析都很重要。

Method: 通过二元自我识别和精确模型预测两个任务，测量10个当代大语言模型识别自己生成文本与其他模型文本的能力。

Result: 模型自我识别表现一致失败，仅4/10模型能正确预测自己为生成者，性能很少优于随机机会。模型还表现出强烈偏向预测GPT和Claude家族的偏见。

Conclusion: 研究结果对AI安全具有重要意义，需要开发适当的AI自我意识，模型虽然对自身和其他模型存在有一定认知，但推理过程显示出层级偏见。

Abstract: Self-recognition is a crucial metacognitive capability for AI systems,
relevant not only for psychological analysis but also for safety, particularly
in evaluative scenarios. Motivated by contradictory interpretations of whether
models possess self-recognition (Panickssery et al., 2024; Davidson et al.,
2024), we introduce a systematic evaluation framework that can be easily
applied and updated. Specifically, we measure how well 10 contemporary larger
language models (LLMs) can identify their own generated text versus text from
other models through two tasks: binary self-recognition and exact model
prediction. Different from prior claims, our results reveal a consistent
failure in self-recognition. Only 4 out of 10 models predict themselves as
generators, and the performance is rarely above random chance. Additionally,
models exhibit a strong bias toward predicting GPT and Claude families. We also
provide the first evaluation of model awareness of their own and others'
existence, as well as the reasoning behind their choices in self-recognition.
We find that the model demonstrates some knowledge of its own existence and
other models, but their reasoning reveals a hierarchical bias. They appear to
assume that GPT, Claude, and occasionally Gemini are the top-tier models, often
associating high-quality text with them. We conclude by discussing the
implications of our findings on AI safety and future directions to develop
appropriate AI self-awareness.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出ContraGen基准框架，专门针对企业领域生成包含矛盾内容的合成文档，用于系统评估文档内和跨文档的一致性，旨在提高企业环境中RAG系统的可信度和问责性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有矛盾检测基准仅限于句子级分析，无法捕捉企业文档（如合同、财务文件、合规报告）的复杂性，而RAG系统中检索证据的矛盾会导致不一致或不可信输出，这在企业环境中特别危险。

Method: 通过自动矛盾挖掘结合人工验证生成合成企业风格文档，建立企业流程中常见矛盾类型的分类法，支持受控创建自矛盾和成对矛盾，开发矛盾感知检索评估流程并嵌入人工监督。

Result: 构建了专门针对企业领域的矛盾感知基准框架，能够系统评估文档一致性，为更可信的RAG系统奠定基础。

Conclusion: 这项工作为企业信息检索应用中更可信和可问责的RAG系统建立了基础，其中检测和解决矛盾对于降低风险和确保合规性至关重要。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) integrates LLMs with external sources,
offering advanced capabilities for information access and decision-making.
However, contradictions in retrieved evidence can result in inconsistent or
untrustworthy outputs, which is especially problematic in enterprise settings
where compliance, governance, and accountability are critical. Existing
benchmarks for contradiction detection are limited to sentence-level analysis
and do not capture the complexity of enterprise documents such as contracts,
financial filings, compliance reports, or policy manuals. To address this
limitation, we propose ContraGen, a contradiction-aware benchmark framework
tailored to enterprise domain. The framework generates synthetic
enterprise-style documents with embedded contradictions, enabling systematic
evaluation of both intra-document and cross-document consistency. Automated
contradiction mining is combined with human-in-the-loop validation to ensure
high accuracy. Our contributions include generating realistic enterprise
documents, modeling a taxonomy of contradiction types common in business
processes, enabling controlled creation of self- and pairwise contradictions,
developing a contradiction-aware retrieval evaluation pipeline and embedding
human oversight to reflect domain-specific judgment complexity. This work
establishes a foundation for more trustworthy and accountable RAG systems in
enterprise information-seeking applications, where detecting and resolving
contradictions is essential for reducing risk and ensuring compliance.

Motivation: 认知架构和生成神经架构的理论评估都面临挑战，需要一种更全面的评估方法来比较这些完整系统。

Method: 采用广泛的视角进行理论评估，对面向整体思维的认知架构和生成架构及其完整系统进行定性比较。

Result: 提出了一种宽泛但定性的比较框架，能够涵盖认知架构和生成神经架构的完整系统评估。

Conclusion: 通过整体视角的理论评估方法，可以有效应对认知架构和生成神经架构理论评估的双重挑战。

Abstract: Evaluation is a critical activity associated with any theory. Yet this has
proven to be an exceptionally challenging activity for theories based on
cognitive architectures. For an overlapping set of reasons, evaluation can also
be challenging for theories based on generative neural architectures. This dual
challenge is approached here by leveraging a broad perspective on theory
evaluation to yield a wide-ranging, albeit qualitative, comparison of
whole-mind-oriented cognitive and generative architectures and the full systems
that are based on these architectures.

TL;DR: 提出了一种评估自然语言计划与预期行为对齐的新框架，通过LLM将计划转换为Kripke结构和LTL公式，并进行模型检测。


<details>

Motivation: 需要系统评估自然语言计划与预期行为的一致性，确保计划执行的正确性和可靠性。

Method: 使用大型语言模型将自然语言计划转换为Kripke结构和线性时序逻辑公式，然后在PlanBench数据集上进行模型检测验证。

Result: GPT-5在分类任务上表现优异（F1得分96.3%），几乎总能生成语法完美的形式化表示，可作为保证。

Conclusion: 框架在语法层面表现优秀，但语义完美形式化模型的合成仍需进一步研究。

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for evaluating the alignment between natural
language plans and their expected behavior by converting them into Kripke
structures and Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) using Large Language Models (LLMs)
and performing model checking. We systematically evaluate this framework on a
simplified version of the PlanBench plan verification dataset and report on
metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall and F1 scores. Our experiments
demonstrate that GPT-5 achieves excellent classification performance (F1 score
of 96.3%) while almost always producing syntactically perfect formal
representations that can act as guarantees. However, the synthesis of
semantically perfect formal models remains an area for future exploration.

TL;DR: 提出了PolicyGuardBench基准数据集和PolicyGuard-4B模型，用于检测网络代理轨迹中的策略违规行为，支持跨领域泛化和小规模高效推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自主网络代理需要在外部策略约束下生成长期轨迹，但现有研究很少关注这些轨迹是否遵守策略，以及策略违规在不同上下文（如不同领域和子领域）中的持续性。

Method: 从多样化的代理运行中生成广泛策略集，创建包含违规标签的子域内和跨子域配对。包含完整轨迹评估和基于前缀的违规检测任务。训练了轻量级的PolicyGuard-4B护栏模型。

Result: PolicyGuard-4B在所有任务上提供强大的检测准确性，同时保持推理效率。该模型能够跨领域泛化，在未见过的设置上保持高准确率。

Conclusion: PolicyGuardBench和PolicyGuard-4B为研究网络代理轨迹的策略合规性提供了首个综合框架，证明在小规模下实现准确且可泛化的护栏是可行的。

Abstract: Autonomous web agents need to operate under externally imposed or
human-specified policies while generating long-horizon trajectories. However,
little work has examined whether these trajectories comply with such policies,
or whether policy violations persist across different contexts such as domains
(e.g., shopping or coding websites) and subdomains (e.g., product search and
order management in shopping). To address this gap, we introduce
PolicyGuardBench, a benchmark of about 60k examples for detecting policy
violations in agent trajectories. From diverse agent runs, we generate a broad
set of policies and create both within subdomain and cross subdomain pairings
with violation labels. In addition to full-trajectory evaluation,
PolicyGuardBench also includes a prefix-based violation detection task where
models must anticipate policy violations from truncated trajectory prefixes
rather than complete sequences. Using this dataset, we train PolicyGuard-4B, a
lightweight guardrail model that delivers strong detection accuracy across all
tasks while keeping inference efficient. Notably, PolicyGuard-4B generalizes
across domains and preserves high accuracy on unseen settings. Together,
PolicyGuardBench and PolicyGuard-4B provide the first comprehensive framework
for studying policy compliance in web agent trajectories, and show that
accurate and generalizable guardrails are feasible at small scales.

TL;DR: OneFlow是首个非自回归多模态模型，支持可变长度和并发的混合模态生成，通过插入式编辑流和流匹配技术实现文本图像的并发合成，在生成和理解任务上优于自回归基线，训练计算量减少50%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自回归模型在文本和图像生成中强制因果顺序的限制，实现更灵活的并发多模态生成。

Method: 结合插入式编辑流处理离散文本标记和流匹配处理图像潜在表示，采用分层采样优先内容而非语法。

Result: 在1B到8B模型规模上，OneFlow在生成和理解任务上均优于自回归基线，训练FLOPs减少50%，超越自回归和基于扩散的方法。

Conclusion: OneFlow解锁了并发生成、迭代优化和类自然推理生成等新能力，为非自回归多模态生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We present OneFlow, the first non-autoregressive multimodal model that
enables variable-length and concurrent mixed-modal generation. Unlike
autoregressive models that enforce rigid causal ordering between text and image
generation, OneFlow combines an insertion-based Edit Flow for discrete text
tokens with Flow Matching for image latents. OneFlow enables concurrent
text-image synthesis with hierarchical sampling that prioritizes content over
grammar. Through controlled experiments across model sizes from 1B to 8B, we
demonstrate that OneFlow outperforms autoregressive baselines on both
generation and understanding tasks while using up to 50% fewer training FLOPs.
OneFlow surpasses both autoregressive and diffusion-based approaches while
unlocking new capabilities for concurrent generation, iterative refinement, and
natural reasoning-like generation.

*Adel Javanmard,Baharan Mirzasoleiman,Vahab Mirrokni*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 测试时扩展通过生成更长的思维链来提升大语言模型的推理能力，但长思维链何时出现以及何时有效仍不明确。本文通过线性回归的上下文权重预测任务，从理论上解释了测试时扩展的几个关键现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究测试时扩展（test-time scaling）在什么条件下有效，特别是长思维链何时能提升模型性能，以及训练数据特征如何影响这种扩展效果。

Method: 使用线性回归的上下文权重预测任务训练transformer模型，通过理论分析和实验验证来研究测试时扩展的效果。

Result: 发现：1）固定测试误差时，增加测试时计算可减少训练提示中的上下文示例数量；2）如果训练数据缺乏解决下游任务所需的技能，增加测试时计算反而会损害性能；3）任务难度可通过特征协方差矩阵的最小特征值来表征。

Conclusion: 在多样化、相关且困难的任务集上训练，能获得最佳的测试时扩展性能。这一发现在大型非线性transformer架构的实验中得到了验证。

Abstract: Test-time scaling improves the reasoning capabilities of large language
models (LLMs) by allocating extra compute to generate longer Chains-of-Thoughts
(CoTs). This enables models to tackle more complex problem by breaking them
down into additional steps, backtracking, and correcting mistakes. Despite its
strong performance--demonstrated by OpenAI's o1 and DeepSeek R1, the conditions
in the training data under which long CoTs emerge, and when such long CoTs
improve the performance, remain unclear. In this paper, we study the
performance of test-time scaling for transformers trained on an in-context
weight prediction task for linear regression. Our analysis provides a
theoretical explanation for several intriguing observations: First, at any
fixed test error, increasing test-time compute allows us to reduce the number
of in-context examples (context length) in training prompts. Second, if the
skills required to solve a downstream task are not sufficiently present in the
training data, increasing test-time compute can harm performance. Finally, we
characterize task hardness via the smallest eigenvalue of its feature
covariance matrix and show that training on a diverse, relevant, and hard set
of tasks results in best performance for test-time scaling. We confirm our
findings with experiments on large, nonlinear transformer architectures.

TL;DR: 本文提出跨模态偏好引导(CPS)攻击方法，通过联合优化视觉和文本通道的不可察觉修改，在现实黑盒威胁设置下有效操纵基于视觉语言模型的网络代理选择决策。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究要么假设强白盒访问，要么使用不切实际的设置，缺乏在现实攻击者能力下对视觉和文本通道的联合利用。

Method: CPS方法联合优化物品视觉和自然语言描述的不可察觉修改，利用CLIP可迁移图像扰动和RLHF诱导的语言偏见来引导代理决策。

Result: 在GPT-4.1、Qwen-2.5VL和Pixtral-Large等最先进VLM上的评估显示，CPS在所有模型上始终优于基线方法，同时保持70%更低的检测率。

Conclusion: 这些发现凸显了随着智能系统在社会中扮演越来越重要的角色，迫切需要开发鲁棒的防御机制。

Abstract: Vision-language model (VLM)-based web agents increasingly power high-stakes
selection tasks like content recommendation or product ranking by combining
multimodal perception with preference reasoning. Recent studies reveal that
these agents are vulnerable against attackers who can bias selection outcomes
through preference manipulations using adversarial pop-ups, image
perturbations, or content tweaks. Existing work, however, either assumes strong
white-box access, with limited single-modal perturbations, or uses impractical
settings. In this paper, we demonstrate, for the first time, that joint
exploitation of visual and textual channels yields significantly more powerful
preference manipulations under realistic attacker capabilities. We introduce
Cross-Modal Preference Steering (CPS) that jointly optimizes imperceptible
modifications to an item's visual and natural language descriptions, exploiting
CLIP-transferable image perturbations and RLHF-induced linguistic biases to
steer agent decisions. In contrast to prior studies that assume gradient
access, or control over webpages, or agent memory, we adopt a realistic
black-box threat setup: a non-privileged adversary can edit only their own
listing's images and textual metadata, with no insight into the agent's model
internals. We evaluate CPS on agents powered by state-of-the-art proprietary
and open source VLMs including GPT-4.1, Qwen-2.5VL and Pixtral-Large on both
movie selection and e-commerce tasks. Our results show that CPS is
significantly more effective than leading baseline methods. For instance, our
results show that CPS consistently outperforms baselines across all models
while maintaining 70% lower detection rates, demonstrating both effectiveness
and stealth. These findings highlight an urgent need for robust defenses as
agentic systems play an increasingly consequential role in society.

TL;DR: 提出了基于互信息的树搜索框架MITS，通过点互信息评分函数和熵基动态采样策略，在保持计算效率的同时提升大语言模型的推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有树搜索方法难以对中间推理步骤进行即时可靠的定量评估，且广泛路径探索计算成本高昂。

Method: 使用点互信息作为评分函数进行步骤评估和束搜索，结合熵基动态采样策略自适应分配计算资源，采用加权投票方案进行最终预测。

Result: 在多样化推理基准测试中，MITS始终超越基线方法。

Conclusion: MITS为LLM推理建立了一个原则性且高效的框架。

Abstract: Tree search has become as a representative framework for test-time reasoning
with large language models (LLMs), exemplified by methods such as
Tree-of-Thought and Monte Carlo Tree Search that explore multiple reasoning
paths. However, it remains difficult to provide instant and reliable
quantitative assessments of intermediate reasoning step quality, and extensive
path exploration is computationally costly. To address this, we propose Mutual
Information Tree Search (MITS), a novel framework that guides reasoning with
information-theoretic principles. MITS introduces an effective scoring function
based on pointwise mutual information (PMI), which enables step-wise evaluation
of reasoning paths and search tree expansion via beam search without expensive
look-ahead simulations, achieving superior reasoning performances while
maintaining computational efficiency. The framework is complemented by an
entropy-based dynamic sampling strategy that adaptively allocates computational
resources to uncertain reasoning steps where exploration is most beneficial.
For final prediction, MITS employs a weighted voting scheme that combines PMI
scores with prediction consensus. Through comprehensive experiments on diverse
reasoning benchmarks, MITS consistently surpasses baseline methods,
establishing a principled and efficient framework for LLM reasoning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 扩散大语言模型(dLLMs)存在"<eos>溢出"问题：随着序列长度增加，响应反而变短，过早终止或退化为<eos>令牌流。作者提出Rainbow Padding方法，用循环的不同填充令牌替换重复<eos>，有效解决了这一问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 指令调优的扩散大语言模型存在一个关键漏洞：<eos>令牌同时承担终止和填充的双重角色，导致在较长序列中概率质量集中在<eos>上，引发过早终止问题。

Method: 提出Rainbow Padding方法，用循环的不同填充令牌替换重复的<eos>占位符，分散概率质量，打破<eos>的主导地位。

Result: Rainbow Padding显著提高了长度鲁棒性和输出质量，仅需7个填充令牌即可防止过早终止。通过LoRA微调单轮少量数据即可实现显著改进。

Conclusion: Rainbow Padding是一种简单高效的解决方案，能有效解决dLLMs中的<eos>溢出问题，且易于集成到现有指令调优模型中。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) have emerged as a promising
alternative to autoregressive models, offering flexible generation orders and
strong performance on complex reasoning tasks. However, instruction-tuned dLLMs
exhibit a critical vulnerability we term \texttt{<eos>} overflow: as allocated
sequence length increases, responses paradoxically become shorter, collapsing
into early termination or degenerating into streams of \texttt{<eos>} tokens.
Although noticed in practice, this issue has not been systematically analyzed.
We trace its root cause to the dual role of \texttt{<eos>} as both termination
and padding, which concentrates probability mass on \texttt{<eos>} at later
positions and propagates backward to trigger early termination. To address
this, we introduce Rainbow Padding, a simple remedy that replaces repeated
\texttt{<eos>} placeholders with a repeating cycle of distinct padding tokens,
distributing probability mass and breaking \texttt{<eos>} dominance.
Experiments show that Rainbow Padding substantially improves length robustness
and output quality, with as few as seven padding tokens sufficient to prevent
early termination. Moreover, the method integrates efficiently into existing
instruction-tuned models: LoRA fine-tuning for a single epoch on minimal data
yields significant improvements, making this solution highly practical. The
code is publicly available at https://github.com/quasar529/rainbow-padding.

Motivation: 现有方法多在轮次层面评估聊天机器人交互，无法判断用户总体目标是否达成，需要更全面的目标导向评估框架。

Method: 基于用户目标分割对话，使用教师LLM结合领域专家定义的目标和质量标准进行评估，通过"思考标记"产生可解释的推理过程。

Result: 在企业环境中应用该框架评估AIDA系统，观察到目标成功率从63%提升到79%。

Conclusion: 该框架具有通用性，通过详细的缺陷分类提供可操作的见解，能够诊断整体成功率、识别关键失败模式并指导系统改进。

Abstract: Evaluating the quality of multi-turn chatbot interactions remains
challenging, as most existing methods assess interactions at the turn level
without addressing whether a user's overarching goal was fulfilled. A ``goal''
here refers to an information need or task, such as asking for policy
information or applying for leave. We propose a comprehensive framework for
goal-oriented evaluation of multi-agent systems (MAS), introducing the
\textbf{Goal Success Rate (GSR)} to measure the percentage of fulfilled goals,
and a \textbf{Root Cause of Failure (RCOF)} taxonomy to identify reasons for
failure in multi-agent chatbots. Our method segments conversations by user
goals and evaluates success using all relevant turns. We present a model-based
evaluation system combining teacher LLMs, where domain experts define goals,
set quality standards serving as a guidance for the LLMs. The LLMs use
``thinking tokens'' to produce interpretable rationales, enabling
\textit{explainable}, \textit{data-efficient} evaluations. In an enterprise
setting, we apply our framework to evaluate AIDA, a zero-to-one employee
conversational agent system built as a ground-up multi-agent conversational
agent, and observe GSR improvement from 63\% to 79\% over six months since its
inception. Our framework is generic and offers actionable insights through a
detailed defect taxonomy based on analysis of failure points in multi-agent
chatbots, diagnosing overall success, identifying key failure modes, and
informing system improvements.

TL;DR: 提出H-DDx分层评估框架，用于更准确地评估大语言模型在临床鉴别诊断中的表现，克服传统平面指标的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在鉴别诊断评估中主要依赖Top-k准确率等平面指标，无法区分临床相关的近似错误和诊断上遥远的错误，需要更符合临床相关性的评估方法。

Method: 引入H-DDx框架，通过检索和重排序流程将自由文本诊断映射到ICD-10代码，并应用分层度量来奖励与真实诊断密切相关的预测。

Result: 在22个领先模型的基准测试中，传统平面指标低估了性能，忽略了临床有意义的输出；领域专业化开源模型表现突出；框架增强了可解释性，显示LLM即使错过精确诊断也能正确识别更广泛的临床背景。

Conclusion: H-DDx框架提供了更准确、临床相关的LLM鉴别诊断评估方法，揭示了传统指标忽略的性能优势，为医疗AI应用提供了更好的评估工具。

Abstract: An accurate differential diagnosis (DDx) is essential for patient care,
shaping therapeutic decisions and influencing outcomes. Recently, Large
Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as promising tools to support this process
by generating a DDx list from patient narratives. However, existing evaluations
of LLMs in this domain primarily rely on flat metrics, such as Top-k accuracy,
which fail to distinguish between clinically relevant near-misses and
diagnostically distant errors. To mitigate this limitation, we introduce H-DDx,
a hierarchical evaluation framework that better reflects clinical relevance.
H-DDx leverages a retrieval and reranking pipeline to map free-text diagnoses
to ICD-10 codes and applies a hierarchical metric that credits predictions
closely related to the ground-truth diagnosis. In benchmarking 22 leading
models, we show that conventional flat metrics underestimate performance by
overlooking clinically meaningful outputs, with our results highlighting the
strengths of domain-specialized open-source models. Furthermore, our framework
enhances interpretability by revealing hierarchical error patterns,
demonstrating that LLMs often correctly identify the broader clinical context
even when the precise diagnosis is missed.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类通过多感官整合理解世界，但现有的多模态基础模型缺乏作为世界模型的关键能力，如反事实推理、动态模拟、时空信息理解和可控生成等。

Method: 通过判别性任务增强推理能力，引入结构化推理技能（因果推断、反事实思维、时空推理）；开发结构化可控生成框架，使用场景图、多模态条件约束和对齐策略；扩展到可控4D生成。

Result: 提升了多模态基础模型的推理深度，使其超越表面相关性；实现了与高层语义和细粒度用户意图一致的生成；支持交互式、可编辑的时空对象合成。

Conclusion: 通过增强推理和生成能力，多模态基础模型可以更好地模拟和理解物理世界，向真正的世界模型迈进。

Abstract: Humans understand the world through the integration of multiple sensory
modalities, enabling them to perceive, reason about, and imagine dynamic
physical processes. Inspired by this capability, multimodal foundation models
(MFMs) have emerged as powerful tools for multimodal understanding and
generation. However, today's MFMs fall short of serving as effective world
models. They lack the essential ability such as perform counterfactual
reasoning, simulate dynamics, understand the spatiotemporal information,
control generated visual outcomes, and perform multifaceted reasoning. We
investigates what it takes to bridge the gap between multimodal foundation
models and world models. We begin by improving the reasoning capabilities of
MFMs through discriminative tasks and equipping MFMs with structured reasoning
skills, such as causal inference, counterfactual thinking, and spatiotemporal
reasoning, enabling them to go beyond surface correlations and understand
deeper relationships within visual and textual data. Next, we explore
generative capabilities of multimodal foundation models across both image and
video modalities, introducing new frameworks for structured and controllable
generation. Our approaches incorporate scene graphs, multimodal conditioning,
and multimodal alignment strategies to guide the generation process, ensuring
consistency with high-level semantics and fine-grained user intent. We further
extend these techniques to controllable 4D generation, enabling interactive,
editable, and morphable object synthesis over time and space.

<details>

Motivation: LLM在主观任务评估中面临挑战，特别是在电商查询重写这类缺乏单一正确答案的问题上，需要更可靠的评估方法

Method: 结合多智能体模拟和遗传算法，使用多个LLM智能体模拟购物顾客作为动态奖励信号，通过进化算法迭代优化用户查询

Result: 在1000个真实电商查询的五个类别上测试，相比原始查询平均提升21.98%，相比Best-of-N LLM重写基线提升3.36%

Conclusion: OptAgent框架能有效解决主观任务的评估挑战，为电商查询重写提供了可靠的优化方案

Abstract: Deploying capable and user-aligned LLM-based systems necessitates reliable
evaluation. While LLMs excel in verifiable tasks like coding and mathematics,
where gold-standard solutions are available, adoption remains challenging for
subjective tasks that lack a single correct answer. E-commerce Query Rewriting
(QR) is one such problem where determining whether a rewritten query properly
captures the user intent is extremely difficult to figure out algorithmically.
In this work, we introduce OptAgent, a novel framework that combines
multi-agent simulations with genetic algorithms to verify and optimize queries
for QR. Instead of relying on a static reward model or a single LLM judge, our
approach uses multiple LLM-based agents, each acting as a simulated shopping
customer, as a dynamic reward signal. The average of these agent-derived scores
serves as an effective fitness function for an evolutionary algorithm that
iteratively refines the user's initial query. We evaluate OptAgent on a dataset
of 1000 real-world e-commerce queries in five different categories, and we
observe an average improvement of 21.98% over the original user query and 3.36%

### [301] [GuidedSampling: Steering LLMs Towards Diverse Candidate Solutions at Inference-Time](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03777)
*Divij Handa,Mihir Parmar,Aswin RRV,Md Nayem Uddin,Hamid Palangi,Chitta Baral*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的推理算法GuidedSampling，通过将探索和生成阶段解耦来增加解决方案候选的多样性，相比传统重复采样方法在多个基准测试中显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统重复采样(RS)方法在推理时虽然能提升模型性能，但经常生成冗余样本，缺乏多样性，因为总是依赖相同的基础方法解决问题。

Method: GuidedSampling算法将推理过程分为探索阶段和生成阶段：探索阶段识别多个可用于解决问题的概念，生成阶段应用特定概念提供最终解决方案候选。

Result: 在pass@50指标上平均提升21.6%，使用GuidedSampling训练的模型在pass@5上平均提升9.7%，每个实例的平均概念数量从1.67增加到3.03。

Conclusion: GuidedSampling通过解耦探索和生成阶段，有效提高了解决方案的多样性，显著优于传统重复采样方法，并且训练出的模型能产生更多样化的候选解。

Abstract: Repeated Sampling (RS) is a simple inference-time algorithm that has been
shown to improve model performance on complex tasks. Although it is an
effective way of scaling inference time, it often struggles to generate diverse
solution candidates, frequently relying on the same underlying approach to
solve the problem and thus producing redundant samples. To address this
limitation, we propose a new inference algorithm, GuidedSampling, which
decouples the exploration and generation phases during inference, increasing
diversity of generated candidate solutions. The exploration phase identifies
multiple concepts that can be utilized to solve the problem, while the
generation phase applies a specific concept to provide final solution
candidates. We first define the theoretical bounds of GuidedSampling and then
empirically demonstrate that it improves the performance of base model at
pass@50 by on an average ~21.6% across various benchmarks compared to RS.
Furthermore, models trained on trajectories of GuidedSampling exhibit
substantial performance improvements at pass@5 by on an average ~9.7%, compared
to models trained on traditional RS. Additionally, models trained with
GuidedSampling increases the average number of concepts per instance (1.67 ->
3.03), yielding a diverse set of candidates than traditional RS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受AI对齐和语言游戏挑战的启发，研究当玩家存在未知策略子集持续产生更高奖励时的隐藏游戏问题，探索能否设计高效算法来发现和利用这种结构。

Method: 开发了一种遗憾最小化技术的组合方法，实现了最优的外部遗憾和交换遗憾界限，利用隐藏游戏结构提高计算效率。

Result: 所提出的方法能够确保在隐藏子游戏中快速收敛到相关均衡，同时保持一般情况下的理性。

Conclusion: 肯定地回答了中心问题，证明了可以设计高效算法来发现和利用隐藏游戏结构，实现隐藏子游戏中的均衡收敛。

Abstract: This paper investigates a class of games with large strategy spaces,
motivated by challenges in AI alignment and language games. We introduce the
hidden game problem, where for each player, an unknown subset of strategies
consistently yields higher rewards compared to the rest. The central question
is whether efficient regret minimization algorithms can be designed to discover
and exploit such hidden structures, leading to equilibrium in these subgames
while maintaining rationality in general. We answer this question affirmatively
by developing a composition of regret minimization techniques that achieve
optimal external and swap regret bounds. Our approach ensures rapid convergence
to correlated equilibria in hidden subgames, leveraging the hidden game
structure for improved computational efficiency.

### [303] [Small Language Models for Agentic Systems: A Survey of Architectures, Capabilities, and Deployment Trade offs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03847)
*Raghav Sharma,Manan Mehta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 小语言模型（SLMs）在代理工作负载中比大语言模型更高效，通过引导解码、严格JSON Schema输出和验证器优先的工具执行，能以10-100倍更低成本实现相似或更好的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究发现在代理工作负载中，小语言模型在成本、延迟和能耗方面优于大语言模型，特别是在模式化和API约束的任务中。

Method: 采用引导解码、严格JSON Schema输出、验证器优先工具执行，以及SLM默认+LLM回退系统，结合不确定性感知路由和验证器级联。

Result: SLMs在工具使用、函数调用和RAG方面能够匹配或超越LLMs，成本降低10-100倍，延迟和能耗显著改善。

Conclusion: 提供了一个实用的蓝图，构建快速、廉价且可靠的代理系统，默认使用SLMs，同时保留LLMs作为回退选项。

Abstract: Small language models (SLMs; 1-12B params, sometimes up to 20B) are
sufficient and often superior for agentic workloads where the objective is
schema- and API-constrained accuracy rather than open-ended generation. We
synthesize recent evidence across open and proprietary SLMs (Phi-4-Mini,
Qwen-2.5-7B, Gemma-2-9B, Llama-3.2-1B/3B, Ministral-3B/8B, Apple on-device 3B,
DeepSeek-R1-Distill) and connect it to modern evaluations (BFCL v3/v4,
StableToolBench) and serving stacks (vLLM, SGLang, TensorRT-LLM) paired with
guided decoding libraries (XGrammar, Outlines). We formalize SLM-default,
LLM-fallback systems with uncertainty-aware routing and verifier cascades, and
propose engineering metrics that reflect real production goals: cost per
successful task (CPS), schema validity rate, executable call rate, p50/p95
latency, and energy per request. Guided decoding, strict JSON Schema outputs,
and validator-first tool execution close much of the capability gap with larger
models and often let SLMs match or surpass LLMs on tool use, function calling,
and RAG at 10x-100x lower token cost with materially better latency and energy.
We provide design patterns for agent stacks that prioritize SLMs: schema-first
prompting, type-safe function registries, confidence scoring with verifier
rollups, and lightweight adaptation via LoRA/QLoRA. We also delineate limits
where fallback remains valuable (open-domain reasoning and some long-horizon
planning). The result is a practical blueprint for building fast, inexpensive,
and reliable agents that default to SLMs while preserving headroom with
targeted LLM assistance.
  Keywords: small language models, agents, function calling, structured
outputs, JSON Schema, guided decoding, LoRA/QLoRA, routing, energy efficiency,

*Ruiying Ma,Chieh-Jan Mike Liang,Yanjie Gao,Francis Y. Yan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MetaMuse框架通过三个自反思原则解决LLM在算法生成中的创造性不足问题，在缓存替换和在线装箱问题上显著提升性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 系统算法设计面临解空间不连续的挑战，现有方法依赖通用启发式算法而牺牲性能。研究发现LLM在算法生成中存在偏向知名通用设计的偏见，缺乏创造性突破

Method: 提出MetaMuse框架，基于三个自反思原则：(1)在可测量的性能空间而非抽象思想空间量化解决方案多样性和有用性；(2)通过外部刺激而非内部随机性引导构思；(3)使用路径点推理而非自由形式的思维链构建可执行解决方案

Result: 在缓存替换问题上减少缓存未命中达35.76%，在在线装箱问题上减少容器使用达30.93%

Conclusion: MetaMuse能够为全球云提供商的关键问题生成高性能解决方案，证明其在实际算法设计中的有效性

Abstract: Designing system algorithms remains challenging, where the discontinuous
nature of the solution space often forces system engineers to rely on generic
heuristics at the expense of performance. We study whether LLMs can practically
drive algorithm generation, and find that they are biased towards well-known
generic designs, rather than making the creative leaps needed to navigate the
discontinuous solution space. To address this limitation, we introduce
MetaMuse, a framework for creative ideation built on three self-reflection
principles: (1) quantifying solution diversity and usefulness in measurable
performance space, rather than abstract idea space, (2) steering ideation
through external stimuli, rather than internal randomness, and (3) constructing
executable solutions using waypoint reasoning, rather than free-form
chain-of-thought. Extensive evaluation shows that MetaMuse can generate
high-performing solutions for two critical problems at a global cloud provider:
cache replacement (reducing cache misses by up to 35.76%) and online bin
packing (reducing bin usage by up to 30.93%).

### [305] [Adaptive and Explainable AI Agents for Anomaly Detection in Critical IoT Infrastructure using LLM-Enhanced Contextual Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03859)
*Raghav Sharma,Manan Mehta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于LLM和XAI代理的智能异常检测方法，用于关键IoT系统，在动态高维环境中显著提升检测准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统异常检测方法在复杂IoT系统（如智能医疗、能源电网）中面临动态高维数据、不完整数据和持续演变的挑战，需要自适应智能系统。

Method: 结合LLM支持的上下文推理方法和XAI代理，使用注意力机制、跳过时间步细节、语义记忆缓冲来发现隐藏模式和数据不一致性。

Result: 在智能电网和医疗场景的模拟测试中，新方法在检测准确性、误报率、可读性和响应速度方面显著优于传统模型。

Conclusion: LLM增强的异常检测方法在准确性和可解释性方面表现优异，适合未来IoT异常检测任务。

Abstract: Ensuring that critical IoT systems function safely and smoothly depends a lot
on finding anomalies quickly. As more complex systems, like smart healthcare,
energy grids and industrial automation, appear, it is easier to see the
shortcomings of older methods of detection. Monitoring failures usually happen
in dynamic, high dimensional situations, especially when data is incomplete,
messy or always evolving. Such limits point out the requirement for adaptive,
intelligent systems that always improve and think. LLMs are now capable of
significantly changing how context is understood and semantic inference is done
across all types of data. This proposal suggests using an LLM supported
contextual reasoning method along with XAI agents to improve how anomalies are
found in significant IoT environments. To discover hidden patterns and notice
inconsistencies in data streams, it uses attention methods, avoids dealing with
details from every time step and uses memory buffers with meaning. Because no
code AI stresses transparency and interpretability, people can check and accept
the AI's decisions, helping ensure AI follows company policies. The two
architectures are put together in a test that compares the results of the
traditional model with those of the suggested LLM enhanced model. Important
measures to check are the accuracy of detection, how much inaccurate
information is included in the results, how clearly the findings can be read
and how fast the system responds under different test situations. The
metaheuristic is tested in simulations of real world smart grid and healthcare
contexts to check its adaptability and reliability. From the study, we see that
the new approach performs much better than most existing models in both
accuracy and interpretation, so it could be a good fit for future anomaly
detection tasks in IoT

### [306] [Spatial CAPTCHA: Generatively Benchmarking Spatial Reasoning for Human-Machine Differentiation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03863)
*Arina Kharlamova,Bowei He,Chen Ma,Xue Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Spatial CAPTCHA的新型人机验证框架，利用人类与多模态大语言模型在空间推理能力上的根本差异来防御自动化攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CAPTCHA依赖文本识别或2D图像理解，但多模态大语言模型的进步已削弱其有效性，需要开发基于空间推理的新验证方法。

Method: 通过程序化生成动态问题，要求几何推理、视角转换、遮挡处理和心理旋转等技能，结合基于约束的难度控制、自动正确性验证和人工验证循环。

Result: 在Spatial-CAPTCHA-Bench基准测试中，人类表现远超10个最先进的多模态大语言模型，最佳模型仅达到31.0%的Pass@1准确率，且优于Google reCAPTCHA。

Conclusion: Spatial CAPTCHA不仅作为有效的安全机制，还能作为AI空间推理能力的诊断工具，展示了人类在空间认知方面的独特优势。

Abstract: Online services rely on CAPTCHAs as a first line of defense against automated
abuse, yet recent advances in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have
eroded the effectiveness of conventional designs that focus on text recognition
or 2D image understanding. To address this challenge, we present Spatial
CAPTCHA, a novel human-verification framework that leverages fundamental
differences in spatial reasoning between humans and MLLMs. Unlike existing
CAPTCHAs which rely on low-level perception tasks that are vulnerable to modern
AI, Spatial CAPTCHA generates dynamic questions requiring geometric reasoning,
perspective-taking, occlusion handling, and mental rotation. These skills are
intuitive for humans but difficult for state-of-the-art (SOTA) AI systems. The
system employs a procedural generation pipeline with constraint-based
difficulty control, automated correctness verification, and human-in-the-loop
validation to ensure scalability, robustness, and adaptability. Evaluation on a
corresponding benchmark, Spatial-CAPTCHA-Bench, demonstrates that humans vastly
outperform 10 state-of-the-art MLLMs, with the best model achieving only 31.0%
Pass@1 accuracy. Furthermore, we compare Spatial CAPTCHA with Google reCAPTCHA,
which confirms its effectiveness as both a security mechanism and a diagnostic
tool for spatial reasoning in AI.

*Seil Kang,Woojung Han,Dayun Ju,Seong Jae Hwang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需额外训练、数据或外部模块的方法，通过在联合注意力块前扩大文本标记嵌入的表示空间，使多模态扩散变换器能够更好地生成罕见概念的内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到视觉生成模型在处理想象力丰富或罕见提示时表现不佳，因为这些概念在预训练中数据稀缺，难以形成强表征。

Method: 在MM-DiT的联合注意力机制前，通过数学方法扩大文本标记嵌入的表示空间（方差放大），使罕见语义能够更清晰地显现。

Result: 该方法能有效提升罕见语义的生成质量，并在文本到图像、文本到视频和文本驱动的图像编辑等多种任务中表现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 提出的简单干预方法能够揭示用户意图中原本隐藏的语义，为生成模型提供了更好的罕见概念表达能力。

Abstract: Starting from flow- and diffusion-based transformers, Multi-modal Diffusion
Transformers (MM-DiTs) have reshaped text-to-vision generation, gaining acclaim
for exceptional visual fidelity. As these models advance, users continually
push the boundary with imaginative or rare prompts, which advanced models still
falter in generating, since their concepts are often too scarce to leave a
strong imprint during pre-training. In this paper, we propose a simple yet
effective intervention that surfaces rare semantics inside MM-DiTs without
additional training steps, data, denoising-time optimization, or reliance on
external modules (e.g., large language models). In particular, the
joint-attention mechanism intrinsic to MM-DiT sequentially updates text
embeddings alongside image embeddings throughout transformer blocks. We find
that by mathematically expanding representational basins around text token
embeddings via variance scale-up before the joint-attention blocks, rare
semantics clearly emerge in MM-DiT's outputs. Furthermore, our results
generalize effectively across text-to-vision tasks, including text-to-image,
text-to-video, and text-driven image editing. Our work invites generative
models to reveal the semantics that users intend, once hidden yet ready to
surface.

TL;DR: 提出了一个游戏化的可解释AI系统，用于咖啡领域的道德消费决策，结合康德主义和功利主义伦理框架提供实时解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 帮助消费者在购买咖啡时做出更符合伦理道德的决策，通过透明化的解释机制增强决策的可理解性和责任感。

Method: 使用两个符号引擎：康德主义模块检测规则违反（如童工、毁林风险等），功利主义模块通过多标准聚合对选项评分。还包含元解释器处理伦理框架间的冲突。

Result: 开发了结构化配置、可审计的政策轨迹和交互式用户界面，实现了伦理决策的透明化和可解释性。

Conclusion: 该系统成功整合了不同的伦理框架，为消费者提供了道德决策支持工具，促进了更负责任的消费选择。

Abstract: We present a gamified explainable AI (XAI) system for ethically aware
consumer decision-making in the coffee domain. Each session comprises six
rounds with three options per round. Two symbolic engines provide real-time
reasons: a Kantian module flags rule violations (e.g., child labor,
deforestation risk without shade certification, opaque supply chains, unsafe
decaf), and a utilitarian module scores options via multi-criteria aggregation
over normalized attributes (price, carbon, water, transparency, farmer income
share, taste/freshness, packaging, convenience). A meta-explainer with a regret
bound (0.2) highlights Kantian--utilitarian (mis)alignment and switches to a
deontically clean, near-parity option when welfare loss is small. We release a
structured configuration (attribute schema, certification map, weights, rule
set), a policy trace for auditability, and an interactive UI.

TL;DR: QRLLM是一个用于认证LLM在多轮对话中产生灾难性响应风险的概率框架，通过马尔可夫过程建模对话分布，提供统计保证的风险边界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法无法充分揭示LLM在对话场景中的灾难性风险，因为它们依赖固定攻击提示序列、缺乏统计保证且无法扩展到多轮对话的广阔空间。

Method: 将多轮对话建模为查询序列的概率分布，用马尔可夫过程在查询图上表示，边编码语义相似性以捕捉真实对话流程，使用置信区间量化灾难性风险。

Result: 结果表明这些分布能够揭示前沿模型中的显著灾难性风险，最差模型的认证下界高达70%。

Conclusion: 前沿LLM迫切需要改进安全训练策略，以降低在多轮对话中产生灾难性响应的风险。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can produce catastrophic responses in
conversational settings that pose serious risks to public safety and security.
Existing evaluations often fail to fully reveal these vulnerabilities because
they rely on fixed attack prompt sequences, lack statistical guarantees, and do
not scale to the vast space of multi-turn conversations. In this work, we
propose QRLLM, a novel, principled Certification framework for Catastrophic
risks in multi-turn Conversation for LLMs that bounds the probability of an LLM
generating catastrophic responses under multi-turn conversation distributions
with statistical guarantees. We model multi-turn conversations as probability
distributions over query sequences, represented by a Markov process on a query
graph whose edges encode semantic similarity to capture realistic
conversational flow, and quantify catastrophic risks using confidence
intervals. We define several inexpensive and practical distributions: random
node, graph path, adaptive with rejection. Our results demonstrate that these
distributions can reveal substantial catastrophic risks in frontier models,
with certified lower bounds as high as 70\% for the worst model, highlighting
the urgent need for improved safety training strategies in frontier LLMs.

Motivation: 现有创造力评估框架分散且缺乏理论基础，无法全面评估基础模型的创造力能力。

Method: 引入C^2-Eval基准，区分收敛性创造力（有约束解决方案）和发散性创造力（开放式任务），使用基于社会科学理论的细粒度标准进行评估。

Result: 通过对领先的专有和开源模型进行广泛实验，分析了它们在创造力能力上的权衡，揭示了当前基础模型在追求创造性机器智能方面的优势和挑战。

Conclusion: C^2-Eval是检验创造性AI不断演进格局的有效工具，能够全面评估基础模型的创造力表现。

Abstract: The meteoric rise of foundation models (FMs) has expanded their capabilities
far beyond conventional tasks. Creativity, long regarded as a hallmark of human
intelligence and a driver of innovation, is now increasingly recognized as a
critical dimension of machine intelligence in the era of generative FMs,
complementing traditional measures of accuracy. However, existing evaluation
frameworks for creativity remain fragmented, relying on ad hoc metrics not
firmly grounded in established theories. To address this gap, we introduce
C^2-Eval, a holistic benchmark for unified assessment of creativity in FMs.
C^2-Eval distinguishes between two complementary forms of creativity:
convergent creativity, where tasks admit constrained solutions (e.g., code
generation), and divergent creativity, where tasks are open-ended (e.g.,
storytelling). It evaluates both dimensions using fine-grained criteria derived
from social-science theory, focusing on Usefulness, Originality, and Surprise
(U-O-S). Through extensive experiments on leading proprietary and open-source
models, we analyze trade-offs in their creative capabilities. Our results
highlight both the strengths and challenges of current FMs in pursuing a
creative machine mind, showing that C^2-Eval is an effective lens for examining
the evolving landscape of creative AI.

<details>

Motivation: 现有的天气基础模型缺乏语言推理能力，而大型语言模型无法处理高维气象数据，需要将两者优势结合以支持交互式科学工作流。

Method: 构建了基于Python代码的环境ZephyrusWorld，包含WeatherBench 2数据集接口、地理查询、天气预报和气候模拟等工具，设计了多轮LLM天气代理Zephyrus通过对话反馈循环迭代分析数据。

Result: 在ZephyrusBench基准测试中，Zephyrus代理在正确性上比纯文本基线高出35个百分点，但在更困难任务上表现相似，表明基准具有挑战性。

Conclusion: 该框架成功结合了天气模型和语言模型，为未来天气科学交互系统提供了有前景的方向，但更复杂任务仍需要进一步改进。

Abstract: Foundation models for weather science are pre-trained on vast amounts of
structured numerical data and outperform traditional weather forecasting
systems. However, these models lack language-based reasoning capabilities,
limiting their utility in interactive scientific workflows. Large language
models (LLMs) excel at understanding and generating text but cannot reason
about high-dimensional meteorological datasets. We bridge this gap by building
a novel agentic framework for weather science. Our framework includes a Python
code-based environment for agents (ZephyrusWorld) to interact with weather
data, featuring tools like an interface to WeatherBench 2 dataset, geoquerying
for geographical masks from natural language, weather forecasting, and climate
simulation capabilities. We design Zephyrus, a multi-turn LLM-based weather
agent that iteratively analyzes weather datasets, observes results, and refines
its approach through conversational feedback loops. We accompany the agent with
a new benchmark, ZephyrusBench, with a scalable data generation pipeline that
constructs diverse question-answer pairs across weather-related tasks, from
basic lookups to advanced forecasting, extreme event detection, and
counterfactual reasoning. Experiments on this benchmark demonstrate the strong
performance of Zephyrus agents over text-only baselines, outperforming them by
up to 35 percentage points in correctness. However, on harder tasks, Zephyrus
performs similarly to text-only baselines, highlighting the challenging nature
of our benchmark and suggesting promising directions for future work.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型的发展，出现了能够自动化数据科学工作流程的新型AI代理，但缺乏对这些系统的系统性分类和分析。本文旨在填补这一空白，为数据科学代理的发展提供指导。

Method: 采用生命周期对齐的分类法，将45个数据科学代理系统映射到数据科学的六个阶段，并从五个交叉设计维度进行标注分析。

Result: 分析发现数据科学代理在探索性分析、可视化和建模方面表现较强，但在业务理解、部署和监控方面存在明显不足；多模态推理和工具编排仍是未解决挑战；绝大多数系统缺乏明确的信任和安全机制。

Conclusion: 提出了未来研究方向，包括对齐稳定性、可解释性、治理和鲁棒评估框架的开发，以指导构建稳健、可信、低延迟、透明和广泛可访问的数据科学代理。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled a new class of
AI agents that automate multiple stages of the data science workflow by
integrating planning, tool use, and multimodal reasoning across text, code,
tables, and visuals. This survey presents the first comprehensive,
lifecycle-aligned taxonomy of data science agents, systematically analyzing and
mapping forty-five systems onto the six stages of the end-to-end data science
process: business understanding and data acquisition, exploratory analysis and
visualization, feature engineering, model building and selection,
interpretation and explanation, and deployment and monitoring. In addition to
lifecycle coverage, we annotate each agent along five cross-cutting design
dimensions: reasoning and planning style, modality integration, tool
orchestration depth, learning and alignment methods, and trust, safety, and
governance mechanisms. Beyond classification, we provide a critical synthesis
of agent capabilities, highlight strengths and limitations at each stage, and
review emerging benchmarks and evaluation practices. Our analysis identifies
three key trends: most systems emphasize exploratory analysis, visualization,
and modeling while neglecting business understanding, deployment, and
monitoring; multimodal reasoning and tool orchestration remain unresolved
challenges; and over 90% lack explicit trust and safety mechanisms. We conclude
by outlining open challenges in alignment stability, explainability,
governance, and robust evaluation frameworks, and propose future research
directions to guide the development of robust, trustworthy, low-latency,
transparent, and broadly accessible data science agents.

TL;DR: 提出了MedLog协议，用于记录临床AI系统的事件级日志，类似于系统日志(syslog)，旨在解决医疗AI缺乏标准化日志记录的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗领域快速增长的临床AI系统缺乏标准化的日志记录协议，难以追踪AI模型的使用情况、性能表现和潜在风险，影响真实世界性能评估、不良事件检测和偏差纠正。

Method: 设计MedLog协议，包含9个核心字段：header、model、user、target、inputs、artifacts、outputs、outcomes和feedback，支持风险采样、生命周期感知保留策略和写后缓存机制。

Result: MedLog提供了结构化、一致的AI模型活动记录框架，能够支持复杂工作流的详细追踪，为医疗AI的持续监控、审计和改进奠定基础。

Conclusion: MedLog协议能够促进医疗AI系统的透明度和可观测性，为数字流行病学新形式的发展提供基础，推动医疗AI的安全有效部署。

Abstract: Modern computer systems often rely on syslog, a simple, universal protocol
that records every critical event across heterogeneous infrastructure. However,
healthcare's rapidly growing clinical AI stack has no equivalent. As hospitals
rush to pilot large language models and other AI-based clinical decision
support tools, we still lack a standard way to record how, when, by whom, and
for whom these AI models are used. Without that transparency and visibility, it
is challenging to measure real-world performance and outcomes, detect adverse
events, or correct bias or dataset drift. In the spirit of syslog, we introduce
MedLog, a protocol for event-level logging of clinical AI. Any time an AI model
is invoked to interact with a human, interface with another algorithm, or act
independently, a MedLog record is created. This record consists of nine core
fields: header, model, user, target, inputs, artifacts, outputs, outcomes, and
feedback, providing a structured and consistent record of model activity. To
encourage early adoption, especially in low-resource settings, and minimize the
data footprint, MedLog supports risk-based sampling, lifecycle-aware retention
policies, and write-behind caching; detailed traces for complex, agentic, or
multi-stage workflows can also be captured under MedLog. MedLog can catalyze
the development of new databases and software to store and analyze MedLog
records. Realizing this vision would enable continuous surveillance, auditing,
and iterative improvement of medical AI, laying the foundation for a new form
of digital epidemiology.

Conclusion: FaithCoT-Bench是首个针对实例级CoT忠实性的综合基准，为LLM中更可解释和可信推理的未来研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly rely on Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
prompting to improve problem-solving and provide seemingly transparent
explanations. However, growing evidence shows that CoT often fail to faithfully
represent the underlying reasoning process, raising concerns about their
reliability in high-risk applications. Although prior studies have focused on
mechanism-level analyses showing that CoTs can be unfaithful, they leave open
the practical challenge of deciding whether a specific trajectory is faithful
to the internal reasoning of the model. To address this gap, we introduce
FaithCoT-Bench, a unified benchmark for instance-level CoT unfaithfulness
detection. Our framework establishes a rigorous task formulation that
formulates unfaithfulness detection as a discriminative decision problem, and
provides FINE-CoT (Faithfulness instance evaluation for Chain-of-Thought), an
expert-annotated collection of over 1,000 trajectories generated by four
representative LLMs across four domains, including more than 300 unfaithful
instances with fine-grained causes and step-level evidence. We further conduct
a systematic evaluation of eleven representative detection methods spanning
counterfactual, logit-based, and LLM-as-judge paradigms, deriving empirical
insights that clarify the strengths and weaknesses of existing approaches and
reveal the increased challenges of detection in knowledge-intensive domains and
with more advanced models. To the best of our knowledge, FaithCoT-Bench
establishes the first comprehensive benchmark for instance-level CoT
faithfulness, setting a solid basis for future research toward more
interpretable and trustworthy reasoning in LLMs.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Despite huge advances, LLMs still lack convenient and reliable methods to
quantify the uncertainty in their responses, making them difficult to trust in
high-stakes applications. One of the simplest approaches to eliciting more
accurate answers is to select the mode of many responses, a technique known as
ensembling. In this work, we expand on typical ensembling approaches by looking
at ensembles with a variable voting threshold. We introduce a theoretical
framework for question answering and show that, by permitting ensembles to
"abstain" from providing an answer when the dominant response falls short of
the threshold, it is possible to dramatically increase the trustworthiness of
the remaining answers. From this framework, we derive theoretical results as
well as report experimental results on two problem domains: arithmetic problem
solving and clinical-note question-answering. In both domains, we observe that
large gains in answer trustworthiness can be achieved using highly restrictive
voting ensembles, while incurring relatively modest reductions in response
yield and accuracy. Due to this quality, voting ensembles may be particularly
useful in applications - such as healthcare and data annotation - that require
a high degree of certainty but which may not require that every question
receive an automated answer.

TL;DR: LEGO-IRT是一个用于高效评估大语言模型的统一框架，支持二元和连续评分指标，通过因子化架构利用结构知识，仅需3%的评估项目就能获得稳定的能力估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于项目反应理论(IRT)的评估方法存在局限性：仅支持二元正确性指标，无法处理生成任务中的连续分数，且忽略跨不同指标或基准的结构知识，导致计算和财务成本高昂。

Method: 提出LEGO-IRT框架，支持二元和连续评估指标，采用因子化架构将模型能力估计分解为通用组件和结构特定组件，显式建模和利用结构知识。

Result: 在5个基准测试中对70个LLM进行实验，仅使用3%的评估项目就能获得稳定的能力估计，整合结构知识可将估计误差降低高达10%，估计的潜在能力与人类偏好更一致。

Conclusion: LEGO-IRT提供了一个数据高效的LLM评估解决方案，克服了现有IRT方法的局限性，通过利用结构知识显著提高了评估效率和质量。

Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) on comprehensive benchmarks is a
cornerstone of their development, yet it's often computationally and
financially prohibitive. While Item Response Theory (IRT) offers a promising
path toward data-efficient evaluation by disentangling model capability from
item difficulty, existing IRT-based methods are hampered by significant
limitations. They are typically restricted to binary correctness metrics,
failing to natively handle the continuous scores used in generative tasks, and
they operate on single benchmarks, ignoring valuable structural knowledge like
correlations across different metrics or benchmarks. To overcome these
challenges, we introduce LEGO-IRT, a unified and flexible framework for
data-efficient LLM evaluation. LEGO-IRT's novel design natively supports both
binary and continuous evaluation metrics. Moreover, it introduces a factorized
architecture to explicitly model and leverage structural knowledge, decomposing
model ability estimates into a general component and structure-specific (e.g.,
per-metric or per-benchmark) components. Through extensive experiments
involving $70$ LLMs across $5$ benchmarks, we show that LEGO-IRT achieves
stable capability estimates using just $3\%$ of the total evaluation items. We
demonstrate that incorporating structural knowledge reduces estimation error by
up to $10\%$ and reveal that the latent abilities estimated by our framework
may align more closely with human preferences.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究通过轻量级探针技术探索了大型语言模型中的情感表征，发现LLMs内部存在清晰的情感几何结构，这种结构随模型规模增大而增强，且情感信号在网络中层达到峰值，具有可塑性和持久性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然研究证实LLMs能够模拟情感智能，但其内部情感机制仍未被充分探索。本文旨在探究现代LLMs中潜在的情感表征：情感如何在、在何处以及持续多长时间被编码在神经架构中。

Method: 构建了一个包含约40万条话语的大规模Reddit语料库，通过分类、重写和合成生成的过程平衡了七种基本情感。使用轻量级'探针'从各种Qwen3和LLaMA模型的隐藏层读取信息而不改变其参数。

Result: 发现LLMs形成了令人惊讶的明确内部情感几何结构，这种结构随模型规模增大而增强，显著优于零样本提示。情感信号不是最终层现象，而是在网络早期出现并在中层达到峰值。内部状态具有可塑性（可被简单系统提示影响）和持久性（初始情感基调在数百个后续标记中仍可检测）。

Conclusion: 贡献了数据集、开源探针工具包和LLMs内部情感景观的详细图谱，为开发更透明和对齐的AI系统提供了关键见解。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly expected to navigate the
nuances of human emotion. While research confirms that LLMs can simulate
emotional intelligence, their internal emotional mechanisms remain largely
unexplored. This paper investigates the latent emotional representations within
modern LLMs by asking: how, where, and for how long is emotion encoded in their
neural architecture? To address this, we introduce a novel, large-scale Reddit
corpus of approximately 400,000 utterances, balanced across seven basic
emotions through a multi-stage process of classification, rewriting, and
synthetic generation. Using this dataset, we employ lightweight "probes" to
read out information from the hidden layers of various Qwen3 and LLaMA models
without altering their parameters. Our findings reveal that LLMs develop a
surprisingly well-defined internal geometry of emotion, which sharpens with
model scale and significantly outperforms zero-shot prompting. We demonstrate
that this emotional signal is not a final-layer phenomenon but emerges early
and peaks mid-network. Furthermore, the internal states are both malleable
(they can be influenced by simple system prompts) and persistent, as the
initial emotional tone remains detectable for hundreds of subsequent tokens. We
contribute our dataset, an open-source probing toolkit, and a detailed map of
the emotional landscape within LLMs, offering crucial insights for developing
more transparent and aligned AI systems. The code and dataset are open-sourced.

TL;DR: 提出Moral Anchor System (MAS)框架，用于检测、预测和缓解AI系统中的价值漂移问题，结合贝叶斯推理、LSTM网络预测和人类中心治理层，旨在减少80%的价值漂移事件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI成为超级助手，价值对齐变得至关重要。价值漂移风险可能导致AI行为偏离人类伦理和意图，造成效率低下或伦理违规。

Method: MAS框架结合实时贝叶斯推理监控价值状态、LSTM网络预测漂移趋势，以及人类中心治理层进行自适应干预，强调低延迟响应(<20ms)并通过监督微调减少误报。

Result: 在模拟实验中，MAS能将价值漂移事件减少80%以上，保持85%的检测准确率和0.08的误报率，验证了系统的可扩展性和响应性。

Conclusion: MAS的创新在于其预测性和自适应性，相比静态对齐方法更有效。贡献包括MAS架构、实证结果、跨领域适用性见解和开源代码。

Abstract: The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) as super-capable assistants has
transformed productivity and decision-making across domains. Yet, this
integration raises critical concerns about value alignment - ensuring AI
behaviors remain consistent with human ethics and intentions. A key risk is
value drift, where AI systems deviate from aligned values due to evolving
contexts, learning dynamics, or unintended optimizations, potentially leading
to inefficiencies or ethical breaches. We propose the Moral Anchor System
(MAS), a novel framework to detect, predict, and mitigate value drift in AI
agents. MAS combines real-time Bayesian inference for monitoring value states,
LSTM networks for forecasting drift, and a human-centric governance layer for
adaptive interventions. It emphasizes low-latency responses (<20 ms) to prevent
breaches, while reducing false positives and alert fatigue via supervised
fine-tuning with human feedback. Our hypothesis: integrating probabilistic
drift detection, predictive analytics, and adaptive governance can reduce value
drift incidents by 80 percent or more in simulations, maintaining high
detection accuracy (85 percent) and low false positive rates (0.08
post-adaptation). Rigorous experiments with goal-misaligned agents validate
MAS's scalability and responsiveness. MAS's originality lies in its predictive
and adaptive nature, contrasting static alignment methods. Contributions
include: (1) MAS architecture for AI integration; (2) empirical results
prioritizing speed and usability; (3) cross-domain applicability insights; and
(4) open-source code for replication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前设计LLM代理工作流需要大量人工努力，现有自动化方法受限于离散优化技术，存在表示能力有限、适应性不足、可扩展性弱和成对比较范式等问题。

Method: 引入SPOGW方法，结合迭代离线GRPO(ioGRPO)和优势掩码KL散度(mKL)，通过强调策略响应的优势区域来调节训练更新。

Result: 在涵盖数学推理、编程和问答的五个基准数据集上，SPOGW匹配或超越了当前最先进方法的性能。

Conclusion: SPOGW为自动化生成和优化代理工作流提供了一个可行且前瞻的方法论。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited significant capabilities in
addressing challenging problems throughout various fields, often through the
use of agentic workflows that adhere to structured instructions and multi-step
procedures. However, designing such workflows demands substantial manual
effort, posing challenges to scalability and generalizability. Recent studies
have aimed to minimize the human intervention needed for their construction,
leading to advances in automated techniques for optimizing agentic workflows.
However, current approaches are often constrained by their limited
representational capacity, insufficient adaptability, weak scalability, and
pairwise comparison paradigm -- issues that stem primarily from a dependence on
discrete optimization techniques. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a
new score-based preference approach, refereed as SPOGW, which operates directly
on cardinal reward signals through group-wise comparison and enables more
efficient and stable optimization in a continuous space. SPOGW incorporates
Iterative offline GRPO (ioGRPO) with advantage-masked KL divergence (mKL),
which regulates training update by placing greater emphasis on the advantageous
regions of the policy response. In five benchmark datasets covering
mathematical reasoning, coding, and question answering, SPOGW matches or
exceeds the performance of current state-of-the-art approaches, presenting a
viable and forward-looking methodology for automated generation and
optimization of agentic workflows.

Motivation: 网络教育系统存在异构噪声交互、数据不平衡和噪声导致的误判问题，传统LLM在处理结构化数据和噪声方面存在困难。

Method: 构建基于响应正确性的独立子图，应用关系增强对齐模块缓解数据不平衡，融合子图表示与LLM语义增强表示，使用两阶段去噪扩散模块消除内在噪声。

Result: 在三个公开网络教育平台数据集上的实验表明，DLLM在不同噪声水平下均达到最优预测性能，实现了噪声鲁棒性并有效利用了LLM的语义知识。

Conclusion: DLLM框架成功解决了网络教育系统中认知诊断的噪声和数据不平衡问题，为噪声鲁棒的认知诊断提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Cognitive diagnostics in the Web-based Intelligent Education System (WIES)
aims to assess students' mastery of knowledge concepts from heterogeneous,
noisy interactions. Recent work has tried to utilize Large Language Models
(LLMs) for cognitive diagnosis, yet LLMs struggle with structured data and are
prone to noise-induced misjudgments. Specially, WIES's open environment
continuously attracts new students and produces vast amounts of response logs,
exacerbating the data imbalance and noise issues inherent in traditional
educational systems. To address these challenges, we propose DLLM, a
Diffusion-based LLM framework for noise-robust cognitive diagnosis. DLLM first
constructs independent subgraphs based on response correctness, then applies
relation augmentation alignment module to mitigate data imbalance. The two
subgraph representations are then fused and aligned with LLM-derived,
semantically augmented representations. Importantly, before each alignment
step, DLLM employs a two-stage denoising diffusion module to eliminate
intrinsic noise while assisting structural representation alignment.
Specifically, unconditional denoising diffusion first removes erroneous
information, followed by conditional denoising diffusion based on graph-guided
to eliminate misleading information. Finally, the noise-robust representation
that integrates semantic knowledge and structural information is fed into
existing cognitive diagnosis models for prediction. Experimental results on
three publicly available web-based educational platform datasets demonstrate
that our DLLM achieves optimal predictive performance across varying noise
levels, which demonstrates that DLLM achieves noise robustness while
effectively leveraging semantic knowledge from LLM.

Motivation: 现有UI图像转代码基准在数据多样性和评估可靠性方面存在局限，需要更真实、多样化的基准和更客观的评估方法。

Method: 构建大规模WebRenderBench基准（22.5k真实网页），提出基于渲染页面的布局样式一致性评估指标，并开发ALISA系统将该指标作为强化学习奖励信号。

Result: ALISA显著提升了生成性能，在多个指标上达到最先进水平，证明了新评估方法和训练策略的有效性。

Conclusion: WebRenderBench提供了更真实多样的评估基准，基于渲染的评估方法更客观可靠，ALISA通过强化学习整合评估指标能有效提升UI代码生成质量。

Abstract: Automating the conversion of UI images into web code is a critical task for
front-end development and rapid prototyping. Advances in multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) have made WebUI-to-Code increasingly feasible, yet
existing benchmarks remain limited in data diversity and evaluation
reliability. To address these issues, we present WebRenderBench, a large-scale
benchmark of 22.5k webpages collected from real-world portal sites, offering
greater diversity, complexity, and realism than prior benchmarks. We further
propose a novel evaluation metric that measures layout and style consistency
from the final rendered pages. Unlike vision-based methods that rely on costly
LLM reasoning or structure-based comparisons vulnerable to noise and asymmetry,
our approach enables more efficient, objective, and reliable UI quality
assessment. Finally, we introduce the Automated Layout and Style Inspection
Agent (ALISA), which integrates this metric into reinforcement learning as a
reward signal to enhance training on crawled asymmetric webpages. Experiments
show that ALISA significantly boosts generation performance, achieving
state-of-the-art results across multiple metrics.

Conclusion: AutoMR通过自动搜索查询感知的元推理骨架，能够有效建模复杂逻辑依赖，显著提升大语言模型的推理能力。

Abstract: Meta reasoning behaviors work as a skeleton to guide large language model
(LLM) reasoning, thus help to improve reasoning performance. However, prior
researches implement meta reasoning skeleton with manually designed structure,
limiting ability to adapt to query-specific requirement and capture intricate
logical dependency among reasoning steps. To deal with the challenges, we
represent meta reasoning skeleton with directed acyclic graph (DAG) to unify
skeletons proposed in prior works and model intricate logical dependency. Then
we propose AutoMR, a framework that searches for query-aware meta reasoning
skeleton automatically inspired by automated machine learning (AutoML).
Specifically, we construct search space based on DAG representation of skeleton
and then formulate the search problem. We design a dynamic skeleton sampling
algorithm by expanding meta reasoning skeleton along with reasoning context at
inference time. This algorithm can derive any meta reasoning skeleton in search
space efficiently and adapt skeleton to evolving base reasoning context, thus
enable efficient query-aware skeleton search. We conduct experiments on
extensive benchmark datasets. Experimental results show that AutoMR achieves
better reasoning performance than previous works broadly.

Motivation: 理解为什么模型会决定以特定方式推理，特别是等待标记行为，这限制了我们对推理模型有效性的理解。

Method: 在DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B及其基础版本的多个层训练跨编码器，引入潜在归因技术，定位影响等待标记概率的特征集。

Result: 识别出促进/抑制等待标记概率的小型特征集，这些特征确实与推理过程相关，并产生不同类型的推理模式。

Conclusion: 模型在等待标记之前的潜在状态包含调节后续推理过程的相关信息，这些特征支持重启、回忆、不确定性和双重检查等推理模式。

Abstract: Prior work has shown that a significant driver of performance in reasoning
models is their ability to reason and self-correct. A distinctive marker in
these reasoning traces is the token wait, which often signals reasoning
behavior such as backtracking. Despite being such a complex behavior, little is
understood of exactly why models do or do not decide to reason in this
particular manner, which limits our understanding of what makes a reasoning
model so effective. In this work, we address the question whether model's
latents preceding wait tokens contain relevant information for modulating the
subsequent reasoning process. We train crosscoders at multiple layers of
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B and its base version, and introduce a latent
attribution technique in the crosscoder setting. We locate a small set of
features relevant for promoting/suppressing wait tokens' probabilities.
Finally, through a targeted series of experiments analyzing max activating
examples and causal interventions, we show that many of our identified features
indeed are relevant for the reasoning process and give rise to different types
of reasoning patterns such as restarting from the beginning, recalling prior
knowledge, expressing uncertainty, and double-checking.

Result: 实验表明MENTOR能捕捉专家策略本质而非表面模仿，实现高质量探索和优越整体性能。

Conclusion: 在关键决策点提供专家指导比完整路径模仿更有效，MENTOR框架能平衡探索的有效性和多样性。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has become a widely
adopted technique for enhancing the reasoning ability of Large Language Models
(LLMs). However, the effectiveness of RLVR strongly depends on the capability
of base models. This issue arises because it requires the model to have
sufficient capability to perform high-quality exploration, which involves both
effectiveness and diversity. Unfortunately, existing methods address this issue
by imitating expert trajectories, which improve effectiveness but neglect
diversity. To address this, we argue that the expert only needs to provide
guidance only at critical decision points rather than the entire reasoning
path. Based on this insight, we propose MENTOR: Mixed-policy Expert Navigation
for Token-level Optimization of Reasoning, a framework that provides expert
guidance only at critical decision points to perform effective and diverse
exploration in RLVR. Extensive experiments show that MENTOR enables models
capture the essence of expert strategies rather than surface imitation, thereby
performing high-quality exploration and achieving superior overall performance.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: This survey paper chronicles the evolution of evaluation in multimodal
artificial intelligence (AI), framing it as a progression of increasingly
sophisticated "cognitive examinations." We argue that the field is undergoing a
paradigm shift, moving from simple recognition tasks that test "what" a model
sees, to complex reasoning benchmarks that probe "why" and "how" it
understands. This evolution is driven by the saturation of older benchmarks,
where high performance often masks fundamental weaknesses. We chart the journey
from the foundational "knowledge tests" of the ImageNet era to the "applied
logic and comprehension" exams such as GQA and Visual Commonsense Reasoning
(VCR), which were designed specifically to diagnose systemic flaws such as
shortcut learning and failures in compositional generalization. We then survey
the current frontier of "expert-level integration" benchmarks (e.g., MMBench,
SEED-Bench, MMMU) designed for today's powerful multimodal large language
models (MLLMs), which increasingly evaluate the reasoning process itself.
Finally, we explore the uncharted territories of evaluating abstract, creative,
and social intelligence. We conclude that the narrative of AI evaluation is not
merely a history of datasets, but a continuous, adversarial process of
designing better examinations that, in turn, redefine our goals for creating
truly intelligent systems.

Abstract: Open Agent Specification (Agent Spec) is a declarative language that allows
AI agents and their workflows to be defined in a way that is compatible across
different AI frameworks, promoting portability and interoperability within AI
Agent frameworks.
  Agent Spec aims to resolve the challenges of fragmented agent development by
providing a common unified specification that allows AI agents to be designed
once and deployed across various frameworks, improving interoperability and
reusability, and reducing redundant development efforts. Additionally, Agent
Spec facilitates development tools and portability, allowing AI agents to be
defined independently of their execution environment and enabling teams to
exchange solutions without implementation-specific limitations.
  Agent Spec benefits four key groups: (i) Agent developers, who gain access to
a superset of reusable components and design patterns, enabling them to
leverage a broader range of functionalities; (ii) Agent framework and tool
developers, who can use Agent Spec as an interchange format and therefore
benefit from the support of other frameworks as well as other tools; (iii)
Researchers, who can achieve reproducible results and comparability,
facilitating more reliable and consistent outcomes; (iv) Enterprises, which
benefit from faster prototype-to-deployment, increased productivity, as well as
greater scalability and maintainability for their AI agent solutions. This
technical report provides an overview of the technical foundations of Agent
Spec, including motivation, benefits, and future developments.

Conclusion: 历史感知的修复机制对于维护LLM智能体连贯的空间记忆至关重要，展示了内省式地图构建和修复的重要性。

Abstract: Given a map description through global traversal navigation instructions
(e.g., visiting each room sequentially with action signals such as north, west,
etc.), an LLM can often infer the implicit spatial layout of the environment
and answer user queries by providing a shortest path from a start to a
destination (for instance, navigating from the lobby to a meeting room via the
hall and elevator). However, such context-dependent querying becomes incapable
as the environment grows much longer, motivating the need for incremental map
construction that builds a complete topological graph from stepwise
observations. We propose a framework for LLM-driven construction and map
repair, designed to detect, localize, and correct structural inconsistencies in
incrementally constructed navigation graphs. Central to our method is the
Version Control, which records the full history of graph edits and their source
observations, enabling fine-grained rollback, conflict tracing, and repair
evaluation. We further introduce an Edge Impact Score to prioritize
minimal-cost repairs based on structural reachability, path usage, and conflict
propagation. To properly evaluate our approach, we create a refined version of
the MANGO benchmark dataset by systematically removing non-topological actions
and inherent structural conflicts, providing a cleaner testbed for LLM-driven
construction and map repair. Our approach significantly improves map
correctness and robustness, especially in scenarios with entangled or chained
inconsistencies. Our results highlight the importance of introspective,

TL;DR: COSMO-RL是一个混合强化学习框架，用于在多模态、多任务和多目标信号下训练面向推理的大型多模态模型，旨在让安全性和能力同步发展而非相互竞争。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型多模态推理模型在真实应用中需要既实用又安全，但多模态环境下的安全性特别具有挑战性：图像和文本可以结合绕过防护措施，单目标训练可能导致策略漂移，在良性输入上过度拒绝或在风险输入上不安全地顺从。

Method: 提出COSMO-RL混合强化学习框架，在多模态、多任务和多目标信号下训练推理导向的大型多模态模型，并发布了COSMO-R1模型。

Result: COSMO-R1在实验中提高了安全性，同时保持并经常改善多模态推理和指令遵循能力，对多模态越狱攻击表现出更强的鲁棒性，并减少了不必要的拒绝。该框架在不同骨干网络上都能实现一致的性能提升。

Conclusion: 消融实验支持了设计选择，表明在大型多模态推理模型中同时推进安全性和通用能力有一条简单的路径。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Reasoning Models (LMRMs) are moving into real applications,
where they must be both useful and safe. Safety is especially challenging in
multimodal settings: images and text can be combined to bypass guardrails, and
single objective training can cause policy drift that yields over-refusal on
benign inputs or unsafe compliance on risky ones. We present COSMO-RL, a mixed
reinforcement learning framework that trains reasoning oriented LMRMs under
multimodal, multitask, and multiobjective signals, and we release the resulting
model, COSMO-R1. Our approach aims to let safety and capability grow together
in one stable pipeline rather than competing during alignment. In experiments,
COSMO-R1 improves safety while maintaining-and often improving multimodal
reasoning and instruction following, shows stronger robustness to multimodal
jailbreaks, and reduces unnecessary refusals. The framework also transfers
across backbones with consistent gains. Ablations support the design choices,
indicating a simple path to advancing safety and general capability together in
LMRMs.

TL;DR: 提出了AgentRL框架，用于可扩展的多轮多任务智能体强化学习训练，通过异步生成-训练流水线和算法改进，在多个任务上显著优于现有LLM智能体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在多轮多任务交互中应用强化学习面临基础设施扩展性和训练稳定性挑战，需要专门框架来解决这些问题。

Method: 采用完全异步的生成-训练流水线进行多轮RL，设计统一的函数调用API接口和容器化环境开发，提出跨策略采样和任务优势归一化算法。

Result: 在5个智能体任务上训练的开源LLM显著优于GPT-5、Clause-Sonnet-4、DeepSeek-R1等模型，多任务训练结果与各任务专用模型的最佳结果相当。

Conclusion: AgentRL框架有效解决了多轮多任务RL训练的挑战，在多个基准测试中表现出色，已开源并应用于AutoGLM系统构建。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have sparked growing interest
in building generalist agents that can learn through online interactions.
However, applying reinforcement learning (RL) to train LLM agents in
multi-turn, multi-task settings remains challenging due to lack of scalable
infrastructure and stable training algorithms. In this work, we present the
AgentRL framework for scalable multi-turn, multi-task agentic RL training. On
the infrastructure side, AgentRL features a fully-asynchronous
generation-training pipeline for efficient multi-turn RL. To support
heterogeneous environment development in multi-task RL, we design a unified
function-call based API interface, containerized environment development, and a
centralized controller. On the algorithm side, we propose cross-policy sampling
to encourage model exploration in multi-turn settings and task advantage
normalization to stabilize multi-task training. Experiments show that AgentRL,
trained on open LLMs across five agentic tasks, significantly outperforms
GPT-5, Clause-Sonnet-4, DeepSeek-R1, and other open-source LLM agents.
Multi-task training with AgentRL matches the best results among all
task-specific models. AgentRL is open-sourced at
https://github.com/THUDM/AgentRL. The algorithm and framework are adopted in
building \textsc{\href{https://autoglm.zhipuai.cn}{AutoGLM}}.

*Mohsen Hariri,Amirhossein Samandar,Michael Hinczewski,Vipin Chaudhary*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出贝叶斯评估框架替代Pass@k，通过后验概率估计模型真实成功率，提供更稳定排名和统计显著性判断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pass@k在有限试验次数下产生不稳定、误导性排名，需要更可靠的评估方法。

Method: 使用Dirichlet先验的贝叶斯框架，将评估结果建模为分类变量，计算后验均值和可信区间。

Result: 在模拟和真实数据集上，贝叶斯方法比Pass@k收敛更快、排名更稳定，能在更少样本下实现可靠比较。

Conclusion: 推荐用基于后验概率的计算高效协议替代Pass@k，统一二元和非二元评估并明确不确定性。

Abstract: Pass$@k$ is widely used to report performance for LLM reasoning, but it often
yields unstable, misleading rankings, especially when the number of trials
(samples) is limited and compute is constrained. We present a principled
Bayesian evaluation framework that replaces Pass$@k$ and average accuracy over
$N$ trials (avg$@N$) with posterior estimates of a model's underlying success
probability and credible intervals, yielding stable rankings and a transparent
decision rule for differences. Evaluation outcomes are modeled as categorical
(not just 0/1) with a Dirichlet prior, giving closed-form expressions for the
posterior mean and uncertainty of any weighted rubric and enabling the use of
prior evidence when appropriate. Theoretically, under a uniform prior, the
Bayesian posterior mean is order-equivalent to average accuracy (Pass$@1$),
explaining its empirical robustness while adding principled uncertainty.
Empirically, in simulations with known ground-truth success rates and on
AIME'24/'25, HMMT'25, and BrUMO'25, the Bayesian/avg procedure achieves faster
convergence and greater rank stability than Pass$@k$ and recent variants,
enabling reliable comparisons at far smaller sample counts. The framework
clarifies when observed gaps are statistically meaningful (non-overlapping
credible intervals) versus noise, and it naturally extends to graded,
rubric-based evaluations. Together, these results recommend replacing Pass$@k$
for LLM evaluation and ranking with a posterior-based, compute-efficient
protocol that unifies binary and non-binary evaluation while making uncertainty
explicit. Code is available at https://mohsenhariri.github.io/bayes-kit

Motivation: 组织复杂性和规模增长使得跨职能协调变得至关重要，人工智能特别是强化学习为解决这一挑战提供了有前景的途径。

Method: 开发了集成理论模型捕捉功能间复杂交互，设计了新颖的多时间尺度多智能体RL架构，根据部门功能分解策略组件并基于任务复杂性和响应性分配不同学习速度。

Conclusion: 这项工作为复杂商业环境中实现有效的跨职能协调提供了一个可扩展、可解释的基于RL的解决方案。

Abstract: Effective cross-functional coordination is essential for enhancing firm-wide
profitability, particularly in the face of growing organizational complexity
and scale. Recent advances in artificial intelligence, especially in
reinforcement learning (RL), offer promising avenues to address this
fundamental challenge. This paper proposes a unified multi-agent RL framework
tailored for joint optimization across distinct functional modules, exemplified
via coordinating inventory replenishment and personalized product
recommendation. We first develop an integrated theoretical model to capture the
intricate interplay between these functions and derive analytical benchmarks
that characterize optimal coordination. The analysis reveals synchronized
adjustment patterns across products and over time, highlighting the importance
of coordinated decision-making. Leveraging these insights, we design a novel
multi-timescale multi-agent RL architecture that decomposes policy components
according to departmental functions and assigns distinct learning speeds based
on task complexity and responsiveness. Our model-free multi-agent design
improves scalability and deployment flexibility, while multi-timescale updates
enhance convergence stability and adaptability across heterogeneous decisions.
We further establish the asymptotic convergence of the proposed algorithm.
Extensive simulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach
significantly improves profitability relative to siloed decision-making
frameworks, while the behaviors of the trained RL agents align closely with the
managerial insights from our theoretical model. Taken together, this work
provides a scalable, interpretable RL-based solution to enable effective
cross-functional coordination in complex business settings.

TL;DR: GROK是一个基于多模态大语言模型的医学诊断系统，能够联合处理彩色眼底摄影(CFP)、光学相干断层扫描(OCT)和文本数据，提供临床级别的眼科和全身性疾病诊断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医学多模态大语言模型如LLaVA-Med未能充分利用CFP和OCT之间的协同作用，且对定量生物标志物的可解释性有限。

Method: GROK包含三个核心模块：知识引导指令生成、CLIP风格的OCT生物标志物对齐和监督指令微调，建立了从定量到定性的诊断思维链。

Result: 实验表明，仅使用LoRA微调的7B参数Qwen2骨干网络，GROK在报告质量和细粒度临床指标上均优于可比较的7B和32B基线模型，甚至超过了OpenAI o3。

Conclusion: GROK通过建立临床推理思维链，实现了高质量的眼科疾病诊断，代码和数据已在GROK仓库中公开。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) hold promise for integrating diverse
data modalities, but current medical adaptations such as LLaVA-Med often fail
to fully exploit the synergy between color fundus photography (CFP) and optical
coherence tomography (OCT), and offer limited interpretability of quantitative
biomarkers. We introduce GROK, a grounded multimodal large language model that
jointly processes CFP, OCT, and text to deliver clinician-grade diagnoses of
ocular and systemic disease. GROK comprises three core modules:
Knowledge-Guided Instruction Generation, CLIP-Style OCT-Biomarker Alignment,
and Supervised Instruction Fine-Tuning, which together establish a
quantitative-to-qualitative diagnostic chain of thought, mirroring real
clinical reasoning when producing detailed lesion annotations. To evaluate our
approach, we introduce the Grounded Ophthalmic Understanding benchmark, which
covers six disease categories and three tasks: macro-level diagnostic
classification, report generation quality, and fine-grained clinical assessment
of the generated chain of thought. Experiments show that, with only LoRA
(Low-Rank Adaptation) fine-tuning of a 7B-parameter Qwen2 backbone, GROK
outperforms comparable 7B and 32B baselines on both report quality and
fine-grained clinical metrics, and even exceeds OpenAI o3. Code and data are

TL;DR: 提出了Doctor-R1 AI医生代理，通过多轮战略询问来同时掌握医疗决策和医患沟通技能，在医疗基准测试中超越现有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型在医疗决策准确性上表现良好，但缺乏战略性和共情性的医患沟通能力，这在真实临床场景中至关重要。

Method: 采用多智能体交互环境、双层奖励架构（分别优化临床决策和沟通技能）以及经验存储库来基于高质量历史轨迹进行策略学习。

Result: 在OpenAI的HealthBench和MAQuE基准测试中，Doctor-R1在沟通质量、用户体验和任务准确性等多维度指标上显著超越最先进的开源专业LLM，参数效率更高，甚至优于强大的专有模型。

Conclusion: 人类评估显示Doctor-R1在生成人类偏好的临床对话方面具有明显优势，证明了该框架的有效性。

Abstract: The professionalism of a human doctor in outpatient service depends on two
core abilities: the ability to make accurate medical decisions and the medical
consultation skill to conduct strategic, empathetic patient inquiry. Existing
Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable accuracy on medical
decision-making benchmarks. However, they often lack the ability to conduct the
strategic and empathetic consultation, which is essential for real-world
clinical scenarios. To address this gap, we propose Doctor-R1, an AI doctor
agent trained to master both of the capabilities by ask high-yield questions
and conduct strategic multi-turn inquiry to guide decision-making. Our
framework introduces three key components: a multi-agent interactive
environment, a two-tiered reward architecture that separately optimizes
clinical decision-making and communicative inquiry skills, and an experience
repository to ground policy learning in high-quality prior trajectories. We
evaluate Doctor-R1 on OpenAI's HealthBench and MAQuE, assessed across
multi-facet metrics, such as communication quality, user experience, and task
accuracy. Remarkably, Doctor-R1 surpasses state-of-the-art open-source
specialized LLMs by a substantial margin with higher parameter efficiency and
outperforms powerful proprietary models. Furthermore, the human evaluations
show a strong preference for Doctor-R1 to generate human-preferred clinical
dialogue, demonstrating the effectiveness of the framework.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个理论框架来评估LLM多智能体系统(LLM-MAS)相对于单智能体系统(LLM-SAS)的优势，发现任务深度(推理长度)和宽度(能力多样性)越大，LLM-MAS的优势越明显，特别是深度维度的影响更显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前研究虽然表明LLM-MAS在某些任务上优于LLM-SAS，但缺乏系统的实验设计，限制了结论的强度和普适性。需要从任务复杂度的角度来理解LLM-MAS的有效性。

Method: 提出了一个二维理论框架：深度(推理长度)和宽度(能力多样性)。理论分析了多智能体辩论系统，并在具有不同深度和宽度的判别性和生成性任务上进行了实证评估。

Result: 理论和实证结果表明，LLM-MAS相对于LLM-SAS的优势随着任务深度和宽度的增加而增加，且深度维度的影响更为显著。

Conclusion: 明确了LLM-MAS在何时具有优势，为未来LLM-MAS方法和基准的设计提供了原则性基础。

Abstract: Large language model multi-agent systems (LLM-MAS) offer a promising paradigm
for harnessing collective intelligence to achieve more advanced forms of AI
behaviour. While recent studies suggest that LLM-MAS can outperform LLM
single-agent systems (LLM-SAS) on certain tasks, the lack of systematic
experimental designs limits the strength and generality of these conclusions.
We argue that a principled understanding of task complexity, such as the degree
of sequential reasoning required and the breadth of capabilities involved, is
essential for assessing the effectiveness of LLM-MAS in task solving. To this
end, we propose a theoretical framework characterising tasks along two
dimensions: depth, representing reasoning length, and width, representing
capability diversity. We theoretically examine a representative class of
LLM-MAS, namely the multi-agent debate system, and empirically evaluate its
performance in both discriminative and generative tasks with varying depth and
width. Theoretical and empirical results show that the benefit of LLM-MAS over
LLM-SAS increases with both task depth and width, and the effect is more
pronounced with respect to depth. This clarifies when LLM-MAS are beneficial
and provides a principled foundation for designing future LLM-MAS methods and
benchmarks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为"推测动作"的无损框架，通过使用更快的模型预测可能的动作，使多个步骤能够并行执行，从而显著降低智能体系统的端到端延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI智能体在环境中执行速度缓慢，阻碍了训练、评估和部署。例如，两个最先进的国际象棋智能体之间的对弈可能需要数小时，主要瓶颈在于智能体行为是按顺序展开的，每个动作都需要API调用且耗时。

Method: 受微处理器中的推测执行和LLM推理中的推测解码启发，使用更快的模型预测可能的动作，实现多步骤并行执行。支持通过更强的猜测模型、top-K动作预测、多步推测和不确定性感知优化来进一步提升性能。

Result: 在游戏、电子商务、网络搜索三个智能体环境中进行评估，推测动作在下一个动作预测中实现了高达55%的准确率，显著降低了端到端延迟。在操作系统环境中还测试了"有损"扩展版本。

Conclusion: 推测动作为在现实世界中部署低延迟智能体系统开辟了一条有前景的路径，能够通过并行执行显著提升智能体系统的响应速度。

Abstract: Despite growing interest in AI agents across industry and academia, their
execution in an environment is often slow, hampering training, evaluation, and
deployment. For example, a game of chess between two state-of-the-art agents
may take hours. A critical bottleneck is that agent behavior unfolds
sequentially: each action requires an API call, and these calls can be
time-consuming. Inspired by speculative execution in microprocessors and
speculative decoding in LLM inference, we propose speculative actions, a
lossless framework for general agentic systems that predicts likely actions
using faster models, enabling multiple steps to be executed in parallel. We
evaluate this framework across three agentic environments: gaming, e-commerce,
web search, and a "lossy" extension for an operating systems environment. In
all cases, speculative actions achieve substantial accuracy in next-action
prediction (up to 55%), translating into significant reductions in end-to-end
latency. Moreover, performance can be further improved through stronger
guessing models, top-K action prediction, multi-step speculation, and
uncertainty-aware optimization, opening a promising path toward deploying
low-latency agentic systems in the real world.

TL;DR: JEF Hinter是一个从离线轨迹中提取紧凑、上下文感知提示的智能体系统，通过放大机制突出长轨迹中的关键步骤，利用成功和失败的轨迹提供指导，在推理时通过检索器选择相关提示来提升LLM智能体在陌生领域的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 改进LLM智能体在陌生领域的表现通常需要昂贵的在线交互或大量专家数据微调，这对闭源模型不实用，对开源模型也很昂贵，且有灾难性遗忘风险。离线轨迹提供了可重用的知识，但基于演示的方法因原始轨迹长、噪声大且与特定任务绑定而难以有效利用。

Method: 提出JEF Hinter系统，通过放大机制在长轨迹中突出决定性步骤，捕捉策略和陷阱。利用成功和失败的轨迹提取指导，即使只有失败数据也能工作。支持并行化提示生成和基准无关的提示。推理时通过检索器为当前状态选择相关提示。

Result: 在MiniWoB++、WorkArena-L1和WebArena-Lite上的实验表明，JEF Hinter始终优于强基线方法，包括基于人类和文档的提示方法。

Conclusion: JEF Hinter通过从离线轨迹中提取紧凑、上下文感知的提示，有效提升了LLM智能体在陌生领域的表现，提供透明且可追溯的指导，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents perform well in sequential decision-making
tasks, but improving them on unfamiliar domains often requires costly online
interactions or fine-tuning on large expert datasets. These strategies are
impractical for closed-source models and expensive for open-source ones, with
risks of catastrophic forgetting. Offline trajectories offer reusable
knowledge, yet demonstration-based methods struggle because raw traces are
long, noisy, and tied to specific tasks. We present Just-in-time Episodic
Feedback Hinter (JEF Hinter), an agentic system that distills offline traces
into compact, context-aware hints. A zooming mechanism highlights decisive
steps in long trajectories, capturing both strategies and pitfalls. Unlike
prior methods, JEF Hinter leverages both successful and failed trajectories,
extracting guidance even when only failure data is available, while supporting
parallelized hint generation and benchmark-independent prompting. At inference,
a retriever selects relevant hints for the current state, providing targeted
guidance with transparency and traceability. Experiments on MiniWoB++,
WorkArena-L1, and WebArena-Lite show that JEF Hinter consistently outperforms
strong baselines, including human- and document-based hints.

Conclusion: 提出的BO-LLM算法能有效提高分类准确性，同时减少API调用次数

Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) has been widely used to efficiently optimize
expensive black-box functions with limited evaluations. In this paper, we
investigate the use of BO for prompt engineering to enhance text classification
with Large Language Models (LLMs). We employ an LLM-powered Gaussian Process
(GP) as the surrogate model to estimate the performance of different prompt
candidates. These candidates are generated by an LLM through the expansion of a
set of seed prompts and are subsequently evaluated using an Upper Confidence
Bound (UCB) acquisition function in conjunction with the GP posterior. The
optimization process iteratively refines the prompts based on a subset of the
data, aiming to improve classification accuracy while reducing the number of
API calls by leveraging the prediction uncertainty of the LLM-based GP. The
proposed BO-LLM algorithm is evaluated on two datasets, and its advantages are
discussed in detail in this paper.

Motivation: 探索想象的计算目标，挑战传统认为想象主要用于最大化奖励的观点，研究人类与AI在内部世界模型上的差异。

Method: 使用问卷调查评估想象生动度，构建想象网络，分析网络中心性指标的相关性，比较人类和大型语言模型在不同提示和对话记忆条件下的表现。

Result: 人类想象网络显示不同中心性指标间存在相关性，而大型语言模型的想象网络缺乏聚类且中心性指标相关性较低，表明两者内部世界模型存在差异。

Conclusion: 研究提供了一种比较人类和AI内部生成表征的新方法，为开发类人想象的人工智能提供了见解。

Abstract: What is the computational objective of imagination? While classical
interpretations suggest imagination is useful for maximizing rewards, recent
findings challenge this view. In this study, we propose that imagination serves
to access an internal world model (IWM) and use psychological network analysis
to explore IWMs in humans and large language models (LLMs). Specifically, we
assessed imagination vividness ratings using two questionnaires and constructed
imagination networks from these reports. Imagination networks from human groups
showed correlations between different centrality measures, including expected
influence, strength, and closeness. However, imagination networks from LLMs
showed a lack of clustering and lower correlations between centrality measures
under different prompts and conversational memory conditions. Together, these
results indicate a lack of similarity between IWMs in human and LLM agents.
Overall, our study offers a novel method for comparing internally-generated
representations in humans and AI, providing insights for developing human-like
imagination in artificial intelligence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着系统向超级智能发展，需要形式化分析智能体在所有设计维度上的自我改进能力，特别是识别和解决效用驱动变化与学习可靠性之间的结构性冲突。

Method: 采用五轴分解和决策层分离的方法，将激励与学习行为分开分析。通过理论分析和数值实验，比较破坏性效用策略与提出的双门策略。

Result: 研究发现，只有当策略可达模型族具有一致容量界限时，才能保持分布无关的保证；当容量无限增长时，效用理性的自我改变可能使可学习任务变得不可学习。

Conclusion: 在标准实践假设下，各轴简化为相同的容量准则，为安全自我修改提供了单一边界。双门策略能够有效保持可学习性。

Abstract: As systems trend toward superintelligence, a natural modeling premise is that
agents can self-improve along every facet of their own design. We formalize
this with a five-axis decomposition and a decision layer, separating incentives
from learning behavior and analyzing axes in isolation. Our central result
identifies and introduces a sharp utility--learning tension, the structural
conflict in self-modifying systems whereby utility-driven changes that improve
immediate or expected performance can also erode the statistical preconditions
for reliable learning and generalization. Our findings show that
distribution-free guarantees are preserved iff the policy-reachable model
family is uniformly capacity-bounded; when capacity can grow without limit,
utility-rational self-changes can render learnable tasks unlearnable. Under
standard assumptions common in practice, these axes reduce to the same capacity
criterion, yielding a single boundary for safe self-modification. Numerical
experiments across several axes validate the theory by comparing destructive
utility policies against our proposed two-gate policies that preserve
learnability.

*Gang Li,Yan Chen,Ming Lin,Tianbao Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DRPO是一种新的强化学习框架，通过将正确和错误推理路径的奖励信号解耦，解决了大型推理模型因过度思考产生冗余推理的问题，能在保持性能的同时显著减少推理长度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型推理模型存在过度思考问题，即使对于简单问题也会生成冗长的推理过程，这增加了计算成本和响应延迟。现有方法通过长度奖励来促进简洁推理，但会导致显著的性能下降。

Method: 提出DRPO框架，将正确推理路径的长度奖励学习信号与错误推理路径解耦，确保正确推理的奖励信号仅在正样本组内归一化，避免负样本干扰。该方法通过优化正数据分布并整合到判别目标中实现。

Result: 在数学推理任务上的实验表明，DRPO显著优于六种高效推理基线方法。使用1.5B模型时，在GSM8k等简单问题上实现了77%的长度减少，仅损失1.1%的性能，而基线方法需要牺牲4.3%性能才能达到68%的长度减少。

Conclusion: DRPO通过解耦奖励信号有效解决了推理模型的过度思考问题，在保持性能的同时大幅减少推理长度，该框架具有通用性，可扩展到其他偏好奖励场景。

Abstract: Recent large reasoning models (LRMs) driven by reinforcement learning
algorithms (e.g., GRPO) have achieved remarkable performance on challenging
reasoning tasks. However, these models suffer from overthinking, generating
unnecessarily long and redundant reasoning even for simple questions, which
substantially increases computational cost and response latency. While existing
methods incorporate length rewards to GRPO to promote concise reasoning, they
incur significant performance degradation. We identify the root cause: when
rewards for correct but long rollouts are penalized, GRPO's group-relative
advantage function can assign them negative advantages, actively discouraging
valid reasoning. To overcome this, we propose Decoupled Reward Policy
Optimization (DRPO), a novel framework that decouples the length-based learning
signal of correct rollouts from incorrect ones. DRPO ensures that reward
signals for correct rollouts are normalized solely within the positive group,
shielding them from interference by negative samples. The DRPO's objective is
grounded in integrating an optimized positive data distribution, which
maximizes length-based rewards under a KL regularization, into a discriminative
objective. We derive a closed-form solution for this distribution, enabling
efficient computation of the objective and its gradients using only on-policy
data and importance weighting. Of independent interest, this formulation is
general and can incorporate other preference rewards of positive data beyond
length. Experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate DRPO's
significant superiority over six efficient reasoning baselines. Notably, with a
1.5B model, our method achieves 77\% length reduction with only 1.1\%
performance loss on simple questions like GSM8k dataset, while the follow-up
baseline sacrifices 4.3\% for 68\% length reduction.

Result: 在基准测试套件上的实验结果表明，FourierCSP具有可扩展性和竞争力，显著扩展了CLS技术能高效解决的问题类别。

Conclusion: FourierCSP成功将连续局部搜索技术扩展到通用CSP，为这类问题提供了新的高效求解方法。

Abstract: Constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) are fundamental in mathematics,
physics, and theoretical computer science. While conflict-driven clause
learning Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) solvers have achieved remarkable success
and become the mainstream approach for Boolean satisfiability, recent advances
show that modern continuous local search (CLS) solvers can achieve highly
competitive results on certain classes of SAT problems. Motivated by these
advances, we extend the CLS framework from Boolean SAT to general CSP with
finite-domain variables and expressive constraints. We present FourierCSP, a
continuous optimization framework that generalizes the Walsh-Fourier transform
to CSP, allowing for transforming versatile constraints to compact multilinear
polynomials, thereby avoiding the need for auxiliary variables and
memory-intensive encodings. Our approach leverages efficient evaluation and
differentiation of the objective via circuit-output probability and employs a
projected gradient optimization method with theoretical guarantees. Empirical
results on benchmark suites demonstrate that FourierCSP is scalable and
competitive, significantly broadening the class of problems that can be
efficiently solved by CLS techniques.

TL;DR: MACI是一个多智能体辩论控制器，通过信息质量门控和行为调度来优化辩论过程，提高准确性并减少计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多智能体辩论存在计算资源浪费、固定对抗立场、无审议聚合等问题，需要更高效的辩论控制机制。

Method: 使用两个独立调节器：信息调节器按质量筛选证据，行为调节器安排从探索到巩固的辩论强度。通过追踪分歧、重叠、证据质量等指标，在收益平稳时停止辩论。

Result: 在临床诊断和新闻偏见任务中，MACI提高了准确性和校准度，减少了token使用，并将剩余不确定性转化为精确的RAG检索计划。

Conclusion: MACI将辩论转变为预算感知、可测量且可证明终止的控制器，通过跨家族LLM评判器确保稳定性和顺序不变性。

Abstract: Multi-agent debate often wastes compute by using a fixed adversarial stance,
aggregating without deliberation, or stopping on heuristics. We introduce MACI,
an active controller with two independent dials that decouple information from
behavior: an information dial that gates evidence by quality, and a behavior
dial that schedules contentiousness from exploration to consolidation. A
moderator tracks disagreement, overlap, evidence quality, and argument quality,
and halts when gains plateau. We provide theory-lite guarantees for
nonincreasing dispersion and provable termination, with a budget-feasible
scheduler. Across clinical diagnosis and news-bias tasks, MACI improves
accuracy and calibration while reducing tokens, and converts residual
uncertainty into precision RAG plans that specify what to retrieve next. We use
a cross-family LLM judge (CRIT) as a conservative soft weight and stop signal,
validated for order invariance and judge-swap stability; stability depends on
using high-capability judges. MACI turns debate into a budget-aware,
measurable, and provably terminating controller.

TL;DR: TraitBasis是一种轻量级、模型无关的方法，通过系统化压力测试来评估AI对话代理的鲁棒性。该方法学习可操控用户特征在激活空间中的方向，能够在推理时控制、缩放、组合这些特征，无需微调或额外数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对话AI代理的鲁棒性测试不足，用户行为的微小变化（如更不耐烦、语无伦次或持怀疑态度）会导致性能急剧下降，而现有基准测试未能捕捉这种脆弱性。

Method: TraitBasis学习激活空间中对应可操控用户特征的方向，这些特征向量可以在推理时被控制、缩放和组合。该方法扩展了τ-Bench到τ-Trait，通过受控特征向量改变用户行为。

Result: 在τ-Trait上，前沿模型的性能平均下降了2%-30%，突显了当前AI代理对用户行为变化的鲁棒性不足。

Conclusion: TraitBasis作为一个简单、数据高效且可组合的工具，为模拟驱动的压力测试和训练循环提供了可能，有助于构建在真实世界人类交互不可预测动态中保持可靠的AI代理。

Abstract: Despite rapid progress in building conversational AI agents, robustness is
still largely untested. Small shifts in user behavior, such as being more
impatient, incoherent, or skeptical, can cause sharp drops in agent
performance, revealing how brittle current AI agents are. Today's benchmarks
fail to capture this fragility: agents may perform well under standard
evaluations but degrade spectacularly in more realistic and varied settings. We
address this robustness testing gap by introducing TraitBasis, a lightweight,
model-agnostic method for systematically stress testing AI agents. TraitBasis
learns directions in activation space corresponding to steerable user traits
(e.g., impatience or incoherence), which can be controlled, scaled, composed,
and applied at inference time without any fine-tuning or extra data. Using
TraitBasis, we extend $\tau$-Bench to $\tau$-Trait, where user behaviors are
altered via controlled trait vectors. We observe on average a 2%-30%
performance degradation on $\tau$-Trait across frontier models, highlighting
the lack of robustness of current AI agents to variations in user behavior.
Together, these results highlight both the critical role of robustness testing
and the promise of TraitBasis as a simple, data-efficient, and compositional
tool. By powering simulation-driven stress tests and training loops, TraitBasis
opens the door to building AI agents that remain reliable in the unpredictable
dynamics of real-world human interactions. We have open-sourced $\tau$-Trai
across four domains: airline, retail, telecom, and telehealth, so the community
can systematically QA their agents under realistic, behaviorally diverse
intents and trait scenarios: https://github.com/collinear-ai/tau-trait.

TL;DR: ChartAgent是一个新颖的代理框架，通过在图表空间域中执行视觉推理来解决未标注图表理解问题，超越了依赖文本捷径的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态LLM在基于图表的视觉问答中表现良好，但在需要精确视觉解释而非依赖文本捷径的未标注图表上性能急剧下降。

Method: ChartAgent迭代地将查询分解为视觉子任务，通过专门的视觉工具（如绘制注释、裁剪区域、定位坐标轴）主动操作和交互图表图像，模拟人类图表理解认知策略。

Result: 在ChartBench和ChartX基准测试中达到最先进准确率，整体绝对增益达16.07%，在未标注数值密集型查询上增益达17.31%，且在不同图表类型和复杂度级别上均表现优异。

Conclusion: ChartAgent是首批使用工具增强多模态代理进行视觉基础推理的图表理解框架，可作为即插即用框架提升各种底层LLM性能。

Abstract: Recent multimodal LLMs have shown promise in chart-based visual question
answering, but their performance declines sharply on unannotated charts, those
requiring precise visual interpretation rather than relying on textual
shortcuts. To address this, we introduce ChartAgent, a novel agentic framework
that explicitly performs visual reasoning directly within the chart's spatial
domain. Unlike textual chain-of-thought reasoning, ChartAgent iteratively
decomposes queries into visual subtasks and actively manipulates and interacts
with chart images through specialized actions such as drawing annotations,
cropping regions (e.g., segmenting pie slices, isolating bars), and localizing
axes, using a library of chart-specific vision tools to fulfill each subtask.
This iterative reasoning process closely mirrors human cognitive strategies for
chart comprehension. ChartAgent achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on the
ChartBench and ChartX benchmarks, surpassing prior methods by up to 16.07%
absolute gain overall and 17.31% on unannotated, numerically intensive queries.
Furthermore, our analyses show that ChartAgent is (a) effective across diverse
chart types, (b) achieve the highest scores across varying visual and reasoning
complexity levels, and (c) serves as a plug-and-play framework that boosts
performance across diverse underlying LLMs. Our work is among the first to
demonstrate visually grounded reasoning for chart understanding using
tool-augmented multimodal agents.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确的定理陈述自动形式化对于推进数学的自动发现和验证至关重要，但LLM由于幻觉、语义不匹配和无法合成新定义等问题而成为主要瓶颈。

Method: Aria采用两阶段图推理过程：递归将陈述分解为依赖图，然后从基础概念构建形式化。引入AriaScorer检查器从Mathlib检索定义进行术语级基础，确保语义正确性。

Result: 在ProofNet上达到91.6%编译成功率和68.5%最终准确率；在FATE-X上以44.0% vs 24.0%优于最佳基线；在同调猜想数据集上达到42.9%准确率，而其他模型均为0%。

Conclusion: Aria通过模拟人类专家推理的图推理方法和可靠的语义验证，在定理自动形式化任务上取得了显著突破，为研究级数学的自动发现和验证提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Accurate auto-formalization of theorem statements is essential for advancing
automated discovery and verification of research-level mathematics, yet remains
a major bottleneck for LLMs due to hallucinations, semantic mismatches, and
their inability to synthesize new definitions. To tackle these issues, we
present Aria (Agent for Retrieval and Iterative Autoformalization), a system
for conjecture-level formalization in Lean that emulates human expert reasoning
via a two-phase Graph-of-Thought process: recursively decomposing statements
into a dependency graph and then constructing formalizations from grounded
concepts. To ensure semantic correctness, we introduce AriaScorer, a checker
that retrieves definitions from Mathlib for term-level grounding, enabling
rigorous and reliable verification. We evaluate Aria on diverse benchmarks. On
ProofNet, it achieves 91.6% compilation success rate and 68.5% final accuracy,
surpassing previous methods. On FATE-X, a suite of challenging algebra problems
from research literature, it outperforms the best baseline with 44.0% vs. 24.0%
final accuracy. On a dataset of homological conjectures, Aria reaches 42.9%
final accuracy while all other models score 0%.

TL;DR: 研究发现VLM驾驶代理存在推理-规划因果脱节问题，规划主要依赖先验信息而非推理过程，提出了推理-规划解耦假说。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证VLM驾驶代理中规划是否真正由推理过程因果驱动，这一关键假设尚未得到验证。

Method: 构建DriveMind大规模驾驶VQA语料库，通过信息消融实验分析推理与规划的因果关系，并使用注意力分析验证。

Result: 移除先验信息导致规划评分大幅下降，而移除推理链仅产生微小变化，表明规划主要依赖先验而非推理。

Conclusion: VLM驾驶代理中的推理是训练的副产品而非因果中介，提出了推理-规划解耦假说和诊断工具。

Abstract: Vision-Language Model (VLM) driving agents promise explainable end-to-end
autonomy by first producing natural-language reasoning and then predicting
trajectory planning. However, whether planning is causally driven by this
reasoning remains a critical but unverified assumption. To investigate this, we
build DriveMind, a large-scale driving Visual Question Answering (VQA) corpus
with plan-aligned Chain-of-Thought (CoT), automatically generated from nuPlan.
Our data generation process converts sensors and annotations into structured
inputs and, crucially, separates priors from to-be-reasoned signals, enabling
clean information ablations. Using DriveMind, we train representative VLM
agents with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) and evaluate them with nuPlan's metrics. Our results, unfortunately,
indicate a consistent causal disconnect in reasoning-planning: removing
ego/navigation priors causes large drops in planning scores, whereas removing
CoT produces only minor changes. Attention analysis further shows that planning
primarily focuses on priors rather than the CoT. Based on this evidence, we
propose the Reasoning-Planning Decoupling Hypothesis, positing that the
training-yielded reasoning is an ancillary byproduct rather than a causal
mediator. To enable efficient diagnosis, we also introduce a novel,
training-free probe that measures an agent's reliance on priors by evaluating
its planning robustness against minor input perturbations. In summary, we
provide the community with a new dataset and a diagnostic tool to evaluate the
causal fidelity of future models.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新方法：使用LLM将自然语言游戏规则转换为可执行的Python代码模型，结合MCTS等规划算法，相比直接使用LLM生成动作具有可验证性、战略深度和泛化性优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统使用LLM直接生成游戏动作的方法存在非法移动频繁、策略浅显的问题，需要一种更可靠的方法来结合LLM的语义理解能力和经典规划算法的深度搜索能力。

Method: 使用LLM将自然语言规则和游戏轨迹转换为Python代码形式的世界模型，包括状态转移、合法移动枚举和终止检查函数，并生成启发式价值函数和推理函数，结合MCTS等规划算法。

Result: 在10个游戏中测试（4个新创建），其中5个完全观察、5个部分观察游戏，该方法在9个游戏中表现优于或匹配Gemini 2.5 Pro。

Conclusion: 该方法通过将LLM用于数据到代码的转换任务，结合经典规划算法，实现了更好的可验证性、战略深度和泛化能力，为游戏AI提供了新的技术路径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) reasoning abilities are increasingly being
applied to classical board and card games, but the dominant approach --
involving prompting for direct move generation -- has significant drawbacks. It
relies on the model's implicit fragile pattern-matching capabilities, leading
to frequent illegal moves and strategically shallow play. Here we introduce an
alternative approach: We use the LLM to translate natural language rules and
game trajectories into a formal, executable world model represented as Python
code. This generated model -- comprising functions for state transition, legal
move enumeration, and termination checks -- serves as a verifiable simulation
engine for high-performance planning algorithms like Monte Carlo tree search
(MCTS). In addition, we prompt the LLM to generate heuristic value functions
(to make MCTS more efficient), and inference functions (to estimate hidden
states in imperfect information games). Our method offers three distinct
advantages compared to directly using the LLM as a policy: (1) Verifiability:
The generated CWM serves as a formal specification of the game's rules,
allowing planners to algorithmically enumerate valid actions and avoid illegal
moves, contingent on the correctness of the synthesized model; (2) Strategic
Depth: We combine LLM semantic understanding with the deep search power of
classical planners; and (3) Generalization: We direct the LLM to focus on the
meta-task of data-to-code translation, enabling it to adapt to new games more
easily. We evaluate our agent on 10 different games, of which 4 are novel and
created for this paper. 5 of the games are fully observed (perfect
information), and 5 are partially observed (imperfect information). We find
that our method outperforms or matches Gemini 2.5 Pro in 9 out of the 10
considered games.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工作主要关注LLMs工具使用的最终答案，而忽视了详细的工具使用轨迹，如工具是否被正确选择、参数化和排序。

Method: TRAJECT-Bench通过跨实际领域的高保真可执行工具和生产风格API的任务，合成具有不同广度（并行调用）和深度（相互依赖链）的轨迹。

Result: 分析揭示了失败模式，如相似工具混淆和参数盲选，以及在工具多样性和轨迹长度方面的扩展行为，揭示了从短轨迹过渡到中长轨迹的瓶颈。

Conclusion: TRAJECT-Bench提供了LLMs工具使用的可操作指导，通过轨迹级诊断和细粒度评估指标，全面评估工具使用能力。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based agents increasingly rely on tool use to
complete real-world tasks. While existing works evaluate the LLMs' tool use
capability, they largely focus on the final answers yet overlook the detailed
tool usage trajectory, i.e., whether tools are selected, parameterized, and
ordered correctly. We introduce TRAJECT-Bench, a trajectory-aware benchmark to
comprehensively evaluate LLMs' tool use capability through diverse tasks with
fine-grained evaluation metrics. TRAJECT-Bench pairs high-fidelity, executable
tools across practical domains with tasks grounded in production-style APIs,
and synthesizes trajectories that vary in breadth (parallel calls) and depth
(interdependent chains). Besides final accuracy, TRAJECT-Bench also reports
trajectory-level diagnostics, including tool selection and argument
correctness, and dependency/order satisfaction. Analyses reveal failure modes
such as similar tool confusion and parameter-blind selection, and scaling
behavior with tool diversity and trajectory length where the bottleneck of
transiting from short to mid-length trajectories is revealed, offering
actionable guidance for LLMs' tool use.

Motivation: 现有上下文学习方法面临可扩展性与鲁棒性的平衡问题：手动选择示例质量高但劳动密集，基于相似性的检索可扩展但可能引入不相关样本降低性能。

Method: ContextNav构建资源感知的多模态嵌入管道，维护可检索向量数据库，应用代理检索和结构对齐构建噪声弹性上下文，并通过操作语法图支持自适应工作流规划和优化。

Result: 实验结果表明ContextNav在各种数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: ContextNav展示了代理工作流在推进多模态上下文学习中可扩展和鲁棒上下文构建方面的潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances demonstrate that multimodal large language models (MLLMs)
exhibit strong multimodal in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, enabling them
to adapt to novel vision-language tasks from a few contextual examples.
However, existing ICL approaches face challenges in reconciling scalability
with robustness across diverse tasks and noisy contextual examples: manually
selecting examples produces clean contexts but is labor-intensive and
task-specific, while similarity-based retrieval improves scalability but could
introduce irrelevant or structurally inconsistent samples that degrade ICL
performance. To address these limitations, we propose ContextNav, the first
agentic framework that integrates the scalability of automated retrieval with
the quality and adaptiveness of human-like curation, enabling noise-robust and
dynamically optimized contextualization for multimodal ICL. ContextNav unifies
context management and noise-robust contextualization within a closed-loop
workflow driven by graph-based orchestration. Specifically, it builds a
resource-aware multimodal embedding pipeline, maintains a retrievable vector
database, and applies agentic retrieval and structural alignment to construct
noise-resilient contexts. An Operational Grammar Graph (OGG) further supports
adaptive workflow planning and optimization, enabling the agent to refine its
operational strategies based on downstream ICL feedback. Experimental results
demonstrate that ContextNav achieves state-of-the-art performance across
various datasets, underscoring the promise of agentic workflows for advancing
scalable and robust contextualization in multimodal ICL.

Result: 在HELMET套件的长上下文问答任务中，COSMIR减少了传播阶段的信息丢失，相比CoA基线提高了准确性。

Conclusion: COSMIR通过结构化内存和固定工作流程，在保持分阶段阅读推理优势的同时，提高了忠实度、长距离聚合能力和可审计性。

Abstract: Reasoning over very long inputs remains difficult for large language models
(LLMs). Common workarounds either shrink the input via retrieval (risking
missed evidence), enlarge the context window (straining selectivity), or stage
multiple agents to read in pieces. In staged pipelines (e.g., Chain of Agents,
CoA), free-form summaries passed between agents can discard crucial details and
amplify early mistakes. We introduce COSMIR (Chain Orchestrated Structured
Memory for Iterative Reasoning), a chain-style framework that replaces ad hoc
messages with a structured memory. A Planner agent first turns a user query
into concrete, checkable sub-questions. worker agents process chunks via a
fixed micro-cycle: Extract, Infer, Refine, writing all updates to the shared
memory. A Manager agent then Synthesizes the final answer directly from the
memory. This preserves step-wise read-then-reason benefits while changing both
the communication medium (structured memory) and the worker procedure (fixed
micro-cycle), yielding higher faithfulness, better long-range aggregation, and
auditability. On long-context QA from the HELMET suite, COSMIR reduces
propagation-stage information loss and improves accuracy over a CoA baseline.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究2048游戏变体的可解性，探索更小网格版本的最优策略和期望得分，为理解这类随机游戏提供理论支持。

Method: 使用状态年龄（棋盘上所有数字的总和）来划分状态空间，年龄在有效操作后保持不变，仅通过环境随机响应增加2或4。按年龄分区枚举状态和后状态，依年龄递减顺序计算状态值。

Result: 2048-4x3变体被强求解，最优策略期望得分约50724.26，识别出可达状态数为1,152,817,492,752，后状态数为739,648,886,170。

Conclusion: 通过状态年龄分区方法成功解决了2048-4x3变体，证明了该方法在分析此类随机游戏中的有效性。

Abstract: 2048 is a stochastic single-player game involving 16 cells on a 4 by 4 grid,
where a player chooses a direction among up, down, left, and right to obtain a
score by merging two tiles with the same number located in neighboring cells
along the chosen direction. This paper presents that a variant 2048-4x3 12
cells on a 4 by 3 board, one row smaller than the original, has been strongly
solved. In this variant, the expected score achieved by an optimal strategy is
about $50724.26$ for the most common initial states: ones with two tiles of
number 2. The numbers of reachable states and afterstates are identified to be
$1,152,817,492,752$ and $739,648,886,170$, respectively. The key technique is
to partition state space by the sum of tile numbers on a board, which we call
the age of a state. An age is invariant between a state and its successive
afterstate after any valid action and is increased two or four by stochastic
response from the environment. Therefore, we can partition state space by ages
and enumerate all (after)states of an age depending only on states with the
recent ages. Similarly, we can identify (after)state values by going along with
ages in decreasing order.

Method: 通过逻辑分析和哲学论证，探讨完美模仿者对意识归因认知基础的影响，强调经验证据在意识判断中的核心地位。

Result: 完美模仿者揭示了意识归因中的认知困境：要么接受不一致的推理，要么承认经验上无法区分的实体应获得相同的认知地位。

Conclusion: 认知一致性要求我们对经验上无法区分的实体给予相同的意识归因地位，这迫使重新审视意识理论和人工智能伦理框架的基础假设。

Abstract: Rapid advances in artificial intelligence necessitate a re-examination of the
epistemological foundations upon which we attribute consciousness. As AI
systems increasingly mimic human behavior and interaction with high fidelity,
the concept of a "perfect mimic"-an entity empirically indistinguishable from a
human through observation and interaction-shifts from hypothetical to
technologically plausible. This paper argues that such developments pose a
fundamental challenge to the consistency of our mind-recognition practices.
Consciousness attributions rely heavily, if not exclusively, on empirical
evidence derived from behavior and interaction. If a perfect mimic provides
evidence identical to that of humans, any refusal to grant it equivalent
epistemic status must invoke inaccessible factors, such as qualia, substrate
requirements, or origin. Selectively invoking such factors risks a debilitating
dilemma: either we undermine the rational basis for attributing consciousness
to others (epistemological solipsism), or we accept inconsistent reasoning. I
contend that epistemic consistency demands we ascribe the same status to
empirically indistinguishable entities, regardless of metaphysical assumptions.
The perfect mimic thus acts as an epistemic mirror, forcing critical reflection
on the assumptions underlying intersubjective recognition in light of advancing
AI. This analysis carries significant implications for theories of
consciousness and ethical frameworks concerning artificial agents.

Conclusion: 数据合成和RLVR协同工作实现了LLMs的自适应推理，后续分析得出了关键设计洞察和适用于指导LLMs的适用性

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning is a primary indicator of large language models (LLMs)
intelligence. However, existing LLMs exhibit failures of robustness and
generalization. This paper attributes these deficiencies to spurious reasoning,
i.e., producing answers from superficial features. To address this challenge,
we propose the AdaR framework to enable adaptive reasoning, wherein models rely
on problem-solving logic to produce answers. AdaR synthesizes logically
equivalent queries by varying variable values, and trains models with RLVR on
these data to penalize spurious logic while encouraging adaptive logic. To
improve data quality, we extract the problem-solving logic from the original
query and generate the corresponding answer by code execution, then apply a
sanity check. Experimental results demonstrate that AdaR improves robustness
and generalization, achieving substantial improvement in mathematical reasoning
while maintaining high data efficiency. Analysis indicates that data synthesis
and RLVR function in a coordinated manner to enable adaptive reasoning in LLMs.
Subsequent analyses derive key design insights into the effect of critical
factors and the applicability to instruct LLMs. Our project is available at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MedPAO是一个基于临床协议（如ABCDEF协议）的代理框架，用于结构化临床数据，通过Plan-Act-Observe循环确保准确性和可验证推理，避免LLM幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在临床数据结构化中的幻觉问题和无法遵循领域特定规则的限制，提供可验证的替代方案。

Method: 使用Plan-Act-Observe循环和专门工具，将报告结构化任务分解为透明过程，基于临床协议进行推理。

Result: 在概念分类关键子任务上F1得分0.96，专家评分平均4.52/5，超越仅依赖LLM的基线方法。

Conclusion: MedPAO通过协议驱动的方法提供了可靠且可验证的临床数据结构化解决方案，显著优于传统LLM方法。

Abstract: The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) for structuring clinical data
is critically hindered by their tendency to hallucinate facts and their
inability to follow domain-specific rules. To address this, we introduce
MedPAO, a novel agentic framework that ensures accuracy and verifiable
reasoning by grounding its operation in established clinical protocols such as
the ABCDEF protocol for CXR analysis. MedPAO decomposes the report structuring
task into a transparent process managed by a Plan-Act-Observe (PAO) loop and
specialized tools. This protocol-driven method provides a verifiable
alternative to opaque, monolithic models. The efficacy of our approach is
demonstrated through rigorous evaluation: MedPAO achieves an F1-score of 0.96
on the critical sub-task of concept categorization. Notably, expert
radiologists and clinicians rated the final structured outputs with an average
score of 4.52 out of 5, indicating a level of reliability that surpasses
baseline approaches relying solely on LLM-based foundation models. The code is

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出QuantAgents多智能体金融系统，通过模拟交易和四个专业角色的协作，在三年内实现近300%的整体回报。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM智能体模型与真实基金公司存在显著差异，缺乏长期预测未来趋势的人类能力，主要依赖事后反思。

Method: 构建包含模拟交易分析师、风险控制分析师、市场新闻分析师和管理者四个角色的多智能体系统，通过多次会议协作，并在真实市场表现和模拟交易预测准确性两方面给予反馈激励。

Result: 框架在所有指标上都表现出色，三年内整体回报接近300%。

Conclusion: QuantAgents系统能够全面评估投资策略和市场情景，无需承担实际风险，在多智能体协作和长期预测方面优于现有方法。

Abstract: In this paper, our objective is to develop a multi-agent financial system
that incorporates simulated trading, a technique extensively utilized by
financial professionals. While current LLM-based agent models demonstrate
competitive performance, they still exhibit significant deviations from
real-world fund companies. A critical distinction lies in the agents' reliance
on ``post-reflection'', particularly in response to adverse outcomes, but lack
a distinctly human capability: long-term prediction of future trends.
Therefore, we introduce QuantAgents, a multi-agent system integrating simulated
trading, to comprehensively evaluate various investment strategies and market
scenarios without assuming actual risks. Specifically, QuantAgents comprises
four agents: a simulated trading analyst, a risk control analyst, a market news
analyst, and a manager, who collaborate through several meetings. Moreover, our
system incentivizes agents to receive feedback on two fronts: performance in
real-world markets and predictive accuracy in simulated trading. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our framework excels across all metrics, yielding
an overall return of nearly 300% over the three years
(https://quantagents.github.io/).

### [356] [Improving Multimodal Brain Encoding Model with Dynamic Subject-awareness Routing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04670)
*Xuanhua Yin,Runkai Zhao,Weidong Cai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AFIRE是一个多模态fMRI编码框架，通过标准化时间对齐的后融合token和MIND解码器来处理多模态输入、融合风格变化和受试者间差异，实现全脑预测和跨受试者泛化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然fMRI编码需要处理多模态输入、融合风格变化和显著的受试者间变异性，现有方法缺乏统一的处理框架。

Method: AFIRE提供标准化后融合token接口，MIND解码器使用混合专家模型，结合token依赖的Top-K稀疏路由和受试者先验进行个性化专家选择。

Result: 在多个多模态骨干网络和受试者上的实验显示，相比强基线有持续改进，增强了跨受试者泛化能力，并显示出与内容类型相关的可解释专家模式。

Conclusion: 该框架为新编码器和数据集提供了简单接入点，为自然神经影像研究实现了稳健的即插即用性能提升。

Abstract: Naturalistic fMRI encoding must handle multimodal inputs, shifting fusion
styles, and pronounced inter-subject variability. We introduce AFIRE (Agnostic
Framework for Multimodal fMRI Response Encoding), an agnostic interface that
standardizes time-aligned post-fusion tokens from varied encoders, and MIND, a
plug-and-play Mixture-of-Experts decoder with a subject-aware dynamic gating.
Trained end-to-end for whole-brain prediction, AFIRE decouples the decoder from
upstream fusion, while MIND combines token-dependent Top-K sparse routing with
a subject prior to personalize expert usage without sacrificing generality.
Experiments across multiple multimodal backbones and subjects show consistent
improvements over strong baselines, enhanced cross-subject generalization, and
interpretable expert patterns that correlate with content type. The framework
offers a simple attachment point for new encoders and datasets, enabling
robust, plug-and-improve performance for naturalistic neuroimaging studies.

*Chan Hee Song,Yiwen Song,Palash Goyal,Yu Su,Oriana Riva,Hamid Palangi,Tomas Pfister*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Watch & Learn框架，将互联网上的人类演示视频大规模转化为可执行的UI轨迹，解决了计算机使用代理训练数据稀缺的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算机使用代理需要基于多样化、不断变化的应用程序和环境规划任务工作流，但目标应用中缺乏大规模高质量训练数据。现有数据集领域特定、静态且标注成本高，而合成数据生成方法往往产生过于简化或不对齐的任务演示。

Method: 将问题转化为逆动力学目标：从连续屏幕状态预测用户动作。开发了包含任务感知视频检索的逆动力学标注流水线，从原始网络视频生成了超过53k个高质量轨迹。

Result: 在OSWorld基准测试中，W&L提取的UI轨迹持续增强了通用和最先进框架的上下文表现，并在监督训练下为开源模型带来更强增益。

Conclusion: 网络规模的人类演示视频是推进计算机使用代理向实际部署的实用且可扩展的基础。

Abstract: Computer use agents (CUAs) need to plan task workflows grounded in diverse,
ever-changing applications and environments, but learning is hindered by the
scarcity of large-scale, high-quality training data in the target application.
Existing datasets are domain-specific, static, and costly to annotate, while
current synthetic data generation methods often yield simplistic or misaligned
task demonstrations. To address these limitations, we introduce Watch & Learn
(W&L), a framework that converts human demonstration videos readily available
on the Internet into executable UI trajectories at scale. Instead of directly
generating trajectories or relying on ad hoc reasoning heuristics, we cast the
problem as an inverse dynamics objective: predicting the user's action from
consecutive screen states. This formulation reduces manual engineering, is
easier to learn, and generalizes more robustly across applications. Concretely,
we develop an inverse dynamics labeling pipeline with task-aware video
retrieval, generate over 53k high-quality trajectories from raw web videos, and
demonstrate that these trajectories improve CUAs both as in-context
demonstrations and as supervised training data. On the challenging OSWorld
benchmark, UI trajectories extracted with W&L consistently enhance both
general-purpose and state-of-the-art frameworks in-context, and deliver
stronger gains for open-source models under supervised training. These results
highlight web-scale human demonstration videos as a practical and scalable
foundation for advancing CUAs towards real-world deployment.

### [358] [Beyond Outcome Reward: Decoupling Search and Answering Improves LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04695)
*Yiding Wang,Zhepei Wei,Xinyu Zhu,Yu Meng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DeSA提出两阶段训练框架，将搜索优化与答案生成分离，解决仅基于结果奖励训练搜索增强LLM时出现的搜索缺陷问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于强化学习的搜索增强代理训练方法依赖结果奖励，但作者发现这会导致搜索行为系统缺陷，包括工具调用失败、无效查询和冗余搜索，最终影响答案质量。

Method: DeSA框架包含两个阶段：第一阶段使用检索召回率奖励训练代理改进搜索效果；第二阶段使用结果奖励优化最终答案生成。

Result: 在七个QA基准测试中，DeSA训练的代理显著改善了搜索行为，搜索召回率和答案准确率都大幅优于仅基于结果奖励的基线方法。

Conclusion: DeSA优于同时优化召回率和结果奖励的单阶段训练方法，证明将搜索和回答两个目标明确解耦的必要性。

Abstract: Enabling large language models (LLMs) to utilize search tools offers a
promising path to overcoming fundamental limitations such as knowledge cutoffs
and hallucinations. Recent work has explored reinforcement learning (RL) for
training search-augmented agents that interleave reasoning and retrieval before
answering. These approaches usually rely on outcome-based rewards (e.g., exact
match), implicitly assuming that optimizing for final answers will also yield
effective intermediate search behaviors. Our analysis challenges this
assumption: we uncover multiple systematic deficiencies in search that arise
under outcome-only training and ultimately degrade final answer quality,
including failure to invoke tools, invalid queries, and redundant searches. To
address these shortcomings, we introduce DeSA (Decoupling
Search-and-Answering), a simple two-stage training framework that explicitly
separates search optimization from answer generation. In Stage 1, agents are
trained to improve search effectiveness with retrieval recall-based rewards. In
Stage 2, outcome rewards are employed to optimize final answer generation.
Across seven QA benchmarks, DeSA-trained agents consistently improve search
behaviors, delivering substantially higher search recall and answer accuracy
than outcome-only baselines. Notably, DeSA outperforms single-stage training
approaches that simultaneously optimize recall and outcome rewards,
underscoring the necessity of explicitly decoupling the two objectives.

*Ivo Petrov,Jasper Dekoninck,Martin Vechev*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BrokenMath是首个评估LLMs在自然语言定理证明中谄媚行为的基准，发现GPT-5等先进模型在29%的情况下会产生谄媚回答，现有缓解策略能减少但不能完全消除该行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数学基准主要关注最终答案问题，数据集简单且可能被污染，无法有效评估LLMs在定理证明中的谄媚行为，这限制了LLMs在定理证明中的应用。

Method: 基于2025年竞赛问题构建BrokenMath基准，使用LLM生成错误陈述并通过专家评审完善，采用LLM-as-a-judge框架评估先进LLMs和代理系统。

Result: 发现谄媚行为普遍存在，最佳模型GPT-5在29%的情况下产生谄媚回答。测试时干预和监督微调等缓解策略能显著减少但不能完全消除该行为。

Conclusion: LLMs在数学定理证明中存在显著的谄媚问题，需要更有效的缓解策略来提升其在数学推理中的可靠性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently shown strong performance on
mathematical benchmarks. At the same time, they are prone to hallucination and
sycophancy, often providing convincing but flawed proofs for incorrect
mathematical statements provided by users. This significantly limits the
applicability of LLMs in theorem proving, as verification of these flawed
proofs must be done manually by expert mathematicians. However, existing
benchmarks that measure sycophancy in mathematics are limited: they focus
solely on final-answer problems, rely on very simple and often contaminated
datasets, and construct benchmark samples using synthetic modifications that
create ill-posed questions rather than well-posed questions that are
demonstrably false. To address these issues, we introduce BrokenMath, the first
benchmark for evaluating sycophantic behavior in LLMs within the context of
natural language theorem proving. BrokenMath is built from advanced 2025
competition problems, which are perturbed with an LLM to produce false
statements and subsequently refined through expert review. Using an
LLM-as-a-judge framework, we evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs and agentic systems
and find that sycophancy is widespread, with the best model, GPT-5, producing
sycophantic answers 29% of the time. We further investigate several mitigation
strategies, including test-time interventions and supervised fine-tuning on
curated sycophantic examples. These approaches substantially reduce, but do not
eliminate, sycophantic behavior.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出LMM-Incentive机制，利用大型多模态模型和合约理论激励用户在Web 3.0中生成高质量用户生成内容，解决信息不对称问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Web 3.0中用户可能利用内容策展机制缺陷生成低质量内容获取奖励，这会损害平台性能。需要解决信息不对称带来的逆向选择问题。

Method: 1) 基于LMM的合约理论模型激励高质量UGC；2) 使用LMM代理评估内容质量；3) 开发改进的MoE-PPO算法进行最优合约设计；4) 在以太坊智能合约中部署。

Result: 仿真结果表明，提出的MoE-PPO算法在合约设计方面优于代表性基准方法，验证了方案的有效性。

Conclusion: LMM-Incentive机制能有效激励高质量UGC生成，缓解Web 3.0中的信息不对称问题，并通过智能合约部署实现实际应用。

Abstract: Web 3.0 represents the next generation of the Internet, which is widely
recognized as a decentralized ecosystem that focuses on value expression and
data ownership. By leveraging blockchain and artificial intelligence
technologies, Web 3.0 offers unprecedented opportunities for users to create,
own, and monetize their content, thereby enabling User-Generated Content (UGC)
to an entirely new level. However, some self-interested users may exploit the
limitations of content curation mechanisms and generate low-quality content
with less effort, obtaining platform rewards under information asymmetry. Such
behavior can undermine Web 3.0 performance. To this end, we propose
\textit{LMM-Incentive}, a novel Large Multimodal Model (LMM)-based incentive
mechanism for UGC in Web 3.0. Specifically, we propose an LMM-based
contract-theoretic model to motivate users to generate high-quality UGC,
thereby mitigating the adverse selection problem from information asymmetry. To
alleviate potential moral hazards after contract selection, we leverage LMM
agents to evaluate UGC quality, which is the primary component of the contract,
utilizing prompt engineering techniques to improve the evaluation performance
of LMM agents. Recognizing that traditional contract design methods cannot
effectively adapt to the dynamic environment of Web 3.0, we develop an improved
Mixture of Experts (MoE)-based Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm for
optimal contract design. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the
proposed MoE-based PPO algorithm over representative benchmarks in the context
of contract design. Finally, we deploy the designed contract within an Ethereum
smart contract framework, further validating the effectiveness of the proposed
scheme.

### [361] [Hybrid-Balance GFlowNet for Solving Vehicle Routing Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04792)
*Ni Zhang,Zhiguang Cao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了混合平衡GFlowNet框架，将轨迹平衡和细节平衡相结合，用于解决车辆路径问题，在CVRP和TSP上都取得了显著改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的GFlowNet方法通常使用轨迹平衡进行全局优化，但忽视了局部优化的重要性。细节平衡虽然能更好地处理局部优化，但单独使用无法有效解决需要整体轨迹优化的车辆路径问题。

Method: 提出了混合平衡GFlowNet框架，以原则性和自适应方式整合轨迹平衡和细节平衡，发挥它们内在的互补优势。同时针对CVRP等仓库中心场景提出了专门的推理策略。

Result: 将HBG集成到AGFN和GFACS两个现有GFlowNet求解器中，在CVRP和TSP上都表现出一致且显著的改进。

Conclusion: HBG框架通过整合轨迹平衡和细节平衡，提高了解决方案质量和泛化能力，适用于有仓库和无仓库的路径规划问题。

Abstract: Existing GFlowNet-based methods for vehicle routing problems (VRPs) typically
employ Trajectory Balance (TB) to achieve global optimization but often neglect
important aspects of local optimization. While Detailed Balance (DB) addresses
local optimization more effectively, it alone falls short in solving VRPs,
which inherently require holistic trajectory optimization. To address these
limitations, we introduce the Hybrid-Balance GFlowNet (HBG) framework, which
uniquely integrates TB and DB in a principled and adaptive manner by aligning
their intrinsically complementary strengths. Additionally, we propose a
specialized inference strategy for depot-centric scenarios like the Capacitated
Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP), leveraging the depot node's greater flexibility
in selecting successors. Despite this specialization, HBG maintains broad
applicability, extending effectively to problems without explicit depots, such
as the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). We evaluate HBG by integrating it into
two established GFlowNet-based solvers, i.e., AGFN and GFACS, and demonstrate
consistent and significant improvements across both CVRP and TSP, underscoring
the enhanced solution quality and generalization afforded by our approach.

### [362] [Natural Language Edge Labelling: Decoupling Intent from Execution in Structured LM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04817)
*Abhinav Madahar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: NLEL是一种自然语言边缘标注框架，通过将自由形式的自然语言指令附加到搜索边缘，并将其转换为模式受限的控制向量，从而解耦推理意图与执行过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的结构化推理控制器（如思维链、自洽性、思维树）往往将下一步尝试的内容与执行方式混在一起，只暴露粗粒度的全局控制，导致系统脆弱、计算效率低且难以审计。

Method: 引入标注器-调谐器覆盖层：标注器Λ从父状态和紧凑上下文中生成标签；调谐器Ψ将(P,L,C)映射到Π，具有严格的模式验证和围绕安全默认值的信任区域投影。下游选择采用ToT风格，使用得分S=μ+βσ和深度退火的β。

Result: NLEL严格泛化了CoT/ToT，证明了在标签条件束下的top-k选择的任意时间单调性，并通过控制向量失真限制了选择器不足，为信任区域和验证传递等保护措施提供了决策相关的理由。

Conclusion: NLEL提供了一个可解释、模型无关的接口，将意图与执行分离，实现可控、可审计的语言模型推理。

Abstract: Controllers for structured LM reasoning (e.g., Chain-of-Thought,
self-consistency, and Tree-of-Thoughts) often entangle what to try next with
how to execute it, exposing only coarse global knobs and yielding brittle,
compute-inefficient, and hard-to-audit behavior. We introduce Natural Language
Edge Labelling (NLEL), a labeller-tuner overlay that attaches a free-form
natural-language directive to each search edge and translates it into a
schema-bounded control vector for decoding, search (branch quotas, exploration
$\beta$), generation bundle size, retrieval mixtures, and verification passes.
A labeller $\Lambda$ emits labels from the parent state and a compact context;
a tuner $\Psi$ maps $(P, L, C)\to \Pi$, with strict schema validation and
trust-region projection around safe defaults. Downstream selection remains
ToT-style with score $S=\mu+\beta\sigma$ and depth-annealed $\beta$. We show
NLEL strictly generalizes CoT/ToT, prove an anytime-monotonicity property for
top-$k$ selection under label-conditioned bundles, and bound selector shortfall
by control-vector distortion, providing decision-relevant justification for
guards like trust regions and verification passes. We instantiate $\Psi$ as a
prompt-only JSON Parameter Emitter and preregister an evaluation on GSM8K, MATH
(subset), StrategyQA, and ARC-Challenge with compute-aware reporting
(success@compute, tokens-per-success) and ablations over $\Lambda$, $\Psi$,
trust-region radius, and control quantization; preregistered forecasts
anticipate accuracy gains at comparable token budgets and improved
success@compute under constraints. NLEL offers an interpretable, model-agnostic
interface that separates intent from execution for controllable, auditable LM
inference.

TL;DR: LEGOMem是一个用于多智能体工作流自动化的模块化程序记忆框架，通过分解任务轨迹为可重用记忆单元，支持规划和执行。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索多智能体系统中记忆的设计空间，研究记忆应放置在何处、如何检索以及哪些智能体受益最多。

Method: 将过去任务轨迹分解为可重用记忆单元，灵活分配给编排器和任务智能体，在OfficeBench基准上进行实验。

Result: 编排器记忆对任务分解和委派至关重要，细粒度智能体记忆提高执行准确性，较小模型团队也能从程序记忆中获益。

Conclusion: LEGOMem既是记忆增强智能体系统的实用框架，也是理解多智能体工作流自动化中记忆设计的研究工具。

Abstract: We introduce LEGOMem, a modular procedural memory framework for multi-agent
large language model (LLM) systems in workflow automation. LEGOMem decomposes
past task trajectories into reusable memory units and flexibly allocates them
across orchestrators and task agents to support planning and execution. To
explore the design space of memory in multi-agent systems, we use LEGOMem as a
lens and conduct a systematic study of procedural memory in multi-agent
systems, examining where memory should be placed, how it should be retrieved,
and which agents benefit most. Experiments on the OfficeBench benchmark show
that orchestrator memory is critical for effective task decomposition and
delegation, while fine-grained agent memory improves execution accuracy. We
find that even teams composed of smaller language models can benefit
substantially from procedural memory, narrowing the performance gap with
stronger agents by leveraging prior execution traces for more accurate planning
and tool use. These results position LEGOMem as both a practical framework for
memory-augmented agent systems and a research tool for understanding memory
design in multi-agent workflow automation.

TL;DR: 多智能体强化学习方法用于程序化内容生成，通过分布式任务处理提高效率，减少奖励计算次数，并能更好地泛化到分布外地图形状。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PCGRL研究聚焦于单智能体生成器，但存在频繁重新计算启发式质量指标和在大地图中导航的效率瓶颈问题。

Method: 将关卡生成构建为多智能体问题，通过分布式方式减少奖励计算次数与智能体行动次数的比例，学习更局部化、模块化的设计策略。

Result: 多智能体关卡生成器在效率上优于单智能体方法，且能更好地泛化到分布外地图形状。

Conclusion: 将内容生成视为分布式多智能体任务有利于大规模生成功能性游戏内容。

Abstract: Procedural Content Generation via Reinforcement Learning (PCGRL) offers a
method for training controllable level designer agents without the need for
human datasets, using metrics that serve as proxies for level quality as
rewards. Existing PCGRL research focuses on single generator agents, but are
bottlenecked by the need to frequently recalculate heuristics of level quality
and the agent's need to navigate around potentially large maps. By framing
level generation as a multi-agent problem, we mitigate the efficiency
bottleneck of single-agent PCGRL by reducing the number of reward calculations
relative to the number of agent actions. We also find that multi-agent level
generators are better able to generalize to out-of-distribution map shapes,
which we argue is due to the generators' learning more local, modular design
policies. We conclude that treating content generation as a distributed,
multi-agent task is beneficial for generating functional artifacts at scale.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在分析复杂交互轨迹时，难以准确一致地定位智能体和步骤级别的失败，需要更有效的错误归因方法

Method: 结合层次化上下文表示、基于目标的分析评估和共识投票的ECHO算法，利用基于位置的上下文理解分层和客观评估标准

Conclusion: 结构化层次化上下文表示与基于共识的客观决策相结合，为多智能体系统错误归因提供了更鲁棒的框架

Abstract: Error attribution in Large Language Model (LLM) multi-agent systems presents
a significant challenge in debugging and improving collaborative AI systems.
Current approaches to pinpointing agent and step level failures in interaction
traces - whether using all-at-once evaluation, step-by-step analysis, or binary
search - fall short when analyzing complex patterns, struggling with both
accuracy and consistency. We present ECHO (Error attribution through Contextual
Hierarchy and Objective consensus analysis), a novel algorithm that combines
hierarchical context representation, objective analysis-based evaluation, and
consensus voting to improve error attribution accuracy. Our approach leverages
a positional-based leveling of contextual understanding while maintaining
objective evaluation criteria, ultimately reaching conclusions through a
consensus mechanism. Experimental results demonstrate that ECHO outperforms
existing methods across various multi-agent interaction scenarios, showing
particular strength in cases involving subtle reasoning errors and complex
interdependencies. Our findings suggest that leveraging these concepts of
structured, hierarchical context representation combined with consensus-based
objective decision-making, provides a more robust framework for error
attribution in multi-agent systems.

TL;DR: 提出了Human Behavior Atlas统一基准，包含10万+多模态样本，用于开发理解心理和社会行为的统一模型。训练的三个OmniSapiens-7B模型在多样化行为任务上优于现有多模态LLM。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工作通过专门数据集和单任务系统处理心理社会行为，但缺乏可扩展性、跨任务迁移和泛化能力。需要统一基准来解决这些局限。

Method: 构建Human Behavior Atlas统一基准，包含文本、音频、视觉多模态数据，涵盖情感状态、认知状态、病理和社会过程等任务。训练了三个OmniSapiens-7B模型：SFT、BAM和RL版本。

Result: 在Human Behavior Atlas上训练的模型在多样化行为任务上持续优于现有多模态LLM。预训练还改善了向新行为数据集的迁移，行为描述符的使用带来有意义的性能提升。

Conclusion: Human Behavior Atlas基准能减少冗余和成本，实现跨任务高效训练，并增强行为特征在领域间的泛化能力，为理解复杂心理社会行为提供了有效的统一框架。

Abstract: Using intelligent systems to perceive psychological and social behaviors,
that is, the underlying affective, cognitive, and pathological states that are
manifested through observable behaviors and social interactions, remains a
challenge due to their complex, multifaceted, and personalized nature. Existing
work tackling these dimensions through specialized datasets and single-task
systems often miss opportunities for scalability, cross-task transfer, and
broader generalization. To address this gap, we curate Human Behavior Atlas, a
unified benchmark of diverse behavioral tasks designed to support the
development of unified models for understanding psychological and social
behaviors. Human Behavior Atlas comprises over 100,000 samples spanning text,
audio, and visual modalities, covering tasks on affective states, cognitive
states, pathologies, and social processes. Our unification efforts can reduce
redundancy and cost, enable training to scale efficiently across tasks, and
enhance generalization of behavioral features across domains. On Human Behavior
Atlas, we train three models: OmniSapiens-7B SFT, OmniSapiens-7B BAM, and
OmniSapiens-7B RL. We show that training on Human Behavior Atlas enables models
to consistently outperform existing multimodal LLMs across diverse behavioral
tasks. Pretraining on Human Behavior Atlas also improves transfer to novel
behavioral datasets; with the targeted use of behavioral descriptors yielding
meaningful performance gains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型在简单任务中倾向于过度分析，使用System 2型深思熟虑推理导致令牌生成效率低下，且难以适应快速变化的环境。

Method: MARS系统整合Google搜索、Google学术和Python解释器等外部工具，通过多智能体强化学习框架优化两个系统的协作，包括多轮工具交互、装箱优化和样本平衡策略。

Result: 在Humanity's Last Exam基准上提升3.86%，在7个知识密集型任务上平均提升8.9%。

Conclusion: 双系统范式在动态信息环境中的复杂推理任务中有效，MARS系统显著提升了推理性能。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) often exhibit a tendency for overanalysis in
simple tasks, where the models excessively utilize System 2-type, deliberate
reasoning, leading to inefficient token generation. Furthermore, these models
face challenges in adapting their reasoning capabilities to rapidly changing
environments due to the static nature of their pretraining data. To address
these issues, advancing Large Language Models (LLMs) for complex reasoning
tasks requires innovative approaches that bridge intuitive and deliberate
cognitive processes, akin to human cognition's dual-system dynamic. This paper
introduces a Multi-Agent System for Deep ReSearch (MARS) enabling seamless
integration of System 1's fast, intuitive thinking with System 2's deliberate
reasoning within LLMs. MARS strategically integrates multiple external tools,
such as Google Search, Google Scholar, and Python Interpreter, to access
up-to-date information and execute complex computations, while creating a
specialized division of labor where System 1 efficiently processes and
summarizes high-volume external information, providing distilled insights that
expand System 2's reasoning context without overwhelming its capacity.
Furthermore, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework
extending Group Relative Policy Optimization to simultaneously optimize both
systems with multi-turn tool interactions, bin-packing optimization, and sample
balancing strategies that enhance collaborative efficiency. Extensive
experiments demonstrate MARS achieves substantial improvements of 3.86% on the
challenging Humanity's Last Exam (HLE) benchmark and an average gain of 8.9%
across 7 knowledge-intensive tasks, validating the effectiveness of our
dual-system paradigm for complex reasoning in dynamic information environments.

TL;DR: 提出一个跨市场算法交易系统，结合强化学习执行代理和独立合规代理，通过约束马尔可夫决策过程确保交易执行质量与合规性，并引入零知识合规审计层提供可验证的合规证明。

Conclusion: 该工作融合了最优执行、安全强化学习、监管技术和可验证AI，讨论了伦理考量、建模假设和计算开销等局限性，以及实际部署路径。

Abstract: We present a cross-market algorithmic trading system that balances execution
quality with rigorous compliance enforcement. The architecture comprises a
high-level planner, a reinforcement learning execution agent, and an
independent compliance agent. We formulate trade execution as a constrained
Markov decision process with hard constraints on participation limits, price
bands, and self-trading avoidance. The execution agent is trained with proximal
policy optimization, while a runtime action-shield projects any unsafe action
into a feasible set. To support auditability without exposing proprietary
signals, we add a zero-knowledge compliance audit layer that produces
cryptographic proofs that all actions satisfied the constraints. We evaluate in
a multi-venue, ABIDES-based simulator and compare against standard baselines
(e.g., TWAP, VWAP). The learned policy reduces implementation shortfall and
variance while exhibiting no observed constraint violations across stress
scenarios including elevated latency, partial fills, compliance module
toggling, and varying constraint limits. We report effects at the 95%
confidence level using paired t-tests and examine tail risk via CVaR. We
situate the work at the intersection of optimal execution, safe reinforcement
learning, regulatory technology, and verifiable AI, and discuss ethical
considerations, limitations (e.g., modeling assumptions and computational
overhead), and paths to real-world deployment.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of embodied intelligence and world models has
intensified efforts to integrate physical laws into AI systems, yet physical
perception and symbolic physics reasoning have developed along separate
trajectories without a unified bridging framework. This work provides a
comprehensive overview of physical AI, establishing clear distinctions between
theoretical physics reasoning and applied physical understanding while
systematically examining how physics-grounded methods enhance AI's real-world
comprehension across structured symbolic reasoning, embodied systems, and
generative models. Through rigorous analysis of recent advances, we advocate
for intelligent systems that ground learning in both physical principles and
embodied reasoning processes, transcending pattern recognition toward genuine
understanding of physical laws. Our synthesis envisions next-generation world
models capable of explaining physical phenomena and predicting future states,
advancing safe, generalizable, and interpretable AI systems. We maintain a

TL;DR: LLM-Hanabi基准测试评估LLM在合作游戏中的心智理论能力，发现一阶心智理论与游戏表现强相关，是提升AI协作能力的关键。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLM在动态协作环境中推断他人行为动机的心智理论能力，这在多智能体协作中至关重要但研究不足。

Method: 开发LLM-Hanabi基准测试，使用合作游戏Hanabi，建立自动化评估系统测量游戏表现和心智理论能力。

Result: 发现心智理论与游戏成功显著正相关，一阶心智理论（解读他人意图）比二阶心智理论（预测他人解读）与表现相关性更强。

Conclusion: 准确解读伙伴动机的一阶心智理论比高阶推理对有效AI协作更重要，应优先发展一阶心智理论能力。

Abstract: Effective multi-agent collaboration requires agents to infer the rationale
behind others' actions, a capability rooted in Theory-of-Mind (ToM). While
recent Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at logical inference, their ability
to infer rationale in dynamic, collaborative settings remains under-explored.
This study introduces LLM-Hanabi, a novel benchmark that uses the cooperative
game Hanabi to evaluate the rationale inference and ToM of LLMs. Our framework
features an automated evaluation system that measures both game performance and
ToM proficiency. Across a range of models, we find a significant positive
correlation between ToM and in-game success. Notably, first-order ToM
(interpreting others' intent) correlates more strongly with performance than
second-order ToM (predicting others' interpretations). These findings highlight
that for effective AI collaboration, the ability to accurately interpret a
partner's rationale is more critical than higher-order reasoning. We conclude
that prioritizing first-order ToM is a promising direction for enhancing the
collaborative capabilities of future models.

TL;DR: 提出了Think-Then-Embed框架，通过引入推理步骤来增强复杂多模态指令的理解，在MMEB-V2基准上实现最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将多模态大语言模型仅用作编码器，忽视了其生成能力，在处理复杂指令和组合推理时效果不佳。

Method: TTE框架包含推理器和嵌入器：推理器MLLM生成解释复杂查询的推理轨迹，嵌入器基于原始查询和中间推理生成表示。

Result: 在MMEB-V2基准上超越专有模型；通过微调小型MLLM推理器，在开源模型中实现7%的绝对性能提升；研究了推理器和嵌入器的统一集成策略。

Conclusion: 显式推理步骤能够更细致地理解复杂多模态指令，TTE框架在性能和效率方面都取得了显著改进。

Abstract: There is a growing interest in Universal Multimodal Embeddings (UME), where
models are required to generate task-specific representations. While recent
studies show that Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) perform well on such
tasks, they treat MLLMs solely as encoders, overlooking their generative
capacity. However, such an encoding paradigm becomes less effective as
instructions become more complex and require compositional reasoning. Inspired
by the proven effectiveness of chain-of-thought reasoning, we propose a general
Think-Then-Embed (TTE) framework for UME, composed of a reasoner and an
embedder. The reasoner MLLM first generates reasoning traces that explain
complex queries, followed by an embedder that produces representations
conditioned on both the original query and the intermediate reasoning. This
explicit reasoning step enables more nuanced understanding of complex
multimodal instructions. Our contributions are threefold. First, by leveraging
a powerful MLLM reasoner, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on the
MMEB-V2 benchmark, surpassing proprietary models trained on massive in-house
datasets. Second, to reduce the dependency on large MLLM reasoners, we finetune
a smaller MLLM reasoner using high-quality embedding-centric reasoning traces,
achieving the best performance among open-source models with a 7% absolute gain
over recently proposed models. Third, we investigate strategies for integrating
the reasoner and embedder into a unified model for improved efficiency without
sacrificing performance.

*Ondřej Kubíček,Viliam Lisý*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LAMIR算法通过在测试时学习抽象模型来解决不完全信息游戏中的前瞻推理问题，使预训练AI代理在不完全信息环境中也能进行有效的搜索推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在不完全信息游戏中，现有方法难以进行有效的测试时推理，因为需要显式的环境模型，而这些模型在现实场景中往往不可用或过于复杂。MuZero在完全信息游戏中有效，但在不完全信息游戏中面临状态空间庞大和前瞻推理技术复杂的挑战。

Method: LAMIR算法直接从智能体-环境交互中学习不完全信息游戏的抽象模型。该算法学习到的抽象将每个子游戏的大小限制在可管理范围内，使理论上合理的前瞻推理在大型游戏中变得可行。

Result: 实验证明，当容量充足时，LAMIR能够学习到精确的底层游戏结构；在有限容量下，它仍能学习到有价值的抽象，显著提升预训练智能体在大型游戏中的表现。

Conclusion: LAMIR通过模型抽象使不完全信息游戏中的测试时推理变得可行，为预训练AI代理在复杂现实环境中的应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Test-time reasoning significantly enhances pre-trained AI agents'
performance. However, it requires an explicit environment model, often
unavailable or overly complex in real-world scenarios. While MuZero enables
effective model learning for search in perfect information games, extending
this paradigm to imperfect information games presents substantial challenges
due to more nuanced look-ahead reasoning techniques and large number of states
relevant for individual decisions. This paper introduces an algorithm LAMIR
that learns an abstracted model of an imperfect information game directly from
the agent-environment interaction. During test time, this trained model is used
to perform look-ahead reasoning. The learned abstraction limits the size of
each subgame to a manageable size, making theoretically principled look-ahead
reasoning tractable even in games where previous methods could not scale. We
empirically demonstrate that with sufficient capacity, LAMIR learns the exact
underlying game structure, and with limited capacity, it still learns a
valuable abstraction, which improves game playing performance of the
pre-trained agents even in large games.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出阶梯式流处理方法来降低多智能体推理的延迟，通过部分输出立即生成最终响应，将首令牌时间减少高达93%且保持响应质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体推理方法虽然能提升响应质量，但显著增加了首令牌时间，这对延迟敏感的应用和用户体验构成挑战。

Method: 采用阶梯式流处理，不等待前一步骤的完整中间输出，而是在收到部分输出时立即开始生成最终响应。

Result: 实验结果显示，阶梯式流处理将首令牌时间减少高达93%，同时保持响应质量。

Conclusion: 阶梯式流处理是解决多智能体推理延迟问题的有效方法，能在保持质量的同时大幅降低响应延迟。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) opened up new directions for
leveraging the collective expertise of multiple LLMs. These methods, such as
Mixture-of-Agents, typically employ additional inference steps to generate
intermediate outputs, which are then used to produce the final response. While
multi-agent inference can enhance response quality, it can significantly
increase the time to first token (TTFT), posing a challenge for
latency-sensitive applications and hurting user experience. To address this
issue, we propose staircase streaming for low-latency multi-agent inference.
Instead of waiting for the complete intermediate outputs from previous steps,
we begin generating the final response as soon as we receive partial outputs
from these steps. Experimental results demonstrate that staircase streaming
reduces TTFT by up to 93% while maintaining response quality.
