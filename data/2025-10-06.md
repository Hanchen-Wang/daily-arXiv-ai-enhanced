### [2] [Oracle-RLAIF: An Improved Fine-Tuning Framework for Multi-modal Video Models through Reinforcement Learning from Ranking Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02561)
*Derek Shi,Ruben Glatt,Christine Klymko,Shubham Mohole,Hongjun Choi,Shashank Kushwaha,Sam Sakla,Felipe Leno da Silva*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Oracle-RLAIF框架，用通用的Oracle排序器替代专用奖励模型，结合新的GRPO_rank损失函数，通过排序反馈而非评分来优化视频语言模型，实现更高效的多模态模型对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视频语言模型参数规模扩大，收集人类反馈的成本急剧增加。现有的AI反馈强化学习框架依赖训练专门的奖励模型，这一流程昂贵且受限。

Method: 使用Oracle排序器对候选模型响应进行排序而非评分，提出基于GRPO的GRPO_rank排序损失函数，直接优化序数反馈。

Result: 经验证，Oracle-RLAIF在各种视频理解基准测试中持续优于使用现有微调方法的领先视频语言模型。

Conclusion: Oracle-RLAIF为创建灵活且数据高效的大型多模态视频模型对齐框架开辟了新路径，通过排序而非评分进行强化学习。

Abstract: Recent advances in large video-language models (VLMs) rely on extensive
fine-tuning techniques that strengthen alignment between textual and visual
comprehension. Leading pipelines typically pair supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
with reinforcement learning from preference data to enhance video
comprehension. However, as VLMs scale in parameter size, so does the cost of
gathering enough human feedback. To make fine-tuning more cost-effective,
recent frameworks explore reinforcement learning with AI feedback (RLAIF),
which replace human preference with AI as a judge. Current RLAIF frameworks
rely on a specialized reward model trained with video narratives to create
calibrated scalar rewards -- an expensive and restrictive pipeline. We propose
Oracle-RLAIF, a novel framework that replaces the trained reward model with a
more general Oracle ranker which acts as a drop-in model ranking candidate
model responses rather than scoring them. Alongside Oracle-RLAIF, we introduce
$GRPO_{rank}$, a novel rank-based loss function based on Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) that directly optimizes ordinal feedback with rank-aware
advantages. Empirically, we demonstrate that Oracle-RLAIF consistently
outperforms leading VLMs using existing fine-tuning methods when evaluated
across various video comprehension benchmarks. Oracle-RLAIF paves the path to
creating flexible and data-efficient frameworks for aligning large multi-modal
video models with reinforcement learning from rank rather than score.

### [3] [PhysHMR: Learning Humanoid Control Policies from Vision for Physically Plausible Human Motion Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02566)
*Qiao Feng,Yiming Huang,Yufu Wang,Jiatao Gu,Lingjie Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PhysHMR是一个统一框架，直接从单目视频学习视觉到动作策略，在物理模拟器中重建物理合理的人类运动，避免了传统两阶段方法导致的误差累积问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Method: 提出像素射线策略将2D关键点提升为3D空间射线并转换到全局空间；结合预训练编码器的局部视觉特征；使用蒸馏方案从动捕专家转移运动知识；通过物理驱动的强化学习奖励进行精炼。

Result: PhysHMR在多样化场景中产生高保真、物理合理的运动，在视觉准确性和物理真实性方面均优于先前方法。

Conclusion: 该框架通过统一的视觉到动作学习策略，实现了物理基础且视觉对齐的运动重建，解决了传统两阶段方法的局限性。

Abstract: Reconstructing physically plausible human motion from monocular videos
remains a challenging problem in computer vision and graphics. Existing methods
primarily focus on kinematics-based pose estimation, often leading to
unrealistic results due to the lack of physical constraints. To address such
artifacts, prior methods have typically relied on physics-based post-processing
following the initial kinematics-based motion estimation. However, this
two-stage design introduces error accumulation, ultimately limiting the overall
reconstruction quality. In this paper, we present PhysHMR, a unified framework
that directly learns a visual-to-action policy for humanoid control in a
physics-based simulator, enabling motion reconstruction that is both physically
grounded and visually aligned with the input video. A key component of our
approach is the pixel-as-ray strategy, which lifts 2D keypoints into 3D spatial
rays and transforms them into global space. These rays are incorporated as
policy inputs, providing robust global pose guidance without depending on noisy
3D root predictions. This soft global grounding, combined with local visual
features from a pretrained encoder, allows the policy to reason over both
detailed pose and global positioning. To overcome the sample inefficiency of
reinforcement learning, we further introduce a distillation scheme that
transfers motion knowledge from a mocap-trained expert to the
vision-conditioned policy, which is then refined using physically motivated
reinforcement learning rewards. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PhysHMR
produces high-fidelity, physically plausible motion across diverse scenarios,
outperforming prior approaches in both visual accuracy and physical realism.

### [4] [Unlocking the power of partnership: How humans and machines can work together to improve face recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02570)

Motivation: 研究人机协作面部识别系统的准确性，探索在何种情况下人类与机器的结合能提高识别准确率。

Method: 使用专家和非专家面部识别者的数据，分析人-人和人-机协作的效果，应用近端准确率规则预测协作收益，并实施智能人机融合策略。

Result: 协作收益随协作者基线准确率差异减小而增加，智能人机融合比单独机器或所有人机判断组合更准确，能有效最小化低表现人类对系统准确性的影响。

Conclusion: 人机协作在面部识别中具有重要价值，智能融合策略能显著提高系统准确性，为AI在面部识别中的智能应用提供了实证路线图。

Abstract: Human review of consequential decisions by face recognition algorithms
creates a "collaborative" human-machine system. Individual differences between
people and machines, however, affect whether collaboration improves or degrades
accuracy in any given case. We establish the circumstances under which
combining human and machine face identification decisions improves accuracy.
Using data from expert and non-expert face identifiers, we examined the
benefits of human-human and human-machine collaborations. The benefits of
collaboration increased as the difference in baseline accuracy between
collaborators decreased-following the Proximal Accuracy Rule (PAR). This rule
predicted collaborative (fusion) benefit across a wide range of baseline
abilities, from people with no training to those with extensive training. Using
the PAR, we established a critical fusion zone, where humans are less accurate
than the machine, but fusing the two improves system accuracy. This zone was
surprisingly large. We implemented "intelligent human-machine fusion" by
selecting people with the potential to increase the accuracy of a
high-performing machine. Intelligent fusion was more accurate than the machine
operating alone and more accurate than combining all human and machine
judgments. The highest system-wide accuracy achievable with human-only
partnerships was found by graph theory. This fully human system approximated
the average performance achieved by intelligent human-machine collaboration.
However, intelligent human-machine collaboration more effectively minimized the
impact of low-performing humans on system-wide accuracy. The results
demonstrate a meaningful role for both humans and machines in assuring accurate
face identification. This study offers an evidence-based road map for the
intelligent use of AI in face identification.

### [5] [How Confident are Video Models? Empowering Video Models to Express their Uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02571)
*Zhiting Mei,Ola Shorinwa,Anirudha Majumdar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个用于视频生成模型不确定性量化的框架S-QUBED，包括评估指标、黑盒UQ方法和基准数据集，能够分解预测不确定性为认知和偶然成分。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频生成模型存在幻觉问题，会产生事实错误的视频，但目前缺乏不确定性量化方法，存在安全隐患。

Method: 提出S-QUBED框架：基于稳健秩相关的校准评估指标；通过潜在建模分解不确定性的黑盒UQ方法；用于基准测试的UQ数据集。

Result: 实验表明S-QUBED能计算校准的总不确定性估计，与任务准确度负相关，并能有效分解认知和偶然不确定性成分。

Conclusion: 这是视频生成模型不确定性量化的首个工作，S-QUBED框架为视频模型的安全应用提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Generative video models demonstrate impressive text-to-video capabilities,
spurring widespread adoption in many real-world applications. However, like
large language models (LLMs), video generation models tend to hallucinate,
producing plausible videos even when they are factually wrong. Although
uncertainty quantification (UQ) of LLMs has been extensively studied in prior
work, no UQ method for video models exists, raising critical safety concerns.
To our knowledge, this paper represents the first work towards quantifying the
uncertainty of video models. We present a framework for uncertainty
quantification of generative video models, consisting of: (i) a metric for
evaluating the calibration of video models based on robust rank correlation
estimation with no stringent modeling assumptions; (ii) a black-box UQ method
for video models (termed S-QUBED), which leverages latent modeling to
rigorously decompose predictive uncertainty into its aleatoric and epistemic
components; and (iii) a UQ dataset to facilitate benchmarking calibration in
video models. By conditioning the generation task in the latent space, we
disentangle uncertainty arising due to vague task specifications from that
arising from lack of knowledge. Through extensive experiments on benchmark
video datasets, we demonstrate that S-QUBED computes calibrated total
uncertainty estimates that are negatively correlated with the task accuracy and
effectively computes the aleatoric and epistemic constituents.

### [6] [PEO: Training-Free Aesthetic Quality Enhancement in Pre-Trained Text-to-Image Diffusion Models with Prompt Embedding Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02599)
*Hovhannes Margaryan,Bo Wan,Tinne Tuytelaars*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Prompt Embedding Optimization (PEO)方法，通过优化文本嵌入来提升预训练文本到图像扩散模型生成图像的美学质量，无需额外训练且与骨干网络无关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决预训练文本到图像扩散模型在简单提示词下生成图像美学质量不足的问题，无需重新训练模型或依赖精心设计的提示词。

Method: 使用三重目标函数优化文本嵌入：提升生成图像的美学保真度、确保与优化后文本嵌入的一致性、通过提示词保留项最小化与初始提示词的差异。

Result: 定量和定性评估表明，该方法在性能上超过或等同于最先进的文本到图像和提示词适应方法。

Conclusion: PEO是一种有效、无需训练且与骨干网络无关的方法，能够显著提升简单提示词下生成图像的美学质量。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to aesthetic quality improvement in
pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models when given a simple prompt. Our
method, dubbed Prompt Embedding Optimization (PEO), leverages a pre-trained
text-to-image diffusion model as a backbone and optimizes the text embedding of
a given simple and uncurated prompt to enhance the visual quality of the
generated image. We achieve this by a tripartite objective function that
improves the aesthetic fidelity of the generated image, ensures adherence to
the optimized text embedding, and minimal divergence from the initial prompt.
The latter is accomplished through a prompt preservation term. Additionally,
PEO is training-free and backbone-independent. Quantitative and qualitative
evaluations confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method, exceeding or
equating the performance of state-of-the-art text-to-image and prompt
adaptation methods.

### [7] [Ego-Exo 3D Hand Tracking in the Wild with a Mobile Multi-Camera Rig](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02601)
*Patrick Rim,Kun He,Kevin Harris,Braden Copple,Shangchen Han,Sizhe An,Ivan Shugurov,Tomas Hodan,He Wen,Xu Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型无标记多摄像头系统，用于在真实野外条件下捕捉精确的3D手部和物体，解决了现有数据集在环境多样性和模型泛化方面的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有手部跟踪数据集主要在受控实验室环境中采集，限制了环境多样性，导致模型泛化能力不足。需要开发能够在真实野外条件下准确跟踪手部及其与物体交互的方法。

Method: 设计了一个轻量级背戴式捕捉装置，包含8个外中心摄像头和Meta Quest 3头显提供的2个自我中心视角。开发了自我-外中心跟踪流程来生成准确的3D手部姿态真值。

Result: 通过收集包含同步多视角图像和精确3D手部姿态的标注数据集，证明了该方法能够显著减少环境真实性与3D标注准确性之间的权衡。

Conclusion: 该无标记多摄像头系统能够在真实野外条件下实现精确的3D手部和物体跟踪，为计算机视觉研究提供了更真实、更通用的数据集。

Abstract: Accurate 3D tracking of hands and their interactions with the world in
unconstrained settings remains a significant challenge for egocentric computer
vision. With few exceptions, existing datasets are predominantly captured in
controlled lab setups, limiting environmental diversity and model
generalization. To address this, we introduce a novel marker-less multi-camera
system designed to capture precise 3D hands and objects, which allows for
nearly unconstrained mobility in genuinely in-the-wild conditions. We combine a
lightweight, back-mounted capture rig with eight exocentric cameras, and a
user-worn Meta Quest 3 headset, which contributes two egocentric views. We
design an ego-exo tracking pipeline to generate accurate 3D hand pose ground
truth from this system, and rigorously evaluate its quality. By collecting an
annotated dataset featuring synchronized multi-view images and precise 3D hand
poses, we demonstrate the capability of our approach to significantly reduce
the trade-off between environmental realism and 3D annotation accuracy.

### [8] [Input-Aware Sparse Attention for Real-Time Co-Speech Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02617)
*Beijia Lu,Ziyi Chen,Jing Xiao,Jun-Yan Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的视频蒸馏方法，通过输入人体姿态条件引导注意力和损失函数，将多步扩散视频模型蒸馏为少步学生模型，实现实时性能并提升视觉质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散的方法由于大量去噪步骤和昂贵注意力机制导致速度慢，无法实现实时部署。需要将多步扩散模型蒸馏为少步模型，但直接应用现有蒸馏方法会降低视频质量且无法达到实时性能。

Method: 1. 使用输入人体姿态关键点的准确对应关系引导注意力到相关区域（如人脸、手部、上半身），实现输入感知稀疏注意力；2. 引入输入感知蒸馏损失，提升唇部同步和手部运动真实性；3. 结合稀疏注意力和蒸馏损失进行模型蒸馏。

Result: 方法实现了实时性能，相比最近的音频驱动和输入驱动方法具有更好的视觉质量。

Conclusion: 通过输入感知的稀疏注意力和蒸馏损失，成功将多步扩散视频模型蒸馏为少步模型，在保持高质量的同时实现实时性能，为视频创建和虚拟代理等应用提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models can synthesize realistic co-speech video from audio for
various applications, such as video creation and virtual agents. However,
existing diffusion-based methods are slow due to numerous denoising steps and
costly attention mechanisms, preventing real-time deployment. In this work, we
distill a many-step diffusion video model into a few-step student model.
Unfortunately, directly applying recent diffusion distillation methods degrades
video quality and falls short of real-time performance. To address these
issues, our new video distillation method leverages input human pose
conditioning for both attention and loss functions. We first propose using
accurate correspondence between input human pose keypoints to guide attention
to relevant regions, such as the speaker's face, hands, and upper body. This
input-aware sparse attention reduces redundant computations and strengthens
temporal correspondences of body parts, improving inference efficiency and
motion coherence. To further enhance visual quality, we introduce an
input-aware distillation loss that improves lip synchronization and hand motion
realism. By integrating our input-aware sparse attention and distillation loss,
our method achieves real-time performance with improved visual quality compared
to recent audio-driven and input-driven methods. We also conduct extensive
experiments showing the effectiveness of our algorithmic design choices.

### [9] [Deep Generative Continual Learning using Functional LoRA: FunLoRA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02631)
*Victor Enescu,Hichem Sahbi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于LoRA的新型条件机制FunLoRA，用于解决生成模型在持续学习中的灾难性遗忘问题，通过仅使用秩1矩阵和函数重参数化来提高表达能力，实现参数高效微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度生成模型在增量训练中面临的灾难性遗忘问题，同时克服传统方法训练时间过长和依赖合成数据导致性能下降的局限性。

Method: 设计基于低秩适应(LoRA)的功能性条件机制FunLoRA，使用秩1矩阵并通过函数重参数化动态增加矩阵秩，仅需在当前任务数据上训练。

Result: 实验表明FunLoRA在基于流匹配的模型上超越了基于扩散模型的先前最优结果，达到更高的分类准确率，同时仅需少量内存成本和采样时间。

Conclusion: FunLoRA提供了一种参数高效的持续学习方法，能有效避免灾难性遗忘，在性能和效率方面都优于现有方法。

Abstract: Continual adaptation of deep generative models holds tremendous potential and
critical importance, given their rapid and expanding usage in text and vision
based applications. Incremental training, however, remains highly challenging
due to catastrophic forgetting phenomenon, which makes it difficult for neural
networks to effectively incorporate new knowledge. A common strategy consists
in retraining the generative model on its own synthetic data in order to
mitigate forgetting. Yet, such an approach faces two major limitations: (i) the
continually increasing training time eventually becomes intractable, and (ii)
reliance on synthetic data inevitably leads to long-term performance
degradation, since synthetic samples lack the richness of real training data.
In this paper, we attenuate these issues by designing a novel and more
expressive conditioning mechanism for generative models based on low rank
adaptation (LoRA), that exclusively employs rank 1 matrices, whose
reparametrized matrix rank is functionally increased using carefully selected
functions -- and dubbed functional LoRA: FunLoRA. Using this dynamic
conditioning, the generative model is guaranteed to avoid catastrophic
forgetting and needs only to be trained on data from the current task.
Extensive experiments using flow-matching based models trained from scratch,
showcase that our proposed parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method
surpasses prior state-of-the-art results based on diffusion models, reaching
higher classification accuracy scores, while only requiring a fraction of the
memory cost and sampling time.

### [10] [Sequence-Preserving Dual-FoV Defense for Traffic Sign and Light Recognition in Autonomous Vehicles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02642)
*Abhishek Joshi,Jahnavi Krishna Koda,Abhishek Phadke*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一个双视场、序列保持的鲁棒性框架，用于美国交通灯和标志识别，通过统一的三层防御堆栈（特征压缩、防御蒸馏、基于熵的异常检测）和时序投票，显著降低攻击成功率和高风险误分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶车辆中交通灯和标志识别错误直接影响导航和安全，现有方法缺乏对时序连续性、多静态视场感知以及数字和自然退化鲁棒性的考虑。

Method: 基于aiMotive、Udacity、Waymo和自录德克萨斯州视频构建多源数据集，对高速公路、夜间、雨天和城市四种操作设计域进行时序对齐，采用三层防御堆栈框架结合时序投票。

Result: 统一防御堆栈达到79.8mAP，将攻击成功率降至18.2%，优于YOLOv8、YOLOv9和BEVFormer，同时将高风险误分类降至32%。

Conclusion: 该框架通过时序对齐和多层防御机制，显著提升了交通灯和标志识别系统对数字和物理攻击的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Traffic light and sign recognition are key for Autonomous Vehicles (AVs)
because perception mistakes directly influence navigation and safety. In
addition to digital adversarial attacks, models are vulnerable to existing
perturbations (glare, rain, dirt, or graffiti), which could lead to dangerous
misclassifications. The current work lacks consideration of temporal
continuity, multistatic field-of-view (FoV) sensing, and robustness to both
digital and natural degradation. This study proposes a dual FoV,
sequence-preserving robustness framework for traffic lights and signs in the
USA based on a multi-source dataset built on aiMotive, Udacity, Waymo, and
self-recorded videos from the region of Texas. Mid and long-term sequences of
RGB images are temporally aligned for four operational design domains (ODDs):
highway, night, rainy, and urban. Over a series of experiments on a real-life
application of anomaly detection, this study outlines a unified three-layer
defense stack framework that incorporates feature squeezing, defensive
distillation, and entropy-based anomaly detection, as well as sequence-wise
temporal voting for further enhancement. The evaluation measures included
accuracy, attack success rate (ASR), risk-weighted misclassification severity,
and confidence stability. Physical transferability was confirmed using probes
for recapture. The results showed that the Unified Defense Stack achieved
79.8mAP and reduced the ASR to 18.2%, which is superior to YOLOv8, YOLOv9, and
BEVFormer, while reducing the high-risk misclassification to 32%.

### [11] [Smart-GRPO: Smartly Sampling Noise for Efficient RL of Flow-Matching Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02654)
*Benjamin Yu,Jackie Liu,Justin Cui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Smart-GRPO是首个针对流匹配模型中强化学习的噪声扰动优化方法，通过迭代搜索策略改进噪声分布，提升奖励优化和视觉质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 流匹配模型虽然能生成高质量文本到图像，但其确定性特性不适合强化学习，而现有通过随机噪声引入随机性的方法效率低且不稳定

Method: 采用迭代搜索策略：解码候选扰动、用奖励函数评估、向高奖励区域优化噪声分布

Result: 实验表明Smart-GRPO在奖励优化和视觉质量上都优于基线方法

Conclusion: 为流匹配框架中的强化学习提供了实用路径，弥合了高效训练与人类对齐生成之间的差距

Abstract: Recent advancements in flow-matching have enabled high-quality text-to-image
generation. However, the deterministic nature of flow-matching models makes
them poorly suited for reinforcement learning, a key tool for improving image
quality and human alignment. Prior work has introduced stochasticity by
perturbing latents with random noise, but such perturbations are inefficient
and unstable. We propose Smart-GRPO, the first method to optimize noise
perturbations for reinforcement learning in flow-matching models. Smart-GRPO
employs an iterative search strategy that decodes candidate perturbations,
evaluates them with a reward function, and refines the noise distribution
toward higher-reward regions. Experiments demonstrate that Smart-GRPO improves
both reward optimization and visual quality compared to baseline methods. Our
results suggest a practical path toward reinforcement learning in flow-matching
frameworks, bridging the gap between efficient training and human-aligned
generation.

*Yibin Zhao,Yihan Pan,Jun Nan,Jianjun Yi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FSFSplatter是一种从自由稀疏图像进行快速表面重建的新方法，通过端到端密集高斯初始化、相机参数估计和几何增强的场景优化，解决了传统方法需要密集校准视图的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有高斯溅射方法大多需要密集、校准的视图，而从自由稀疏图像重建往往由于有限重叠和过拟合导致表面质量差。

Method: 使用大型Transformer编码多视图图像，通过自分裂高斯头生成密集且几何一致的高斯场景初始化，采用贡献度剪枝消除局部漂浮物，利用深度和多视图特征监督缓解过拟合。

Result: FSFSplatter在广泛使用的DTU和Replica数据集上优于当前最先进的方法。

Conclusion: 该方法能够从自由稀疏图像实现高质量的表面重建，解决了传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting has become a leading reconstruction technique, known for
its high-quality novel view synthesis and detailed reconstruction. However,
most existing methods require dense, calibrated views. Reconstructing from free
sparse images often leads to poor surface due to limited overlap and
overfitting. We introduce FSFSplatter, a new approach for fast surface
reconstruction from free sparse images. Our method integrates end-to-end dense
Gaussian initialization, camera parameter estimation, and geometry-enhanced
scene optimization. Specifically, FSFSplatter employs a large Transformer to
encode multi-view images and generates a dense and geometrically consistent
Gaussian scene initialization via a self-splitting Gaussian head. It eliminates
local floaters through contribution-based pruning and mitigates overfitting to
limited views by leveraging depth and multi-view feature supervision with
differentiable camera parameters during rapid optimization. FSFSplatter
outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on widely used DTU and Replica.

*Junyu Shi,Yong Sun,Zhiyuan Zhang,Lijiang Liu,Zhengjie Zhang,Yuxin He,Qiang Nie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoGIC是一个统一的多模态运动生成框架，通过整合意图建模和视觉先验，解决了现有方法在动作执行因果逻辑和人类意图理解方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本驱动运动生成方法将合成视为语言与运动之间的双向映射，但在捕捉动作执行的因果逻辑和驱动行为的人类意图方面存在局限。缺乏视觉基础进一步限制了精度和个性化。

Method: 提出MoGIC框架，联合优化多模态条件运动生成和意图预测，引入混合注意力机制实现条件标记与运动子序列的有效局部对齐。构建了440小时的Mo440H基准数据集。

Result: 微调后，MoGIC在HumanML3D上FID降低38.6%，在Mo440H上降低34.6%，在运动描述任务中超越基于LLM的方法，并支持意图预测和视觉条件生成。

Conclusion: MoGIC通过整合意图建模和视觉先验，推进了可控运动合成和意图理解，展示了多模态生成能力。

Abstract: Existing text-driven motion generation methods often treat synthesis as a
bidirectional mapping between language and motion, but remain limited in
capturing the causal logic of action execution and the human intentions that
drive behavior. The absence of visual grounding further restricts precision and
personalization, as language alone cannot specify fine-grained spatiotemporal
details. We propose MoGIC, a unified framework that integrates intention
modeling and visual priors into multimodal motion synthesis. By jointly
optimizing multimodal-conditioned motion generation and intention prediction,
MoGIC uncovers latent human goals, leverages visual priors to enhance
generation, and exhibits versatile multimodal generative capability. We further
introduce a mixture-of-attention mechanism with adaptive scope to enable
effective local alignment between conditional tokens and motion subsequences.
To support this paradigm, we curate Mo440H, a 440-hour benchmark from 21
high-quality motion datasets. Experiments show that after finetuning, MoGIC
reduces FID by 38.6\% on HumanML3D and 34.6\% on Mo440H, surpasses LLM-based
methods in motion captioning with a lightweight text head, and further enables
intention prediction and vision-conditioned generation, advancing controllable
motion synthesis and intention understanding. The code is available at

Abstract: Dynamic 3D reconstruction from monocular videos remains difficult due to the
ambiguity inferring 3D motion from limited views and computational demands of
modeling temporally varying scenes. While recent sparse control methods
alleviate computation by reducing millions of Gaussians to thousands of control
points, they suffer from a critical limitation: they allocate points purely by
geometry, leading to static redundancy and dynamic insufficiency. We propose a
motion-adaptive framework that aligns control density with motion complexity.
Leveraging semantic and motion priors from vision foundation models, we
establish patch-token-node correspondences and apply motion-adaptive
compression to concentrate control points in dynamic regions while suppressing
redundancy in static backgrounds. Our approach achieves flexible
representational density adaptation through iterative voxelization and motion
tendency scoring, directly addressing the fundamental mismatch between control
point allocation and motion complexity. To capture temporal evolution, we
introduce spline-based trajectory parameterization initialized by 2D tracklets,
replacing MLP-based deformation fields to achieve smoother motion
representation and more stable optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate
significant improvements in reconstruction quality and efficiency over existing
state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: Net2Net结合无训练网络和预训练网络，通过RED正则化实现真实世界噪声去除，无需标记数据且能适应不同噪声模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统去噪方法依赖手工先验，难以处理真实噪声的复杂性；深度学习需要大量标记数据且泛化能力有限。

Method: 结合无监督DIP和预训练DRUNet模型，通过RED正则化实现混合框架，无训练网络适应输入图像噪声特性，预训练网络利用大规模数据集学习表示。

Result: 在基准数据集上的广泛实验表明该方法在真实世界噪声去除方面具有优越性。

Conclusion: Net2Net通过混合框架增强了不同噪声模式的泛化能力，在训练数据有限的情况下表现优异。

Abstract: Traditional denoising methods for noise removal have largely relied on
handcrafted priors, often perform well in controlled environments but struggle
to address the complexity and variability of real noise. In contrast, deep
learning-based approaches have gained prominence for learning noise
characteristics from large datasets, but these methods frequently require
extensive labeled data and may not generalize effectively across diverse noise
types and imaging conditions. In this paper, we present an innovative method,
termed as Net2Net, that combines the strengths of untrained and pre-trained
networks to tackle the challenges of real-world noise removal. The innovation
of Net2Net lies in its combination of unsupervised DIP and supervised
pre-trained model DRUNet by regularization by denoising (RED). The untrained
network adapts to the unique noise characteristics of each input image without
requiring labeled data, while the pre-trained network leverages learned
representations from large-scale datasets to deliver robust denoising
performance. This hybrid framework enhances generalization across varying noise
patterns and improves performance, particularly in scenarios with limited
training data. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the
superiority of our method for real-world noise removal.

TL;DR: Retrv-R1是首个专为多模态通用检索设计的R1风格MLLM，通过逐步推理提高检索准确性。解决了DeepSeek-R1直接应用于检索任务时的高计算成本和训练不稳定性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DeepSeek-R1展示了RL增强LLM推理能力的潜力，但直接应用于检索任务存在高计算成本（多候选推理消耗大量token）和训练不稳定性问题。

Method: 引入信息压缩模块和细节检查机制减少token数量但保留关键信息；提出新训练范式，包括使用检索定制合成CoT数据集的激活阶段，以及带有课程奖励的RL训练。

Result: Retrv-R1在多个基准测试和任务中实现了SOTA性能、高效率和强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 通过信息压缩和新的训练范式，Retrv-R1成功解决了R1风格MLLM在检索任务中的计算效率和训练稳定性问题，实现了优异的检索性能。

Abstract: The success of DeepSeek-R1 demonstrates the immense potential of using
reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance LLMs' reasoning capabilities. This paper
introduces Retrv-R1, the first R1-style MLLM specifically designed for
multimodal universal retrieval, achieving higher performance by employing
step-by-step reasoning to produce more accurate retrieval results. We find that
directly applying the methods of DeepSeek-R1 to retrieval tasks is not
feasible, mainly due to (1) the high computational cost caused by the large
token consumption required for multiple candidates with reasoning processes,
and (2) the instability and suboptimal results when directly applying RL to
train for retrieval tasks. To address these issues, Retrv-R1 introduces an
information compression module with a details inspection mechanism, which
enhances computational efficiency by reducing the number of tokens while
ensuring that critical information for challenging candidates is preserved.
Furthermore, a new training paradigm is proposed, including an activation stage
using a retrieval-tailored synthetic CoT dataset for more effective
optimization, followed by RL with a novel curriculum reward to improve both
performance and efficiency. Incorporating these novel designs, Retrv-R1
achieves SOTA performance, high efficiency, and strong generalization ability,
as demonstrated by experiments across multiple benchmarks and tasks.

TL;DR: BCA+是一个无需训练、无需反向传播的测试时自适应框架，通过动态缓存机制和贝叶斯推理，同时适应对象识别和检测任务中的分布偏移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时自适应方法要么计算成本高，要么只关注似然适应而忽略了先验的重要性。BCA+旨在解决这些问题，为视觉语言模型在真实世界分布偏移下的性能下降提供高效解决方案。

Method: BCA+引入动态缓存机制，自适应存储和更新类别嵌入、空间尺度（用于检测）以及从历史预测中推导的自适应类别先验。将自适应建模为贝叶斯推理问题，通过融合初始VLM输出和基于缓存的预测来生成最终预测。

Result: 大量实验表明，BCA+在识别和检测基准测试中达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: BCA+是一个统一、无需训练的高效框架，能够通过双自适应机制和不确定性引导融合，纠正模型的语义理解和上下文置信度，在对象识别和检测任务中都表现出色。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP and Grounding DINO have achieved
remarkable success in object recognition and detection. However, their
performance often degrades under real-world distribution shifts. Test-time
adaptation (TTA) aims to mitigate this issue by adapting models during
inference. Existing methods either rely on computationally expensive
backpropagation, which hinders real-time deployment, or focus solely on
likelihood adaptation, which overlooks the critical role of the prior. Our
prior work, Bayesian Class Adaptation (BCA), addressed these shortcomings for
object recognition by introducing a training-free framework that incorporates
adaptive priors. Building upon this foundation, we now present Bayesian Class
Adaptation plus (BCA+), a unified, training-free framework for TTA for both
object recognition and detection. BCA+ introduces a dynamic cache that
adaptively stores and updates class embeddings, spatial scales (for detection),
and, crucially, adaptive class priors derived from historical predictions. We
formulate adaptation as a Bayesian inference problem, where final predictions
are generated by fusing the initial VLM output with a cache-based prediction.
This cache-based prediction combines a dynamically updated likelihood
(measuring feature and scale similarity) and a prior (reflecting the evolving
class distribution). This dual-adaptation mechanism, coupled with
uncertainty-guided fusion, enables BCA+ to correct both the model's semantic
understanding and its contextual confidence. As a training-free method
requiring no backpropagation, BCA+ is highly efficient. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that BCA+ achieves state-of-the-art performance on both recognition
and detection benchmarks.

*Matthias Perkonigg,Patrick Rockenschaub,Georg Göbel,Adelheid Wöhrer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于脑肿瘤分类的层次化广义类别发现方法（HGCD-BT），通过结合层次聚类和对比学习，能够识别训练时未见过的肿瘤类别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有脑肿瘤分类方法局限于预定义类别，无法识别训练时未见的肿瘤类型。广义类别发现（GCD）虽能识别已知和未知类别，但缺乏对脑肿瘤层次化分类结构的考虑。

Method: 将层次聚类与对比学习相结合，在对比学习基础上引入半监督层次聚类损失函数，构建层次化广义类别发现框架。

Result: 在OpenSRH数据集上，相比最先进的GCD方法，在斑块级分类准确率提升28%，特别是在识别未见肿瘤类别方面表现优异。在数字脑肿瘤图谱的H&E染色全切片图像上也验证了方法的通用性。

Conclusion: HGCD-BT方法能够有效识别已知和未知的脑肿瘤类别，并适应不同成像模式，为神经肿瘤手术中的术中决策提供了更准确的分类工具。

Abstract: Accurate brain tumor classification is critical for intra-operative decision
making in neuro-oncological surgery. However, existing approaches are
restricted to a fixed set of predefined classes and are therefore unable to
capture patterns of tumor types not available during training. Unsupervised
learning can extract general-purpose features, but it lacks the ability to
incorporate prior knowledge from labelled data, and semi-supervised methods
often assume that all potential classes are represented in the labelled data.
Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to bridge this gap by categorizing
both known and unknown classes within unlabelled data. To reflect the
hierarchical structure of brain tumor taxonomies, in this work, we introduce
Hierarchical Generalized Category Discovery for Brain Tumor Classification
(HGCD-BT), a novel approach that integrates hierarchical clustering with
contrastive learning. Our method extends contrastive learning based GCD by
incorporating a novel semi-supervised hierarchical clustering loss. We evaluate
HGCD-BT on OpenSRH, a dataset of stimulated Raman histology brain tumor images,
achieving a +28% improvement in accuracy over state-of-the-art GCD methods for
patch-level classification, particularly in identifying previously unseen tumor
categories. Furthermore, we demonstrate the generalizability of HGCD-BT on
slide-level classification of hematoxylin and eosin stained whole-slide images
from the Digital Brain Tumor Atlas, confirming its utility across imaging
modalities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在关键问题：均匀采样会忽略关键时刻，固定时间间隔方法会错过精细线索，而强调视觉多样性的方法又忽略了查询相关性。

Method: AdaRD-Key最大化相关性-多样性最大体积目标，结合查询条件相关性评分和对数行列式多样性组件，并包含轻量级相关性感知门控机制来处理弱对齐查询。

Result: 在LongVideoBench和Video-MME上的广泛实验展示了最先进的性能，特别是在长视频上，且方法计算高效，可在单个GPU上实时运行。

Conclusion: AdaRD-Key是一种无需训练、计算高效且与现有视觉语言模型兼容的即插即用解决方案，显著提升了长视频理解能力。

Abstract: Understanding long-form videos remains a significant challenge for
vision--language models (VLMs) due to their extensive temporal length and high
information density. Most current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) rely
on uniform sampling, which often overlooks critical moments, leading to
incorrect responses to queries. In parallel, many keyframe selection approaches
impose rigid temporal spacing: once a frame is chosen, an exclusion window
suppresses adjacent timestamps to reduce redundancy. While effective at
limiting overlap, this strategy frequently misses short, fine-grained cues near
important events. Other methods instead emphasize visual diversity but neglect
query relevance. We propose AdaRD-Key, a training-free keyframe sampling module
for query-driven long-form video understanding. AdaRD-Key maximizes a unified
Relevance--Diversity Max-Volume (RD-MV) objective, combining a
query-conditioned relevance score with a log-determinant diversity component to
yield informative yet non-redundant frames. To handle broad queries with weak
alignment to the video, AdaRD-Key employs a lightweight relevance-aware gating
mechanism; when the relevance distribution indicates weak alignment, the method
seamlessly shifts into a diversity-only mode, enhancing coverage without
additional supervision. Our pipeline is training-free, computationally
efficient (running in real time on a single GPU), and compatible with existing
VLMs in a plug-and-play manner. Extensive experiments on LongVideoBench and
Video-MME demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, particularly on long-form
videos. Code available at https://github.com/Xian867/AdaRD-Key.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然视觉语言模型在多模态任务中表现出色，但其在复杂横向思维挑战（如字谜）中的认知过程仍不透明，且现有研究仅关注性能指标而忽略了底层推理过程和失败模式。

Method: 创建了包含221个字谜的系统标注数据集，涵盖六个认知类别；开发了将推理质量与答案正确性分离的评估框架；研究了三种提示策略以引出不同类型的解释过程。

Result: 发现推理质量在不同谜题类别中差异显著，模型在视觉组合方面表现出系统优势，但在缺席解释和文化象征方面存在根本性限制；提示策略显著影响认知方法和问题解决效果。

Conclusion: 可解释性应作为模型性能的组成部分而非事后考虑，提示策略对认知过程和问题解决有实质性影响。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at many multimodal tasks, yet their
cognitive processes remain opaque on complex lateral thinking challenges like
rebus puzzles. While recent work has demonstrated these models struggle
significantly with rebus puzzle solving, the underlying reasoning processes and
failure patterns remain largely unexplored. We address this gap through a
comprehensive explainability analysis that moves beyond performance metrics to
understand how VLMs approach these complex lateral thinking challenges. Our
study contributes a systematically annotated dataset of 221 rebus puzzles
across six cognitive categories, paired with an evaluation framework that
separates reasoning quality from answer correctness. We investigate three
prompting strategies designed to elicit different types of explanatory
processes and reveal critical insights into VLM cognitive processes. Our
findings demonstrate that reasoning quality varies dramatically across puzzle
categories, with models showing systematic strengths in visual composition
while exhibiting fundamental limitations in absence interpretation and cultural
symbolism. We also discover that prompting strategy substantially influences
both cognitive approach and problem-solving effectiveness, establishing
explainability as an integral component of model performance rather than a
post-hoc consideration.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本去除研究主要关注自然图像中的场景文本，但当前数据集存在地面真值伪影、文本背景过于简单、评估指标无法捕捉生成结果质量等问题，限制了跨域泛化能力。

Method: 通过对象感知放置和视觉语言模型生成内容，在复杂背景上渲染文本，构建具有干净地面真值和挑战性文本去除场景的数据集。

Result: 创建了一个适用于场景文本以外领域的文本去除基准数据集，该数据集可在Hugging Face上获取。

Conclusion: 提出的数据集合成方法能够提供更准确和具有挑战性的文本去除评估基准，解决了现有数据集的局限性。

Abstract: Text removal is a crucial task in computer vision with applications such as
privacy preservation, image editing, and media reuse. While existing research
has primarily focused on scene text removal in natural images, limitations in
current datasets hinder out-of-domain generalization or accurate evaluation. In
particular, widely used benchmarks such as SCUT-EnsText suffer from ground
truth artifacts due to manual editing, overly simplistic text backgrounds, and
evaluation metrics that do not capture the quality of generated results. To
address these issues, we introduce an approach to synthesizing a text removal
benchmark applicable to domains other than scene texts. Our dataset features
text rendered on complex backgrounds using object-aware placement and
vision-language model-generated content, ensuring clean ground truth and
challenging text removal scenarios. The dataset is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种简单、检测器无关的框架，通过模态上下文注意力（MoCA）和查询表示对齐预训练（QueryREPA）来对齐DETR风格对象查询与模态上下文，解决多模态医学目标检测中的统计异质性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在混合医学模态（如CXR、CT、MRI）上训练单一检测器时，由于异构统计和不相交表示空间导致的性能下降问题。

Method: 1. 定义模态标记：紧凑的文本派生嵌入编码成像模态；2. 通过MoCA将模态标记整合到检测过程中，通过自注意力混合对象查询表示；3. QueryREPA预训练阶段，使用任务特定的对比目标对齐查询表示与模态标记。

Result: 该方法在多种模态联合训练时，以最小开销持续提升AP，无需架构修改，为稳健的多模态医学目标检测提供了实用路径。

Conclusion: MoCA和QueryREPA共同产生模态感知、类别忠实的查询，能有效迁移到下游训练，显著改善多模态医学目标检测性能。

Abstract: Medical object detection suffers when a single detector is trained on mixed
medical modalities (e.g., CXR, CT, MRI) due to heterogeneous statistics and
disjoint representation spaces. To address this challenge, we turn to
representation alignment, an approach that has proven effective for bringing
features from different sources into a shared space. Specifically, we target
the representations of DETR-style object queries and propose a simple,
detector-agnostic framework to align them with modality context. First, we
define modality tokens: compact, text-derived embeddings encoding imaging
modality that are lightweight and require no extra annotations. We integrate
the modality tokens into the detection process via Multimodality Context
Attention (MoCA), mixing object-query representations via self-attention to
propagate modality context within the query set. This preserves DETR-style
architectures and adds negligible latency while injecting modality cues into
object queries. We further introduce QueryREPA, a short pretraining stage that
aligns query representations to their modality tokens using a task-specific
contrastive objective with modality-balanced batches. Together, MoCA and
QueryREPA produce modality-aware, class-faithful queries that transfer
effectively to downstream training. Across diverse modalities trained
altogether, the proposed approach consistently improves AP with minimal
overhead and no architectural modifications, offering a practical path toward
robust multimodality medical object detection. Project page:

Motivation: 现有方法如对比解码在构建对比样本方面存在困难，注意力操作方法敏感且缺乏稳定性，需要更有效的幻觉缓解方案。

Method: 利用LVLMs中的"图像头"，通过掩码这些头来构建对比样本进行对比解码。

Result: 在LLaVA-1.5-7b和Qwen-VL-7b上的评估显示，MaskCD在CHAIR、POPE、AMBER和MME等基准测试中有效缓解幻觉现象。

Conclusion: MaskCD能够有效减轻LVLMs的幻觉问题，同时保持模型的通用能力，为解决多模态大模型幻觉提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have shown remarkable performance in
visual-language understanding for downstream multimodal tasks. While their
capabilities are improving, problems emerge simultaneously. Among those
problems, the hallucinations have attracted much attention, which stands for
the phenomenon where LVLMs generate contradictory content to their input visual
and text contents. Many approaches have been proposed to deal with this issue,
such as contrastive decoding and attention manipulation. However, contrastive
decoding methods struggle in constructing appropriate contrastive samples, and
attention manipulation methods are highly sensitive, lacking stability. In this
work, we propose image head Masked Contrastive Decoding (MaskCD). Our approach
utilizes the "image heads" in LVLMs, masking them to construct contrastive
samples for contrastive decoding. We evaluated MaskCD on LLaVA-1.5-7b and
Qwen-VL-7b, using various benchmarks such as CHAIR, POPE, AMBER and MME. The
results demonstrate that MaskCD effectively alleviates the phenomenon of
hallucinations and retains the general capabilities of LVLMs. Corresponding

Abstract: Pose estimation is still a challenge at the small scales. Few solutions exist
to capture the 6 degrees of freedom of an object with nanometric and
microradians resolutions over relatively large ranges. Over the years, we have
proposed several fiducial marker and pattern designs to achieve reliable
performance for various microscopy applications. Centimeter ranges are possible
using pattern encoding methods, while nanometer resolutions can be achieved
using phase processing of the periodic frames. This paper presents VERNIER, an
open source phase processing software designed to provide fast and reliable
pose measurement based on pseudo-periodic patterns. Thanks to a phase-based
local thresholding algorithm, the software has proven to be particularly robust
to noise, defocus and occlusion. The successive steps of the phase processing
are presented, as well as the different types of patterns that address
different application needs. The implementation procedure is illustrated with
synthetic and experimental images. Finally, guidelines are given for selecting
the appropriate pattern design and microscope magnification lenses as a
function of the desired performance.

Motivation: 压缩视频动作识别虽然能显著降低存储和计算成本，但面临动态信息粗糙噪声大、RGB与运动模态融合不足的问题。

Method: 采用双流架构，运动流使用嵌入去噪模块的多尺度块增强表示学习，通过选择性运动补全和跨模态增强模块加强模态间交互。

Result: 在UCF-101、HMDB-51和Kinetics-400基准测试上证明了方法的有效性和效率。

Conclusion: MEACI-Net通过运动增强和跨模态交互机制，有效解决了压缩视频动作识别中的动态噪声和模态融合问题。

Abstract: Compressed video action recognition has recently drawn growing attention,
since it remarkably reduces the storage and computational cost via replacing
raw videos by sparsely sampled RGB frames and compressed motion cues (e.g.,
motion vectors and residuals). However, this task severely suffers from the
coarse and noisy dynamics and the insufficient fusion of the heterogeneous RGB
and motion modalities. To address the two issues above, this paper proposes a
novel framework, namely Attentive Cross-modal Interaction Network with Motion
Enhancement (MEACI-Net). It follows the two-stream architecture, i.e. one for
the RGB modality and the other for the motion modality. Particularly, the
motion stream employs a multi-scale block embedded with a denoising module to
enhance representation learning. The interaction between the two streams is
then strengthened by introducing the Selective Motion Complement (SMC) and
Cross-Modality Augment (CMA) modules, where SMC complements the RGB modality
with spatio-temporally attentive local motion features and CMA further combines
the two modalities with selective feature augmentation. Extensive experiments
on the UCF-101, HMDB-51 and Kinetics-400 benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness and efficiency of MEACI-Net.

Motivation: 临床诊断需要灵活的重建缺失成像模态，但现有方法面临三个挑战：如何建模不同模态对目标任务的异质贡献、如何确保融合质量控制防止噪声信息退化、如何在多输出生成中保持模态身份一致性。

Method: 将多模态医学数据视为具有质量驱动选择机制的序列帧，设计三个协作模块：PreWeightNet用于全局贡献评估、ThresholdNet用于自适应过滤、EffiWeightNet用于有效权重计算，并提出因果模态身份模块(CMIM)建立生成图像与目标模态描述之间的因果约束。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，Med-K2N方法显著优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 通过渐进增强和质量驱动选择机制，Med-K2N能够有效解决K到N医学图像合成中的关键挑战，为临床诊断提供可靠支持。

Abstract: Cross-modal medical image synthesis research focuses on reconstructing
missing imaging modalities from available ones to support clinical diagnosis.
Driven by clinical necessities for flexible modality reconstruction, we explore
K to N medical generation, where three critical challenges emerge: How can we
model the heterogeneous contributions of different modalities to various target
tasks? How can we ensure fusion quality control to prevent degradation from
noisy information? How can we maintain modality identity consistency in
multi-output generation? Driven by these clinical necessities, and drawing
inspiration from SAM2's sequential frame paradigm and clinicians' progressive
workflow of incrementally adding and selectively integrating multi-modal
information, we treat multi-modal medical data as sequential frames with
quality-driven selection mechanisms. Our key idea is to "learn" adaptive
weights for each modality-task pair and "memorize" beneficial fusion patterns
through progressive enhancement. To achieve this, we design three collaborative
modules: PreWeightNet for global contribution assessment, ThresholdNet for
adaptive filtering, and EffiWeightNet for effective weight computation.
Meanwhile, to maintain modality identity consistency, we propose the Causal
Modality Identity Module (CMIM) that establishes causal constraints between
generated images and target modality descriptions using vision-language
modeling. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed Med-K2N
outperforms state-of-the-art methods by significant margins on multiple
benchmarks. Source code is available.

Motivation: 需要准确、无损的鸡蛋质量评估方法来确保食品安全、维持产品标准和提高商业家禽生产效率。传统方法需要破坏性内部测量，而本研究旨在仅使用外部特征进行内部质量评估。

Method: 构建包含186个褐壳鸡蛋的数据集，使用预训练CNN模型提取图像特征，结合形状和重量特征，通过PCA降维、SMOTE增强和多种机器学习算法分类，最后采用集成投票机制。

Abstract: Accurate, non-destructive assessment of egg quality is critical for ensuring
food safety, maintaining product standards, and operational efficiency in
commercial poultry production. This paper introduces ELMF4EggQ, an ensemble
learning framework that employs multimodal feature fusion to classify egg grade
and freshness using only external attributes - image, shape, and weight. A
novel, publicly available dataset of 186 brown-shelled eggs was constructed,
with egg grade and freshness levels determined through laboratory-based expert
assessments involving internal quality measurements, such as yolk index and
Haugh unit. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to apply
machine learning methods for internal egg quality assessment using only
external, non-invasive features, and the first to release a corresponding
labeled dataset. The proposed framework integrates deep features extracted from
external egg images with structural characteristics such as egg shape and
weight, enabling a comprehensive representation of each egg. Image feature
extraction is performed using top-performing pre-trained CNN models (ResNet152,
DenseNet169, and ResNet152V2), followed by PCA-based dimensionality reduction,
SMOTE augmentation, and classification using multiple machine learning
algorithms. An ensemble voting mechanism combines predictions from the
best-performing classifiers to enhance overall accuracy. Experimental results

*Lorenzo Bianchi,Giacomo Pacini,Fabio Carrara,Nicola Messina,Giuseppe Amato,Fabrizio Falchi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Patch-ioner框架，将零样本图像描述从图像中心范式转向补丁中心范式，无需区域级监督即可描述任意图像区域


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有零样本描述模型仅使用全局图像表示生成整图描述，无法描述特定区域。需要一种能够描述任意图像区域（从单个补丁到非连续区域）的统一框架

Method: 将单个图像补丁作为原子描述单元，通过聚合补丁特征来描述任意区域。使用DINO等生成有意义的密集视觉特征作为骨干网络

Result: 在多个区域描述任务中达到最先进性能，包括零样本密集描述、区域集描述和新引入的轨迹描述任务

Conclusion: 补丁级语义表示对于可扩展的描述生成非常有效，为区域级图像描述提供了统一解决方案

Abstract: Zero-shot captioners are recently proposed models that utilize common-space
vision-language representations to caption images without relying on paired
image-text data. To caption an image, they proceed by textually decoding a
text-aligned image feature, but they limit their scope to global
representations and whole-image captions. We present \frameworkName{}, a
unified framework for zero-shot captioning that shifts from an image-centric to
a patch-centric paradigm, enabling the captioning of arbitrary regions without
the need of region-level supervision. Instead of relying on global image
representations, we treat individual patches as atomic captioning units and
aggregate them to describe arbitrary regions, from single patches to
non-contiguous areas and entire images. We analyze the key ingredients that
enable current latent captioners to work in our novel proposed framework.
Experiments demonstrate that backbones producing meaningful, dense visual
features, such as DINO, are key to achieving state-of-the-art performance in
multiple region-based captioning tasks. Compared to other baselines and
state-of-the-art competitors, our models achieve better performance on
zero-shot dense, region-set, and a newly introduced trace captioning task,
highlighting the effectiveness of patch-wise semantic representations for
scalable caption generation. Project page at https://paciosoft.com/Patch-ioner/ .

*Laith Nayal,Hadi Salloum,Ahmad Taha,Yaroslav Kholodov,Alexander Gasnikov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种无需训练的简单方法，利用InternImage骨干网络特征，结合K-Means聚类和置信度阈值来检测语义分割中的未知物体，在多个基准测试中超越了有监督和无监督基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉基础模型在闭集语义任务中表现出色，但其在语义分割中检测分布外区域的能力尚未充分探索。本文旨在研究这些模型是否能在没有异常监督的情况下区分分布内和分布外区域。

Method: 使用InternImage骨干网络提取特征，应用K-Means聚类并结合原始解码器logits的置信度阈值来识别分布外聚类，整个过程无需训练。

Result: 在RoadAnomaly基准测试上达到50.02平均精度，在ADE-OoD基准测试上达到48.77平均精度，使用InternImage-L模型超越了多个有监督和无监督基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为需要最少假设或额外数据的通用分布外分割方法提供了有前景的方向，展示了基础模型在异常检测方面的潜力。

Abstract: Detecting unknown objects in semantic segmentation is crucial for
safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving. Large vision
foundation models, including DINOv2, InternImage, and CLIP, have advanced
visual representation learning by providing rich features that generalize well
across diverse tasks. While their strength in closed-set semantic tasks is
established, their capability to detect out-of-distribution (OoD) regions in
semantic segmentation remains underexplored. In this work, we investigate
whether foundation models fine-tuned on segmentation datasets can inherently
distinguish in-distribution (ID) from OoD regions without any outlier
supervision. We propose a simple, training-free approach that utilizes features
from the InternImage backbone and applies K-Means clustering alongside
confidence thresholding on raw decoder logits to identify OoD clusters. Our
method achieves 50.02 Average Precision on the RoadAnomaly benchmark and 48.77
on the benchmark of ADE-OoD with InternImage-L, surpassing several supervised
and unsupervised baselines. These results suggest a promising direction for
generic OoD segmentation methods that require minimal assumptions or additional
data.

*Xin Zou,Di Lu,Yizhou Wang,Yibo Yan,Yuanhuiyi Lyu,Xu Zheng,Linfeng Zhang,Xuming Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HoloV是一个简单有效的视觉token剪枝框架，通过从整体视角重新思考token保留策略，在不同空间区域自适应分配剪枝预算，确保保留的token捕捉全局视觉上下文而非孤立特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型依赖大量视觉token导致计算开销巨大，现有基于注意力的剪枝方法在高剪枝率下性能下降明显，因为它们倾向于保留语义相似的token。

Method: 提出HoloV框架，从整体视角重新设计token保留策略，自适应地在不同空间区域分配剪枝预算，确保保留的token能捕捉全局视觉上下文。

Result: 实验结果表明HoloV在各种任务、MLLM架构和剪枝率下都优于现有方法。例如，LLaVA1.5在剪枝88.9%视觉token后仍保持95.8%的原始性能。

Conclusion: HoloV通过整体视角的token剪枝策略，实现了优越的效率-准确率权衡，有效解决了高剪枝率下性能下降的问题。

Abstract: Despite their powerful capabilities, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
suffer from considerable computational overhead due to their reliance on
massive visual tokens. Recent studies have explored token pruning to alleviate
this problem, which typically uses text-vision cross-attention or
[\texttt{CLS}] attention to assess and discard redundant visual tokens. In this
work, we identify a critical limitation of such attention-first pruning
approaches, i.e., they tend to preserve semantically similar tokens, resulting
in pronounced performance drops under high pruning ratios. To this end, we
propose {HoloV}, a simple yet effective, plug-and-play visual token pruning
framework for efficient inference. Distinct from previous attention-first
schemes, HoloV rethinks token retention from a holistic perspective. By
adaptively distributing the pruning budget across different spatial crops,
HoloV ensures that the retained tokens capture the global visual context rather
than isolated salient features. This strategy minimizes representational
collapse and maintains task-relevant information even under aggressive pruning.
Experimental results demonstrate that our HoloV achieves superior performance
across various tasks, MLLM architectures, and pruning ratios compared to SOTA
methods. For instance, LLaVA1.5 equipped with HoloV preserves 95.8\% of the
original performance after pruning 88.9\% of visual tokens, achieving superior
efficiency-accuracy trade-offs.

### [31] [Zero-Shot Robustness of Vision Language Models Via Confidence-Aware Weighting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02913)
*Nikoo Naghavian,Mostafa Tavassolipour*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Confidence-Aware Weighting (CAW)方法，通过置信度感知损失和特征对齐正则化来增强视觉语言模型的零样本鲁棒性，在保持泛化能力的同时提升清洁和对抗精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型如CLIP在零样本泛化方面表现出色，但对对抗攻击高度脆弱，需要提升其鲁棒性。

Method: CAW包含两个组件：(1) 置信度感知损失，通过缩放清洁和对抗预测之间的KL散度来优先处理不确定的对抗样本；(2) 特征对齐正则化，通过最小化冻结和微调图像编码器在对抗输入上的特征距离来保持语义一致性。

Result: 在TinyImageNet和14个额外数据集上的广泛实验表明，CAW在强攻击如AutoAttack下优于PMG-AFT和TGA-ZSR等最新方法，同时使用更少内存。

Conclusion: CAW方法有效提升了视觉语言模型的零样本鲁棒性，在保持泛化能力的同时显著改善了清洁和对抗精度。

Abstract: Vision-language models like CLIP demonstrate impressive zero-shot
generalization but remain highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks. In this
work, we propose Confidence-Aware Weighting (CAW) to enhance zero-shot
robustness in vision-language models. CAW consists of two components: (1) a
Confidence-Aware loss that prioritizes uncertain adversarial examples by
scaling the KL divergence between clean and adversarial predictions, and (2) a
feature alignment regularization that preserves semantic consistency by
minimizing the distance between frozen and fine-tuned image encoder features on
adversarial inputs. These components work jointly to improve both clean and
robust accuracy without sacrificing generalization. Extensive experiments on
TinyImageNet and 14 additional datasets show that CAW outperforms recent
methods such as PMG-AFT and TGA-ZSR under strong attacks like AutoAttack, while
using less memory.

TL;DR: 该研究评估了大型视觉语言模型在颈动脉粥样硬化疾病风险预测中的应用，通过整合超声成像与临床数据，发现现有模型在风险分类方面表现不佳，但通过领域适应和多模态整合可以显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 颈动脉粥样硬化疾病的风险评估需要整合多样化的临床和影像信息，但现有方法缺乏透明度和可解释性。研究旨在探索大型视觉语言模型在多模态颈动脉斑块评估中的潜力。

Method: 提出了一个模拟真实诊断场景的框架，比较了多种开源LVLM模型，包括通用模型和医学调优模型。使用零样本实验评估模型性能，并对LLaVa-NeXT-Vicuna模型进行超声领域的低秩适应(LoRA)微调。

Result: 零样本实验显示，并非所有LVLM都能准确识别成像模态和解剖结构，所有模型在风险分类方面表现均不佳。经过领域适应后，模型在卒中风险分层方面有显著提升，整合多模态表格数据进一步提高了特异性和平衡准确率。

Conclusion: LVLM在基于超声的心血管风险预测中既有前景也有局限性，强调了多模态整合、模型校准和领域适应对于临床转化的重要性。

Abstract: Reliable risk assessment for carotid atheromatous disease remains a major
clinical challenge, as it requires integrating diverse clinical and imaging
information in a manner that is transparent and interpretable to clinicians.
This study investigates the potential of state-of-the-art and recent large
vision-language models (LVLMs) for multimodal carotid plaque assessment by
integrating ultrasound imaging (USI) with structured clinical, demographic,
laboratory, and protein biomarker data. A framework that simulates realistic
diagnostic scenarios through interview-style question sequences is proposed,
comparing a range of open-source LVLMs, including both general-purpose and
medically tuned models. Zero-shot experiments reveal that even if they are very
powerful, not all LVLMs can accurately identify imaging modality and anatomy,
while all of them perform poorly in accurate risk classification. To address
this limitation, LLaVa-NeXT-Vicuna is adapted to the ultrasound domain using
low-rank adaptation (LoRA), resulting in substantial improvements in stroke
risk stratification. The integration of multimodal tabular data in the form of
text further enhances specificity and balanced accuracy, yielding competitive
performance compared to prior convolutional neural network (CNN) baselines
trained on the same dataset. Our findings highlight both the promise and
limitations of LVLMs in ultrasound-based cardiovascular risk prediction,
underscoring the importance of multimodal integration, model calibration, and
domain adaptation for clinical translation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法使用深度自编码器生成器参数效率低，且缺乏可解释的训练策略，需要改进多期相增强MRI合成中的共享和独立特征分离。

Method: 提出FDA-VAE模型，将输入和目标图像编码为关于标准正态分布对称的两个潜在分布，使用Y形双向训练策略增强特征分离的可解释性。

Result: 相比现有基于深度自编码器的端到端合成方法，FDA-VAE显著减少模型参数和推理时间，同时有效提升合成质量。

Conclusion: FDA-VAE为多期相增强MRI合成提供了一种轻量级且可解释的特征解耦解决方案，在参数效率和合成质量方面均优于现有方法。

Abstract: Separating shared and independent features is crucial for multi-phase
contrast-enhanced (CE) MRI synthesis. However, existing methods use deep
autoencoder generators with low parameter efficiency and lack interpretable
training strategies. In this paper, we propose Flip Distribution Alignment
Variational Autoencoder (FDA-VAE), a lightweight feature-decoupled VAE model
for multi-phase CE MRI synthesis. Our method encodes input and target images
into two latent distributions that are symmetric concerning a standard normal
distribution, effectively separating shared and independent features. The
Y-shaped bidirectional training strategy further enhances the interpretability
of feature separation. Experimental results show that compared to existing deep
autoencoder-based end-to-end synthesis methods, FDA-VAE significantly reduces
model parameters and inference time while effectively improving synthesis
quality. The source code is publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了LPG-Bench基准测试和TIT评估方法，用于评估长提示文本到图像生成的性能，解决了现有模型对长提示理解不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像模型虽然能生成高质量图像，但在理解和遵循长而详细的提示方面表现不佳，生成结果不一致。

Method: 创建了包含200个平均长度超过250词的长提示基准LPG-Bench，并提出了基于文本-图像-文本一致性的TIT评估方法，包括TIT-Score和TIT-Score-LLM两种实现。

Result: 实验表明TIT方法比CLIP-score、LMM-score等现有指标更符合人类判断，TIT-Score-LLM在成对准确率上比最强基线提高了7.31%。

Conclusion: LPG-Bench和TIT方法为评估和促进文本到图像模型的发展提供了新的视角和工具。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large multimodal models (LMMs), recent
text-to-image (T2I) models can generate high-quality images and demonstrate
great alignment to short prompts. However, they still struggle to effectively
understand and follow long and detailed prompts, displaying inconsistent
generation. To address this challenge, we introduce LPG-Bench, a comprehensive
benchmark for evaluating long-prompt-based text-to-image generation. LPG-Bench
features 200 meticulously crafted prompts with an average length of over 250
words, approaching the input capacity of several leading commercial models.
Using these prompts, we generate 2,600 images from 13 state-of-the-art models
and further perform comprehensive human-ranked annotations. Based on LPG-Bench,
we observe that state-of-the-art T2I alignment evaluation metrics exhibit poor
consistency with human preferences on long-prompt-based image generation. To
address the gap, we introduce a novel zero-shot metric based on
text-to-image-to-text consistency, termed TIT, for evaluating
long-prompt-generated images. The core concept of TIT is to quantify T2I
alignment by directly comparing the consistency between the raw prompt and the
LMM-produced description on the generated image, which includes an efficient
score-based instantiation TIT-Score and a large-language-model (LLM) based
instantiation TIT-Score-LLM. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
framework achieves superior alignment with human judgment compared to
CLIP-score, LMM-score, etc., with TIT-Score-LLM attaining a 7.31% absolute
improvement in pairwise accuracy over the strongest baseline. LPG-Bench and TIT
methods together offer a deeper perspective to benchmark and foster the
development of T2I models. All resources will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: 提出了3DEditVerse数据集和3DEditFormer模型，通过大规模配对数据和结构保持的Transformer架构，实现了无需3D掩码的高质量3D编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有3D编辑方法存在的速度慢、几何失真、依赖手动3D掩码等问题，实现跨视图一致、结构保真和细粒度可控的3D编辑。

Method: 构建3DEditVerse数据集（116,309训练对+1,500测试对），提出3DEditFormer模型，采用双引导注意力和时间自适应门控机制，在图像到3D生成中解耦可编辑区域与保留结构。

Result: 在定量和定性评估中均优于现有最先进方法，建立了实用且可扩展的3D编辑新标准。

Conclusion: 通过数据和模型的双重创新，实现了无需辅助3D掩码的精确一致3D编辑，为3D内容创作提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: 3D editing - the task of locally modifying the geometry or appearance of a 3D
asset - has wide applications in immersive content creation, digital
entertainment, and AR/VR. However, unlike 2D editing, it remains challenging
due to the need for cross-view consistency, structural fidelity, and
fine-grained controllability. Existing approaches are often slow, prone to
geometric distortions, or dependent on manual and accurate 3D masks that are
error-prone and impractical. To address these challenges, we advance both the
data and model fronts. On the data side, we introduce 3DEditVerse, the largest
paired 3D editing benchmark to date, comprising 116,309 high-quality training
pairs and 1,500 curated test pairs. Built through complementary pipelines of
pose-driven geometric edits and foundation model-guided appearance edits,
3DEditVerse ensures edit locality, multi-view consistency, and semantic
alignment. On the model side, we propose 3DEditFormer, a
3D-structure-preserving conditional transformer. By enhancing image-to-3D
generation with dual-guidance attention and time-adaptive gating, 3DEditFormer
disentangles editable regions from preserved structure, enabling precise and
consistent edits without requiring auxiliary 3D masks. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art baselines both
quantitatively and qualitatively, establishing a new standard for practical and
scalable 3D editing. Dataset and code will be released. Project:

TL;DR: 提出了一种云层注入算法模拟真实云覆盖，并引入归一化差异指数注入方法增强深度学习模型在云层遮挡条件下的土地覆盖语义分割性能，结合Sentinel-1雷达数据填补光学图像空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Sentinel-2数据集多为无云图像，在云层常见的热带地区实用性有限，需要解决云层遮挡和深度学习网络下采样过程中的空间/光谱细节丢失问题。

Method: 开发云层注入算法模拟真实云覆盖；提出轻量级方法将归一化差异指数注入最终解码层，以最小计算代价保留关键空间特征；结合Sentinel-1雷达数据与光学图像融合。

Result: 在DFC2020数据集上，NDI注入使U-Net和DeepLabV3在无云图像上的性能分别提升1.99%和2.78%；在云层覆盖条件下，结合Sentinel-1数据相比单独使用光学数据在所有模型上都取得显著性能提升。

Conclusion: 归一化差异指数注入能有效提升土地覆盖分割性能，雷达-光学融合在挑战性大气条件下表现出色，为热带地区土地覆盖监测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Supervised deep learning for land cover semantic segmentation (LCS) relies on
labeled satellite data. However, most existing Sentinel-2 datasets are
cloud-free, which limits their usefulness in tropical regions where clouds are
common. To properly evaluate the extent of this problem, we developed a cloud
injection algorithm that simulates realistic cloud cover, allowing us to test
how Sentinel-1 radar data can fill in the gaps caused by cloud-obstructed
optical imagery. We also tackle the issue of losing spatial and/or spectral
details during encoder downsampling in deep networks. To mitigate this loss, we
propose a lightweight method that injects Normalized Difference Indices (NDIs)
into the final decoding layers, enabling the model to retain key spatial
features with minimal additional computation. Injecting NDIs enhanced land
cover segmentation performance on the DFC2020 dataset, yielding improvements of
1.99% for U-Net and 2.78% for DeepLabV3 on cloud-free imagery. Under
cloud-covered conditions, incorporating Sentinel-1 data led to significant
performance gains across all models compared to using optical data alone,
highlighting the effectiveness of radar-optical fusion in challenging
atmospheric scenarios.

Abstract: Real-world image super-resolution (RealSR) aims to enhance the visual quality
of in-the-wild images, such as those captured by mobile phones. While existing
methods leveraging large generative models demonstrate impressive results, the
high computational cost and latency make them impractical for edge deployment.
In this paper, we introduce PocketSR, an ultra-lightweight, single-step model
that brings generative modeling capabilities to RealSR while maintaining high
fidelity. To achieve this, we design LiteED, a highly efficient alternative to
the original computationally intensive VAE in SD, reducing parameters by 97.5%
while preserving high-quality encoding and decoding. Additionally, we propose
online annealing pruning for the U-Net, which progressively shifts generative
priors from heavy modules to lightweight counterparts, ensuring effective
knowledge transfer and further optimizing efficiency. To mitigate the loss of
prior knowledge during pruning, we incorporate a multi-layer feature
distillation loss. Through an in-depth analysis of each design component, we
provide valuable insights for future research. PocketSR, with a model size of
146M parameters, processes 4K images in just 0.8 seconds, achieving a
remarkable speedup over previous methods. Notably, it delivers performance on
par with state-of-the-art single-step and even multi-step RealSR models, making
it a highly practical solution for edge-device applications.

Abstract: Text-to-video (T2V) generation has surged in response to challenging
questions, especially when a long video must depict multiple sequential events
with temporal coherence and controllable content. Existing methods that extend
to multi-event generation omit an inspection of the intrinsic factor in event
shifting. The paper aims to answer the central question: When and where
multi-event prompts control event transition during T2V generation. This work
introduces MEve, a self-curated prompt suite for evaluating multi-event
text-to-video (T2V) generation, and conducts a systematic study of two
representative model families, i.e., OpenSora and CogVideoX. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the importance of early intervention in denoising steps
and block-wise model layers, revealing the essential factor for multi-event
video generation and highlighting the possibilities for multi-event

Abstract: Facial Emotion Recognition (FER) is a key task in affective computing,
enabling applications in human-computer interaction, e-learning, healthcare,
and safety systems. Despite advances in deep learning, FER remains challenging
due to occlusions, illumination and pose variations, subtle intra-class
differences, and dataset imbalance that hinders recognition of minority
emotions. We present InsideOut, a reproducible FER framework built on
EfficientNetV2-S with transfer learning, strong data augmentation, and
imbalance-aware optimization. The approach standardizes FER2013 images, applies
stratified splitting and augmentation, and fine-tunes a lightweight
classification head with class-weighted loss to address skewed distributions.
InsideOut achieves 62.8% accuracy with a macro averaged F1 of 0.590 on FER2013,
showing competitive results compared to conventional CNN baselines. The novelty
lies in demonstrating that efficient architectures, combined with tailored
imbalance handling, can provide practical, transparent, and reproducible FER
solutions.

Result: 识别出两个关键因素：训练目标的离散/连续分布特性，以及训练期间条件信息提供程度。

Conclusion: 通过放松MaskGIT离散损失并添加连续JEPA目标，可以改善离散模型的组合性能。

Abstract: Compositional generalization, the ability to generate novel combinations of
known concepts, is a key ingredient for visual generative models. Yet, not all
mechanisms that enable or inhibit it are fully understood. In this work, we
conduct a systematic study of how various design choices influence
compositional generalization in image and video generation in a positive or
negative way. Through controlled experiments, we identify two key factors: (i)
whether the training objective operates on a discrete or continuous
distribution, and (ii) to what extent conditioning provides information about
the constituent concepts during training. Building on these insights, we show
that relaxing the MaskGIT discrete loss with an auxiliary continuous JEPA-based
objective can improve compositional performance in discrete models like
MaskGIT.

Motivation: 随着文本到图像扩散模型在个性化应用中的有效性增强，数据隐私、知识产权保护和未经授权使用的问题日益突出。现有基于像素空间的图像毒化方法存在噪声和伪影问题，限制了其不可察觉性。

Method: 在扩散模型的潜在空间中操作，交替进行去噪和反转过程，同时修改去噪轨迹的起点。这种轨迹偏移采样确保扰动图像在保持原始输入高视觉保真度的同时，对下游生成模型的反转和个性化具有抵抗力。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的验证表明，该方法在不可察觉性指标（PSNR、SSIM、FID）上提升了约8%-10%，在五种对抗设置下的鲁棒性平均提升了约10%，能有效抵御最先进的反转攻击。

Conclusion: 该方法将不可学习性集成到潜在扩散模型框架中，提供了一种实用且难以察觉的防御机制，能够有效保护敏感数据免受未经授权的模型适配。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in
rapid and high-fidelity personalization, even when provided with only a few
user images. However, the effectiveness of personalization techniques has lead
to concerns regarding data privacy, intellectual property protection, and
unauthorized usage. To mitigate such unauthorized usage and model replication,
the idea of generating ``unlearnable'' training samples utilizing image
poisoning techniques has emerged. Existing methods for this have limited
imperceptibility as they operate in the pixel space which results in images
with noise and artifacts. In this work, we propose a novel model-based
perturbation strategy that operates within the latent space of diffusion
models. Our method alternates between denoising and inversion while modifying
the starting point of the denoising trajectory: of diffusion models. This
trajectory-shifted sampling ensures that the perturbed images maintain high
visual fidelity to the original inputs while being resistant to inversion and
personalization by downstream generative models. This approach integrates
unlearnability into the framework of Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs), enabling a
practical and imperceptible defense against unauthorized model adaptation. We
validate our approach on four benchmark datasets to demonstrate robustness
against state-of-the-art inversion attacks. Results demonstrate that our method
achieves significant improvements in imperceptibility ($\sim 8 \% -10\%$ on
perceptual metrics including PSNR, SSIM, and FID) and robustness ( $\sim 10\%$
on average across five adversarial settings), highlighting its effectiveness in
safeguarding sensitive data.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在辐射场语义蒸馏中几何基础特征与纯视觉特征的对比效果，发现几何基础特征虽然包含更多几何细节，但在语义目标定位和姿态估计任务中表现不如纯视觉特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索几何基础语义特征在蒸馏辐射场中的潜在优势，特别是在空间任务如姿态估计中的表现。

Method: 提出SPINE框架进行无初始猜测的辐射场反演，包括基于蒸馏语义的粗反演和基于光度优化的细反演。

Result: 几何基础特征包含更精细的结构细节，但在语义目标定位任务中无显著差异，在姿态估计任务中准确率反而下降。

Conclusion: 纯视觉特征在下游任务中更具通用性，未来需要研究更有效的几何基础策略来增强预训练语义特征的性能和通用性。

Abstract: Semantic distillation in radiance fields has spurred significant advances in
open-vocabulary robot policies, e.g., in manipulation and navigation, founded
on pretrained semantics from large vision models. While prior work has
demonstrated the effectiveness of visual-only semantic features (e.g., DINO and
CLIP) in Gaussian Splatting and neural radiance fields, the potential benefit
of geometry-grounding in distilled fields remains an open question. In
principle, visual-geometry features seem very promising for spatial tasks such
as pose estimation, prompting the question: Do geometry-grounded semantic
features offer an edge in distilled fields? Specifically, we ask three critical
questions: First, does spatial-grounding produce higher-fidelity geometry-aware
semantic features? We find that image features from geometry-grounded backbones
contain finer structural details compared to their counterparts. Secondly, does
geometry-grounding improve semantic object localization? We observe no
significant difference in this task. Thirdly, does geometry-grounding enable
higher-accuracy radiance field inversion? Given the limitations of prior work
and their lack of semantics integration, we propose a novel framework SPINE for
inverting radiance fields without an initial guess, consisting of two core
components: coarse inversion using distilled semantics, and fine inversion
using photometric-based optimization. Surprisingly, we find that the pose
estimation accuracy decreases with geometry-grounded features. Our results
suggest that visual-only features offer greater versatility for a broader range
of downstream tasks, although geometry-grounded features contain more geometric
detail. Notably, our findings underscore the necessity of future research on
effective strategies for geometry-grounding that augment the versatility and
performance of pretrained semantic features.

*Beibei Lin,Tingting Chen,Robby T. Tan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeoComplete是一个基于参考图像的图像补全框架，通过引入显式3D几何引导和双分支扩散架构，显著提升了补全区域的几何一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的生成方法仅依赖扩散先验，缺乏几何线索（如相机位姿或深度），在处理目标视图与参考图像差异较大时，常产生错位或不合理的内容。

Method: 提出双分支扩散架构：一个分支从掩码目标合成缺失区域，另一个分支从投影点云提取几何特征；采用联合自注意力确保一致性；引入目标感知掩码策略指导模型关注相关参考线索。

Result: 实验表明，GeoComplete在PSNR指标上比现有最优方法提升了17.1，显著提高了几何准确性同时保持高视觉质量。

Conclusion: 通过整合几何感知的双分支扩散架构和目标感知掩码策略，GeoComplete为几何条件图像补全提供了统一且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Reference-driven image completion, which restores missing regions in a target
view using additional images, is particularly challenging when the target view
differs significantly from the references. Existing generative methods rely
solely on diffusion priors and, without geometric cues such as camera pose or
depth, often produce misaligned or implausible content. We propose GeoComplete,
a novel framework that incorporates explicit 3D structural guidance to enforce
geometric consistency in the completed regions, setting it apart from prior
image-only approaches. GeoComplete introduces two key ideas: conditioning the
diffusion process on projected point clouds to infuse geometric information,
and applying target-aware masking to guide the model toward relevant reference
cues. The framework features a dual-branch diffusion architecture. One branch
synthesizes the missing regions from the masked target, while the other
extracts geometric features from the projected point cloud. Joint
self-attention across branches ensures coherent and accurate completion. To
address regions visible in references but absent in the target, we project the
target view into each reference to detect occluded areas, which are then masked
during training. This target-aware masking directs the model to focus on useful
cues, enhancing performance in difficult scenarios. By integrating a
geometry-aware dual-branch diffusion architecture with a target-aware masking
strategy, GeoComplete offers a unified and robust solution for
geometry-conditioned image completion. Experiments show that GeoComplete
achieves a 17.1 PSNR improvement over state-of-the-art methods, significantly
boosting geometric accuracy while maintaining high visual quality.

Motivation: 解决文本到声音视频生成中的两个关键挑战：单一共享文本标题导致的模态干扰，以及跨模态特征交互机制不明确的问题。

Method: 提出分层视觉基础字幕框架生成解耦的视频和音频字幕，并设计BridgeDiT双塔扩散变换器，采用双交叉注意力机制实现双向信息交换。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法在大多数指标上达到了最先进水平，人类评估也证实了其有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了T2SV任务中的模态干扰和同步问题，为未来研究提供了重要见解，所有代码和检查点将公开发布。

Abstract: This study focuses on a challenging yet promising task,
Text-to-Sounding-Video (T2SV) generation, which aims to generate a video with
synchronized audio from text conditions, meanwhile ensuring both modalities are
aligned with text. Despite progress in joint audio-video training, two critical
challenges still remain unaddressed: (1) a single, shared text caption where
the text for video is equal to the text for audio often creates modal
interference, confusing the pretrained backbones, and (2) the optimal mechanism
for cross-modal feature interaction remains unclear. To address these
challenges, we first propose the Hierarchical Visual-Grounded Captioning (HVGC)
framework that generates pairs of disentangled captions, a video caption, and
an audio caption, eliminating interference at the conditioning stage. Based on
HVGC, we further introduce BridgeDiT, a novel dual-tower diffusion transformer,
which employs a Dual CrossAttention (DCA) mechanism that acts as a robust
``bridge" to enable a symmetric, bidirectional exchange of information,
achieving both semantic and temporal synchronization. Extensive experiments on
three benchmark datasets, supported by human evaluations, demonstrate that our
method achieves state-of-the-art results on most metrics. Comprehensive
ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of our contributions,
offering key insights for the future T2SV task. All the codes and checkpoints
will be publicly released.

TL;DR: HAVIR模型通过分离视觉皮层的两个层次区域提取不同特征，使用结构生成器和语义提取器分别处理空间和语义信息，通过Versatile Diffusion模型合成最终图像，在复杂场景下提升了重建的结构和语义质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在恢复高度复杂视觉刺激方面仍面临挑战，因为自然场景的低级特征具有异质性，而高级特征由于上下文重叠而存在语义纠缠。受视觉皮层层次表示理论启发，需要开发能分别处理结构和语义信息的方法。

Method: 将视觉皮层分为两个层次区域：结构生成器从空间处理体素提取结构信息并转换为潜在扩散先验，语义提取器将语义处理体素转换为CLIP嵌入，通过Versatile Diffusion模型集成这些组件合成最终图像。

Result: 实验结果表明HAVIR在复杂场景下提升了重建的结构和语义质量，并优于现有模型。

Conclusion: HAVIR模型通过层次化分离视觉皮层特征处理，有效解决了复杂视觉刺激重建中的结构和语义挑战，为脑活动视觉信息重建提供了新思路。

Abstract: The reconstruction of visual information from brain activity fosters
interdisciplinary integration between neuroscience and computer vision.
However, existing methods still face challenges in accurately recovering highly
complex visual stimuli. This difficulty stems from the characteristics of
natural scenes: low-level features exhibit heterogeneity, while high-level
features show semantic entanglement due to contextual overlaps. Inspired by the
hierarchical representation theory of the visual cortex, we propose the HAVIR
model, which separates the visual cortex into two hierarchical regions and
extracts distinct features from each. Specifically, the Structural Generator
extracts structural information from spatial processing voxels and converts it
into latent diffusion priors, while the Semantic Extractor converts semantic
processing voxels into CLIP embeddings. These components are integrated via the
Versatile Diffusion model to synthesize the final image. Experimental results
demonstrate that HAVIR enhances both the structural and semantic quality of
reconstructions, even in complex scenes, and outperforms existing models.

TL;DR: Mask2IV是一个用于交互中心视频生成的新框架，采用解耦的两阶段流程，无需密集掩码输入，支持通过动作描述或空间位置线索来控制交互过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成交互中心视频对于具身智能至关重要，但现有方法难以建模复杂的动态交互，且获取密集精确的掩码标注在现实应用中具有挑战性。

Method: 采用两阶段流程：首先预测演员和物体的合理运动轨迹，然后基于这些轨迹生成视频。支持通过指定交互目标对象和动作描述或空间位置线索来控制运动轨迹。

Result: 在两个涵盖人类-物体交互和机器人操作场景的基准测试中，该方法在视觉真实性和可控性方面优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: Mask2IV框架在无需密集掩码输入的情况下，实现了高质量的交互中心视频生成，并提供了灵活直观的控制能力。

Abstract: Generating interaction-centric videos, such as those depicting humans or
robots interacting with objects, is crucial for embodied intelligence, as they
provide rich and diverse visual priors for robot learning, manipulation policy
training, and affordance reasoning. However, existing methods often struggle to
model such complex and dynamic interactions. While recent studies show that
masks can serve as effective control signals and enhance generation quality,
obtaining dense and precise mask annotations remains a major challenge for
real-world use. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Mask2IV, a novel
framework specifically designed for interaction-centric video generation. It
adopts a decoupled two-stage pipeline that first predicts plausible motion
trajectories for both actor and object, then generates a video conditioned on
these trajectories. This design eliminates the need for dense mask inputs from
users while preserving the flexibility to manipulate the interaction process.
Furthermore, Mask2IV supports versatile and intuitive control, allowing users
to specify the target object of interaction and guide the motion trajectory
through action descriptions or spatial position cues. To support systematic
training and evaluation, we curate two benchmarks covering diverse action and
object categories across both human-object interaction and robotic manipulation
scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior
visual realism and controllability compared to existing baselines.

Abstract: Accurately modeling human mobility is critical for urban planning,
epidemiology, and traffic management. In this work, we introduce Markovian Reeb
Graphs, a novel framework for simulating spatiotemporal trajectories that
preserve Patterns of Life (PoLs) learned from baseline data. By combining
individual- and population-level mobility structures within a probabilistic
topological model, our approach generates realistic future trajectories that
capture both consistency and variability in daily life. Evaluations on the
Urban Anomalies dataset (Atlanta and Berlin subsets) using the Jensen-Shannon
Divergence (JSD) across population- and agent-level metrics demonstrate that
the proposed method achieves strong fidelity while remaining data- and
compute-efficient. These results position Markovian Reeb Graphs as a scalable
framework for trajectory simulation with broad applicability across diverse
urban environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脊柱疾病影响全球6.19亿人，是致残的主要原因，但AI辅助诊断因缺乏椎体层面感知的多模态数据集而受限。临床决策需要跨X光、CT和MRI在特定椎体层面进行复杂推理。

Method: 采用临床医生参与的两阶段LLM生成方法（草稿和修订），从教科书、指南、开放数据集和约1000个医院病例中构建SpineMed-450k数据集，包含超过45万条指令实例。

Result: 在SpineBench上的评估显示，现有大型视觉语言模型在细粒度椎体层面推理方面存在系统性弱点，而基于SpineMed-450k微调的模型在所有任务上均表现出显著改进。

Conclusion: 临床医生评估证实了该模型输出的诊断清晰度和实用价值，SpineMed生态系统为脊柱疾病AI诊断提供了重要基础。

Abstract: Spine disorders affect 619 million people globally and are a leading cause of
disability, yet AI-assisted diagnosis remains limited by the lack of
level-aware, multimodal datasets. Clinical decision-making for spine disorders
requires sophisticated reasoning across X-ray, CT, and MRI at specific
vertebral levels. However, progress has been constrained by the absence of
traceable, clinically-grounded instruction data and standardized,
spine-specific benchmarks. To address this, we introduce SpineMed, an ecosystem
co-designed with practicing spine surgeons. It features SpineMed-450k, the
first large-scale dataset explicitly designed for vertebral-level reasoning
across imaging modalities with over 450,000 instruction instances, and
SpineBench, a clinically-grounded evaluation framework. SpineMed-450k is
curated from diverse sources, including textbooks, guidelines, open datasets,
and ~1,000 de-identified hospital cases, using a clinician-in-the-loop pipeline
with a two-stage LLM generation method (draft and revision) to ensure
high-quality, traceable data for question-answering, multi-turn consultations,
and report generation. SpineBench evaluates models on clinically salient axes,
including level identification, pathology assessment, and surgical planning.
Our comprehensive evaluation of several recently advanced large vision-language
models (LVLMs) on SpineBench reveals systematic weaknesses in fine-grained,
level-specific reasoning. In contrast, our model fine-tuned on SpineMed-450k
demonstrates consistent and significant improvements across all tasks.
Clinician assessments confirm the diagnostic clarity and practical utility of
our model's outputs.

Motivation: 随着图像生成技术的快速发展，合成图像变得越来越逼真，带来了严重的社会风险，如虚假信息和欺诈。现有的领域特定检测方法虽然性能出色，但实际应用受限，主要因为其专业化范围窄、跨领域泛化能力差，以及缺乏集成自适应框架。

Method: UniShield创新性地集成了感知智能体和检测智能体。感知智能体智能分析图像特征以动态选择合适的检测模型，而检测智能体将各种专家检测器整合到统一框架中，并生成可解释的报告。

Result: 大量实验表明，UniShield取得了最先进的结果，超越了现有的统一方法和领域特定检测器，突显了其优越的实用性、自适应性和可扩展性。

Conclusion: UniShield通过多智能体统一框架有效解决了伪造图像检测和定位的跨领域挑战，为维护信息完整性和社会安全提供了强大的解决方案。

Abstract: With the rapid advancements in image generation, synthetic images have become
increasingly realistic, posing significant societal risks, such as
misinformation and fraud. Forgery Image Detection and Localization (FIDL) thus
emerges as essential for maintaining information integrity and societal
security. Despite impressive performances by existing domain-specific detection
methods, their practical applicability remains limited, primarily due to their
narrow specialization, poor cross-domain generalization, and the absence of an
integrated adaptive framework. To address these issues, we propose UniShield,
the novel multi-agent-based unified system capable of detecting and localizing
image forgeries across diverse domains, including image manipulation, document
manipulation, DeepFake, and AI-generated images. UniShield innovatively
integrates a perception agent with a detection agent. The perception agent
intelligently analyzes image features to dynamically select suitable detection
models, while the detection agent consolidates various expert detectors into a
unified framework and generates interpretable reports. Extensive experiments
show that UniShield achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing both existing
unified approaches and domain-specific detectors, highlighting its superior
practicality, adaptiveness, and scalability.

Abstract: We introduce ROGR, a novel approach that reconstructs a relightable 3D model
of an object captured from multiple views, driven by a generative relighting
model that simulates the effects of placing the object under novel environment
illuminations. Our method samples the appearance of the object under multiple
lighting environments, creating a dataset that is used to train a
lighting-conditioned Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) that outputs the object's
appearance under any input environmental lighting. The lighting-conditioned
NeRF uses a novel dual-branch architecture to encode the general lighting
effects and specularities separately. The optimized lighting-conditioned NeRF
enables efficient feed-forward relighting under arbitrary environment maps
without requiring per-illumination optimization or light transport simulation.
We evaluate our approach on the established TensoIR and Stanford-ORB datasets,
where it improves upon the state-of-the-art on most metrics, and showcase our
approach on real-world object captures.

Conclusion: PQGAN证明了产品量化在图像合成离散潜在表示中的强大扩展能力，为超参数选择提供了指导，并展示了在扩散模型中应用的潜力。

Abstract: Product quantisation (PQ) is a classical method for scalable vector encoding,
yet it has seen limited usage for latent representations in high-fidelity image
generation. In this work, we introduce PQGAN, a quantised image autoencoder
that integrates PQ into the well-known vector quantisation (VQ) framework of
VQGAN. PQGAN achieves a noticeable improvement over state-of-the-art methods in
terms of reconstruction performance, including both quantisation methods and
their continuous counterparts. We achieve a PSNR score of 37dB, where prior
work achieves 27dB, and are able to reduce the FID, LPIPS, and CMMD score by up
to 96%. Our key to success is a thorough analysis of the interaction between
codebook size, embedding dimensionality, and subspace factorisation, with
vector and scalar quantisation as special cases. We obtain novel findings, such
that the performance of VQ and PQ behaves in opposite ways when scaling the
embedding dimension. Furthermore, our analysis shows performance trends for PQ
that help guide optimal hyperparameter selection. Finally, we demonstrate that
PQGAN can be seamlessly integrated into pre-trained diffusion models. This
enables either a significantly faster and more compute-efficient generation, or
a doubling of the output resolution at no additional cost, positioning PQ as a
strong extension for discrete latent representation in image synthesis.

Conclusion: Memory Forcing框架成功解决了自回归视频扩散模型在有限计算预算下的长期空间一致性与生成质量权衡问题。

Abstract: Autoregressive video diffusion models have proved effective for world
modeling and interactive scene generation, with Minecraft gameplay as a
representative application. To faithfully simulate play, a model must generate
natural content while exploring new scenes and preserve spatial consistency
when revisiting explored areas. Under limited computation budgets, it must
compress and exploit historical cues within a finite context window, which
exposes a trade-off: Temporal-only memory lacks long-term spatial consistency,
whereas adding spatial memory strengthens consistency but may degrade new scene
generation quality when the model over-relies on insufficient spatial context.
We present Memory Forcing, a learning framework that pairs training protocols
with a geometry-indexed spatial memory. Hybrid Training exposes distinct
gameplay regimes, guiding the model to rely on temporal memory during
exploration and incorporate spatial memory for revisits. Chained Forward
Training extends autoregressive training with model rollouts, where chained
predictions create larger pose variations and encourage reliance on spatial
memory for maintaining consistency. Point-to-Frame Retrieval efficiently
retrieves history by mapping currently visible points to their source frames,
while Incremental 3D Reconstruction maintains and updates an explicit 3D cache.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that Memory Forcing achieves superior
long-term spatial consistency and generative quality across diverse
environments, while maintaining computational efficiency for extended
sequences.

Method: 受高阶关系建模启发，MonSTeR利用单模态和跨模态表示构建统一潜空间，捕捉模态间的复杂依赖关系。

Result: MonSTeR优于仅依赖单模态表示的三模态模型，用户研究验证了检索分数与人类偏好的一致性，并在零样本场景物体放置和运动描述任务中展示了潜空间的通用性。

Conclusion: MonSTeR为运动-场景-文本对齐提供了有效的评估工具，在多模态检索任务中表现出色，具有广泛的适用性。

Abstract: Intention drives human movement in complex environments, but such movement
can only happen if the surrounding context supports it. Despite the intuitive
nature of this mechanism, existing research has not yet provided tools to
evaluate the alignment between skeletal movement (motion), intention (text),
and the surrounding context (scene). In this work, we introduce MonSTeR, the
first MOtioN-Scene-TExt Retrieval model. Inspired by the modeling of
higher-order relations, MonSTeR constructs a unified latent space by leveraging
unimodal and cross-modal representations. This allows MonSTeR to capture the
intricate dependencies between modalities, enabling flexible but robust
retrieval across various tasks. Our results show that MonSTeR outperforms
trimodal models that rely solely on unimodal representations. Furthermore, we
validate the alignment of our retrieval scores with human preferences through a
dedicated user study. We demonstrate the versatility of MonSTeR's latent space
on zero-shot in-Scene Object Placement and Motion Captioning. Code and
pre-trained models are available at github.com/colloroneluca/MonSTeR.

*Dong Lao,Yuxiang Zhang,Haniyeh Ehsani Oskouie,Yangchao Wu,Alex Wong,Stefano Soatto*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于随机共振的测试时防御机制，通过引入微小平移扰动来对抗对抗性攻击，无需训练、架构无关且攻击类型无关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御方法依赖特征过滤或平滑，会导致信息损失，需要一种能增强鲁棒性同时最小化信息损失的测试时防御机制。

Method: 引入微小平移扰动到输入图像，对齐变换后的特征嵌入并聚合，然后映射回原始参考图像，采用闭式公式实现。

Result: 在图像分类上恢复68.1%的准确率损失，立体匹配恢复71.9%，光流恢复29.2%，首次为密集预测任务建立通用测试时防御。

Conclusion: 该方法具有训练无关、架构无关和攻击无关的特性，展现了在多种计算机视觉任务中的实用性和通用性。

Abstract: We propose a test-time defense mechanism against adversarial attacks:
imperceptible image perturbations that significantly alter the predictions of a
model. Unlike existing methods that rely on feature filtering or smoothing,
which can lead to information loss, we propose to "combat noise with noise" by
leveraging stochastic resonance to enhance robustness while minimizing
information loss. Our approach introduces small translational perturbations to
the input image, aligns the transformed feature embeddings, and aggregates them
before mapping back to the original reference image. This can be expressed in a
closed-form formula, which can be deployed on diverse existing network
architectures without introducing additional network modules or fine-tuning for
specific attack types. The resulting method is entirely training-free,
architecture-agnostic, and attack-agnostic. Empirical results show
state-of-the-art robustness on image classification and, for the first time,
establish a generic test-time defense for dense prediction tasks, including
stereo matching and optical flow, highlighting the method's versatility and
practicality. Specifically, relative to clean (unperturbed) performance, our
method recovers up to 68.1% of the accuracy loss on image classification, 71.9%
on stereo matching, and 29.2% on optical flow under various types of
adversarial attacks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有随机神经网络方法主要关注改进跨信息预测，未对整体网络架构进行显著改进，需要新的随机网络架构来提升纹理表示学习能力。

Method: 使用超球面随机嵌入结合双分支学习模块，通过新制定的优化问题构建丰富的纹理表示，捕获通道内和通道间关系。

Result: 在多个具有不同特征和挑战的纯纹理基准测试中取得了有趣的结果。

Conclusion: Mixer方法在纹理识别任务中表现出色，源代码将在发表后提供。

Abstract: Randomized neural networks for representation learning have consistently
achieved prominent results in texture recognition tasks, effectively combining
the advantages of both traditional techniques and learning-based approaches.
However, existing approaches have so far focused mainly on improving
cross-information prediction, without introducing significant advancements to
the overall randomized network architecture. In this paper, we propose Mixer, a
novel randomized neural network for texture representation learning. At its
core, the method leverages hyperspherical random embeddings coupled with a
dual-branch learning module to capture both intra- and inter-channel
relationships, further enhanced by a newly formulated optimization problem for
building rich texture representations. Experimental results have shown the
interesting results of the proposed approach across several pure texture
benchmarks, each with distinct characteristics and challenges. The source code
will be available upon publication.

TL;DR: 本文提出RULER tokens和I-MRoPE两种创新方法，解决GUI grounding中分辨率外推问题，显著提升高分辨率界面上的坐标定位精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在GUI grounding任务中面临核心瓶颈：可靠的patch-to-pixel映射在训练未见的高分辨率显示上失效，导致坐标定位精度下降。

Method: 1. RULER tokens作为显式坐标标记，让模型能够像地图网格线一样参考位置；2. Interleaved MRoPE改进空间编码，确保宽度和高度维度平等表示。

Result: 在ScreenSpot、ScreenSpot-V2和ScreenSpot-Pro数据集上的实验显示，该方法在grounding精度上获得一致提升，尤其在高分辨率界面上改进最大。

Conclusion: 通过提供显式空间指导而非依赖隐式学习，该方法能够实现跨不同分辨率和平台的更可靠GUI自动化。

Abstract: GUI grounding, the task of mapping natural-language instructions to pixel
coordinates, is crucial for autonomous agents, yet remains difficult for
current VLMs. The core bottleneck is reliable patch-to-pixel mapping, which
breaks when extrapolating to high-resolution displays unseen during training.
Current approaches generate coordinates as text tokens directly from visual
features, forcing the model to infer complex position-to-pixel mappings
implicitly; as a result, accuracy degrades and failures proliferate on new
resolutions. We address this with two complementary innovations. First, RULER
tokens serve as explicit coordinate markers, letting the model reference
positions similar to gridlines on a map and adjust rather than generate
coordinates from scratch. Second, Interleaved MRoPE (I-MRoPE) improves spatial
encoding by ensuring that width and height dimensions are represented equally,
addressing the asymmetry of standard positional schemes. Experiments on
ScreenSpot, ScreenSpot-V2, and ScreenSpot-Pro show consistent gains in
grounding accuracy, with the largest improvements on high-resolution
interfaces. By providing explicit spatial guidance rather than relying on
implicit learning, our approach enables more reliable GUI automation across
diverse resolutions and platforms.

<details>

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在通用视觉任务上表现良好，但在医学影像等专业领域的分布外任务中表现不佳，且这些领域标注数据有限且昂贵。

Method: 使用QA生成器通过标题蒸馏生成领域相关的伪问答对，并选择性更新与问答最相关的神经元，使QA生成器在蒸馏过程中高效获取领域特定知识。

Result: 在胃肠道内窥镜和体育VQA上的实验表明，LEAML在最小监督下始终优于标准微调方法。

Conclusion: LEAML框架在标签稀缺的专业领域实现了高效的多模态大语言模型适应，证明了该方法的有效性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved strong performance on
general visual benchmarks but struggle with out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks in
specialized domains such as medical imaging, where labeled data is limited and
expensive. We introduce LEAML, a label-efficient adaptation framework that
leverages both scarce labeled VQA samples and abundant unlabeled images. Our
approach generates domain-relevant pseudo question-answer pairs for unlabeled
data using a QA generator regularized by caption distillation. Importantly, we
selectively update only those neurons most relevant to question-answering,
enabling the QA Generator to efficiently acquire domain-specific knowledge
during distillation. Experiments on gastrointestinal endoscopy and sports VQA
demonstrate that LEAML consistently outperforms standard fine-tuning under
minimal supervision, highlighting the effectiveness of our proposed LEAML
framework.

*Wannan Yang,Xinchi Qiu,Lei Yu,Yuchen Zhang,Oliver Aobo Yang,Narine Kokhlikyan,Nicola Cancedda,Diego Garcia-Olano*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CASAL是一种高效的对比激活引导算法，通过将激活引导的好处直接融入模型权重，使LLM能够回答已知问题并拒绝未知问题，减少幻觉30%-40%，计算效率比LoRA基线高30倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型经常产生幻觉，自信地提供错误答案而不是承认无知。现有方法需要实时监控和干预，限制了实际部署。

Method: CASAL连接可解释性与摊销优化，通过训练单个Transformer层的子模块，将激活引导的好处直接融入模型权重。

Result: 在多个短问答基准上减少幻觉30%-40%，计算效率比LoRA基线高30倍，数据效率高20倍，并能有效泛化到分布外领域。

Conclusion: CASAL是第一个对密集和MoE模型都有效的基于引导的训练方法，为在生产系统中部署可解释性方法提供了有前景的进展。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit impressive capabilities but often
hallucinate, confidently providing incorrect answers instead of admitting
ignorance. Prior work has shown that models encode linear representations of
their own knowledge and that activation steering can reduce hallucinations.
These approaches, however, require real-time monitoring and intervention during
inference. We introduce Contrastive Activation Steering for Amortized Learning
(CASAL), an efficient algorithm that connects interpretability with amortized
optimization. CASAL directly bakes the benefits of activation steering into
model's weights. Once trained, LLMs answer questions they know while abstaining
from answering those they do not. CASAL's light-weight design requires training
only a submodule of a single transformer layer and yet reduces hallucination by
30%-40% across multiple short-form QA benchmarks. CASAL is 30x more
compute-efficient and 20x more data-efficient than strong LoRA-based baselines
such as SFT and DPO, boosting its practical applicability in data scarce
domains. Importantly, CASAL also generalizes effectively to out-of-distribution
(OOD) domains. We showcase CASAL's flexibility in mitigating hallucinations in
both text-only and vision-language models. To our knowledge, CASAL is the first
steering-based training method that has been shown to be effective for both
dense and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models. CASAL represents a promising step
forward for applying interpretability-inspired method for practical deployment
in production systems.

TL;DR: RA-FSM是一个基于GPT的模块化研究助手，使用有限状态机控制循环（相关性→置信度→知识）来减少幻觉和错误引用，通过向量检索和确定性引用管道实现可信的文献合成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然能加速文献合成，但存在幻觉和错误引用问题，限制了其在专家工作流程中的实用性。需要开发能够提供透明、有据可循答案的系统。

Method: 采用有限状态机控制循环，包含相关性过滤、可回答性评分、问题分解和按需检索。系统基于向量检索和确定性引用管道，构建包含期刊、会议、预印本和专利的知识库。

Result: 在光子学领域的盲测A/B评估中，领域专家更偏好RA-FSM而非Notebook LM和默认GPT API基线，认为其边界条件处理更好、证据使用更可靠。系统在保持可调延迟和成本的同时，探索范围超出NLM。

Conclusion: RA-FSM设计强调为高风险技术工作提供透明、有据可循的答案，可推广到其他科学领域，解决了LLM在专业应用中的幻觉和引用问题。

Abstract: Large language models accelerate literature synthesis but can hallucinate and
mis-cite, limiting their usefulness in expert workflows. We present RA-FSM
(Research Assistant - Finite State Machine), a modular GPT-based research
assistant that wraps generation in a finite-state control loop: Relevance ->
Confidence -> Knowledge. The system is grounded in vector retrieval and a
deterministic citation pipeline. The controller filters out-of-scope queries,
scores answerability, decomposes questions, and triggers retrieval only when
needed, and emits answers with confidence labels and in-corpus, de-duplicated
references. A ranked-tier ingestion workflow constructs a domain knowledge base
from journals, conferences, indices, preprints, and patents, writing both to a
dense vector index and to a relational store of normalized metrics. We
implement the system for photonics and evaluate it on six task categories:
analytical reasoning, numerical analysis, methodological critique, comparative
synthesis, factual extraction, and application design. In blinded A/B reviews,
domain experts prefer RA-FSM to both a strong Notebook LM (NLM) and a vanilla
Default GPT API call single-pass baseline, citing stronger boundary-condition
handling and more defensible evidence use. Coverage and novelty analyses
indicate that RA-FSM explores beyond the NLM while incurring tunable latency
and cost overheads. The design emphasizes transparent, well-cited answers for
high-stakes technical work and is generalizable to other scientific domains.

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合架构，将实时语音到语音模型与后端大语言模型结合，在保持低延迟的同时提升语义理解能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决实时语音对话模型缺乏深度知识和语义理解，而级联系统虽然知识丰富但延迟过高的问题

Method: 使用S2S变换器处理用户语音实现即时响应，同时将查询发送给后端LLM，将LLM的文本响应实时注入来指导S2S模型的语音生成

Result: 在MT-Bench语音合成基准测试中，系统在响应正确性上显著优于基线S2S模型，接近级联系统水平，同时保持与基线相当的延迟

Conclusion: 该混合架构成功弥合了实时S2S模型和知识丰富但延迟高的级联系统之间的差距

Abstract: Real-time speech-to-speech (S2S) models excel at generating natural,
low-latency conversational responses but often lack deep knowledge and semantic
understanding. Conversely, cascaded systems combining automatic speech
recognition, a text-based Large Language Model (LLM), and text-to-speech
synthesis offer superior knowledge representation at the cost of high latency,
which disrupts the flow of natural interaction. This paper introduces a novel
hybrid architecture that bridges the gap between these two paradigms. Our
framework processes user speech through an S2S transformer for immediate
responsiveness while concurrently relaying the query to a powerful back-end
LLM. The LLM's text-based response is then injected in real time to guide the
S2S model's speech generation, effectively infusing its output with rich
knowledge without the full latency penalty of a cascaded system. We evaluated
our method using a speech-synthesized variant of the MT-Bench benchmark that
consists of multi-turn question-answering sessions. The results demonstrate
that our system substantially outperforms a baseline S2S model in response
correctness, approaching that of a cascaded system, while maintaining a latency
on par with the baseline.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的医学多模态大语言模型在低资源环境下表现不佳，主要存在内在推理瓶颈（忽略医学图像细节）和外在推理瓶颈（缺乏专业医学知识）两大问题。

Method: 提出训练免费的代理框架AMANDA，通过内在医学知识增强（粗到细的问题分解）和外在医学知识增强（生物医学知识图谱检索）来提升推理能力。

Result: 在8个Med-VQA基准测试中，AMANDA在零样本和少样本设置下均取得显著改进。

Conclusion: AMANDA框架有效解决了医学多模态大语言模型的推理瓶颈问题，在低资源医学视觉问答任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Medical Multimodal Large Language Models (Med-MLLMs) have shown great promise
in medical visual question answering (Med-VQA). However, when deployed in
low-resource settings where abundant labeled data are unavailable, existing
Med-MLLMs commonly fail due to their medical reasoning capability bottlenecks:
(i) the intrinsic reasoning bottleneck that ignores the details from the
medical image; (ii) the extrinsic reasoning bottleneck that fails to
incorporate specialized medical knowledge. To address those limitations, we
propose AMANDA, a training-free agentic framework that performs medical
knowledge augmentation via LLM agents. Specifically, our intrinsic medical
knowledge augmentation focuses on coarse-to-fine question decomposition for
comprehensive diagnosis, while extrinsic medical knowledge augmentation grounds
the reasoning process via biomedical knowledge graph retrieval. Extensive
experiments across eight Med-VQA benchmarks demonstrate substantial
improvements in both zero-shot and few-shot Med-VQA settings. The code is

TL;DR: SelfJudge通过目标模型的自监督训练法官验证器，放宽验证标准接受与目标模型输出存在微小差异的草稿标记，从而加速LLM推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的法官解码方法依赖人工标注或具有可验证真实值的任务，限制了在不同NLP任务中的通用性。

Method: 通过评估标记替换后的响应是否保留原始响应的语义来衡量语义保留，实现跨不同NLP任务的自动验证器训练。

Result: 实验显示SelfJudge在推理-准确率权衡方面优于法官解码基线方法。

Conclusion: SelfJudge为更快的LLM推理提供了一个广泛适用的解决方案。

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates LLM inference by verifying candidate tokens
from a draft model against a larger target model. Recent judge decoding boosts
this process by relaxing verification criteria by accepting draft tokens that
may exhibit minor discrepancies from target model output, but existing methods
are restricted by their reliance on human annotations or tasks with verifiable
ground truths, limiting generalizability across diverse NLP tasks. We propose
SelfJudge, which trains judge verifiers via self-supervision of the target
model. Our method measures semantic preservation by assessing whether
token-substituted responses preserve the meaning of original responses,
enabling automatic verifier training across diverse NLP tasks. Our experiments
show SelfJudge achieves superior inference-accuracy trade-offs than judge
decoding baselines, offering a broadly applicable solution for faster LLM
inference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有长上下文语言模型训练方法（如通用文本拼接或基于启发式的方法）经常无法保证真正的长距离依赖关系，需要专门的数据构建方法

Method: 识别文档中的高熵位置，从大型语料库中检索语义相关上下文，通过评估是否降低预测熵来验证其效用，构建包含原始文档和已验证上下文补充的训练样本

Result: 使用FineWebEdu和Cosmopedia构建了128K长度序列的数据集，在RULER基准测试中表现显著提升，特别是在需要远距离信息的任务中。指令微调后在LongBenchv2上也取得实质性进展

Conclusion: 基于熵的验证对于长上下文训练是必要且有效的，EntropyLong方法能够构建具有真实长距离依赖的训练数据，提升模型的长上下文理解能力

Abstract: Training long-context language models to capture long-range dependencies
requires specialized data construction. Current approaches, such as generic
text concatenation or heuristic-based variants, frequently fail to guarantee
genuine long-range dependencies. We propose EntropyLong, a novel data
construction method that leverages predictive uncertainty to verify dependency
quality. Our approach identifies high-entropy positions in documents, retrieves
semantically relevant contexts from large corpora, and verifies their utility
by assessing whether they reduce prediction entropy. This model-in-the-loop
verification ensures each dependency represents measurable information gain
rather than spurious correlation. We construct training samples with long-range
dependencies by combining original documents with these verified contextual
supplements. Using FineWebEdu and Cosmopedia, we generate a dataset of
128K-length sequences with verified dependencies. Models trained on this data
demonstrate significant improvements on RULER benchmarks, particularly in tasks
requiring distant information. Following instruction fine-tuning, our models
also achieve substantial gains on LongBenchv2, demonstrating enhanced
long-context understanding. Extensive ablation studies further validate the
necessity and effectiveness of entropybased verification for long-context
training.

Motivation: 语言模型在对话推荐系统中具有巨大潜力，但公开的CRS数据稀缺使得微调语言模型变得困难。现有的用户模拟器生成的数据缺乏行为一致性，无法反映真实用户的对话序列。

Method: 开发了一种结合行为模拟器和语言模型提示的方法，生成与用户潜在状态一致的自然对话。通过这种方法创建了一个包含偏好引导和示例批评的大规模开源CRS数据集。

Result: 评估显示生成的对话在一致性、事实性和自然性方面表现良好，为训练语言模型为基础的对话推荐系统提供了高质量的数据。

Conclusion: 该方法能够生成行为一致、事实准确且自然的对话数据，有效解决了对话推荐系统中数据稀缺的问题，为开发更可靠的LM-based CRS提供了支持。

Abstract: While language models (LMs) offer great potential for conversational
recommender systems (CRSs), the paucity of public CRS data makes fine-tuning
LMs for CRSs challenging. In response, LMs as user simulators qua data
generators can be used to train LM-based CRSs, but often lack behavioral
consistency, generating utterance sequences inconsistent with those of any real
user. To address this, we develop a methodology for generating natural
dialogues that are consistent with a user's underlying state using behavior
simulators together with LM-prompting. We illustrate our approach by generating
a large, open-source CRS data set with both preference elicitation and example
critiquing. Rater evaluation on some of these dialogues shows them to exhibit
considerable consistency, factuality and naturalness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决SyncPool方法因使用粗粒度同步机制而牺牲嵌入容量的问题，SyncPool将模糊候选组的全部Shannon熵仅用于同步而非有效载荷嵌入

Method: look-ahead Sync方法：仅在真正不可区分的token序列上进行最小化同步采样，同时策略性地保留所有其他可区分路径以最大化嵌入容量

Result: 在英语（使用Llama 3）和中文（使用Qwen 2.5）基准测试中，该方法持续接近理论容量上限，显著优于SyncPool，特别是在较大候选池设置下

Conclusion: 这项工作代表了向实用高容量可证明安全语言隐写术的重要进展

Abstract: Neural linguistic steganography aims to embed information
  into natural text while preserving statistical undetectability. A fundamental
challenge in this ffeld stems from tokenization ambiguity in modern tokenizers,
which can lead to catastrophic decoding failures. The recent method, SyncPool,
addresses this ambiguity
  by employing a coarse-grained synchronization mechanism over groups of
ambiguous candidates. However, SyncPool sacriffces embedding capacity, as it
utilizes the entire Shannon entropy of an ambiguous group solely for
synchronization rather than for payload embedding. We propose a method named
look-ahead Sync, which overcomes the capacity limitation of SyncPool while
retaining its provable security guarantees. Our approach performs minimal
synchronized sampling only on truly indistinguishable token sequences, while
strategically preserving all other discernible paths to maximize embedding
capacity. We provide theoretical proofs for the security of our method and
analyze the gap between its achievable embedding capacity and the theoretical
upper bound. Experiments on English (using Llama 3) and Chinese (using Qwen
2.5) benchmarks show that our method consistently approaches the theoretical
capacity upper bound and signiffcantly outperforms SyncPool. The improvement in
embedding rate exceeds 160% in English and 25% in Chinese, particularly in
settings with larger candidate pools. This work represents a signiffcant step
toward practical high-capacity provably secure linguistic steganography.

Abstract: In this resource paper, we present two publicly available datasets of

them. The trajectories are publicly available GPS traces retrieved from
OpenStreetMap. Each dataset includes contextual layers such as stops, moves,

Resource Description Framework (RDF) formats, supporting semantic reasoning and
FAIR data practices. They cover two structurally distinct, large cities: Paris

customization, while the datasets support research tasks such as behavior

Conclusion: 这项工作为理解、审计和最终减轻LLM相关风险提供了一个强大的诊断工具。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, yet
their deployment is frequently undermined by undesirable behaviors such as
generating harmful content, factual inaccuracies, and societal biases.
Diagnosing the root causes of these failures poses a critical challenge for AI
safety. Existing attribution methods, particularly those based on parameter
gradients, often fall short due to prohibitive noisy signals and computational
complexity. In this work, we introduce a novel and efficient framework that
diagnoses a range of undesirable LLM behaviors by analyzing representation and
its gradients, which operates directly in the model's activation space to
provide a semantically meaningful signal linking outputs to their training
data. We systematically evaluate our method for tasks that include tracking
harmful content, detecting backdoor poisoning, and identifying knowledge
contamination. The results demonstrate that our approach not only excels at
sample-level attribution but also enables fine-grained token-level analysis,
precisely identifying the specific samples and phrases that causally influence
model behavior. This work provides a powerful diagnostic tool to understand,
audit, and ultimately mitigate the risks associated with LLMs. The code is

*Xiao-Wen Yang,Zihao Zhang,Jianuo Cao,Zhi Zhou,Zenan Li,Lan-Zhe Guo,Yuan Yao,Taolue Chen,Yu-Feng Li,Xiaoxing Ma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了FormalML基准来评估LLM在数学证明子目标补全任务中的能力，该基准基于Lean 4构建，包含4937个优化和概率不等式问题，结合了前提检索和复杂研究级上下文。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLM作为数学家实际助手的能力，特别是在填补复杂证明中缺失步骤（子目标补全）方面的潜力，目前这方面研究不足。

Method: 使用翻译策略将过程式证明转换为声明式形式，构建FormalML基准，该基准包含从机器学习基础理论中提取的4937个问题，涵盖优化和概率不等式。

Result: 对最先进证明器的评估显示在准确性和效率方面存在持续限制，表明需要更强大的基于LLM的定理证明器来有效完成子目标补全任务。

Conclusion: FormalML是第一个结合前提检索和复杂研究级上下文的子目标补全基准，突显了当前LLM在数学证明辅助方面的局限性，需要进一步改进证明器能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable progress
in formal theorem proving. Yet their ability to serve as practical assistants
for mathematicians, filling in missing steps within complex proofs, remains
underexplored. We identify this challenge as the task of subgoal completion,
where an LLM must discharge short but nontrivial proof obligations left
unresolved in a human-provided sketch. To study this problem, we introduce
FormalML, a Lean 4 benchmark built from foundational theories of machine
learning. Using a translation tactic that converts procedural proofs into
declarative form, we extract 4937 problems spanning optimization and
probability inequalities, with varying levels of difficulty. FormalML is the
first subgoal completion benchmark to combine premise retrieval and complex
research-level contexts. Evaluation of state-of-the-art provers highlights
persistent limitations in accuracy and efficiency, underscoring the need for
more capable LLM-based theorem provers for effective subgoal completion,

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 构建了首个库尔德语语义文本相似性数据集，包含10,000个句子对，涵盖正式和非正式语域，并评估了多种基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然高资源语言有丰富的语义文本相似性资源，但低资源语言如库尔德语仍然缺乏相关数据集，这限制了相关NLP任务的发展。

Method: 创建了包含10,000个库尔德语句子对的数据集，涵盖正式和非正式语域，每个句子对都标注了相似度。使用Sentence-BERT、多语言BERT等强基线模型进行基准测试。

Result: 获得了有竞争力的结果，同时揭示了库尔德语形态学、拼写变体和语码混合带来的挑战。

Conclusion: 该数据集和基线模型建立了一个可复现的评估套件，为未来库尔德语语义学和低资源NLP研究提供了坚实的基础。

Abstract: Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) measures the degree of meaning overlap
between two texts and underpins many NLP tasks. While extensive resources exist
for high-resource languages, low-resource languages such as Kurdish remain
underserved. We present, to our knowledge, the first Kurdish STS dataset:
10,000 sentence pairs spanning formal and informal registers, each annotated
for similarity. We benchmark Sentence-BERT, multilingual BERT, and other strong
baselines, obtaining competitive results while highlighting challenges arising
from Kurdish morphology, orthographic variation, and code-mixing. The dataset
and baselines establish a reproducible evaluation suite and provide a strong
starting point for future research on Kurdish semantics and low-resource NLP.

*Ishak Soltani,Francisco Belo,Bernardo Tavares*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CRACQ是一个多维评估框架，专门用于评估文档在五个特质上的表现：连贯性、严谨性、适当性、完整性和质量。该框架基于特征自动作文评分方法，扩展到机器生成文本的评估，提供基于评分标准的可解释评估方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的单一评分方法无法全面评估机器生成文档的质量，需要开发一个能够从多个维度进行可解释评估的框架。

Method: 基于特征自动作文评分方法，整合语言、语义和结构信号进行累积评估，支持整体和特质层面的分析。在500份合成资助提案上训练，并与LLM作为评判者进行基准测试。

Result: 初步结果表明，CRACQ比直接使用LLM评估产生更稳定和可解释的特质级别判断，但在可靠性和领域范围方面仍存在挑战。

Conclusion: CRACQ提供了一个有前景的多维评估框架，能够对机器生成文档进行更细致和可解释的评估，但需要进一步改进可靠性和扩展领域适应性。

Abstract: This paper presents CRACQ, a multi-dimensional evaluation framework tailored
to evaluate documents across f i v e specific traits: Coherence, Rigor,
Appropriateness, Completeness, and Quality. Building on insights from
traitbased Automated Essay Scoring (AES), CRACQ expands its fo-cus beyond
essays to encompass diverse forms of machine-generated text, providing a
rubricdriven and interpretable methodology for automated evaluation. Unlike
singlescore approaches, CRACQ integrates linguistic, semantic, and structural
signals into a cumulative assessment, enabling both holistic and trait-level
analysis. Trained on 500 synthetic grant pro-posals, CRACQ was benchmarked
against an LLM-as-a-judge and further tested on both strong and weak real
applications. Preliminary results in-dicate that CRACQ produces more stable and
interpretable trait-level judgments than direct LLM evaluation, though
challenges in reliability and domain scope remain

### [72] [Optimizing Long-Form Clinical Text Generation with Claim-Based Rewards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02338)
*Samyak Jhaveri,Praphul Singh,Jangwon Kim,Tara Taghavi,Krishnaram Kenthapadi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个结合GRPO和DocLens评估器的强化学习框架，用于生成临床文档，直接优化事实基础和完整性，无需单独训练奖励模型或依赖人工参考。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动化临床文档需要与完整性和事实基础等优先级精确对齐，现有方法存在训练成本高、依赖人工参考等问题。

Method: 使用Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)与DocLens评估器结合，DocLens提供基于对话的确定性奖励，通过简单的奖励门控策略减少训练成本。

Result: 提高了临床笔记质量，GPT-5定性评估显示在事实性、完整性和简洁性方面更受青睐，减少了遗漏和幻觉。

Conclusion: 该框架可扩展到真实世界设置，能够整合自定义目标如指南遵循或计费偏好，改进效果可能是保守的下限估计。

Abstract: Automating clinical documentation with large language models requires precise
alignment with priorities such as completeness and factual grounding. We
present an evaluation-integrated reinforcement learning framework for long-form
clinical text generation that couples Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)
with DocLens, a claim-level evaluator that provides deterministic,
dialogue-grounded rewards. Our method directly optimizes factual grounding and
completeness without training a separate reward model or relying on
human-authored references. Empirically, the approach improves clinical note
quality and reduces training cost via a simple reward-gating strategy. An
independent GPT-5 qualitative evaluation further supports these gains, showing
higher preference for GRPO outputs in factuality, completeness, and brevity,
with fewer omissions and hallucinations. Because the benchmarks are relatively
clean and the base model already well aligned, these improvements likely
represent a conservative lower bound. The framework is scalable to real-world
settings and can incorporate custom objectives such as guideline adherence or
billing preferences.

*Kevin Zhou,Adam Dejl,Gabriel Freedman,Lihu Chen,Antonio Rago,Francesca Toni*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了在基于计算论证的论证性大语言模型(ArgLLMs)中集成不确定性量化(UQ)方法，发现尽管直接提示方法简单，但在复杂声明验证任务中比其他复杂方法更有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型的广泛应用，确保其可靠性变得越来越重要。本文旨在探索如何在论证性LLM框架中集成不确定性量化方法，以提高决策的可靠性。

Method: 通过实验评估不同LLM不确定性量化方法在ArgLLMs声明验证任务中的表现，实验过程本身也是一种评估UQ方法有效性的新方式。

Result: 实验结果表明，直接提示方法虽然简单，但在ArgLLMs中是一种有效的UQ策略，明显优于更复杂的方法。

Conclusion: 在论证性LLM框架中，简单的直接提示方法可以有效地进行不确定性量化，特别适用于处理复杂且有争议的声明。

Abstract: Research in uncertainty quantification (UQ) for large language models (LLMs)
is increasingly important towards guaranteeing the reliability of this
groundbreaking technology. We explore the integration of LLM UQ methods in
argumentative LLMs (ArgLLMs), an explainable LLM framework for decision-making
based on computational argumentation in which UQ plays a critical role. We
conduct experiments to evaluate ArgLLMs' performance on claim verification
tasks when using different LLM UQ methods, inherently performing an assessment
of the UQ methods' effectiveness. Moreover, the experimental procedure itself
is a novel way of evaluating the effectiveness of UQ methods, especially when
intricate and potentially contentious statements are present. Our results
demonstrate that, despite its simplicity, direct prompting is an effective UQ
strategy in ArgLLMs, outperforming considerably more complex approaches.

*Xin Gao,Ruiyi Zhang,Daniel Du,Saurabh Mahindre,Sai Ashish Somayajula,Pengtao Xie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了通过提示让大语言模型模拟早期知识截止点的能力，发现提示方法在直接查询特定日期后信息时有效，但在处理因果相关但未直接询问的遗忘内容时效果不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在时间预测任务中广泛使用，但其对预训练数据的依赖引发污染担忧，准确预测可能反映记忆而非推理，导致对其泛化能力的高估。随着基于提示的遗忘技术出现，需要研究LLMs能否通过提示模拟早期知识截止点。

Method: 构建三个评估数据集来评估LLMs遗忘能力：(1)直接事实知识，(2)语义变化，(3)因果相关知识。使用提示方法模拟早期知识截止点。

Result: 结果显示，基于提示的模拟知识截止点在直接查询特定日期后信息时有效，但在诱导遗忘未直接询问但与查询因果相关的内容时表现不佳。

Conclusion: 这些发现强调了在将LLMs应用于时间预测任务时需要更严格的评估设置。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used for temporal prediction, but
their reliance on pretraining data raises contamination concerns, as accurate
predictions on pre-cutoff test data may reflect memorization rather than
reasoning, leading to an overestimation of their generalization capability.
With the recent emergence of prompting-based unlearning techniques, a natural
question arises: Can LLMs be prompted to simulate an earlier knowledge cutoff?
In this work, we investigate the capability of prompting to simulate earlier
knowledge cutoff in LLMs. We construct three evaluation datasets to assess the
extent to which LLMs can forget (1) direct factual knowledge, (2) semantic
shifts, and (3) causally related knowledge. Results demonstrate that while
prompt-based simulated knowledge cutoffs show effectiveness when directly
queried with the information after that date, they struggle to induce
forgetting when the forgotten content is not directly asked but causally
related to the query. These findings highlight the need for more rigorous
evaluation settings when applying LLMs for temporal prediction tasks. The full
dataset and evaluation code are available at

*Yifan Wang,Bolian Li,Junlin Wu,Zhaoxuan Tan,Zheli Liu,Ruqi Zhang,Ananth Grama,Qingkai Zeng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DRIFT是一种利用现实世界用户不满意信号进行迭代偏好训练的方法，通过动态采样正面样本来优化大语言模型，在多个基准测试中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界的大语言模型部署会产生大量隐式用户不满意信号（如修正、重述），而显式满意反馈却很稀缺。现有偏好学习方法与这种数据分布不匹配，需要昂贵的人工标注或假设有充足的正面响应。

Method: DRIFT方法以现实世界的不满意信号为基础，从不断演化的策略中动态采样正面样本进行训练，避免了梯度退化问题。

Result: 在WildBench任务得分上，7B模型提升+6.23%，14B模型提升+7.61%；在AlpacaEval2胜率上，7B模型提升+8.95%，14B模型提升+12.29%。14B模型甚至超过了GPT-4o-mini在WildBench上的表现。

Conclusion: DRIFT是一种有效且可扩展的后训练方法，能够充分利用现实世界中最丰富和最有信息量的用户信号，同时保持模型的探索能力。

Abstract: Real-world large language model deployments (e.g., conversational AI systems,
code generation assistants) naturally generate abundant implicit user
dissatisfaction (DSAT) signals, as users iterate toward better answers through
refinements, corrections, and expressed preferences, while explicit
satisfaction (SAT) feedback is scarce. Existing preference learning approaches
are poorly aligned with this data profile, as they rely on costly human
annotations or assume plentiful positive responses. In this paper, we introduce
\textbf{DRIFT} (\textbf{D}issatisfaction-\textbf{R}efined \textbf{I}terative
pre\textbf{F}erence \textbf{T}raining), which anchors training on real-world
DSAT signals and samples positives dynamically from the evolving policy.
Empirically, DRIFT models trained on real-world \textit{WildFeedback} datasets
and synthetic \textit{UltraFeedback} datasets achieve up to +6.23\% (7B) /
+7.61\% (14B) on WildBench Task Score and up to +8.95\% (7B) / +12.29\% (14B)
on AlpacaEval2 win rate over base models, outperforming strong baseline methods
such as iterative DPO and SPIN. At larger scales, the improvements are
particularly pronounced: 14B models trained with DRIFT surpass GPT-4o-mini on
WildBench. Further analysis shows that DRIFT also preserves exploratory
capacity, yielding more diverse high-reward solutions rather than collapsing to
narrow subsets. Theoretically, we demonstrate that this design preserves
preference margins and avoids the gradient degeneration. These results show
that DRIFT is an effective and scalable recipe for real-world post-training
that leverages the most abundant and informative signal. The code and data are

TL;DR: 提出了SIMPACT框架和BluePrint数据集，用于构建行为基础的社会媒体数据集，支持LLM作为社交媒体代理的训练和评估，特别关注政治话语建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏用于微调和评估LLM作为真实社交媒体代理的标准化数据资源，难以进行大规模社交媒体动态模拟研究。

Method: 开发SIMPACT框架，将匿名用户聚类为行为聚合角色，构建包含12种社交媒体互动类型的大规模数据集，并制定集群和群体层面的评估指标。

Result: 发布了基于Bluesky数据的BluePrint数据集，支持上下文依赖的互动行为建模，为政治话语建模提供评估基准。

Conclusion: SIMPACT通过标准化数据和评估协议，为推进严谨、符合伦理的社交媒体模拟奠定了基础，BluePrint可作为领域特定数据集构建的模板。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer promising capabilities for simulating
social media dynamics at scale, enabling studies that would be ethically or
logistically challenging with human subjects. However, the field lacks
standardized data resources for fine-tuning and evaluating LLMs as realistic
social media agents. We address this gap by introducing SIMPACT, the
SIMulation-oriented Persona and Action Capture Toolkit, a privacy respecting
framework for constructing behaviorally-grounded social media datasets suitable
for training agent models. We formulate next-action prediction as a task for
training and evaluating LLM-based agents and introduce metrics at both the
cluster and population levels to assess behavioral fidelity and stylistic
realism. As a concrete implementation, we release BluePrint, a large-scale
dataset built from public Bluesky data focused on political discourse.
BluePrint clusters anonymized users into personas of aggregated behaviours,
capturing authentic engagement patterns while safeguarding privacy through
pseudonymization and removal of personally identifiable information. The
dataset includes a sizable action set of 12 social media interaction types
(likes, replies, reposts, etc.), each instance tied to the posting activity
preceding it. This supports the development of agents that use
context-dependence, not only in the language, but also in the interaction
behaviours of social media to model social media users. By standardizing data
and evaluation protocols, SIMPACT provides a foundation for advancing rigorous,
ethically responsible social media simulations. BluePrint serves as both an
evaluation benchmark for political discourse modeling and a template for
building domain specific datasets to study challenges such as misinformation
and polarization.

*Peijun Zhu,Ning Yang,Jiayu Wei,Jinghang Wu,Haijun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于动态专家聚类和结构化压缩的统一框架，解决了MoE LLMs的负载不平衡、参数冗余和通信开销三难问题，在保持模型质量的同时显著提升了效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决MoE大语言模型面临的三个核心挑战：负载不平衡、参数冗余和通信开销，这些因素限制了MoE模型的可扩展性和效率。

Method: 使用动态专家聚类方法，基于参数和激活相似性定期重新分组专家；在集群内将专家权重分解为共享基础矩阵和极低秩残差适配器；采用两阶段分层路由策略；实施异构精度方案和动态卸载机制。

Result: 在GLUE和WikiText-103上评估，框架在保持标准MoE模型质量的同时，总参数减少约80%，吞吐量提高10%-20%，专家负载方差降低超过三倍。

Conclusion: 结构重组是实现可扩展、高效和内存有效的MoE LLMs的原则性路径，证明了通过动态架构重配置可以获得显著的效率提升。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Large Language Models (LLMs) face a trilemma of load
imbalance, parameter redundancy, and communication overhead. We introduce a
unified framework based on dynamic expert clustering and structured compression
to address these issues cohesively. Our method employs an online clustering
procedure that periodically regroups experts using a fused metric of parameter
and activation similarity, which stabilizes expert utilization. To our
knowledge, this is one of the first frameworks to leverage the semantic
embedding capability of the router to dynamically reconfigure the model's
architecture during training for substantial efficiency gains. Within each
cluster, we decompose expert weights into a shared base matrix and extremely
low-rank residual adapters, achieving up to fivefold parameter reduction per
group while preserving specialization. This structure enables a two-stage
hierarchical routing strategy: tokens are first assigned to a cluster, then to
specific experts within it, drastically reducing the routing search space and
the volume of all-to-all communication. Furthermore, a heterogeneous precision
scheme, which stores shared bases in FP16 and residual factors in INT4, coupled
with dynamic offloading of inactive clusters, reduces peak memory consumption
to levels comparable to dense models. Evaluated on GLUE and WikiText-103, our
framework matches the quality of standard MoE models while reducing total
parameters by approximately 80%, improving throughput by 10% to 20%, and
lowering expert load variance by a factor of over three. Our work demonstrates
that structural reorganization is a principled path toward scalable, efficient,
and memory-effective MoE LLMs.

Method: 使用检索增强生成(RAG)管道，对包括LLaMA 3.1、IBM Granite 3.3和Gemma 3在内的8个小型语言模型(7-17B参数)进行基准测试，并与GPT-4o进行比较。

Result: 研究发现，通过适当的提示和针对性检索，小型语言模型能够提供与大型语言模型相当的准确且符合教学要求的回答。

Conclusion: 小型语言模型具有显著的可持性优势，计算和能源需求较低，可在消费级硬件上实时使用，无需依赖云基础设施，是教育机构实现可持续、节能个性化学习的可行AI教学助手方案。

Abstract: The adoption of generative AI and large language models (LLMs) in education
is still emerging. In this study, we explore the development and evaluation of
AI teaching assistants that provide curriculum-based guidance using a
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline applied to selected open-source
small language models (SLMs). We benchmarked eight SLMs, including LLaMA 3.1,
IBM Granite 3.3, and Gemma 3 (7-17B parameters), against GPT-4o. Our findings
show that with proper prompting and targeted retrieval, SLMs can match LLMs in
delivering accurate, pedagogically aligned responses. Importantly, SLMs offer
significant sustainability benefits due to their lower computational and energy
requirements, enabling real-time use on consumer-grade hardware without
depending on cloud infrastructure. This makes them not only cost-effective and
privacy-preserving but also environmentally responsible, positioning them as
viable AI teaching assistants for educational institutions aiming to scale
personalized learning in a sustainable and energy-efficient manner.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: vec2vec方法虽然能找到近乎完美的文本嵌入空间对齐，但计算昂贵且不稳定，需要更简单高效的替代方案。

Method: 包含三个主要阶段：伪并行嵌入向量的初步匹配、变换拟合和迭代精炼，学习线性变换映射。

Result: mini-vec2vec在效率上比原始vec2vec高出数个数量级，同时达到或超过其性能结果。

Conclusion: 该方法具有稳定性和可解释的算法步骤，便于扩展并为新领域应用提供了机会。

Abstract: We build upon vec2vec, a procedure designed to align text embedding spaces
without parallel data. vec2vec finds a near-perfect alignment, but it is
expensive and unstable. We present mini-vec2vec, a simple and efficient
alternative that requires substantially lower computational cost and is highly
robust. Moreover, the learned mapping is a linear transformation. Our method
consists of three main stages: a tentative matching of pseudo-parallel
embedding vectors, transformation fitting, and iterative refinement. Our linear
alternative exceeds the original instantiation of vec2vec by orders of
magnitude in efficiency, while matching or exceeding their results. The
method's stability and interpretable algorithmic steps facilitate scaling and
unlock new opportunities for adoption in new domains and fields.

*Dzmitry Pihulski,Karol Charchut,Viktoria Novogrodskaia,Jan Kocoń*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMSQL是对WikiSQL数据集的系统性修订和转换，旨在解决原数据集的结构和标注问题，为LLM时代提供更清洁的自然语言问题和完整SQL查询文本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: WikiSQL数据集在早期NL2SQL研究中发挥了关键作用，但由于存在大小写敏感不一致、数据类型不匹配、语法错误和未回答问题等结构性和标注问题，其使用率下降。需要为现代自然语言到SQL模型提供更适合的基准。

Method: 对WikiSQL中的错误进行分类，并实施自动化的清理和重新标注方法。将数据集转换为提供清洁自然语言问题和完整SQL查询作为纯文本的形式。

Result: 评估了多个大型语言模型（包括Gemma 3、LLaMA 3.2、Mistral 7B等）在改进后的LLMSQL数据集上的表现。

Conclusion: LLMSQL不是简单的更新，而是作为LLM就绪的基准引入：与为指针网络模型设计的原始WikiSQL不同，LLMSQL提供清洁的自然语言问题和完整的SQL查询作为纯文本，为现代自然语言到SQL模型提供了直接的生成和评估能力。

Abstract: Converting natural language questions into SQL queries (Text-to-SQL) enables
non-expert users to interact with relational databases and has long been a
central task for natural language interfaces to data. While the WikiSQL dataset
played a key role in early NL2SQL research, its usage has declined due to
structural and annotation issues, including case sensitivity inconsistencies,
data type mismatches, syntax errors, and unanswered questions. We present
LLMSQL, a systematic revision and transformation of WikiSQL designed for the
LLM era. We classify these errors and implement automated methods for cleaning
and re-annotation. To assess the impact of these improvements, we evaluated
multiple large language models (LLMs), including Gemma 3, LLaMA 3.2, Mistral
7B, gpt-oss 20B, Phi-3.5 Mini, Qwen 2.5, OpenAI o4-mini, DeepSeek R1 and
others. Rather than serving as an update, LLMSQL is introduced as an LLM-ready
benchmark: unlike the original WikiSQL, tailored for pointer-network models
selecting tokens from input, LLMSQL provides clean natural language questions
and full SQL queries as plain text, enabling straightforward generation and
evaluation for modern natural language-to-SQL models.

TL;DR: 研究探讨LLMs在采用特定政治文化视角时如何评估政治话语的冒犯性，发现具有显式推理能力的大模型在意识形态和文化差异方面表现更一致和敏感。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在不同政治和文化视角下对冒犯性内容的评估能力，理解模型如何适应多元化的社会政治文本分类需求。

Method: 使用MD-Agreement数据集中2020年美国选举推文的多语言子集，评估多个LLMs从不同政治立场（极右、保守、中间、进步）和语言背景（英语、波兰语、俄语）判断推文冒犯性的能力。

Result: 具有显式推理能力的大模型（如DeepSeek-R1、o4-mini）在意识形态和文化差异方面表现更一致和敏感，而小模型往往无法捕捉细微差别。推理能力显著提高了冒犯性判断的个性化和可解释性。

Conclusion: 推理机制是使LLMs适应跨语言和意识形态的微妙社会政治文本分类的关键，建议在开发此类应用时重视模型的推理能力。

Abstract: We explore how large language models (LLMs) assess offensiveness in political
discourse when prompted to adopt specific political and cultural perspectives.
Using a multilingual subset of the MD-Agreement dataset centered on tweets from
the 2020 US elections, we evaluate several recent LLMs - including DeepSeek-R1,
o4-mini, GPT-4.1-mini, Qwen3, Gemma, and Mistral - tasked with judging tweets
as offensive or non-offensive from the viewpoints of varied political personas
(far-right, conservative, centrist, progressive) across English, Polish, and
Russian contexts. Our results show that larger models with explicit reasoning
abilities (e.g., DeepSeek-R1, o4-mini) are more consistent and sensitive to
ideological and cultural variation, while smaller models often fail to capture
subtle distinctions. We find that reasoning capabilities significantly improve
both the personalization and interpretability of offensiveness judgments,
suggesting that such mechanisms are key to adapting LLMs for nuanced
sociopolitical text classification across languages and ideologies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语音对话模型中的偏见问题尚未被充分研究，而副语言特征（如年龄、性别、口音）可能影响模型输出，多轮对话可能加剧偏见，影响决策和推荐任务的公平性。

Method: 使用群体不公平分数(GUS)衡量决策偏见，基于相似性的归一化统计率(SNSR)衡量推荐偏见，评估开源模型(Qwen2.5-Omni、GLM-4-Voice)和闭源API(GPT-4o Audio、Gemini-2.5-Flash)。

Result: 闭源模型总体偏见较低，开源模型对年龄和性别更敏感，推荐任务会放大跨群体差异，且偏见在多轮对话中可能持续存在。

Conclusion: 这是首个系统研究端到端语音对话模型偏见的工作，为开发公平可靠的音频交互系统提供了见解，并发布了FairDialogue数据集和评估代码。

Abstract: While biases in large language models (LLMs), such as stereotypes and
cultural tendencies in outputs, have been examined and identified, their
presence and characteristics in spoken dialogue models (SDMs) with audio input
and output remain largely unexplored. Paralinguistic features, such as age,
gender, and accent, can affect model outputs; when compounded by multi-turn
conversations, these effects may exacerbate biases, with potential implications
for fairness in decision-making and recommendation tasks. In this paper, we
systematically evaluate biases in speech LLMs and study the impact of
multi-turn dialogues with repeated negative feedback. Bias is measured using
Group Unfairness Score (GUS) for decisions and similarity-based normalized
statistics rate (SNSR) for recommendations, across both open-source models like
Qwen2.5-Omni and GLM-4-Voice, as well as closed-source APIs such as GPT-4o
Audio and Gemini-2.5-Flash. Our analysis reveals that closed-source models
generally exhibit lower bias, while open-source models are more sensitive to
age and gender, and recommendation tasks tend to amplify cross-group
disparities. We found that biased decisions may persist in multi-turn
conversations. This work provides the first systematic study of biases in
end-to-end spoken dialogue models, offering insights towards fair and reliable
audio-based interactive systems. To facilitate further research, we release the
FairDialogue dataset and evaluation code.

<details>

Motivation: 探索语言皮层中是否存在抽象的意义表征，以及这些表征是否独立于具体的语言形式。

Method: 使用视觉和语言模型生成句子对应的图像和多种释义，提取嵌入并建模神经响应，比较不同嵌入对语言皮层活动的预测准确性。

Result: 聚合多个生成图像或多种释义的嵌入能提高预测准确性，甚至超过基于原句嵌入的预测；丰富语境细节的释义进一步提升预测效果。

Conclusion: 语言皮层中存在高度抽象、形式独立的意义表征，其语义表征比语言模型更丰富和广泛。

Abstract: The human language system represents both linguistic forms and meanings, but
the abstractness of the meaning representations remains debated. Here, we
searched for abstract representations of meaning in the language cortex by
modeling neural responses to sentences using representations from vision and
language models. When we generate images corresponding to sentences and extract
vision model embeddings, we find that aggregating across multiple generated
images yields increasingly accurate predictions of language cortex responses,
sometimes rivaling large language models. Similarly, averaging embeddings
across multiple paraphrases of a sentence improves prediction accuracy compared
to any single paraphrase. Enriching paraphrases with contextual details that
may be implicit (e.g., augmenting "I had a pancake" to include details like
"maple syrup") further increases prediction accuracy, even surpassing
predictions based on the embedding of the original sentence, suggesting that
the language system maintains richer and broader semantic representations than
language models. Together, these results demonstrate the existence of highly
abstract, form-independent meaning representations within the language cortex.

TL;DR: DiffuSpec是一个免训练框架，使用预训练扩散语言模型在单次前向传播中生成多令牌草案，通过因果一致性路径搜索和自适应草案长度控制器解决扩散模型草案的挑战，实现最高3倍的加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的自回归解码方式导致延迟增加，现有推测解码方法仍依赖自回归草案器，限制了实际加速效果。

Method: 使用扩散语言模型生成多令牌草案，引入因果一致性路径搜索从令牌网格中提取左到右路径，以及自适应草案长度控制器动态调整草案长度。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，DiffuSpec实现了最高3倍的时钟加速，证明基于扩散的草案生成是自回归草案器的可行替代方案。

Conclusion: 扩散模型草案生成为推测解码提供了稳健的替代方案，显著提升了推理速度。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) scale up, accuracy improves, but the
autoregressive (AR) nature of decoding increases latency since each token
requires a serial forward pass. Speculative decoding addresses this by
employing a fast drafter to propose multi-token drafts, which are then verified
in parallel by the target model. However, many deployments still rely on AR
drafters, where sequential passes limit wall-clock gains. We revisit the
drafting stage and present DiffuSpec, a training-free drop-in framework that
uses a pretrained diffusion language model (DLM) to produce multi-token drafts
in a single forward pass, while remaining compatible with standard AR
verifiers. Because DLM drafts are generated under bidirectional conditioning,
parallel per-position candidates form a token lattice in which the locally
highest-probability token at each position need not form a causal left-to-right
path. Moreover, DLM drafting requires pre-specifying a draft length, inducing a
speed-quality trade-off. To address these challenges, we introduce two
practical components: (i) a causal-consistency path search (CPS) over this
lattice that extracts a left-to-right path aligned with AR verification; and
(ii) an adaptive draft-length (ADL) controller that adjusts next proposal size
based on recent acceptance feedback and realized generated length. Across
benchmarks, DiffuSpec yields up to 3x wall-clock speedup, establishing
diffusion-based drafting as a robust alternative to autoregressive drafters for
speculative decoding.

Abstract: Improving air quality and addressing climate change relies on accurate
understanding and analysis of air pollutant and greenhouse gas emissions.
However, emission-related knowledge is often fragmented and highly specialized,
while existing methods for accessing and compiling emissions data remain
inefficient. These issues hinder the ability of non-experts to interpret
emissions information, posing challenges to research and management. To address
this, we present Emission-GPT, a knowledge-enhanced large language model agent
tailored for the atmospheric emissions domain. Built on a curated knowledge
base of over 10,000 documents (including standards, reports, guidebooks, and
peer-reviewed literature), Emission-GPT integrates prompt engineering and
question completion to support accurate domain-specific question answering.
Emission-GPT also enables users to interactively analyze emissions data via
natural language, such as querying and visualizing inventories, analyzing
source contributions, and recommending emission factors for user-defined
scenarios. A case study in Guangdong Province demonstrates that Emission-GPT
can extract key insights--such as point source distributions and sectoral
trends--directly from raw data with simple prompts. Its modular and extensible
architecture facilitates automation of traditionally manual workflows,
positioning Emission-GPT as a foundational tool for next-generation emission
inventory development and scenario-based assessment.

Motivation: 沉默螺旋理论原本针对人类社会，但大型语言模型作为代理时，这种心理机制是否适用尚不清楚。研究旨在探索纯统计语言生成是否能在LLM群体中产生类似沉默螺旋的动态。

Method: 提出评估框架，系统控制'历史'和'个人特征'信号的可用性，使用Mann-Kendall趋势检验、Spearman秩相关以及峰度和四分位距等指标评估观点动态。

Result: 实验显示：历史和个人特征信号共同产生强烈的多数主导并复制沉默螺旋模式；仅历史信号导致强锚定效应；仅个人特征信号产生多样化但不相关的观点，表明没有历史锚定时无法出现沉默螺旋动态。

Conclusion: 研究连接了计算社会学和负责任AI设计，强调需要监控和减轻LLM代理系统中出现的从众现象。

Abstract: The Spiral of Silence (SoS) theory holds that individuals with minority views
often refrain from speaking out for fear of social isolation, enabling majority
positions to dominate public discourse. When the 'agents' are large language
models (LLMs), however, the classical psychological explanation is not directly
applicable, since SoS was developed for human societies. This raises a central
question: can SoS-like dynamics nevertheless emerge from purely statistical
language generation in LLM collectives? We propose an evaluation framework for
examining SoS in LLM agents. Specifically, we consider four controlled
conditions that systematically vary the availability of 'History' and 'Persona'
signals. Opinion dynamics are assessed using trend tests such as Mann-Kendall
and Spearman's rank, along with concentration measures including kurtosis and
interquartile range. Experiments across open-source and closed-source models
show that history and persona together produce strong majority dominance and
replicate SoS patterns; history signals alone induce strong anchoring; and
persona signals alone foster diverse but uncorrelated opinions, indicating that
without historical anchoring, SoS dynamics cannot emerge. The work bridges
computational sociology and responsible AI design, highlighting the need to
monitor and mitigate emergent conformity in LLM-agent systems.

TL;DR: ChunkLLM是一个轻量级可插拔训练框架，通过QK适配器和分块适配器解决Transformer自注意力机制二次复杂度问题，在保持性能的同时显著提升长文本处理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer大模型在自然语言处理和计算机视觉中表现出色，但由于自注意力机制的二次复杂度导致计算效率低下。现有基于块选择和压缩的方法存在语义不完整或训练-推理效率差的问题。

Method: 提出ChunkLLM框架，包含QK适配器（Q-Adapter和K-Adapter）用于特征压缩和分块注意力获取，以及分块适配器用于检测分块边界。训练时冻结主干参数，仅训练适配器，并设计了注意力蒸馏方法。推理时仅在检测到分块边界时触发块选择。

Result: 在多个长短文本基准数据集上的实验表明，ChunkLLM在短文本基准上达到可比性能，在长上下文基准上保持98.64%性能，同时保留48.58%的键值缓存。处理120K长文本时相比原始Transformer最高加速4.48倍。

Conclusion: ChunkLLM有效解决了Transformer模型的计算效率问题，在保持性能的同时显著提升了长文本处理速度，为大规模语言模型的高效应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Transformer-based large models excel in natural language processing and
computer vision, but face severe computational inefficiencies due to the
self-attention's quadratic complexity with input tokens. Recently, researchers
have proposed a series of methods based on block selection and compression to
alleviate this problem, but they either have issues with semantic
incompleteness or poor training-inference efficiency. To comprehensively
address these challenges, we propose ChunkLLM, a lightweight and pluggable
training framework. Specifically, we introduce two components: QK Adapter
(Q-Adapter and K-Adapter) and Chunk Adapter. The former is attached to each
Transformer layer, serving dual purposes of feature compression and chunk
attention acquisition. The latter operates at the bottommost layer of the
model, functioning to detect chunk boundaries by leveraging contextual semantic
information. During the training phase, the parameters of the backbone remain
frozen, with only the QK Adapter and Chunk Adapter undergoing training.
Notably, we design an attention distillation method for training the QK
Adapter, which enhances the recall rate of key chunks. During the inference
phase, chunk selection is triggered exclusively when the current token is
detected as a chunk boundary, thereby accelerating model inference.
Experimental evaluations are conducted on a diverse set of long-text and
short-text benchmark datasets spanning multiple tasks. ChunkLLM not only
attains comparable performance on short-text benchmarks but also maintains
98.64% of the performance on long-context benchmarks while preserving a 48.58%
key-value cache retention rate. Particularly, ChunkLLM attains a maximum
speedup of 4.48x in comparison to the vanilla Transformer in the processing of
120K long texts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 历史常因文化和国家意识形态而呈现不同视角，大语言模型训练数据的偏见会影响其回答的中立性，研究旨在揭示这种偏见和模型回答的不稳定性。

Method: 研究分三个阶段进行：首先让模型对历史问题给出二元回答，然后在相同问题中要求用数值评分回答，比较两种回答方式下的立场变化。

Result: 模型在二元回答中稳定性相对较高但不完美，且因语言而异；模型在不同语言或回答格式间经常改变立场，数值评分常与初始二元选择不一致；最一致的模型不一定是最准确或中立的。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了模型在特定语言语境下存在回答不一致的倾向，表明大语言模型在历史问题上的回答容易受到语言和回答格式的影响。

Abstract: In this case study, we select a set of controversial Romanian historical
questions and ask multiple Large Language Models to answer them across
languages and contexts, in order to assess their biases. Besides being a study
mainly performed for educational purposes, the motivation also lies in the
recognition that history is often presented through altered perspectives,
primarily influenced by the culture and ideals of a state, even through large
language models. Since they are often trained on certain data sets that may
present certain ambiguities, the lack of neutrality is subsequently instilled
in users. The research process was carried out in three stages, to confirm the
idea that the type of response expected can influence, to a certain extent, the
response itself; after providing an affirmative answer to some given question,
an LLM could shift its way of thinking after being asked the same question
again, but being told to respond with a numerical value of a scale. Results
show that binary response stability is relatively high but far from perfect and
varies by language. Models often flip stance across languages or between
formats; numeric ratings frequently diverge from the initial binary choice, and
the most consistent models are not always those judged most accurate or
neutral. Our research brings to light the predisposition of models to such
inconsistencies, within a specific contextualization of the language for the
question asked.

Motivation: 现有LLM智能体主要依赖环境级手册和任务级指导，但忽略了实例级上下文(如物体位置、制作配方等可验证事实)，这导致在复杂任务中经常失败。

Method: 使用TODO森林进行引导式探索，采用轻量级的计划-执行-提取循环来自动生成高精度的可重用上下文文档。

Result: 在TextWorld、ALFWorld和Crafter上的实验显示，ReAct在TextWorld的平均成功率从37%提升到95%，IGE从81%提升到95%。

Conclusion: 通过将一次性探索转化为持久可重用的知识，该方法补充了现有上下文，实现了更可靠高效的LLM智能体。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents typically receive two kinds of context: (i)
environment-level manuals that define interaction interfaces and global rules,
and (ii) task-level guidance or demonstrations tied to specific goals. In this
work, we identify a crucial but overlooked third type of context,
instance-level context, which consists of verifiable and reusable facts tied to
a specific environment instance, such as object locations, crafting recipes,
and local rules. We argue that the absence of instance-level context is a
common source of failure for LLM agents in complex tasks, as success often
depends not only on reasoning over global rules or task prompts but also on
making decisions based on precise and persistent facts. Acquiring such context
requires more than memorization: the challenge lies in efficiently exploring,
validating, and formatting these facts under tight interaction budgets. We
formalize this problem as Instance-Level Context Learning (ILCL) and introduce
our task-agnostic method to solve it. Our method performs a guided exploration,
using a compact TODO forest to intelligently prioritize its next actions and a
lightweight plan-act-extract loop to execute them. This process automatically
produces a high-precision context document that is reusable across many
downstream tasks and agents, thereby amortizing the initial exploration cost.
Experiments across TextWorld, ALFWorld, and Crafter demonstrate consistent
gains in both success and efficiency: for instance, ReAct's mean success rate
in TextWorld rises from 37% to 95%, while IGE improves from 81% to 95%. By
transforming one-off exploration into persistent, reusable knowledge, our
method complements existing contexts to enable more reliable and efficient LLM
agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在推理时面临上下文检索知识与预训练参数知识之间的冲突，当前缺乏对训练条件如何塑造知识仲裁策略的系统理解，这可能导致预训练模型产生不良仲裁行为并浪费计算资源。

Method: 在合成传记语料库上训练基于Transformer的语言模型，系统控制各种训练条件，包括文档内事实重复、信息不一致性和分布偏斜等。

Result: 实验表明文档内事实重复促进了参数和上下文能力的发展；包含不一致信息或分布偏斜的语料库训练鼓励模型发展利用参数和上下文知识的稳健策略。

Conclusion: 非理想属性（如信息不一致和分布偏斜）不应被视为需要移除的伪影，而是学习稳健知识仲裁的重要条件，这为预训练模型和谐整合参数和上下文知识提供了具体经验指导。

Abstract: Large language models often encounter conflicts between in-context knowledge
retrieved at inference time and parametric knowledge acquired during
pretraining. Models that accept external knowledge uncritically are vulnerable
to misinformation, whereas models that adhere rigidly to parametric knowledge
fail to benefit from retrieval. Despite the widespread adoption of
retrieval-augmented generation, we still lack a systematic understanding of
what shapes knowledge-arbitration strategies during training. This gap risks
producing pretrained models with undesirable arbitration behaviors and,
consequently, wasting substantial computational resources after the pretraining
budget has already been spent. To address this problem, we present the first
controlled study of how training conditions influence models' use of in-context
and parametric knowledge, and how they arbitrate between them. We train
transformer-based language models on a synthetic biographies corpus while
systematically controlling various conditions. Our experiments reveal that
intra-document repetition of facts fosters the development of both parametric
and in-context capabilities. Moreover, training on a corpus that contains
inconsistent information or distributional skew encourages models to develop
robust strategies for leveraging parametric and in-context knowledge. Rather
than viewing these non-ideal properties as artifacts to remove, our results
indicate that they are important for learning robust arbitration. These
insights offer concrete, empirical guidance for pretraining models that
harmoniously integrate parametric and in-context knowledge.

Motivation: 现代语言模型依赖参数扩展来提升性能，但将所有世界知识压缩到参数中既没必要（每个提示只使用一小部分知识）也不实用（边缘设备内存和计算资源有限）。

Method: 采用内存增强架构和与现有硬件范式对齐的预训练策略，构建小型语言模型访问大型分层参数化内存库，在预训练和推理时获取小的上下文相关内存块并添加到模型中。

Result: 160M参数模型增强18M参数内存（从4.6B内存库获取）获得与超过2倍参数常规模型相当的性能；分层前馈内存在不同Transformer架构中都能稳健工作，可扩展到超过21B参数。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了模型参数扩展的局限性，使小型模型通过访问外部内存库获得与大型模型相当的知识存储和推理能力，特别适合资源受限的边缘设备。

Abstract: The impressive performance gains of modern language models currently rely on
scaling parameters: larger models store more world knowledge and reason better.
Yet compressing all world knowledge into parameters is unnecessary, as only a
fraction is used per prompt, and impractical for edge devices with limited
inference-time memory and compute. We address this shortcoming by a
memory-augmented architecture and a pretraining strategy aligned with existing
hardware paradigms. We introduce small language models that access large
hierarchical parametric memory banks encoding world knowledge. During
pretraining and inference, we fetch a small, context-dependent memory block and
add it to the model. Our pretraining learns to store long-tail world knowledge
in the memory parameters, while the small language model acts as an anchor
capturing common knowledge and general reasoning abilities. Through
trillion-token-scale experiments, we show significant gains: a 160M-parameters
model augmented with an 18M-parameters memory fetched from a 4.6B memory bank
obtains comparable performance to a regular model with more than 2x the
parameters. Through extensive experiments, we study the optimal type and size
of parametric memories in transformers, scaling them to over 21B parameters. We
find that our proposed hierarchical feed-forward memories work robustly across
transformer architectures, whether added during pretraining or post-hoc.

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种原则性、新颖且计算高效的多LLM响应选择方案，显著提升了性能

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities, yet
selecting the most reliable response from multiple LLMs remains a challenge,
particularly in resource-constrained settings. Existing approaches often depend
on costly external verifiers, human evaluators, or self-consistency techniques
that require multiple samples from a single model. While multi-LLM systems
produce more diverse responses than single models and thus have greater
potential, they often underperform compared to single LLM self-consistency. We
propose a principled, novel and computationally efficient method to select the
best response from multiple different LLMs using a calibrated log-likelihood
score, implicitly leveraging the inherent knowledge and confidence of these
models. Our method demonstrates improvements of approx. 4%, 3%, and 5% across
both debate (multi-round LLM discussions) and non-debate (Best-of-N with
multiple LLMs) settings on GSM8K, MMLU (6 subsets), and ARC datasets

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance on general
Question Answering (QA), yet they often struggle in domain-specific scenarios
where accurate and up-to-date information is required. Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) addresses this limitation by enriching LLMs with external
knowledge, but existing systems primarily rely on unstructured documents, while
largely overlooking relational databases, which provide precise, timely, and
efficiently queryable factual information, serving as indispensable
infrastructure in domains such as finance, healthcare, and scientific research.
Motivated by this gap, we conduct a systematic analysis that reveals three
central observations: (i) databases and documents offer complementary strengths
across queries, (ii) naively combining both sources introduces noise and cost
without consistent accuracy gains, and (iii) selecting the most suitable source
for each query is crucial to balance effectiveness and efficiency. We further
observe that query types show consistent regularities in their alignment with
retrieval paths, suggesting that routing decisions can be effectively guided by
systematic rules that capture these patterns. Building on these insights, we
propose a rule-driven routing framework. A routing agent scores candidate
augmentation paths based on explicit rules and selects the most suitable one; a
rule-making expert agent refines the rules over time using QA feedback to
maintain adaptability; and a path-level meta-cache reuses past routing
decisions for semantically similar queries to reduce latency and cost.
Experiments on three QA benchmarks demonstrate that our framework consistently
outperforms static strategies and learned routing baselines, achieving higher
accuracy while maintaining moderate computational cost.

Conclusion: 研究结果为设计更可靠和可扩展的知识更新策略提供了建议，强调了理解LLMs知识更新机制的重要性。

Abstract: Knowledge editing and machine unlearning are two popular approaches for large
language models (LLMs) to stay up-to-date. However, the knowledge updating
mechanism of LLMs remains largely unexplored due to insufficient, isolated, and
small-scale evaluation. For instance, are LLMs similar to humans in modifying
certain knowledge? What differs editing and unlearning as training data
increases? This paper proposes KnowledgeSmith, a unified framework to
systematically understand the updating mechanism of LLMs. We first cast editing
and unlearning as instances of one constrained optimization problem. Then, we
propose an automatic dataset generator that provides structured interventions
across multiple graph levels and data scales, enabling controlled studies of
how different modification strategies propagate through model knowledge.
Extensive experiments demonstrate nuanced insights over knowledge propagation,
plasticity scaling, consistency, and robustness. For instance, our results show
that LLMs do not exhibit similar updating as humans for different levels of
knowledge, and there exists consistency-capacity trade-off. We hope our
findings can offer suggestions to the design of more reliable and scalable
strategies. Code: https://github.com/AIFrontierLab/KnowledgeSmith.git

TL;DR: 提出了一个系统化框架，通过数据库级别的结构化领域语句来提升LLM将自然语言查询转换为SQL的性能，使用子字符串匹配检索相关领域语句，在11个真实数据库上验证了方法的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖不现实的、针对特定查询的文本提示来表达领域知识，而自然语言查询通常使用领域特定词汇，需要理解这些词汇与数据库模式结构的关系。

Method: 提出系统化框架，在数据库级别关联结构化领域语句，使用子字符串匹配方法检索与用户查询相关的领域语句。

Result: 在11个真实数据库上测试5个开源和专有LLM，证明数据库级别的结构化领域语句比现有方法更实用准确，子字符串匹配检索比其他检索方法准确率显著更高。

Conclusion: 数据库级别的结构化领域语句结合子字符串匹配检索是提升NL到SQL转换性能的有效方法。

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) for translating Natural
Language (NL) queries into SQL varies significantly across databases (DBs). NL
queries are often expressed using a domain specific vocabulary, and mapping
these to the correct SQL requires an understanding of the embedded domain
expressions, their relationship to the DB schema structure. Existing benchmarks
rely on unrealistic, ad-hoc query specific textual hints for expressing domain
knowledge. In this paper, we propose a systematic framework for associating
structured domain statements at the database level. We present retrieval of
relevant structured domain statements given a user query using sub-string level
match. We evaluate on eleven realistic DB schemas covering diverse domains
across five open-source and proprietary LLMs and demonstrate that (1) DB level
structured domain statements are more practical and accurate than existing
ad-hoc query specific textual domain statements, and (2) Our sub-string match
based retrieval of relevant domain statements provides significantly higher
accuracy than other retrieval approaches.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究表明，仅通过文本训练的大型语言模型可以通过感官提示（如'看'或'听'）激活其内部的多模态表征能力，使其表征与专门的视觉和音频编码器更加对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索纯文本训练的LLMs是否包含隐含的多模态规律，以及是否可以通过显式感官提示来激活这些潜在表征结构。

Method: 使用感官提示（如'看'或'听'）来引导模型，让模型在缺乏实际感官输入的情况下，基于文本预测来激活相应的视觉或听觉表征。

Result: 轻量级的提示工程可以可靠地激活纯文本训练LLMs中与模态相适应的表征，使其表征与专业视觉和音频编码器更加对齐。

Conclusion: 纯文本训练的LLMs确实包含隐含的多模态结构，通过简单的感官提示就能激活这些潜在表征能力，无需实际的感官输入。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) trained purely on text ostensibly lack any
direct perceptual experience, yet their internal representations are implicitly
shaped by multimodal regularities encoded in language. We test the hypothesis
that explicit sensory prompting can surface this latent structure, bringing a
text-only LLM into closer representational alignment with specialist vision and
audio encoders. When a sensory prompt tells the model to 'see' or 'hear', it
cues the model to resolve its next-token predictions as if they were
conditioned on latent visual or auditory evidence that is never actually
supplied. Our findings reveal that lightweight prompt engineering can reliably
activate modality-appropriate representations in purely text-trained LLMs.

Motivation: 开发一个能够安全、高效地处理患者到专科医生路由、临床咨询和病情评估的AI平台，以满足医疗工作流程和IT解决方案的需求。

Method: 采用混合架构，结合有限状态机（FSM）进行结构化对话流程，以及使用大型语言模型（LLM）的协作代理来分析症状并优先转诊到合适的专科医生，基于模块化微服务框架构建。

Result: 在两个月内完成了超过55,000个内容丰富用户对话，其中2,500个经过专家标注验证。验证结果显示CLARITY在首次路由精度上超越人类水平，咨询时间比人类缩短最多3倍。

Abstract: We present CLARITY (Clinical Assistant for Routing, Inference, and Triage),
an AI-driven platform designed to facilitate patient-to-specialist routing,
clinical consultations, and severity assessment of patients' conditions. Its
hybrid architecture combines a Finite State Machine (FSM) for structured
dialogue flows with collaborative agents that employ Large Language Model (LLM)
to analyze symptoms and prioritize referrals to appropriate specialists. Built
on a modular microservices framework, CLARITY ensures safe, efficient, and
robust performance, flexible and readily scalable to meet the demands of
existing workflows and IT solutions in healthcare.
  We report integration of our clinical assistant into a large-scale
nation-wide inter-hospital IT platform, with over 55,000 content-rich user
dialogues completed within the two months of deployment, 2,500 of which were
expert-annotated for a consequent validation. The validation results show that
CLARITY surpasses human-level performance in terms of the first-attempt routing
precision, naturally requiring up to 3 times shorter duration of the
consultation than with a human.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个基于概率上下文无关文法(PCFGs)的新框架来研究语言模型如何学习语法，通过合成语言训练小模型来精确控制语法复杂性、递归深度等参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大型语言模型取得了显著成果，但对其学习动态机制了解甚少。作者希望建立一个可控的实验框架来研究语言模型如何获取语法知识。

Method: 使用PCFGs生成合成语言训练小模型，通过数学公式分析训练损失和KL散度，并进行子语法预训练实验。

Result: 发现transformer模型并行学习所有子语法，与儿童逐步学习不同；子语法预训练能改善小模型性能；模型在处理深层递归结构时存在困难。

Conclusion: 该工作为研究语言模型学习动态提供了PCFGs这一通用测试平台，揭示了神经网络在表示层次语法时的基本挑战。

Abstract: We introduce a new framework for understanding how language models acquire
syntax. While large models achieve impressive results, little is known about
their learning dynamics. Our approach starts with the observation that most
domains of interest, such as natural language syntax, coding languages,
arithmetic problems, are captured by probabilistic context-free grammars
(PCFGs). We study the learning dynamics of small models trained on synthetic
languages generated from PCFGs, enabling precise control over grammar
complexity, recursion depth, and subgrammar structure. We prove several
general, recursive formulae for the training loss and Kullback-Leibler
divergence over the subgrammar structure of a PCFG. Empirically, we find that
unlike children, who first master simple substructures before progressing to
more complex constructions, transformers reduce loss across all subgrammars in
parallel. We further show that subgrammar pretraining can improve the final
loss for smaller models, and that pretrained models develop internal
representations more aligned with the grammar's substructure. Finally, we
demonstrate that models struggle with deeper recursive structures (a limitation
even of large language models), revealing fundamental challenges in how neural
networks represent hierarchical syntax. Overall, our work initiates the study
of the learning dynamics of transformers on PCFGs as a versatile testbed for
probing learning in language models, opening a research direction with many
open questions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Cobweb框架通过构建层次化原型树，实现从粗到细的文档检索，提供多粒度相关性信号和可解释的检索路径，在保持竞争力的同时增强了检索的鲁棒性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统神经文档检索将语料库视为扁平向量云，忽视了语料库结构，导致结构利用不足和解释不透明。

Method: 使用Cobweb框架将句子嵌入组织成原型树，通过从粗到细的遍历方式对文档进行排序。内部节点作为概念原型，提供多粒度相关性信号。实现了两种推理方法：广义最佳优先搜索和轻量级路径求和排序器。

Result: 在MS MARCO和QQP数据集上，使用编码器（BERT/T5）和解码器（GPT-2）表示进行评估。结果显示，在强编码器嵌入上检索方法匹配点积搜索性能，同时在kNN性能下降时保持鲁棒性：使用GPT-2向量时点积性能崩溃，而Cobweb方法仍能检索相关结果。

Conclusion: Cobweb提供了具有竞争力的有效性、对嵌入质量的改进鲁棒性、可扩展性以及通过层次化原型实现的可解释检索。

Abstract: Neural document retrieval often treats a corpus as a flat cloud of vectors
scored at a single granularity, leaving corpus structure underused and
explanations opaque. We use Cobweb--a hierarchy-aware framework--to organize
sentence embeddings into a prototype tree and rank documents via coarse-to-fine
traversal. Internal nodes act as concept prototypes, providing multi-granular
relevance signals and a transparent rationale through retrieval paths. We
instantiate two inference approaches: a generalized best-first search and a
lightweight path-sum ranker. We evaluate our approaches on MS MARCO and QQP
with encoder (e.g., BERT/T5) and decoder (GPT-2) representations. Our results
show that our retrieval approaches match the dot product search on strong
encoder embeddings while remaining robust when kNN degrades: with GPT-2
vectors, dot product performance collapses whereas our approaches still
retrieve relevant results. Overall, our experiments suggest that Cobweb
provides competitive effectiveness, improved robustness to embedding quality,
scalability, and interpretable retrieval via hierarchical prototypes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统评估指标难以有效捕捉现代LLM生成内容的关键特征，RAG系统评估仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 扩展RAGAS框架为基于知识图谱的评估范式，引入多跳推理和语义社区聚类技术。

Result: 与RAGAS评分相比，该方法能更敏感地捕捉生成输出的细微语义差异，且与人工标注具有良好相关性。

Conclusion: 基于知识图谱的评估方法为RAG系统提供了更深入的理解和更细致的性能视角，并指出了未来研究方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) has become a significant research focus and is
utilized in various fields, such as text generation and dialog systems. One of
the most essential applications of LLM is Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG),
which greatly enhances generated content's reliability and relevance. However,
evaluating RAG systems remains a challenging task. Traditional evaluation
metrics struggle to effectively capture the key features of modern
LLM-generated content that often exhibits high fluency and naturalness.
Inspired by the RAGAS tool, a well-known RAG evaluation framework, we extended
this framework into a KG-based evaluation paradigm, enabling multi-hop
reasoning and semantic community clustering to derive more comprehensive
scoring metrics. By incorporating these comprehensive evaluation criteria, we
gain a deeper understanding of RAG systems and a more nuanced perspective on
their performance. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we compare
its performance with RAGAS scores and construct a human-annotated subset to
assess the correlation between human judgments and automated metrics. In
addition, we conduct targeted experiments to demonstrate that our KG-based
evaluation method is more sensitive to subtle semantic differences in generated
outputs. Finally, we discuss the key challenges in evaluating RAG systems and
highlight potential directions for future research.

Motivation: 理解语音语言模型中模态适配器如何将语音编码器输出转换为语言模型可理解的表征，目前对此关键组件的工作机制了解甚少。

Method: 通过寻找模态适配器输出表征与解码器语言模型token的最近邻，分析三种语音语言模型的MA表征策略。

Result: 发现两种MA表征策略：使用Whisper编码器的模型通过英语中介语表示语义，能处理未见语言；其他模型则用英语单词表示语音特征。

Conclusion: MA表征策略取决于语音编码器的训练目标——仅用于语音识别还是也用于翻译，这影响了模型处理多语言语音的能力。

Abstract: Spoken language models (SLMs) that integrate speech with large language
models (LMs) rely on modality adapters (MAs) to map the output of speech
encoders to a representation that is understandable to the decoder LM. Yet we
know very little about how these crucial MAs transform representations. Here we
examine the MA output representation in three SLMs (SALMONN, Qwen2-Audio and
Phi-4-Multimodal-Instruct). By finding the nearest decoder LM token to an MA
representation, we uncover two strategies for MA representations. For models
using a Whisper encoder, MAs appear to represent the meaning of the input using
an English-based interlingua, allowing them to handle languages unseen in
instruction tuning. For models that don't, like Phi-4-Multimodal-Instruct, MAs
instead represent the phonetics of the input, but expressed with English words.
We hypothesise that which arises depends on whether the speech encoder is
trained only for speech recognition or also for translation.

<details>

Motivation: 语言模型如何利用上下文信息对用户来说是不透明的，现有工作缺乏对高亮解释方法在准确解释上下文利用方面的有效性评估。

Method: 使用已知真实上下文使用情况的受控测试案例构建黄金标准评估框架，评估了四种高亮解释方法（包括新提出的MechLight方法）在四种上下文场景、四个数据集和五个语言模型中的表现。

Result: MechLight在所有上下文场景中表现最佳，但所有方法在处理较长上下文时都存在困难，并表现出位置偏见。

Conclusion: 高亮解释方法在提供可靠的上下文利用解释方面仍面临基本挑战，需要新方法来实现在大规模应用中的可靠解释。

Abstract: Context utilisation, the ability of Language Models (LMs) to incorporate
relevant information from the provided context when generating responses,
remains largely opaque to users, who cannot determine whether models draw from
parametric memory or provided context, nor identify which specific context
pieces inform the response. Highlight explanations (HEs) offer a natural
solution as they can point the exact context pieces and tokens that influenced
model outputs. However, no existing work evaluates their effectiveness in
accurately explaining context utilisation. We address this gap by introducing
the first gold standard HE evaluation framework for context attribution, using
controlled test cases with known ground-truth context usage, which avoids the
limitations of existing indirect proxy evaluations. To demonstrate the
framework's broad applicability, we evaluate four HE methods -- three
established techniques and MechLight, a mechanistic interpretability approach
we adapt for this task -- across four context scenarios, four datasets, and
five LMs. Overall, we find that MechLight performs best across all context
scenarios. However, all methods struggle with longer contexts and exhibit
positional biases, pointing to fundamental challenges in explanation accuracy
that require new approaches to deliver reliable context utilisation
explanations at scale.

TL;DR: 用户与LLM聊天机器人和人类客服的沟通风格存在显著差异，包括语法流畅度、礼貌程度和词汇多样性。为增强LLM对部署后沟通风格变化的适应性，数据增强策略比推理时消息重构更有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在客户服务中的广泛应用，了解用户与聊天机器人和人类客服的沟通差异对于改进模型性能至关重要，因为仅基于人-人交互数据训练的模型可能无法适应部署后的沟通风格变化。

Method: 研究分析了用户与聊天机器人和人类客服的沟通差异，并测试了两种增强策略：后训练阶段的数据增强和推理时用户消息重构。

Result: 用户在与聊天机器人和人类客服互动时表现出显著的沟通风格差异。在风格多样化数据集上训练的模型显著优于仅在原始或风格统一数据集上训练的模型，而推理时重构策略效果较差。

Conclusion: 为提升LLM-用户交互体验，需要在训练阶段采用风格多样化的数据增强策略，以适应部署后用户沟通风格的变化。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in customer-facing
applications, a critical yet underexplored question is how users communicate
differently with LLM chatbots compared to human agent. In this study, we
present empirical evidence that users adopt distinct communication styles when
users interact with chatbots versus human agents. Our analysis reveals
significant differences in grammatical fluency, politeness, and lexical
diversity in user language between the two settings. These findings suggest
that models trained exclusively on human-human interaction data may not
adequately accommodate the communication style shift that occurs once an LLM
chatbot is deployed. To enhance LLM robustness to post-launch communication
style changes, we experimented with two strategies: (1) data augmentation
during the post-training phase and (2) inference-time user message
reformulation. Our results indicate that models trained on stylistically
diverse datasets significantly outperform those trained exclusively on original
or stylistically uniform datasets, while inference-time reformulation proved
less effective. These insights help us to better adapt our models for improved
LLM-user interaction experiences.

Motivation: 现有LLM在复杂推理任务上表现良好，但由于资源限制，其推理能力未能成功迁移到非高资源语言，导致多语言推理任务表现不佳。

Method: SoT是一种免训练方法，通过多步转换：语言思维转换将语言特定语义信息转化为语言无关表示，结构化知识转换引导LLM进行更集中的推理。

Result: 实验结果表明，SoT在多个多语言推理基准测试中优于多个强基线，且能适应不同的LLM骨干网络，还可与其他免训练策略集成获得进一步改进。

Conclusion: SoT通过将语言特定信息转化为结构化表示，有效提升了LLM在多语言推理任务上的性能，且具有灵活性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Recent developments have enabled Large Language Models (LLMs) to engage in
complex reasoning tasks through deep thinking. However, the capacity of
reasoning has not been successfully transferred to non-high-resource languages
due to resource constraints, which struggles with multilingual reasoning tasks.
To this end, we propose Structured-of-Thought (SoT), a training-free method
that improves the performance on multilingual reasoning through a multi-step
transformation: Language Thinking Transformation and Structured Knowledge
Transformation. The SoT method converts language-specific semantic information
into language-agnostic structured representations, enabling the models to
understand the query in different languages more sophisticated. Besides, SoT
effectively guides LLMs toward more concentrated reasoning to maintain
consistent underlying reasoning pathways when handling cross-lingual variations
in expression. Experimental results demonstrate that SoT outperforms several
strong baselines on multiple multilingual reasoning benchmarks when adapting to
various backbones of LLMs. It can also be integrated with other training-free
strategies for further improvements. Our code is available at

Abstract: Recent advancements in self-improvement for Large Language Models (LLMs) have
efficiently enhanced model capabilities without significantly increasing costs,
particularly in terms of human effort. While this area is still relatively
young, its extension to the multimodal domain holds immense potential for
leveraging diverse data sources and developing more general self-improving
models. This survey is the first to provide a comprehensive overview of
self-improvement in Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs). We provide a structured overview
of the current literature and discuss methods from three perspectives: 1) data

further development of self-improvement in MLLMs. We also include commonly used
evaluations and downstream applications. Finally, we conclude by outlining open
challenges and future research directions.

Abstract: Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) research has primarily focused on closed-book
factual question answering (QA), while contextual QA remains unexplored,
despite its importance in real-world applications. In this work, we focus on UQ
for the contextual QA task and propose a theoretically grounded approach to
quantify epistemic uncertainty. We begin by introducing a task-agnostic,
token-level uncertainty measure defined as the cross-entropy between the
predictive distribution of the given model and the unknown true distribution.
By decomposing this measure, we isolate the epistemic component and approximate
the true distribution by a perfectly prompted, idealized model. We then derive
an upper bound for epistemic uncertainty and show that it can be interpreted as
semantic feature gaps in the given model's hidden representations relative to
the ideal model. We further apply this generic framework to the contextual QA
task and hypothesize that three features approximate this gap: context-reliance
(using the provided context rather than parametric knowledge), context
comprehension (extracting relevant information from context), and honesty
(avoiding intentional lies). Using a top-down interpretability approach, we
extract these features by using only a small number of labeled samples and
ensemble them to form a robust uncertainty score. Experiments on multiple QA
benchmarks in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings show that
our method substantially outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised
(sampling-free and sampling-based) and supervised UQ methods, achieving up to a
13-point PRR improvement while incurring a negligible inference overhead.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估框架主要关注静态基准和单轮评估，无法捕捉真实对话中随时间变化的退化动态，需要新的方法来理解LLM在多轮对话中的鲁棒性。

Method: 采用生存分析框架，分析36,951轮对话，使用Cox比例风险模型、加速失效时间模型和随机生存森林方法，将对话失败建模为时间到事件过程。

Result: 突发语义漂移会灾难性增加对话失败风险，而渐进累积漂移则能显著降低失败风险，使对话持续时间更长。AFT模型在区分度和校准方面表现优异。

Conclusion: 生存分析是评估LLM鲁棒性的有力范式，为设计弹性对话代理提供了具体见解，并挑战了对话AI系统中语义一致性的必要性假设。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized conversational AI, yet their
robustness in extended multi-turn dialogues remains poorly understood. Existing
evaluation frameworks focus on static benchmarks and single-turn assessments,
failing to capture the temporal dynamics of conversational degradation that
characterize real-world interactions. In this work, we present the first
comprehensive survival analysis of conversational AI robustness, analyzing
36,951 conversation turns across 9 state-of-the-art LLMs to model failure as a
time-to-event process. Our survival modeling framework-employing Cox
proportional hazards, Accelerated Failure Time, and Random Survival Forest
approaches-reveals extraordinary temporal dynamics. We find that abrupt,
prompt-to-prompt(P2P) semantic drift is catastrophic, dramatically increasing
the hazard of conversational failure. In stark contrast, gradual, cumulative
drift is highly protective, vastly reducing the failure hazard and enabling
significantly longer dialogues. AFT models with interactions demonstrate
superior performance, achieving excellent discrimination and exceptional
calibration. These findings establish survival analysis as a powerful paradigm
for evaluating LLM robustness, offer concrete insights for designing resilient
conversational agents, and challenge prevailing assumptions about the necessity
of semantic consistency in conversational AI Systems.

Result: 通用基准测试结果不足以理解模型在低资源任务中的表现；即使训练FLOPs增加，现成LLMs在复杂领域特定场景中仍会遇到性能瓶颈；推理能力对较小LLMs的提升更显著，使其在某些任务中成为更好的判断者。

Conclusion: 需要针对特定领域的评估来准确理解LLMs在低资源任务中的能力，推理能力对较小模型的性能提升尤为重要。

Abstract: Results on existing LLM benchmarks capture little information over the model
capabilities in low-resource tasks, making it difficult to develop effective
solutions in these domains. To address these challenges, we curated 14
travel-domain datasets spanning 7 common NLP tasks using anonymised data from
real-world scenarios, and analysed the performance across LLMs. We report on
the accuracy, scaling behaviour, and reasoning capabilities of LLMs in a
variety of tasks. Our results confirm that general benchmarking results are
insufficient for understanding model performance in low-resource tasks. Despite
the amount of training FLOPs, out-of-the-box LLMs hit performance bottlenecks
in complex, domain-specific scenarios. Furthermore, reasoning provides a more
significant boost for smaller LLMs by making the model a better judge on
certain tasks.

*KM Pooja,Cheng Long,Aixin Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于策略梯度的生成对抗网络PGMEL，用于多模态实体链接任务，通过生成器产生高质量负样本来提升表示学习效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MEL方法未探索高质量负样本选择对度量学习的重要性，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 在生成对抗框架下，生成器负责生成高质量负样本，判别器负责度量学习任务，使用策略梯度技术优化离散的生成过程。

Result: 在Wiki-MEL、Richpedia-MEL和WikiDiverse数据集上的实验表明，PGMEL通过选择具有挑战性的负样本学习到有意义的表示，并优于现有最优方法。

Conclusion: PGMEL成功证明了在MEL任务中生成高质量负样本的重要性，为多模态实体链接提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The task of entity linking, which involves associating mentions with their
respective entities in a knowledge graph, has received significant attention
due to its numerous potential applications. Recently, various multimodal entity
linking (MEL) techniques have been proposed, targeted to learn comprehensive
embeddings by leveraging both text and vision modalities. The selection of
high-quality negative samples can potentially play a crucial role in
metric/representation learning. However, to the best of our knowledge, this
possibility remains unexplored in existing literature within the framework of
MEL. To fill this gap, we address the multimodal entity linking problem in a
generative adversarial setting where the generator is responsible for
generating high-quality negative samples, and the discriminator is assigned the
responsibility for the metric learning tasks. Since the generator is involved
in generating samples, which is a discrete process, we optimize it using policy
gradient techniques and propose a policy gradient-based generative adversarial
network for multimodal entity linking (PGMEL). Experimental results based on
Wiki-MEL, Richpedia-MEL and WikiDiverse datasets demonstrate that PGMEL learns
meaningful representation by selecting challenging negative samples and
outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

*Santhosh G S,Akshay Govind S,Gokul S Krishnan,Balaraman Ravindran,Sriraam Natarajan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于对比学习编码器的评估框架来检测LLMs在印度文化背景下的细微偏见，并创建了包含2,575条人工验证句子的IndiCASA数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在高风险应用中的部署增加，需要严格评估其嵌入偏见，特别是在印度这样文化多样化的环境中，现有基于嵌入的偏见评估方法往往无法捕捉细微的刻板印象。

Method: 使用对比学习训练的编码器通过嵌入相似性捕捉细粒度偏见，并引入了IndiCASA数据集，涵盖种姓、性别、宗教、残疾和社会经济地位五个人口统计维度。

Result: 对多个开源LLMs的评估显示所有模型都表现出一定程度的刻板印象偏见，其中残疾相关偏见尤为持久，宗教偏见相对较低可能是由于全球去偏见努力。

Conclusion: 研究证明了需要更公平的模型开发，特别是在处理文化特定偏见方面。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained significant traction across critical
domains owing to their impressive contextual understanding and generative
capabilities. However, their increasing deployment in high stakes applications
necessitates rigorous evaluation of embedded biases, particularly in culturally
diverse contexts like India where existing embedding-based bias assessment
methods often fall short in capturing nuanced stereotypes. We propose an
evaluation framework based on a encoder trained using contrastive learning that
captures fine-grained bias through embedding similarity. We also introduce a
novel dataset - IndiCASA (IndiBias-based Contextually Aligned Stereotypes and
Anti-stereotypes) comprising 2,575 human-validated sentences spanning five
demographic axes: caste, gender, religion, disability, and socioeconomic
status. Our evaluation of multiple open-weight LLMs reveals that all models
exhibit some degree of stereotypical bias, with disability related biases being
notably persistent, and religion bias generally lower likely due to global
debiasing efforts demonstrating the need for fairer model development.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于自我意识的强化学习方法，通过模型自我生成任务并解决，使用难度预测和极限突破机制，在仅需少量额外数据的情况下显著提升LLM推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习训练需要大量标注数据，成本高昂。本文探索如何用最少数据通过RL提升LLM推理能力。

Method: 交替进行任务生成与解决，引入自我意识机制：自我难度预测（评估任务难度并优先选择有挑战性但可解决的任务）和自我极限突破（识别超出能力边界的任务并主动请求外部数据）。

Result: 在9个基准测试上相对提升53.8%，仅需不到1.2%的额外数据。

Conclusion: 自我意识RL方法有效，展示了自进化智能体训练的前景。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated potential in enhancing the
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), but such training
typically demands substantial efforts in creating and annotating data. In this
work, we explore improving LLMs through RL with minimal data. Our approach
alternates between the LLM proposing a task and then attempting to solve it. To
minimize data dependency, we introduce two novel mechanisms grounded in
self-awareness: (1) self-aware difficulty prediction, where the model learns to
assess task difficulty relative to its own abilities and prioritize challenging
yet solvable tasks, and (2) self-aware limit breaking, where the model
recognizes when a task is beyond its capability boundary and proactively
requests external data to break through that limit. Extensive experiments on
nine benchmarks showing a 53.8% relative improvement with less than 1.2% extra
data demonstrate the efficacy of self-aware RL and underscore the promise of
self-evolving agent training.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: XTRA是一个跨语言主题建模框架，通过表示对齐和主题对齐的双重机制，在共享语义空间中实现跨语言主题的一致性，显著提升了主题连贯性、多样性和对齐质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有跨语言主题建模方法在主题多样性方面有所改进，但往往难以确保高主题连贯性和跨语言一致性对齐。

Method: XTRA结合词袋模型和多语言嵌入，采用表示对齐（通过对比学习对齐文档-主题分布）和主题对齐（将主题-词分布投影到共享空间）的双重机制。

Result: 在多语言语料库上的实验表明，XTRA在主题连贯性、多样性和对齐质量方面显著优于强基线方法。

Conclusion: XTRA框架能够学习到可解释（连贯且多样）且跨语言对齐良好的主题，为跨语言主题建模提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Cross-lingual topic modeling aims to uncover shared semantic themes across
languages. Several methods have been proposed to address this problem,
leveraging both traditional and neural approaches. While previous methods have
achieved some improvements in topic diversity, they often struggle to ensure
high topic coherence and consistent alignment across languages. We propose XTRA
(Cross-Lingual Topic Modeling with Topic and Representation Alignments), a
novel framework that unifies Bag-of-Words modeling with multilingual
embeddings. XTRA introduces two core components: (1) representation alignment,
aligning document-topic distributions via contrastive learning in a shared
semantic space; and (2) topic alignment, projecting topic-word distributions
into the same space to enforce crosslingual consistency. This dual mechanism
enables XTRA to learn topics that are interpretable (coherent and diverse) and
well-aligned across languages. Experiments on multilingual corpora confirm that
XTRA significantly outperforms strong baselines in topic coherence, diversity,
and alignment quality. Code and reproducible scripts are available at https:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决人格评估中大型标注数据集稀缺以及人格心理学与自然语言处理之间的脱节问题，提升模型的有效性和可解释性。

Method: 从Reddit收集数据构建MBTI9k和PANDORA数据集，开发SIMPA框架使用机器学习和语义相似度匹配用户语句与问卷项目。

Result: 实验显示人口统计变量影响模型有效性，SIMPA框架在人格评估方面达到与人类评估相当的效果，同时保持高可解释性和效率。

Conclusion: SIMPA框架不仅适用于人格评估，其模型无关设计、分层线索检测和可扩展性使其适用于涉及复杂标签分类学和变量线索关联的各种应用。

Abstract: Personality refers to individual differences in behavior, thinking, and
feeling. With the growing availability of digital footprints, especially from
social media, automated methods for personality assessment have become
increasingly important. Natural language processing (NLP) enables the analysis
of unstructured text data to identify personality indicators. However, two main
challenges remain central to this thesis: the scarcity of large,
personality-labeled datasets and the disconnect between personality psychology
and NLP, which restricts model validity and interpretability. To address these
challenges, this thesis presents two datasets -- MBTI9k and PANDORA --
collected from Reddit, a platform known for user anonymity and diverse
discussions. The PANDORA dataset contains 17 million comments from over 10,000
users and integrates the MBTI and Big Five personality models with demographic
information, overcoming limitations in data size, quality, and label coverage.
Experiments on these datasets show that demographic variables influence model
validity. In response, the SIMPA (Statement-to-Item Matching Personality
Assessment) framework was developed - a computational framework for
interpretable personality assessment that matches user-generated statements
with validated questionnaire items. By using machine learning and semantic
similarity, SIMPA delivers personality assessments comparable to human
evaluations while maintaining high interpretability and efficiency. Although
focused on personality assessment, SIMPA's versatility extends beyond this
domain. Its model-agnostic design, layered cue detection, and scalability make
it suitable for various research and practical applications involving complex
label taxonomies and variable cue associations with target concepts.

*Tengjun Ni,Xin Yuan,Shenghong Li,Kai Wu,Ren Ping Liu,Wei Ni,Wenjie Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: StepChain GraphRAG是一个结合问题分解和广度优先搜索推理流程的框架，用于增强多跳问答性能，在多个基准测试中实现了最先进的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的检索增强生成方法在多跳问答中，将迭代推理步骤与外部知识检索整合仍面临挑战，需要更有效的推理流程。

Method: 首先构建全局索引，推理时仅将检索到的段落动态解析为知识图谱，将复杂查询分解为子问题，然后基于BFS遍历相关边构建显式证据链。

Result: 在MuSiQue、2WikiMultiHopQA和HotpotQA上达到最先进的Exact Match和F1分数，平均EM提升2.57%，F1提升2.13%，在HotpotQA上提升最大（+4.70% EM，+3.44% F1）。

Conclusion: 该框架通过保留中间检索步骤的思维链增强了可解释性，未来工作应关注减少计算开销和解决大语言模型的幻觉问题，以提升多跳问答的效率和可靠性。

Abstract: Recent progress in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has led to more
accurate and interpretable multi-hop question answering (QA). Yet, challenges
persist in integrating iterative reasoning steps with external knowledge
retrieval. To address this, we introduce StepChain GraphRAG, a framework that
unites question decomposition with a Breadth-First Search (BFS) Reasoning Flow
for enhanced multi-hop QA. Our approach first builds a global index over the
corpus; at inference time, only retrieved passages are parsed on-the-fly into a
knowledge graph, and the complex query is split into sub-questions. For each
sub-question, a BFS-based traversal dynamically expands along relevant edges,
assembling explicit evidence chains without overwhelming the language model
with superfluous context. Experiments on MuSiQue, 2WikiMultiHopQA, and HotpotQA
show that StepChain GraphRAG achieves state-of-the-art Exact Match and F1
scores. StepChain GraphRAG lifts average EM by 2.57% and F1 by 2.13% over the
SOTA method, achieving the largest gain on HotpotQA (+4.70% EM, +3.44% F1).
StepChain GraphRAG also fosters enhanced explainability by preserving the
chain-of-thought across intermediate retrieval steps. We conclude by discussing
how future work can mitigate the computational overhead and address potential
hallucinations from large language models to refine efficiency and reliability
in multi-hop QA.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在生物多样性保护中的快速应用，需要系统评估其在物种评估任务中的可靠性。

Method: 对5个领先模型在21,955个物种上进行系统验证，涵盖IUCN红色名录的四个核心评估组件：分类学、保护状态、分布和威胁。

Result: 模型在分类学任务上表现优异(94.9%)，但在保护状态评估等推理任务上表现较差(27.2%)，存在系统性偏见偏向魅力型脊椎动物。

Conclusion: 大语言模型适合信息检索任务，但在判断性决策中需要人类监督，建议采用混合方法，让模型增强专家能力，但人类专家保留风险评估和政策的最终决定权。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly being adopted in conservation to
address the biodiversity crisis, yet their reliability for species evaluation
is uncertain. This study systematically validates five leading models on 21,955
species across four core IUCN Red List assessment components: taxonomy,
conservation status, distribution, and threats. A critical paradox was
revealed: models excelled at taxonomic classification (94.9%) but consistently
failed at conservation reasoning (27.2% for status assessment). This
knowledge-reasoning gap, evident across all models, suggests inherent
architectural constraints, not just data limitations. Furthermore, models
exhibited systematic biases favoring charismatic vertebrates, potentially
amplifying existing conservation inequities. These findings delineate clear
boundaries for responsible LLM deployment: they are powerful tools for
information retrieval but require human oversight for judgment-based decisions.
A hybrid approach is recommended, where LLMs augment expert capacity while
human experts retain sole authority over risk assessment and policy.

TL;DR: 提出了首个Wordle游戏的完整CSP建模，引入约束感知的熵计算和概率CSP框架，在2,315个英文单词上平均3.54次猜测达到99.9%成功率，比现有方法提升1.7%且运行时间减少46%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Wordle求解器依赖信息论熵最大化或基于频率的启发式方法，缺乏正式的约束处理，需要系统化的CSP建模来提升求解性能。

Method: 引入CSP感知熵（在约束传播后计算信息增益）、概率CSP框架（结合贝叶斯词频先验与逻辑约束）、约束恢复机制处理噪声。

Result: CSP感知熵平均3.54次猜测，99.9%成功率，比前向检查快46%；在10%噪声下保持5.3个百分点优势；概率CSP在所有噪声水平下100%成功；跨语言验证在西班牙语上88%成功率。

Conclusion: 正式的CSP处理、约束感知启发式、概率-逻辑集成、鲁棒性分析和跨词典验证确立了新的性能基准，证明基于约束满足的技术在结构化谜题求解领域优于传统方法。

Abstract: Wordle presents an algorithmically rich testbed for constraint satisfaction
problem (CSP) solving. While existing solvers rely on information-theoretic
entropy maximization or frequency-based heuristics without formal constraint
treatment, we present the first comprehensive CSP formulation of Wordle with
novel constraint-aware solving strategies. We introduce CSP-Aware Entropy,
computing information gain after constraint propagation rather than on raw
candidate sets, and a Probabilistic CSP framework integrating Bayesian
word-frequency priors with logical constraints. Through evaluation on 2,315
English words, CSP-Aware Entropy achieves 3.54 average guesses with 99.9%
success rate, a statistically significant 1.7% improvement over Forward
Checking (t=-4.82, p<0.001, Cohen's d=0.07) with 46% faster runtime (12.9ms
versus 23.7ms per guess). Under 10% noise, CSP-aware approaches maintain 5.3
percentage point advantages (29.0% versus 23.7%, p=0.041), while Probabilistic
CSP achieves 100% success across all noise levels (0-20%) through constraint
recovery mechanisms. Cross-lexicon validation on 500 Spanish words demonstrates
88% success with zero language-specific tuning, validating that core CSP
principles transfer across languages despite an 11.2 percentage point gap from
linguistic differences (p<0.001, Fisher's exact test). Our open-source
implementation with 34 unit tests achieving 91% code coverage provides
reproducible infrastructure for CSP research. The combination of formal CSP
treatment, constraint-aware heuristics, probabilistic-logical integration,
robustness analysis, and cross-lexicon validation establishes new performance
benchmarks demonstrating that principled constraint satisfaction techniques
outperform classical information-theoretic and learning-based approaches for
structured puzzle-solving domains.

*Jian Mu,Qixin Zhang,Zhiyong Wang,Menglin Yang,Shuang Qiu,Chengwei Qin,Zhongxiang Dai,Yao Shu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SRGen是一个轻量级的测试时框架，通过在不确定点进行自我反思来增强大语言模型的推理能力，无需额外训练即可显著提高数学推理任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自反思机制要么对整个草稿进行修订，要么通过昂贵的训练学习自校正，这两种方法都是被动的且效率低下。为了解决这个问题，需要在生成过程中更早地进行反思。

Method: 在token生成过程中，利用动态熵阈值识别高不确定性token，为每个识别出的token训练特定的校正向量，利用已生成的上下文进行自反思生成来校正token概率分布。

Result: 在数学推理基准测试中，SRGen能持续增强模型推理能力：单次生成质量的改进也转化为更强的自一致性投票。特别是在AIME2024上，DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B模型实现了Pass@1 +12.0%和Cons@5 +13.3%的绝对提升。

Conclusion: SRGen作为一种即插即用方法，将反思集成到生成过程中，实现可靠的LLM推理，以有限的额外开销获得一致收益，并能与其他训练时和测试时技术广泛组合使用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly solve complex reasoning tasks via
long chain-of-thought, but their forward-only autoregressive generation process
is fragile; early token errors can cascade, which creates a clear need for
self-reflection mechanisms. However, existing self-reflection either performs
revisions over full drafts or learns self-correction via expensive training,
both fundamentally reactive and inefficient. To address this, we propose
Self-Reflective Generation at Test Time (SRGen), a lightweight test-time
framework that reflects before generating at uncertain points. During token
generation, SRGen utilizes dynamic entropy thresholding to identify
high-uncertainty tokens. For each identified token, it trains a specific
corrective vector, which fully exploits the already generated context for a
self-reflective generation to correct the token probability distribution. By
retrospectively analyzing the partial output, this self-reflection enables more
trustworthy decisions, thereby significantly reducing the probability of errors
at highly uncertain points. Evaluated on challenging mathematical reasoning
benchmarks and a diverse set of LLMs, SRGen can consistently strengthen model
reasoning: improvements in single-pass quality also translate into stronger
self-consistency voting. Especially, on AIME2024 with
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, SRGen yields absolute improvements of +12.0% on
Pass@1 and +13.3% on Cons@5. Moreover, our findings position SRGen as a
plug-and-play method that integrates reflection into the generation process for
reliable LLM reasoning, achieving consistent gains with bounded overhead and
broad composability with other training-time (e.g., RLHF) and test-time (e.g.,
SLOT) techniques.

Motivation: 现有成员推理攻击和数据集推理方法需要内部信号或干净参考数据集，而水印技术可能降低文本质量或任务性能，需要更实用的黑盒检测方案。

Method: 使用私钥引导的无失真水印重写数据集，利用微调对水印数据的放射性效应，引入熵门控程序选择性评分高不确定性token来增强检测能力。

Conclusion: TRACE为受版权保护数据集使用的可靠黑盒验证提供了实用途径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly fine-tuned on smaller,
domain-specific datasets to improve downstream performance. These datasets
often contain proprietary or copyrighted material, raising the need for
reliable safeguards against unauthorized use. Existing membership inference
attacks (MIAs) and dataset-inference methods typically require access to
internal signals such as logits, while current black-box approaches often rely
on handcrafted prompts or a clean reference dataset for calibration, both of
which limit practical applicability. Watermarking is a promising alternative,
but prior techniques can degrade text quality or reduce task performance. We
propose TRACE, a practical framework for fully black-box detection of
copyrighted dataset usage in LLM fine-tuning. \texttt{TRACE} rewrites datasets
with distortion-free watermarks guided by a private key, ensuring both text
quality and downstream utility. At detection time, we exploit the radioactivity
effect of fine-tuning on watermarked data and introduce an entropy-gated
procedure that selectively scores high-uncertainty tokens, substantially
amplifying detection power. Across diverse datasets and model families, TRACE
consistently achieves significant detections (p<0.05), often with extremely
strong statistical evidence. Furthermore, it supports multi-dataset attribution
and remains robust even after continued pretraining on large non-watermarked
corpora. These results establish TRACE as a practical route to reliable
black-box verification of copyrighted dataset usage. We will make our code
available at: https://github.com/NusIoraPrivacy/TRACE.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NICE临床指南篇幅冗长、数量庞大，在时间紧迫的医疗系统中难以有效利用，需要开发能够通过自然语言查询提供精确匹配信息的系统。

Method: 采用检索增强生成(RAG)架构，结合混合嵌入机制，从300份指南中提取10,195个文本块构建数据库，使用7901个查询进行系统评估。

Result: 检索系统表现优异：平均倒数排名0.814，首块召回率81%，前10块召回率99.1%；RAG增强模型在70个问答对测试中，忠实度提升64.7个百分点至99.5%，上下文精确度达1.0。

Conclusion: RAG被证明是医疗保健领域应用生成式AI的有效、可靠且可扩展的方法，能够以经济高效的方式访问医疗指南，防止信息捏造。

Abstract: This paper presents the development and evaluation of a Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) system for querying the United Kingdom's National Institute
for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) clinical guidelines using Large Language
Models (LLMs). The extensive length and volume of these guidelines can impede
their utilisation within a time-constrained healthcare system, a challenge this
project addresses through the creation of a system capable of providing users
with precisely matched information in response to natural language queries. The
system's retrieval architecture, composed of a hybrid embedding mechanism, was
evaluated against a database of 10,195 text chunks derived from three hundred
guidelines. It demonstrates high performance, with a Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR)
of 0.814, a Recall of 81% at the first chunk and of 99.1% within the top ten
retrieved chunks, when evaluated on 7901 queries.
  The most significant impact of the RAG system was observed during the
generation phase. When evaluated on a manually curated dataset of seventy
question-answer pairs, RAG-enhanced models showed substantial gains in
performance. Faithfulness, the measure of whether an answer is supported by the
source text, was increased by 64.7 percentage points to 99.5% for the
RAG-enhanced O4-Mini model and significantly outperformed the medical-focused
Meditron3-8B LLM, which scored 43%. This, combined with a perfect Context
Precision score of 1 for all RAG-enhanced models, confirms the system's ability
to prevent information fabrication by grounding its answers in relevant source
material. This study thus establishes RAG as an effective, reliable, and
scalable approach for applying generative AI in healthcare, enabling
cost-effective access to medical guidelines.

Conclusion: 研究结果为语音情感识别在人机交互中的应用提供了指导，并为开发更具上下文感知能力的AI系统铺平了道路。

Abstract: Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is essential for improving human-computer
interaction, yet its accuracy remains constrained by the complexity of
emotional nuances in speech. In this study, we distinguish between descriptive
semantics, which represents the contextual content of speech, and expressive
semantics, which reflects the speaker's emotional state. After watching
emotionally charged movie segments, we recorded audio clips of participants
describing their experiences, along with the intended emotion tags for each
clip, participants' self-rated emotional responses, and their valence/arousal
scores. Through experiments, we show that descriptive semantics align with
intended emotions, while expressive semantics correlate with evoked emotions.
Our findings inform SER applications in human-AI interaction and pave the way
for more context-aware AI systems.

*Oriol Pareras,Gerard I. Gállego,Federico Costa,Cristina España-Bonet,Javier Hernando*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文系统比较了语音到文本翻译中Chain-of-Thought（CoT）和直接提示策略在不同数据规模下的表现，发现随着S2TT数据量的增加，直接提示策略的改进更一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于LLM的语音到文本翻译主要采用CoT提示策略，因为它可以利用丰富的ASR和T2TT数据集来显式建模步骤。但需要系统比较CoT和直接提示在不同数据规模下的表现。

Method: 通过将ASR语料库的转录本翻译成六种欧洲语言来伪标注数据，在不同数据规模下训练基于LLM的S2TT系统，比较CoT和直接提示策略。

Result: 结果显示，随着数据量的增加，直接提示策略的改进更一致，表明随着更大的S2TT资源被创建，直接提示可能成为更有效的方法。

Conclusion: 随着S2TT数据资源的扩大，直接提示策略可能比CoT提示更具优势，因为它能更一致地受益于数据规模的增加。

Abstract: Recent work on Speech-to-Text Translation (S2TT) has focused on LLM-based
models, introducing the increasingly adopted Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting,
where the model is guided to first transcribe the speech and then translate it.
CoT typically outperforms direct prompting primarily because it can exploit
abundant Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and Text-to-Text Translation (T2TT)
datasets to explicitly model its steps. In this paper, we systematically
compare CoT and Direct prompting under increasing amounts of S2TT data. To this
end, we pseudo-label an ASR corpus by translating its transcriptions into six
European languages, and train LLM-based S2TT systems with both prompting
strategies at different data scales. Our results show that Direct improves more
consistently as the amount of data increases, suggesting that it may become a
more effective approach as larger S2TT resources are created.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出Llama-EntScore方法，结合Llama 3.1和命名实体识别(NER)来比较放射学报告的语义差异，为初级放射科医生提供可解释的反馈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 放射学报告评估对放射科医生培训至关重要，但现有LLMs在专业领域知识方面存在局限，需要专门方法来准确比较初步报告和最终报告的语义差异。

Method: 提出Llama-EntScore方法，结合Llama 3.1和NER，通过可调权重强调或弱化特定类型的差异，生成定量相似性评分和解释性反馈。

Result: 该方法达到67%的精确匹配准确率和93%的±1范围内准确率，优于单独使用LLMs或NER方法。

Conclusion: Llama-EntScore能有效比较放射学报告的语义差异，为初级医生提供有价值的培训指导，在放射学报告评估中表现出色。

Abstract: Radiology report evaluation is a crucial part of radiologists' training and
plays a key role in ensuring diagnostic accuracy. As part of the standard
reporting workflow, a junior radiologist typically prepares a preliminary
report, which is then reviewed and edited by a senior radiologist to produce
the final report. Identifying semantic differences between preliminary and
final reports is essential for junior doctors, both as a training tool and to
help uncover gaps in clinical knowledge. While AI in radiology is a rapidly
growing field, the application of large language models (LLMs) remains
challenging due to the need for specialised domain knowledge. In this paper, we
explore the ability of LLMs to provide explainable and accurate comparisons of
reports in the radiology domain. We begin by comparing the performance of
several LLMs in comparing radiology reports. We then assess a more traditional
approach based on Named-Entity-Recognition (NER). However, both approaches
exhibit limitations in delivering accurate feedback on semantic similarity. To
address this, we propose Llama-EntScore, a semantic similarity scoring method
using a combination of Llama 3.1 and NER with tunable weights to emphasise or
de-emphasise specific types of differences. Our approach generates a
quantitative similarity score for tracking progress and also gives an
interpretation of the score that aims to offer valuable guidance in reviewing
and refining their reporting. We find our method achieves 67% exact-match
accuracy and 93% accuracy within +/- 1 when compared to radiologist-provided
ground truth scores - outperforming both LLMs and NER used independently. Code

TL;DR: 论文分析了语音到文本翻译中的思维链方法，发现其实际上主要依赖转录文本而非语音信号，与级联系统行为相似，挑战了思维链的预期优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语音到文本翻译系统中错误传播和无法利用韵律等声学线索的问题，评估思维链方法是否能真正克服这些限制。

Method: 通过归因方法分析思维链，使用损坏转录进行鲁棒性评估，以及韵律感知测试，并尝试添加直接S2TT数据和噪声转录注入等训练干预。

Result: 思维链方法主要依赖转录文本，很少利用语音信息，与级联系统行为相似。训练干预能提高鲁棒性和语音归因。

Conclusion: 思维链的预期优势受到挑战，需要设计能显式整合声学信息到翻译中的架构。

Abstract: Speech-to-Text Translation (S2TT) systems built from Automatic Speech
Recognition (ASR) and Text-to-Text Translation (T2TT) modules face two major
limitations: error propagation and the inability to exploit prosodic or other
acoustic cues. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has recently been introduced,
with the expectation that jointly accessing speech and transcription will
overcome these issues. Analyzing CoT through attribution methods, robustness
evaluations with corrupted transcripts, and prosody-awareness, we find that it
largely mirrors cascaded behavior, relying mainly on transcripts while barely
leveraging speech. Simple training interventions, such as adding Direct S2TT
data or noisy transcript injection, enhance robustness and increase speech
attribution. These findings challenge the assumed advantages of CoT and
highlight the need for architectures that explicitly integrate acoustic
information into translation.

Motivation: 现有的自动生成学术综述方法（LLM4Survey）输出质量往往达不到人类标准，且缺乏严谨的、与读者需求对齐的评估基准来揭示其不足。

Method: 构建SurveyBench评估框架，包括：(1)从11,343篇arXiv论文和4,947篇高质量综述中选取典型主题；(2)建立多维度指标层次评估大纲质量、内容质量和非文本丰富性；(3)采用基于内容和基于测验的双模式评估协议。

Result: SurveyBench有效挑战了现有的LLM4Survey方法，在基于内容的评估中平均比人类低21%。

Conclusion: SurveyBench提供了一个严谨的评估框架，能够有效揭示自动生成学术综述方法的不足，为未来研究提供了基准。

Abstract: Academic survey writing, which distills vast literature into a coherent and
insightful narrative, remains a labor-intensive and intellectually demanding
task. While recent approaches, such as general DeepResearch agents and
survey-specialized methods, can generate surveys automatically (a.k.a.
LLM4Survey), their outputs often fall short of human standards and there lacks
a rigorous, reader-aligned benchmark for thoroughly revealing their
deficiencies. To fill the gap, we propose a fine-grained, quiz-driven
evaluation framework SurveyBench, featuring (1) typical survey topics source
from recent 11,343 arXiv papers and corresponding 4,947 high-quality surveys;
(2) a multifaceted metric hierarchy that assesses the outline quality (e.g.,
coverage breadth, logical coherence), content quality (e.g., synthesis
granularity, clarity of insights), and non-textual richness; and (3) a
dual-mode evaluation protocol that includes content-based and quiz-based
answerability tests, explicitly aligned with readers' informational needs.
Results show SurveyBench effectively challenges existing LLM4Survey approaches
(e.g., on average 21% lower than human in content-based evaluation).

Motivation: 大语言模型的置信度校准对于可靠部署至关重要，但目前多语言环境下的校准特性尚未得到充分探索，非英语语言存在系统性校准偏差问题。

Method: 研究了六个模型家族和100多种语言的多语言校准，分析模型内部表征，发现最终层受英语中心训练偏差影响，而晚期中间层提供更可靠的校准信号，提出了语言感知置信度集成(LACE)等训练免费方法。

Result: 发现非英语语言校准效果显著差于英语，晚期中间层比最终层提供更可靠和更好校准的信号，LACE方法能自适应地为每种语言选择最优层组合。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了英语中心对齐的隐藏成本，通过超越最终层的方法为构建更公平可信的全球大语言模型提供了新路径。

Abstract: Confidence calibration, the alignment of a model's predicted confidence with
its actual accuracy, is crucial for the reliable deployment of Large Language
Models (LLMs). However, this critical property remains largely under-explored
in multilingual contexts. In this work, we conduct the first large-scale,
systematic studies of multilingual calibration across six model families and
over 100 languages, revealing that non-English languages suffer from
systematically worse calibration. To diagnose this, we investigate the model's
internal representations and find that the final layer, biased by
English-centric training, provides a poor signal for multilingual confidence.
In contrast, our layer-wise analysis uncovers a key insight that
late-intermediate layers consistently offer a more reliable and
better-calibrated signal. Building on this, we introduce a suite of
training-free methods, including Language-Aware Confidence Ensemble (LACE),
which adaptively selects an optimal ensemble of layers for each specific
language. Our study highlights the hidden costs of English-centric alignment
and offer a new path toward building more globally equitable and trustworthy
LLMs by looking beyond the final layer.

TL;DR: 提出了EditLens模型来检测AI编辑过的文本，通过相似度指标量化AI编辑程度，在区分人类写作、AI生成和混合写作任务上达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注检测完全AI生成的文本，但大量查询要求LLM编辑用户提供的文本，需要检测AI编辑过的文本。

Method: 使用轻量级相似度指标量化AI编辑程度，并用这些指标作为中间监督训练EditLens回归模型来预测文本中的AI编辑量。

Result: 模型在二元分类(F1=94.7%)和三元分类(F1=90.4%)任务上达到最先进性能，能够检测AI编辑程度。

Conclusion: AI编辑文本可以被检测，且AI对人类写作的改变程度也可以检测，这对作者归属、教育和政策有重要意义。

Abstract: A significant proportion of queries to large language models ask them to edit
user-provided text, rather than generate new text from scratch. While previous
work focuses on detecting fully AI-generated text, we demonstrate that
AI-edited text is distinguishable from human-written and AI-generated text.
First, we propose using lightweight similarity metrics to quantify the
magnitude of AI editing present in a text given the original human-written text
and validate these metrics with human annotators. Using these similarity
metrics as intermediate supervision, we then train EditLens, a regression model
that predicts the amount of AI editing present within a text. Our model
achieves state-of-the-art performance on both binary (F1=94.7%) and ternary
(F1=90.4%) classification tasks in distinguishing human, AI, and mixed writing.
Not only do we show that AI-edited text can be detected, but also that the
degree of change made by AI to human writing can be detected, which has
implications for authorship attribution, education, and policy. Finally, as a
case study, we use our model to analyze the effects of AI-edits applied by
Grammarly, a popular writing assistance tool. To encourage further research, we
commit to publicly releasing our models and dataset.

Motivation: 验证先前研究中大语言模型隐藏状态与fMRI脑响应相关性的稳健性，排除维度灾难、相似性度量方法等潜在问题，为这些模型的生物合理性和可解释性提供更强证据。

Method: 通过维度降维、使用新的相似性度量方法、比较不同训练类型的模型、以及分析位置编码的影响，来系统验证先前结果的稳健性。

Result: 研究发现：(i) 维度降维后相关性依然存在；(ii) 使用新相似性度量方法确认了先前结果；(iii) 相关性仅存在于经过人类语言训练的模型；(iv) 结果依赖于模型中的位置编码。

Conclusion: 这些结果证实并加强了先前研究的发现，为大语言模型的生物合理性和可解释性辩论提供了更有力的支持。

Abstract: Previous work has shown correlations between the hidden states of large
language models and fMRI brain responses, on language tasks. These correlations
have been taken as evidence of the representational similarity of these models
and brain states. This study tests whether these previous results are robust to
several possible concerns. Specifically this study shows: (i) that the previous
results are still found after dimensionality reduction, and thus are not
attributable to the curse of dimensionality; (ii) that previous results are
confirmed when using new measures of similarity; (iii) that correlations
between brain representations and those from models are specific to models
trained on human language; and (iv) that the results are dependent on the
presence of positional encoding in the models. These results confirm and
strengthen the results of previous research and contribute to the debate on the
biological plausibility and interpretability of state-of-the-art large language
models.

Motivation: 传统神经主题模型依赖推理和生成网络学习潜在主题分布，本文旨在探索LLM时代下主题建模的新范式，验证LLM是否能在零样本提示下超越传统NTMs。

Method: 提出基于LLM的简单实用方法：采样数据子集、使用提示生成主题和代表性文本、通过关键词匹配进行文本分配。

Result: 系统比较了NTMs和LLMs在主题质量方面的表现，并实证检验了"大多数NTMs已过时"的说法。

Conclusion: 研究表明LLM的长文本生成范式在主题建模任务中具有竞争力，可能标志着传统NTMs方法的更新换代。

Abstract: Traditional topic models such as neural topic models rely on inference and
generation networks to learn latent topic distributions. This paper explores a
new paradigm for topic modeling in the era of large language models, framing TM
as a long-form generation task whose definition is updated in this paradigm. We
propose a simple but practical approach to implement LLM-based topic model
tasks out of the box (sample a data subset, generate topics and representative
text with our prompt, text assignment with keyword match). We then investigate
whether the long-form generation paradigm can beat NTMs via zero-shot
prompting. We conduct a systematic comparison between NTMs and LLMs in terms of
topic quality and empirically examine the claim that "a majority of NTMs are
outdated."

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有跨语言迁移方法在源语言选择上依赖词汇和语言特征，需要探索更有效的源语言排序方法以提升迁移性能。

Method: 利用多语言模型的隐藏表示和无标注目标语言数据，通过神经网络方法对源语言进行排序，支持使用少量目标语言数据。

Result: 在词性标注任务上平均提升35.56 NDCG，命名实体识别任务上提升18.14 NDCG，仅需25个目标语言样本即可达到92.8%的完整数据性能。

Conclusion: NN-Rank在跨语言迁移源语言排序方面显著优于现有方法，对数据稀缺语言尤其有效，且可使用域外数据如圣经语料库。

Abstract: We present NN-Rank, an algorithm for ranking source languages for
cross-lingual transfer, which leverages hidden representations from
multilingual models and unlabeled target-language data. We experiment with two
pretrained multilingual models and two tasks: part-of-speech tagging (POS) and
named entity recognition (NER). We consider 51 source languages and evaluate on
56 and 72 target languages for POS and NER, respectively. When using in-domain
data, NN-Rank beats state-of-the-art baselines that leverage lexical and
linguistic features, with average improvements of up to 35.56 NDCG for POS and
18.14 NDCG for NER. As prior approaches can fall back to language-level
features if target language data is not available, we show that NN-Rank remains
competitive using only the Bible, an out-of-domain corpus available for a large
number of languages. Ablations on the amount of unlabeled target data show
that, for subsets consisting of as few as 25 examples, NN-Rank produces
high-quality rankings which achieve 92.8% of the NDCG achieved using all
available target data for ranking.

Motivation: 现有Web代理处理冗长网页时面临上下文限制饱和、计算成本高和安全风险（如提示注入）的问题，现有修剪策略要么丢弃相关内容要么保留无关上下文，导致动作预测不理想。

Method: 利用轻量级LLM检索器根据任务目标从可访问性树观察中提取最相关的行，通过修剪噪声和无关内容来优化观察处理。

Result: 在WorkArena和WebArena基准测试中，FocusAgent与强基线性能相当，同时将观察大小减少50%以上。其变体显著降低了提示注入攻击的成功率，同时在无攻击环境中保持任务成功性能。

Conclusion: 基于LLM的有针对性检索是构建高效、有效且安全的Web代理的实用且稳健策略。

Abstract: Web agents powered by large language models (LLMs) must process lengthy web
page observations to complete user goals; these pages often exceed tens of
thousands of tokens. This saturates context limits and increases computational
cost processing; moreover, processing full pages exposes agents to security
risks such as prompt injection. Existing pruning strategies either discard
relevant content or retain irrelevant context, leading to suboptimal action
prediction. We introduce FocusAgent, a simple yet effective approach that
leverages a lightweight LLM retriever to extract the most relevant lines from
accessibility tree (AxTree) observations, guided by task goals. By pruning
noisy and irrelevant content, FocusAgent enables efficient reasoning while
reducing vulnerability to injection attacks. Experiments on WorkArena and
WebArena benchmarks show that FocusAgent matches the performance of strong
baselines, while reducing observation size by over 50%. Furthermore, a variant
of FocusAgent significantly reduces the success rate of prompt-injection
attacks, including banner and pop-up attacks, while maintaining task success
performance in attack-free settings. Our results highlight that targeted
LLM-based retrieval is a practical and robust strategy for building web agents
that are efficient, effective, and secure.

TL;DR: 提出Cache-to-Cache (C2C)范式，通过直接语义通信替代文本通信，在多LLM系统中实现更高效、更准确的模型协作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多LLM系统通过文本通信会丢失丰富的语义信息并产生token-by-token生成延迟，需要探索超越文本的通信方式。

Method: 使用神经网络投影和融合源模型与目标模型的KV-cache，实现直接语义传输，并通过可学习门控机制选择受益于缓存通信的目标层。

Result: C2C比单个模型平均准确率提高8.5-10.5%，比文本通信范式性能提升约3.0-5.0%，同时延迟平均加速2.0倍。

Conclusion: C2C证明了KV-cache作为模型间通信媒介的有效性，能够利用两个模型的深度专业语义，避免中间文本生成，实现更高效的多模型协作。

Abstract: Multi-LLM systems harness the complementary strengths of diverse Large
Language Models, achieving performance and efficiency gains unattainable by a
single model. In existing designs, LLMs communicate through text, forcing
internal representations to be transformed into output token sequences. This
process both loses rich semantic information and incurs token-by-token
generation latency. Motivated by these limitations, we ask: Can LLMs
communicate beyond text? Oracle experiments show that enriching the KV-Cache
semantics can improve response quality without increasing cache size,
supporting KV-Cache as an effective medium for inter-model communication. Thus,
we propose Cache-to-Cache (C2C), a new paradigm for direct semantic
communication between LLMs. C2C uses a neural network to project and fuse the
source model's KV-cache with that of the target model to enable direct semantic
transfer. A learnable gating mechanism selects the target layers that benefit
from cache communication. Compared with text communication, C2C utilizes the
deep, specialized semantics from both models, while avoiding explicit
intermediate text generation. Experiments show that C2C achieves 8.5-10.5%
higher average accuracy than individual models. It further outperforms the text
communication paradigm by approximately 3.0-5.0%, while delivering an average
2.0x speedup in latency. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着推理链的延长，关键的中间步骤和原始提示会被淹没在上下文中，导致注意力不足和错误。需要一种方法来引导LLM在长推理过程中保持注意力。

Method: 将推理轨迹分解为结构化计划，自动对齐模型注意力到最相关的推理步骤，使模型在整个生成过程中保持专注。

Result: 在六个基准测试中优于最先进的提示方法，显著缩小了“非推理”模型与专用推理模型之间的性能差距。

Conclusion: Self-Anchor有潜力使大多数LLM无需重新训练就能处理复杂推理任务，提供了一种轻量级的替代微调和强化学习的方法。

Abstract: To solve complex reasoning tasks for Large Language Models (LLMs),
prompting-based methods offer a lightweight alternative to fine-tuning and
reinforcement learning. However, as reasoning chains extend, critical
intermediate steps and the original prompt will be buried in the context,
receiving insufficient attention and leading to errors. In this paper, we
propose Self-Anchor, a novel pipeline that leverages the inherent structure of
reasoning to steer LLM attention. Self-Anchor decomposes reasoning trajectories
into structured plans and automatically aligns the model's attention to the
most relevant inference steps, allowing the model to maintain focus throughout
generation. Our experiment shows that Self-Anchor outperforms SOTA prompting
methods across six benchmarks. Notably, Self-Anchor significantly reduces the
performance gap between ``non-reasoning'' models and specialized reasoning
models, with the potential to enable most LLMs to tackle complex reasoning
tasks without retraining.

Motivation: 发现强化学习奖励模型和AI模型评估指标两个研究领域相互分离，导致术语冗余和问题重复，希望通过领域间更紧密合作来克服共同挑战。

Method: 通过广泛的文献调查，比较奖励模型和评估指标在特定任务上的表现，分析两个领域的共同挑战和研究主题。

Conclusion: 建议两个研究领域建立更紧密的合作关系，在偏好获取方法、避免虚假相关性和奖励破解、以及基于校准的元评估等方面实现更好的对齐，从而改进奖励模型和评估指标。

Abstract: The emergence of reinforcement learning in post-training of large language
models has sparked significant interest in reward models. Reward models assess
the quality of sampled model outputs to generate training signals. This task is
also performed by evaluation metrics that monitor the performance of an AI
model. We find that the two research areas are mostly separate, leading to
redundant terminology and repeated pitfalls. Common challenges include
susceptibility to spurious correlations, impact on downstream reward hacking,
methods to improve data quality, and approaches to meta-evaluation. Our
position paper argues that a closer collaboration between the fields can help
overcome these issues. To that end, we show how metrics outperform reward
models on specific tasks and provide an extensive survey of the two areas.
Grounded in this survey, we point to multiple research topics in which closer
alignment can improve reward models and metrics in areas such as preference
elicitation methods, avoidance of spurious correlations and reward hacking, and
calibration-aware meta-evaluation.

Motivation: 当前网页代理评估局限于沙盒环境或人工任务，需要真实开放网页环境下的评估平台来发现实际应用中的失败模式。

Method: 构建BrowserArena平台，收集用户任务，进行Arena式头对头比较，使用逐步人工反馈分析代理轨迹，并针对发现的问题构建专门数据集。

Result: 识别出三个一致的失败模式：验证码解决、弹窗横幅移除和直接URL导航。不同语言模型在这些任务上表现各异，如o4-mini使用更多策略绕过验证码，DeepSeek-R1在验证码解决上误导用户。

Abstract: LLM web agents now browse and take actions on the open web, yet current agent
evaluations are constrained to sandboxed environments or artificial tasks. We
introduce BrowserArena, a live open-web agent evaluation platform that collects
user-submitted tasks, runs Arena-style head-to-head comparisons, and uses
step-level human feedback to surface failure modes. Collecting and analyzing
step-level annotations on the agent traces, we identify three consistent
failure modes: captcha resolution, pop-up banner removal, and direct navigation
to URLs. By constructing targeted datasets to further study these tasks, we
discover variations in how different language models navigate these failure
modes. We find, for example, that o4-mini deploys a wider variety of strategies
to circumvent captcha resolution than other models and DeepSeek-R1 consistently
misleads users about captcha resolution. Our findings surface both the
diversity and brittleness of current web agents. More broadly, our benchmarking
methodology provides an approach to evaluating and understanding web agent
failure modes at scale.

Motivation: ShotBench作为电影摄影理解最全面的基准测试存在选项设计模糊和ShotVL模型推理一致性问题，这影响了评估的可靠性，限制了公平比较和未来进展。

Method: 通过一致的选项重构系统性地改进ShotBench，首次对ShotVL的推理行为进行批判性分析，并引入联合评估任务准确性和核心模型能力的扩展评估协议。

Conclusion: RefineShot基准解决了ShotBench的局限性，为电影摄影理解任务提供了更可靠和全面的评估框架，有助于推动该领域的进步。

Abstract: Cinematography understanding refers to the ability to recognize not only the
visual content of a scene but also the cinematic techniques that shape
narrative meaning. This capability is attracting increasing attention, as it
enhances multimodal understanding in real-world applications and underpins
coherent content creation in film and media. As the most comprehensive
benchmark for this task, ShotBench spans a wide range of cinematic concepts and
VQA-style evaluations, with ShotVL achieving state-of-the-art results on it.
However, our analysis reveals that ambiguous option design in ShotBench and
ShotVL's shortcomings in reasoning consistency and instruction adherence
undermine evaluation reliability, limiting fair comparison and hindering future
progress. To overcome these issues, we systematically refine ShotBench through
consistent option restructuring, conduct the first critical analysis of
ShotVL's reasoning behavior, and introduce an extended evaluation protocol that
jointly assesses task accuracy and core model competencies. These efforts lead
to RefineShot, a refined and expanded benchmark that enables more reliable
assessment and fosters future advances in cinematography understanding.

TL;DR: 提出一种新方法来限制有害演示对LLM性能的影响，通过分布无关风险控制(DFRC)和动态早期退出机制，在保持零样本性能的同时防御恶意输入攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM的上下文学习能力虽然强大，但也带来安全隐患——恶意演示可能被注入而影响模型行为，需要内置防御机制来保护模型性能。

Method: 定义零样本性能为安全基线，应用DFRC控制性能衰减，采用动态早期退出机制忽略关注有害输入的注意力头，并改进DFRC以在有害输入上控制风险，在有益输入上提升效率。

Result: 理论和实证结果表明，该方法能有效控制有害演示的风险，同时在有益演示上获得显著计算效率提升。

Conclusion: 提出的方法为LLM提供了内置的安全防护机制，既能防御恶意输入攻击，又能保持有益输入的性能和效率优势。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate a remarkable ability to learn new
tasks from a few in-context examples. However, this flexibility introduces
safety concerns: LLMs can be influenced by incorrect or malicious
demonstrations -- for example, if an adversary tampers with or injects harmful
examples without a human supervisor noticing. This motivates principled designs
in which the system itself includes built-in mechanisms to guard against such
attacks. We propose a novel approach to limit the degree to which harmful
demonstrations can degrade model performance. First, we define a baseline
``safe'' behavior for the model -- the model's performance given no in-context
demonstrations (zero-shot). Next, we apply distribution-free risk control
(DFRC) to control the extent to which in-context samples can decay performance
below zero-shot. We achieve this by leveraging dynamic early exit prediction,
ignoring later attention heads that attend the most to the unsafe inputs.
Finally, we propose modifications to DFRC that allow it to both control risk
for harmful inputs \textit{and} leverage performance and efficiency gains on
helpful inputs. We present both theoretical and empirical results showing that
our approach can effectively control risk for harmful in-context demonstrations
while simultaneously achieving substantial computational efficiency gains with
helpful demonstrations.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现大型多模态模型中的一小部分注意力头负责传输空间关系表示，这些注意力头的激活（称为功能向量）可以被提取和操作来改变模型在关系任务上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型多模态模型展示了令人印象深刻的情境学习能力，但其支持任务学习的内部机制仍然不透明，需要深入理解模型如何编码和处理空间关系知识。

Method: 使用因果中介分析识别影响关系预测的注意力头，提取多模态功能向量，并在保持模型参数冻结的情况下用少量训练数据微调这些向量。

Result: 提取的功能向量在推理时提高了零样本准确性，经过微调后显著优于情境学习基线，并且能够线性组合来解决涉及未训练空间关系的类比问题。

Conclusion: 大型多模态模型在局部内部结构中编码空间关系知识，这些知识可以被系统提取和优化，从而增进对模型模块化的理解并增强对关系推理的控制。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) demonstrate impressive in-context learning
abilities from limited multimodal demonstrations, yet the internal mechanisms
supporting such task learning remain opaque. Building on prior work of large
language models, we show that a small subset of attention heads in the
vision-language model OpenFlamingo-4B is responsible for transmitting
representations of spatial relations. The activations of these attention heads,
termed function vectors, can be extracted and manipulated to alter an LMM's
performance on relational tasks. First, using both synthetic and real image
datasets, we apply causal mediation analysis to identify attention heads that
strongly influence relational predictions, and extract multimodal function
vectors that improve zero-shot accuracy at inference time. We further
demonstrate that these multimodal function vectors can be fine-tuned with a
modest amount of training data, while keeping LMM parameters frozen, to
significantly outperform in-context learning baselines. Finally, we show that
relation-specific function vectors can be linearly combined to solve analogy
problems involving novel and untrained spatial relations, highlighting the
strong generalization ability of this approach. Our results show that LMMs
encode spatial relational knowledge within localized internal structures, which
can be systematically extracted and optimized, thereby advancing our
understanding of model modularity and enhancing control over relational
reasoning in LMMs.

Abstract: While agentic AI has advanced in automating individual tasks, managing
complex multi-agent workflows remains a challenging problem. This paper
presents a research vision for autonomous agentic systems that orchestrate
collaboration within dynamic human-AI teams. We propose the Autonomous Manager
Agent as a core challenge: an agent that decomposes complex goals into task
graphs, allocates tasks to human and AI workers, monitors progress, adapts to
changing conditions, and maintains transparent stakeholder communication. We
formalize workflow management as a Partially Observable Stochastic Game and
identify four foundational challenges: (1) compositional reasoning for
hierarchical decomposition, (2) multi-objective optimization under shifting
preferences, (3) coordination and planning in ad hoc teams, and (4) governance
and compliance by design. To advance this agenda, we release MA-Gym, an
open-source simulation and evaluation framework for multi-agent workflow
orchestration. Evaluating GPT-5-based Manager Agents across 20 workflows, we
find they struggle to jointly optimize for goal completion, constraint
adherence, and workflow runtime - underscoring workflow management as a
difficult open problem. We conclude with organizational and ethical
implications of autonomous management systems.

Abstract: Agentic systems enable the intelligent use of research tooling, augmenting a
researcher's ability to investigate and propose novel solutions to existing
problems. Within Additive Manufacturing (AM), alloy discovery remains a complex
challenge, often requiring expertise in the various domains of materials
science, thermodynamic simulations, and experimental analysis. Large Language
Model (LLM) enabled agents can facilitate this endeavor by utilizing their
extensive knowledge base to dispatch tool calls via Model Context Protocol
(MCP) to perform actions such as Thermo-Calc property diagram calculations and
lack of fusion process map generation. In addition, the multi-agent system
developed in this work is able to effectively reason through complex user
prompts and provide analysis on the printability of proposed alloys. These
agents can dynamically adjust their task trajectory to the outcomes of tool
call results, effectively enabling autonomous decision-making in practical
environments. This work aims to utilize LLM enabled agents to automate and
accelerate the task of alloy discovery within the field of additive
manufacturing and showcase the benefits of adopting this multi-agent system.

Conclusion: 本文为CSPP提供了多RL方法基准测试和可复用的Gym环境，为未来海运物流研究和实际部署奠定了基础。

Abstract: Container stowage planning (CSPP) is a critical component of maritime
transportation and terminal operations, directly affecting supply chain
efficiency. Owing to its complexity, CSPP has traditionally relied on human
expertise. While reinforcement learning (RL) has recently been applied to CSPP,
systematic benchmark comparisons across different algorithms remain limited. To
address this gap, we develop a Gym environment that captures the fundamental
features of CSPP and extend it to include crane scheduling in both multi-agent
and single-agent formulations. Within this framework, we evaluate five RL
algorithms: DQN, QR-DQN, A2C, PPO, and TRPO under multiple scenarios of varying
complexity. The results reveal distinct performance gaps with increasing
complexity, underscoring the importance of algorithm choice and problem
formulation for CSPP. Overall, this paper benchmarks multiple RL methods for
CSPP while providing a reusable Gym environment with crane scheduling, thus
offering a foundation for future research and practical deployment in maritime
logistics.

Abstract: The integration of electric vehicles (EVs) into smart grids presents unique
opportunities to enhance both transportation systems and energy networks.
However, ensuring safe and interpretable interactions between drivers,
vehicles, and the surrounding environment remains a critical challenge. This
paper presents a multi-modal large language model (LLM)-based framework to
process multimodal sensor data - such as object detection, semantic
segmentation, and vehicular telemetry - and generate natural-language alerts
for drivers. The framework is validated using real-world data collected from
instrumented vehicles driving on urban roads, ensuring its applicability to
real-world scenarios. By combining visual perception (YOLOv8), geocoded
positioning, and CAN bus telemetry, the framework bridges raw sensor data and
driver comprehension, enabling safer and more informed decision-making in urban
driving scenarios. Case studies using real data demonstrate the framework's
effectiveness in generating context-aware alerts for critical situations, such
as proximity to pedestrians, cyclists, and other vehicles. This paper
highlights the potential of LLMs as assistive tools in e-mobility, benefiting
both transportation systems and electric networks by enabling scalable fleet
coordination, EV load forecasting, and traffic-aware energy planning.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了基础模型在多模态联合推理中的表现，特别是在跨模态冲突场景下。研究发现模型在单模态中能识别90%的冲突，但在跨模态情况下识别率降至3%，这归因于跨模态注意力不平衡问题。


<details>

Motivation: 研究基础模型在多模态任务中的联合推理能力，特别是在跨模态冲突场景下，以了解模型是否能够协调不同模态间的矛盾信息。

Method: 通过创建跨模态冲突场景来测试模型表现，分析注意力机制的不平衡问题，并提出通过显式组合多模态训练实例的方法来减少注意力不平衡。

Result: 实验显示模型在跨模态冲突中的识别率极低（3%），存在严重的注意力不对称问题。提出的简单方法能显著减少注意力不平衡，并提升下游任务的性能。

Conclusion: 系统性地处理跨模态上下文对于构建可靠的基础模型至关重要，需要专门的训练策略来改善跨模态推理能力。

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) deployed in real-world tasks such as computer-use
agents must integrate diverse modalities. How good are FMs at performing joint
reasoning, simultaneously reasoning over multiple modalities, especially when
the modalities interact and relate to each other to form cross-modal context?
To better understand this problem, we study FMs on cross-modal conflicts:
scenarios where conflicting evidence is presented across modalities. This
allows us to examine whether FMs prioritize one modality over another or reason
jointly to reconcile the conflict. Our experiments reveal that FMs can
recognize conflicts in unimodal contexts, composed of a single modality, 90% of
the time, but the ratio falls as low as 3% when evidence is split across
modalities -- similar observations hold in cross-lingual contexts, composed of
multiple languages. We trace this failure to cross-modal attention imbalance,
showing that FMs exhibit extreme asymmetry in attention scores,
disproportionately prioritizing certain modalities. We show that cross-modal
attention imbalance does not go away by simply scaling up multimodal or
multilingual datasets blindly, since they lack training examples that
explicitly require cross-modal reasoning. We demonstrate that even a simple and
scalable method of explicitly combining multiple modalities within each
training instance significantly reduces attention imbalance. Reduced attention
imbalance directly translates to improved downstream performance on several
vision-language benchmarks. Our findings underscore the importance of
systematically addressing cross-modal contexts to build reliable foundation
models.

TL;DR: 研究发现测试时扩展(TTS)在样本数量K增大到一定程度后收益递减，提出温度维度扩展能显著提升LLM推理能力，使基础模型达到接近RL训练模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时扩展方法通过增加推理轨迹数量来提升准确率，但存在收益递减问题，且不同温度设置能解决不同子集的问题，需要探索更有效的扩展维度。

Method: 提出温度维度扩展方法，在不同采样温度下生成推理轨迹，并设计多温度投票机制来降低计算开销。

Result: 在多个模型和基准测试上，温度扩展比单温度TTS额外提升7.3个百分点，基础模型性能接近RL训练模型，无需额外后训练。

Conclusion: 测试时扩展的潜力被低估，温度扩展提供了一种简单有效的方法来释放基础模型的潜在能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can improve reasoning at inference time through
test-time scaling (TTS), where multiple reasoning traces are generated and the
best one is selected. Prior work shows that increasing the number of samples K
steadily improves accuracy. In this paper, we demonstrate that this trend does
not hold indefinitely: at large K, further scaling yields no gains, and certain
hard questions remain unsolved regardless of the number of traces.
Interestingly, we find that different sampling temperatures solve different
subsets of problems, implying that single-temperature scaling explores only
part of a model's potential. We therefore propose scaling along the temperature
dimension, which enlarges the reasoning boundary of LLMs. Averaged over Qwen3
(0.6B, 1.7B, 4B, 8B) and five representative reasoning benchmarks (AIME
2024/2025, MATH500, LiveCodeBench, Hi-ToM), temperature scaling yields an
additional 7.3 points over single-temperature TTS. Temperature scaling also
enables base models to reach performance comparable to reinforcement learning
(RL)-trained counterparts, without additional post-training. We further provide
a comprehensive analysis of this phenomenon and design a multi-temperature
voting method that reduces the overhead of temperature scaling. Overall, our
findings suggest that TTS is more powerful than previously thought, and that
temperature scaling offers a simple and effective way to unlock the latent
potential of base models.

Conclusion: 该理论可能正确捕捉人类关于计划的推理模式，具有应用于规划问题的潜力，并提出了未来应用方向。

Abstract: This paper offers a new concept of {\it possibility} as an alternative to the
now-a-days standard concept originally introduced by L.A. Zadeh in 1978. This
new version was inspired by the original but, formally, has nothing in common
with it other than that they both adopt the {\L}ukasiewicz multivalent
interpretation of the logical connectives. Moreover, rather than seeking to
provide a general notion of possibility, this focuses specifically on the
possibility of a real-world event. An event is viewed as having prerequisites
that enable its occurrence and constraints that may impede its occurrence, and
the possibility of the event is computed as a function of the probabilities
that the prerequisites hold and the constraints do not. This version of
possibility might appropriately be applied to problems of planning. When there
are multiple plans available for achieving a goal, this theory can be used to
determine which plan is most possible, i.e., easiest or most feasible to
complete. It is speculated that this model of reasoning correctly captures
normal human reasoning about plans. The theory is elaborated and an
illustrative example for vehicle route planning is provided. There is also a
suggestion of potential future applications.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems powered by large language models have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities across diverse domains, yet existing automated design
approaches seek monolithic solutions that fail to adapt resource allocation
based on query complexity and domain requirements. This paper introduces
AutoMaAS, a self-evolving multi-agent architecture search framework that
leverages neural architecture search principles to automatically discover
optimal agent configurations through dynamic operator lifecycle management and
automated machine learning techniques. Our approach incorporates four key
innovations: (1) automatic operator generation, fusion, and elimination based
on performance-cost analysis, (2) dynamic cost-aware optimization with
real-time parameter adjustment, (3) online feedback integration for continuous
architecture refinement, and (4) enhanced interpretability through decision
tracing mechanisms. Extensive experiments across six benchmarks demonstrate
that AutoMaAS achieves 1.0-7.1\% performance improvement while reducing
inference costs by 3-5\% compared to state-of-the-art methods. The framework
shows superior transferability across datasets and LLM backbones, establishing
a new paradigm for automated multi-agent system design in the era of large

Motivation: 随着视觉语言模型的普及，其多模态接口引入了新的安全漏洞，现有红队方法要么局限于有限的对抗模式，要么依赖手动工程，缺乏对新兴真实世界VLM漏洞的可扩展探索。

Method: 提出11种新颖的多模态攻击策略，涵盖VLM的多样化对抗模式，通过模型上下文协议集成17种红队算法，设计分层记忆和epsilon-greedy攻击探索算法平衡攻击多样性和有效性。

Result: 在实例和策略基准测试中，ARMs达到最先进的攻击成功率，平均超过基线52.1%，在Claude-4-Sonnet上超过90%。构建了包含30K+红队实例的ARMs-Bench数据集。

Conclusion: 基于ARMs-Bench的安全微调显著提高了VLM的鲁棒性，同时保持其通用效用，为改进多模态安全对齐提供了可行指导。

Abstract: As vision-language models (VLMs) gain prominence, their multimodal interfaces
also introduce new safety vulnerabilities, making the safety evaluation
challenging and critical. Existing red-teaming efforts are either restricted to
a narrow set of adversarial patterns or depend heavily on manual engineering,
lacking scalable exploration of emerging real-world VLM vulnerabilities. To
bridge this gap, we propose ARMs, an adaptive red-teaming agent that
systematically conducts comprehensive risk assessments for VLMs. Given a target
harmful behavior or risk definition, ARMs automatically optimizes diverse
red-teaming strategies with reasoning-enhanced multi-step orchestration, to
effectively elicit harmful outputs from target VLMs. We propose 11 novel
multimodal attack strategies, covering diverse adversarial patterns of VLMs
(e.g., reasoning hijacking, contextual cloaking), and integrate 17 red-teaming
algorithms into ARMs via model context protocol (MCP). To balance the diversity
and effectiveness of the attack, we design a layered memory with an
epsilon-greedy attack exploration algorithm. Extensive experiments on instance-
and policy-based benchmarks show that ARMs achieves SOTA attack success rates,
exceeding baselines by an average of 52.1% and surpassing 90% on
Claude-4-Sonnet. We show that the diversity of red-teaming instances generated
by ARMs is significantly higher, revealing emerging vulnerabilities in VLMs.
Leveraging ARMs, we construct ARMs-Bench, a large-scale multimodal safety
dataset comprising over 30K red-teaming instances spanning 51 diverse risk
categories, grounded in both real-world multimodal threats and regulatory
risks. Safety fine-tuning with ARMs-Bench substantially improves the robustness
of VLMs while preserving their general utility, providing actionable guidance
to improve multimodal safety alignment against emerging threats.

Models (LLMs), show promise in automating constraint specification from
heterogeneous raw manufacturing data, their direct application faces challenges
due to natural language ambiguity, non-deterministic outputs, and limited
domain-specific knowledge. This paper presents a constraint-centric
architecture that regulates LLMs to perform reliable automated constraint
specification for production scheduling. The architecture defines a
hierarchical structural space organized across three levels, implemented
through domain-specific representation to ensure precision and reliability
while maintaining flexibility. Furthermore, an automated production scenario
adaptation algorithm is designed and deployed to efficiently customize the
architecture for specific manufacturing configurations. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed approach successfully balances the generative
capabilities of LLMs with the reliability requirements of manufacturing
systems, significantly outperforming pure LLM-based approaches in constraint
specification tasks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出Node-wise Consistency Verification (NCV)框架，通过节点级一致性检查来验证大语言模型的多步推理，提高错误定位精度并减少token消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在验证多步推理时存在错误定位不精确和token成本高的问题，要么评估整个推理链导致注意力稀释，要么依赖昂贵的多重采样。

Method: 将验证重构为节点级的轻量级二进制一致性检查，将思维链分解为互连的验证节点，避免不必要的长文本生成。

Result: 在公开数据集上，NCV相比传统方法如基于CoT的验证器，F1分数提高10%到25%，同时token使用量减少6倍到58倍。

Conclusion: NCV方法提高了可解释性和效率，为可靠的LLM推理验证提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Verifying multi-step reasoning in large language models is difficult due to
imprecise error localization and high token costs. Existing methods either
assess entire reasoning chains, suffering attention dilution, or rely on
expensive multi-sampling. We introduce Node-wise Consistency Verification
(NCV), a training-free framework that recasts verification as lightweight
binary consistency checks at the node level. By decomposing the chain of
thought into interconnected verification nodes, NCV precisely localizes errors
and avoids unnecessary long-form generation. Experiments demonstrate that our
approach enhances interpretability and efficiency, presenting a scalable
solution for reliable LLM reasoning verification. On public datasets, NCV
achieves a 10\% to 25\% improvement in F1 scores over baselines while utilizing
$6\times$~$58\times$ fewer tokens than traditional methods like CoT-based
verifiers.

TL;DR: TRACE是一个用于多维度评估工具增强LLM代理性能的框架，通过证据库机制实现对推理轨迹的全面分析，解决了传统答案匹配评估方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具增强基准测试主要依赖答案匹配评估，无法评估代理在复杂任务中的推理轨迹质量，包括效率、幻觉和适应性等方面。

Method: 提出TRACE框架，通过证据库积累推理步骤中的知识，实现对代理推理轨迹的多维度评估，并构建包含多样化有缺陷轨迹的元评估数据集进行验证。

Result: TRACE能够准确评估复杂行为，即使使用小型开源LLM也能实现可扩展且成本效益高的评估，并揭示了代理在工具增强任务中的新观察和见解。

Conclusion: TRACE框架为工具增强LLM代理提供了超越答案匹配的全面评估方法，能够有效分析推理轨迹的多个维度，为代理性能评估开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Although recent tool-augmented benchmarks incorporate complex user requests
and diverse tools, the evaluation methods for most of them remain limited to
answer matching. However, as the number of steps required to resolve a user
request increases, a proper evaluation of an agent's performance must go beyond
the final answer to also assess the problem-solving trajectory, including
previously ignored aspects such as efficiency, hallucination, and adaptivity.
The most straightforward method for evaluating these aspects is to compare an
agent's trajectory with the ground-truth trajectory, but this approach is
fundamentally limited since annotating all valid ground-truth trajectories is
prohibitively expensive. However, a simple LLM-based evaluator struggles to
assess trajectories in detail without ground truth. To effectively evaluate the
agents in this manner, we introduce TRACE, a framework for the
multi-dimensional evaluation of tool-augmented LLM agent performance. By
incorporating an evidence bank, which accumulates knowledge gathered from
preceding reasoning steps, TRACE enables a multi-faceted analysis and
evaluation of an agent's reasoning trajectory effectively. To validate our
framework, we develop a new meta-evaluation dataset by augmenting existing
benchmarks with diverse and flawed trajectories, each labeled with
multi-faceted performance scores. Our results confirm that TRACE accurately
evaluates these complex behaviors in a scalable and cost-effective manner, even
with small open-source LLMs. Furthermore, we apply our method to evaluate the
trajectories that agents produce while solving tool-augmented tasks, presenting
previously unreported observations and their corresponding insights.

*Antoine Maier,Aude Maier,Tom David*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文分析了机器学习中的目标满足假设(OSA)问题，指出在现实条件下OSA必然失败，包括近似、估计和优化误差导致的系统性偏差，以及开发者意图无法完美转化为形式化目标的固有局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是揭示机器学习中一个被普遍假设但很少检验的问题——训练得到的模型是否真正满足其指定的目标函数，即目标满足假设(OSA)的局限性。

Method: 采用学习范式无关的框架，分析OSA在现实条件下失败的技术原因，包括近似误差、估计误差和优化误差，并结合Goodhart定律的数学结果进行论证。

Result: 研究发现OSA在现实条件下必然失败，这些偏差在强优化压力下会演变为Goodhart定律的失效模式，且无法事先确定失效点。

Conclusion: 由于无法事先确定Goodhart失效点，必须对通用人工智能系统的优化设定原则性限制，否则持续优化可能导致系统进入可预测且不可控的状态。

Abstract: A common but rarely examined assumption in machine learning is that training
yields models that actually satisfy their specified objective function. We call
this the Objective Satisfaction Assumption (OSA). Although deviations from OSA
are acknowledged, their implications are overlooked. We argue, in a
learning-paradigm-agnostic framework, that OSA fails in realistic conditions:
approximation, estimation, and optimization errors guarantee systematic
deviations from the intended objective, regardless of the quality of its
specification. Beyond these technical limitations, perfectly capturing and
translating the developer's intent, such as alignment with human preferences,
into a formal objective is practically impossible, making misspecification
inevitable. Building on recent mathematical results, absent a mathematical
characterization of these gaps, they are indistinguishable from those that
collapse into Goodhart's law failure modes under strong optimization pressure.
Because the Goodhart breaking point cannot be located ex ante, a principled
limit on the optimization of General-Purpose AI systems is necessary. Absent
such a limit, continued optimization is liable to push systems into predictable
and irreversible loss of control.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出BayesianRouter框架，通过结合离线RM强度学习和在线贝叶斯选择，动态选择奖励模型以提升对齐质量，避免过拟合并保持O(1)计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLHF/RLAIF流水线依赖单一奖励模型，限制了对齐质量并存在过拟合风险。现有路由方法存在冷启动和探索不足问题。

Method: 混合路由框架：离线阶段训练多任务路由器估计各RM可靠性；在线阶段使用贝叶斯Thompson采样进行查询级RM选择，以离线嵌入作为高斯先验初始化权重向量，并通过在线奖励更新后验以适应策略分布变化。

Result: 在指令跟随和推理基准测试中，BayesianRouter始终优于单个RM、RM集成和现有路由方法。

Conclusion: BayesianRouter通过有效结合离线和在线学习，显著提升了奖励模型路由的性能和适应性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human or AI feedback (RLHF / RLAIF) has become
the standard paradigm for aligning large language models (LLMs). However, most
pipelines rely on a single reward model (RM), limiting alignment quality and
risking overfitting. Recent work explores RM routing--dynamically selecting an
RM from a candidate pool to exploit complementary strengths while maintaining
$O(1)$ RM calls--but existing methods suffer from cold-start and insufficient
exploration. We propose BayesianRouter, a hybrid routing framework that
combines offline RM strengths learning with online Bayesian selection. In the
offline stage, a multi-task router is trained on preference data to estimate
per-RM reliability. In the online stage, a Bayesian Thompson sampling router
performs per-query RM selection, initializing RM-specific weight vectors with
offline embeddings as Gaussian priors and adaptively updating their posteriors
with online rewards to adapt to the evolving policy distribution. Extensive
experiments on instruction-following (AlpacaEval-2, Arena-Hard, MT-Bench) and
reasoning (GSM8K, MMLU) benchmarks show that BayesianRouter consistently
outperforms individual RMs, RM ensembling, and existing routing methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离散扩散模型（DDM）的优化面临挑战：非自回归范式使得重要性采样难以处理，rollout过程复杂，这困扰了如GRPO等强化学习方法。

Method: 首先澄清DDM的理论基础，构建能够捕捉有价值token波动的重要性估计器；然后为视觉序列精心定制rollout方法，产生多样化的补全和可靠的优化梯度。

Result: 在数学推理、编码和视觉生成基准测试中，MaskGRPO带来了更稳定和高效的更新，导致更强的推理性能和更好的生成质量。

Conclusion: 本研究确立了MaskGRPO作为一个系统性的策略优化方法，并且是离散化视觉扩散的首个实用方法。

Abstract: Optimizing discrete diffusion model (DDM) with rewards remains a challenge:
the non-autoregressive paradigm makes importance sampling intractable and
rollout complex, puzzling reinforcement learning methods such as Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO). In this study, we introduce MaskGRPO, the first
viable approach to enable scalable multimodal reinforcement learning in
discrete diffusion with effective importance sampling and modality-specific
adaptations. To this end, we first clarify the theoretical foundation for DDMs,
which facilitates building an importance estimator that captures valuable token
fluctuation for gradient updates. We then delicately tailored the rollout
method for visual sequences, which yields diverse completions and reliable
optimization gradients. Upon math reasoning, coding, and visual generation
benchmarks, MaskGRPO brings more stable and efficient updates, leading to
stronger reasoning performance and better generation quality. This study
establishes MaskGRPO as a systematic policy optimization approach and the first
practical way for discretized visual diffusion.

TL;DR: 本文分析了可解释AI方法中的本体论和认识论假设，指出这些假设对AI解释的有效性和解释有重要影响，并讨论了如何为不同应用领域选择和调整适当的XAI方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前主流的深度学习方法是黑盒系统，缺乏对其推理过程的解释，这限制了其可信度和采用。可解释AI方法旨在通过提供模型决策过程的解释来克服这一挑战，但这些方法通常由具有技术背景的研究人员开发，并融入了他们对不同解释机制存在性、有效性和解释效用的假设。

Method: 研究可解释性方法应用于AI系统时的本体论和认识论假设，即关于解释存在性以及我们获取这些解释知识能力的假设。分析显示XAI方法的微小技术变化可能对应于关于解释基础假设的重要差异。

Result: 分析揭示了忽略底层本体-认识论范式在选择XAI方法时的风险，并展示了如何根据不同的应用领域选择和调整适当的XAI方法。

Conclusion: XAI方法中的假设并非无害，对AI解释在不同领域的有效性和解释有重要后果。在选择XAI方法时需要考虑其底层本体-认识论范式，以确保解释的有效性和适用性。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is being applied in almost every field. At the
same time, the currently dominant deep learning methods are fundamentally
black-box systems that lack explanations for their inferences, significantly
limiting their trustworthiness and adoption. Explainable AI (XAI) methods aim
to overcome this challenge by providing explanations of the models' decision
process. Such methods are often proposed and developed by engineers and
scientists with a predominantly technical background and incorporate their
assumptions about the existence, validity, and explanatory utility of different
conceivable explanatory mechanisms. However, the basic concept of an
explanation -- what it is, whether we can know it, whether it is absolute or
relative -- is far from trivial and has been the subject of deep philosophical
debate for millennia. As we point out here, the assumptions incorporated into
different XAI methods are not harmless and have important consequences for the
validity and interpretation of AI explanations in different domains. We
investigate ontological and epistemological assumptions in explainability
methods when they are applied to AI systems, meaning the assumptions we make
about the existence of explanations and our ability to gain knowledge about
those explanations. Our analysis shows how seemingly small technical changes to
an XAI method may correspond to important differences in the underlying
assumptions about explanations. We furthermore highlight the risks of ignoring
the underlying onto-epistemological paradigm when choosing an XAI method for a
given application, and we discuss how to select and adapt appropriate XAI
methods for different domains of application.

Motivation: 虽然反事实解释是XAI中的强大工具，但在基于规则的智能环境领域尚无成熟的生成方法。该研究旨在填补这一空白，为智能环境提供新的解释类型。

Method: 开发了一个插件来扩展现有的智能环境解释引擎，实现了反事实解释的形式化和实现。通过用户研究（N=17）评估生成的反事实解释与传统因果解释的效果。

Result: 用户偏好高度依赖情境：因果解释因语言简洁和在时间压力下更受青睐；反事实解释因可操作性强在解决问题时更受欢迎。

Conclusion: 该研究为智能环境提供了一种新的解释框架，并提供了经验证据来指导在不同情境下选择最有效的解释类型。

Abstract: Explainability is increasingly seen as an essential feature of rule-based
smart environments. While counterfactual explanations, which describe what
could have been done differently to achieve a desired outcome, are a powerful
tool in eXplainable AI (XAI), no established methods exist for generating them
in these rule-based domains. In this paper, we present the first formalization
and implementation of counterfactual explanations tailored to this domain. It
is implemented as a plugin that extends an existing explanation engine for
smart environments. We conducted a user study (N=17) to evaluate our generated
counterfactuals against traditional causal explanations. The results show that
user preference is highly contextual: causal explanations are favored for their
linguistic simplicity and in time-pressured situations, while counterfactuals
are preferred for their actionable content, particularly when a user wants to
resolve a problem. Our work contributes a practical framework for a new type of
explanation in smart environments and provides empirical evidence to guide the
choice of when each explanation type is most effective.

Motivation: 探究AI系统是否真正具备类比推理能力，还是仅依赖统计捷径，特别是在训练数据不完整的情况下评估其泛化能力。

Method: 在I-RAVEN数据集上，故意在训练中省略部分结构规则，评估序列到序列transformer模型和视觉架构（如CoPINet和Dual-Contrast Network）的表现。

Result: transformer模型在熟悉规则上表现良好，但在面对新颖或省略规则时准确性急剧下降；token级准确性与完整答案准确性之间存在显著差距。

Conclusion: 当前深度学习方法在抽象推理方面存在根本性局限，需要超越模式识别、开发具备稳健抽象推理能力的架构。

Abstract: Analogical reasoning lies at the core of human cognition and remains a
fundamental challenge for artificial intelligence. Raven's Progressive Matrices
(RPM) serve as a widely used benchmark to assess abstract reasoning by
requiring the inference of underlying structural rules. While many vision-based
and language-based models have achieved success on RPM tasks, it remains
unclear whether their performance reflects genuine reasoning ability or
reliance on statistical shortcuts. This study investigates the generalization
capacity of modern AI systems under conditions of incomplete training by
deliberately omitting several structural rules during training. Both
sequence-to-sequence transformer models and vision-based architectures such as
CoPINet and the Dual-Contrast Network are evaluated on the Impartial-RAVEN
(I-RAVEN) dataset. Experiments reveal that although transformers demonstrate
strong performance on familiar rules, their accuracy declines sharply when
faced with novel or omitted rules. Moreover, the gap between token-level
accuracy and complete answer accuracy highlights fundamental limitations in
current approaches. These findings provide new insights into the reasoning
mechanisms underlying deep learning models and underscore the need for
architectures that move beyond pattern recognition toward robust abstract
reasoning.

We enhance CoELA, a framework designed for building Collaborative Embodied

Abstract: Deep research has revolutionized data analysis, yet data scientists still
devote substantial time to manually crafting visualizations, highlighting the
need for robust automation from natural language queries. However, current
systems struggle with complex datasets containing multiple files and iterative
refinement. Existing approaches, including simple single- or multi-agent
systems, often oversimplify the task, focusing on initial query parsing while
failing to robustly manage data complexity, code errors, or final visualization
quality. In this paper, we reframe this challenge as a collaborative
multi-agent problem. We introduce CoDA, a multi-agent system that employs
specialized LLM agents for metadata analysis, task planning, code generation,
and self-reflection. We formalize this pipeline, demonstrating how
metadata-focused analysis bypasses token limits and quality-driven refinement
ensures robustness. Extensive evaluations show CoDA achieves substantial gains
in the overall score, outperforming competitive baselines by up to 41.5%. This
work demonstrates that the future of visualization automation lies not in
isolated code generation but in integrated, collaborative agentic workflows.

Conclusion: CCDD通过联合连续和离散空间的扩散过程，成功解决了连续扩散模型表达能力与训练性能之间的矛盾，在语言建模任务中取得了优异表现。

Abstract: Diffusion language models, especially masked discrete diffusion models, have
achieved great success recently. While there are some theoretical and primary
empirical results showing the advantages of latent reasoning with looped
transformers or continuous chain-of-thoughts, continuous diffusion models
typically underperform their discrete counterparts. In this paper, we argue
that diffusion language models do not necessarily need to be in the discrete
space. In particular, we prove that continuous diffusion models have stronger
expressivity than discrete diffusions and looped transformers. We attribute the
contradiction between the theoretical expressiveness and empirical performance
to their practical trainability: while continuous diffusion provides
intermediate supervision that looped transformers lack, they introduce
additional difficulty decoding tokens into the discrete token space from the
continuous representation space. We therefore propose Coevolutionary Continuous
Discrete Diffusion (CCDD), which defines a joint multimodal diffusion process
on the union of a continuous representation space and a discrete token space,
leveraging a single model to simultaneously denoise in the joint space. By
combining two modalities, CCDD is expressive with rich semantics in the latent
space, as well as good trainability and sample quality with the help of
explicit discrete tokens. We also propose effective architectures and advanced
training/sampling techniques for CCDD, which reveals strong empirical
performance in extensive language modeling experiments on real-world tasks.

Motivation: 现有数据库规范化方法未能有效处理具有无限可能值的属性，这些属性可能导致数据异常和查询不准确。

Method: 提出有限不同范式（LDNF），将非有限不同属性转换为有限不同属性，强制属性符合有限值范围。

Result: LDNF与现有范式结合使用，填补了当前规范化方法的空白。

Conclusion: LDNF是必要的规范化改进，通过正式方法解决了非有限不同属性带来的问题。

Abstract: In modern databases, the practice of data normalization continues to be
important in improving data integrity, minimizing redundancies, and eliminating
anomalies. However, since its inception and consequent improvements, there have
been no attempts to document a method which constrains the values of attributes
capable of only possessing a limited quantity of values. These non-limited
distinct attributes pose a problem throughout many relational databases as they
have the potential to cause data anomalies and query inaccuracies. Thus, a new
database normalization method, Limited Distinct Normal Form (LDNF), is
necessary in order to improve upon the currently established data normalization
process. In brief, LDNF is a method which turns non-limited distinct attributes
into limited distinct attributes by forcing the attributes to conform to a
limited quantity of values. Utilizing LDNF in tandem with existing normal forms
fulfills a need in normalization that is otherwise not present when only using
current methods. A formal approach to LDNF is therefore proposed.
