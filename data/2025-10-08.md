Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了增强特征金字塔网络(E-FPN)用于基础设施检查中的少样本语义分割，通过原型学习框架解决标注数据稀缺问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础设施检查应用中标注训练样本稀缺且昂贵，现有深度学习框架需要大量标注数据且难以用少量数据学习新的缺陷类别

Method: 使用InceptionSepConv块和深度可分离卷积的自适应E-FPN编码器、带掩码平均池化的原型学习、基于注意力的特征表示（全局自注意力、局部自注意力和交叉注意力）

Result: 在基础设施检查数据集上取得优异性能，最佳配置为8-way 5-shot训练，在2-way分类测试中达到82.55% F1分数和72.26% mIoU，自注意力方法带来最大性能提升

Conclusion: 该框架解决了基础设施检查系统中用有限新训练数据快速响应新缺陷类型的关键需求，为关键基础设施系统提供更高效经济的维护方案

Abstract: Few-shot semantic segmentation is vital for deep learning-based
infrastructure inspection applications, where labeled training examples are
scarce and expensive. Although existing deep learning frameworks perform well,
the need for extensive labeled datasets and the inability to learn new defect
categories with little data are problematic. We present our Enhanced Feature
Pyramid Network (E-FPN) framework for few-shot semantic segmentation of culvert
and sewer defect categories using a prototypical learning framework. Our
approach has three main contributions: (1) adaptive E-FPN encoder using
InceptionSepConv blocks and depth-wise separable convolutions for efficient
multi-scale feature extraction; (2) prototypical learning with masked average
pooling for powerful prototype generation from small support examples; and (3)
attention-based feature representation through global self-attention, local
self-attention and cross-attention. Comprehensive experimentation on
challenging infrastructure inspection datasets illustrates that the method
achieves excellent few-shot performance, with the best configuration being
8-way 5-shot training configuration at 82.55% F1-score and 72.26% mIoU in 2-way
classification testing. The self-attention method had the most significant
performance improvements, providing 2.57% F1-score and 2.9% mIoU gain over
baselines. Our framework addresses the critical need to rapidly respond to new
defect types in infrastructure inspection systems with limited new training
data that lead to more efficient and economical maintenance plans for critical
infrastructure systems.

### [2] [SkinMap: Weighted Full-Body Skin Segmentation for Robust Remote Photoplethysmography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05296)
*Zahra Maleki,Amirhossein Akbari,Amirhossein Binesh,Babak Khalaj*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的皮肤分割技术，通过优先选择皮肤区域来提升远程光电容积描记(rPPG)信号质量，在运动、说话等挑战性条件下仍能准确监测心率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: rPPG技术对光照和运动敏感，现有方法在无监督流程中需要准确选择皮肤区域来提取信号。需要开发更鲁棒的皮肤分割方法来提高信号质量。

Method: 引入新型皮肤分割技术，能够检测全身皮肤区域，同时去除可能造成干扰的口、眼、头发等区域，提高对运动的抵抗能力。

Result: 在公开数据集和新的SYNC-rPPG数据集上评估，模型在说话、头部旋转等挑战条件下仍能准确捕捉心跳，保持预测心率与实际心率之间的平均绝对误差，而其他方法无法做到。

Conclusion: 该技术对多种肤色都具有高精度检测能力，是现实世界应用的有前景选择。

Abstract: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) is an innovative method for monitoring
heart rate and vital signs by using a simple camera to record a person, as long
as any part of their skin is visible. This low-cost, contactless approach helps
in remote patient monitoring, emotion analysis, smart vehicle utilization, and
more. Over the years, various techniques have been proposed to improve the
accuracy of this technology, especially given its sensitivity to lighting and
movement. In the unsupervised pipeline, it is necessary to first select skin
regions from the video to extract the rPPG signal from the skin color changes.
We introduce a novel skin segmentation technique that prioritizes skin regions
to enhance the quality of the extracted signal. It can detect areas of skin all
over the body, making it more resistant to movement, while removing areas such
as the mouth, eyes, and hair that may cause interference. Our model is
evaluated on publicly available datasets, and we also present a new dataset,
called SYNC-rPPG, to better represent real-world conditions. The results
indicate that our model demonstrates a prior ability to capture heartbeats in
challenging conditions, such as talking and head rotation, and maintain the
mean absolute error (MAE) between predicted and actual heart rates, while other
methods fail to do so. In addition, we demonstrate high accuracy in detecting a
diverse range of skin tones, making this technique a promising option for
real-world applications.

### [3] [DeepAf: One-Shot Spatiospectral Auto-Focus Model for Digital Pathology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05315)
*Yousef Yeganeh,Maximilian Frantzen,Michael Lee,Kun-Hsing Yu,Nassir Navab,Azade Farshad*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeepAf是一个结合空间和光谱特征的自动对焦框架，可将传统显微镜转换为高效玻片扫描仪，在资源受限环境中实现实时数字病理学。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全玻片成像扫描仪成本高昂，现有低成本解决方案存在对焦一致性差、需要多张图像或缺乏泛化能力等问题。

Method: 提出DeepAf自动对焦框架，通过混合架构结合空间和光谱特征进行单次对焦预测，自动回归到最佳对焦点的距离并调整控制参数。

Result: 对焦时间比基于堆栈的方法减少80%，对焦精度达0.18μm，在536个脑组织样本的临床研究中，4x放大倍率下癌症分类AUC达0.90。

Conclusion: 该系统实现了在资源受限环境中可访问的实时数字病理学，同时保持诊断准确性。

Abstract: While Whole Slide Imaging (WSI) scanners remain the gold standard for
digitizing pathology samples, their high cost limits accessibility in many
healthcare settings. Other low-cost solutions also face critical limitations:
automated microscopes struggle with consistent focus across varying tissue
morphology, traditional auto-focus methods require time-consuming focal stacks,
and existing deep-learning approaches either need multiple input images or lack
generalization capability across tissue types and staining protocols. We
introduce a novel automated microscopic system powered by DeepAf, a novel
auto-focus framework that uniquely combines spatial and spectral features
through a hybrid architecture for single-shot focus prediction. The proposed
network automatically regresses the distance to the optimal focal point using
the extracted spatiospectral features and adjusts the control parameters for
optimal image outcomes. Our system transforms conventional microscopes into
efficient slide scanners, reducing focusing time by 80% compared to stack-based
methods while achieving focus accuracy of 0.18 {\mu}m on the same-lab samples,
matching the performance of dual-image methods (0.19 {\mu}m) with half the
input requirements. DeepAf demonstrates robust cross-lab generalization with
only 0.72% false focus predictions and 90% of predictions within the depth of
field. Through an extensive clinical study of 536 brain tissue samples, our
system achieves 0.90 AUC in cancer classification at 4x magnification, a
significant achievement at lower magnification than typical 20x WSI scans. This
results in a comprehensive hardware-software design enabling accessible,
real-time digital pathology in resource-constrained settings while maintaining
diagnostic accuracy.

### [5] [Mitigating Diffusion Model Hallucinations with Dynamic Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05356)
*Kostas Triaridis,Alexandros Graikos,Aggelina Chatziagapi,Grigorios G. Chrysos,Dimitris Samaras*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出动态引导方法，在生成时选择性锐化导致伪影的分数函数方向，减少扩散模型的幻觉样本，同时保留有效的语义变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型经常产生结构不一致的幻觉样本，这些样本超出了真实数据分布的支持范围。虽然语义插值有助于生成多样性，但需要更精细的解决方案来平衡幻觉减少和多样性保留。

Method: 引入动态引导方法，仅在已知导致伪影的预定方向上选择性锐化分数函数，同时保留有效的语义变化。这是首个在生成时而非通过后处理过滤来解决幻觉的方法。

Result: 在受控和自然图像数据集上，动态引导显著减少了幻觉，明显优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 动态引导有效解决了扩散模型的幻觉问题，在减少伪影的同时保持了生成多样性，为扩散模型的质量提升提供了新思路。

Abstract: Diffusion models, despite their impressive demos, often produce hallucinatory
samples with structural inconsistencies that lie outside of the support of the
true data distribution. Such hallucinations can be attributed to excessive
smoothing between modes of the data distribution. However, semantic
interpolations are often desirable and can lead to generation diversity, thus
we believe a more nuanced solution is required. In this work, we introduce
Dynamic Guidance, which tackles this issue. Dynamic Guidance mitigates
hallucinations by selectively sharpening the score function only along the
pre-determined directions known to cause artifacts, while preserving valid
semantic variations. To our knowledge, this is the first approach that
addresses hallucinations at generation time rather than through post-hoc
filtering. Dynamic Guidance substantially reduces hallucinations on both
controlled and natural image datasets, significantly outperforming baselines.

### [6] [LightCache: Memory-Efficient, Training-Free Acceleration for Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05367)
*Yang Xiao,Gen Li,Kaiyuan Deng,Yushu Wu,Zheng Zhan,Yanzhi Wang,Xiaolong Ma,Bo Hui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种训练免费的视频生成加速方法LightCache，通过分析扩散模型推理过程中的编码、去噪和解码阶段，设计了阶段特定的内存优化策略来减少缓存加速方法带来的内存激增问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于扩散模型的视频生成中，训练免费加速是一个重要研究方向。扩散模型推理过程中的潜在表示冗余为加速提供了切入点，但现有的缓存加速方法往往在去噪和解码阶段导致显著的内存激增。

Method: 将推理过程分解为编码、去噪和解码三个阶段，针对各阶段特点提出三种策略：1）异步缓存交换；2）特征分块；3）切片潜在表示解码。确保这些策略引入的时间开销低于加速收益。

Result: 与基线方法相比，该方法实现了更快的推理速度和更低的内存使用，同时将质量下降控制在可接受范围内。

Conclusion: LightCache方法通过阶段特定的内存优化策略，有效解决了缓存加速中的内存激增问题，在保持视频质量的同时实现了高效推理。

Abstract: Training-free acceleration has emerged as an advanced research area in video
generation based on diffusion models. The redundancy of latents in diffusion
model inference provides a natural entry point for acceleration. In this paper,
we decompose the inference process into the encoding, denoising, and decoding
stages, and observe that cache-based acceleration methods often lead to
substantial memory surges in the latter two stages. To address this problem, we
analyze the characteristics of inference across different stages and propose
stage-specific strategies for reducing memory consumption: 1) Asynchronous
Cache Swapping. 2) Feature chunk. 3) Slicing latents to decode. At the same
time, we ensure that the time overhead introduced by these three strategies
remains lower than the acceleration gains themselves. Compared with the
baseline, our approach achieves faster inference speed and lower memory usage,
while maintaining quality degradation within an acceptable range. The Code is
available at https://github.com/NKUShaw/LightCache .

### [7] [See the past: Time-Reversed Scene Reconstruction from Thermal Traces Using Visual Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05408)
*Kebin Contreras,Luis Toscano-Palomino,Mauro Dalla Mura,Jorge Bacca*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于热成像的时间反演重建框架，利用RGB和热图像对来恢复几秒前的场景状态，通过视觉语言模型引导的约束扩散过程实现语义和结构一致的重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 热成像能捕捉人机交互留下的热痕迹，这些逐渐消退的印记可作为被动时间编码，推断近期事件，超越RGB相机的能力限制。

Method: 将视觉语言模型与约束扩散过程结合，一个VLM生成场景描述，另一个引导图像重建，确保语义和结构一致性。

Result: 在三个受控场景中评估，能够重建120秒前的合理过去帧，为基于热痕迹的时间反演成像迈出第一步。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了从热痕迹恢复过去场景状态的可行性，为法医学和场景分析提供了新的技术途径。

Abstract: Recovering the past from present observations is an intriguing challenge with
potential applications in forensics and scene analysis. Thermal imaging,
operating in the infrared range, provides access to otherwise invisible
information. Since humans are typically warmer (37 C -98.6 F) than their
surroundings, interactions such as sitting, touching, or leaning leave residual
heat traces. These fading imprints serve as passive temporal codes, allowing
for the inference of recent events that exceed the capabilities of RGB cameras.
This work proposes a time-reversed reconstruction framework that uses paired
RGB and thermal images to recover scene states from a few seconds earlier. The
proposed approach couples Visual-Language Models (VLMs) with a constrained
diffusion process, where one VLM generates scene descriptions and another
guides image reconstruction, ensuring semantic and structural consistency. The
method is evaluated in three controlled scenarios, demonstrating the
feasibility of reconstructing plausible past frames up to 120 seconds earlier,
providing a first step toward time-reversed imaging from thermal traces.

### [8] [Personalizing Retrieval using Joint Embeddings or "the Return of Fluffy"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05411)
*Bruno Korbar,Andrew Zisserman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为pi-map的可训练映射网络，能够将对象实例的图像嵌入转换为文本标记，结合自然语言查询实现CLIP风格的图像检索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决使用复合查询检索图像的问题，即结合对象实例的图像信息和自然语言描述（如"Fluffy独角兽在某人头上"）来检索特定图像。

Method: 设计了一个映射网络，将局部图像嵌入转换为文本标记，该标记与自然语言查询结合后适合CLIP文本编码。每个对象实例只需训练一次映射网络，使用冻结的CLIP文本和图像编码器。

Result: 在两个个性化检索基准测试中达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: pi-map方法通过将图像嵌入映射为文本标记，有效提升了复合查询图像检索的能力，在个性化检索任务中表现出色。

Abstract: The goal of this paper is to be able to retrieve images using a compound
query that combines object instance information from an image, with a natural
text description of what that object is doing or where it is. For example, to
retrieve an image of "Fluffy the unicorn (specified by an image) on someone's
head". To achieve this we design a mapping network that can "translate" from a
local image embedding (of the object instance) to a text token, such that the
combination of the token and a natural language query is suitable for CLIP
style text encoding, and image retrieval. Generating a text token in this
manner involves a simple training procedure, that only needs to be performed
once for each object instance. We show that our approach of using a trainable
mapping network, termed pi-map, together with frozen CLIP text and image
encoders, improves the state of the art on two benchmarks designed to assess
personalized retrieval.

### [9] [ArchitectHead: Continuous Level of Detail Control for 3D Gaussian Head Avatars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05488)
*Peizhi Yan,Rabab Ward,Qiang Tang,Shan Du*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ArchitectHead是首个支持连续控制细节级别(LOD)的3D高斯头像框架，通过UV特征场和动态重采样实现渲染效率与视觉质量的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3DGS头像使用固定数量的高斯点，无法根据实际需求调整细节级别，限制了在需要平衡渲染效率和视觉质量的应用场景中的实用性。

Method: 在2D UV特征空间中参数化高斯点，构建多级可学习特征图组成的UV特征场，通过轻量级神经网络解码器将潜在特征转换为3D高斯属性，通过动态重采样特征图控制高斯点数量。

Result: 在最高LOD下实现SOTA质量，最低LOD仅使用6.2%的高斯点，质量适度下降(L1 Loss +7.9%等)，渲染速度几乎翻倍。

Conclusion: ArchitectHead实现了无需重新训练即可连续控制LOD的3D高斯头像，在保持高质量的同时显著提升渲染效率。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has enabled photorealistic and real-time
rendering of 3D head avatars. Existing 3DGS-based avatars typically rely on
tens of thousands of 3D Gaussian points (Gaussians), with the number of
Gaussians fixed after training. However, many practical applications require
adjustable levels of detail (LOD) to balance rendering efficiency and visual
quality. In this work, we propose "ArchitectHead", the first framework for
creating 3D Gaussian head avatars that support continuous control over LOD. Our
key idea is to parameterize the Gaussians in a 2D UV feature space and propose
a UV feature field composed of multi-level learnable feature maps to encode
their latent features. A lightweight neural network-based decoder then
transforms these latent features into 3D Gaussian attributes for rendering.
ArchitectHead controls the number of Gaussians by dynamically resampling
feature maps from the UV feature field at the desired resolutions. This method
enables efficient and continuous control of LOD without retraining.
Experimental results show that ArchitectHead achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA)
quality in self and cross-identity reenactment tasks at the highest LOD, while
maintaining near SOTA performance at lower LODs. At the lowest LOD, our method
uses only 6.2\% of the Gaussians while the quality degrades moderately (L1 Loss
+7.9\%, PSNR --0.97\%, SSIM --0.6\%, LPIPS Loss +24.1\%), and the rendering
speed nearly doubles.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于3D点云序列的动作识别新方法，结合点云技术和稀疏卷积网络，在NTU RGB-D 120数据集上达到89.3%的准确率，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着消费级深度传感器和激光雷达的普及，利用密集3D数据进行动作识别成为可能，为骨骼动作识别和视频方法提供了第三种途径。

Method: 构建了一个包含点云分割、个体跟踪和身体部位分割的流水线，核心是结合点云技术和稀疏卷积网络的3D动作识别骨干网络，支持深度传感器和单目深度估计的点云输入。

Result: 在NTU RGB-D 120数据集上表现出色，当训练和测试使用不同人类受试者时，通过集成传感器和估计深度输入达到89.3%的准确率。

Conclusion: 该方法在3D动作识别领域具有竞争力，为利用密集3D数据开发动作识别系统提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Recent research into human action recognition (HAR) has focused predominantly
on skeletal action recognition and video-based methods. With the increasing
availability of consumer-grade depth sensors and Lidar instruments, there is a
growing opportunity to leverage dense 3D data for action recognition, to
develop a third way. This paper presents a novel approach for recognizing
actions from 3D videos by introducing a pipeline that segments human point
clouds from the background of a scene, tracks individuals over time, and
performs body part segmentation. The method supports point clouds from both
depth sensors and monocular depth estimation. At the core of the proposed HAR
framework is a novel backbone for 3D action recognition, which combines
point-based techniques with sparse convolutional networks applied to
voxel-mapped point cloud sequences. Experiments incorporate auxiliary point
features including surface normals, color, infrared intensity, and body part
parsing labels, to enhance recognition accuracy. Evaluation on the NTU RGB- D
120 dataset demonstrates that the method is competitive with existing skeletal
action recognition algorithms. Moreover, combining both sensor-based and
estimated depth inputs in an ensemble setup, this approach achieves 89.3%
accuracy when different human subjects are considered for training and testing,
outperforming previous point cloud action recognition methods.

*Shinnosuke Saito,Takashi Matsubara*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于黎曼度量的扩散模型插值方法，通过噪声空间的几何结构实现更自然的数据流形感知插值


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型缺乏显式的低维潜在空间，限制了流形感知的分析和操作，现有插值方法会产生不自然的过渡

Method: 在噪声空间中定义黎曼度量，利用得分函数雅可比矩阵捕获数据流形切空间信息，计算噪声空间中的测地线

Result: 图像插值实验表明，该方法比现有的基于密度和朴素基线方法产生更自然和忠实的过渡

Conclusion: 提出的黎曼度量方法能够有效利用扩散模型学习的数据流形，实现更自然的插值效果

Abstract: Diffusion models are powerful deep generative models (DGMs) that generate
high-fidelity, diverse content. However, unlike classical DGMs, they lack an
explicit, tractable low-dimensional latent space that parameterizes the data
manifold. This absence limits manifold-aware analysis and operations, such as
interpolation and editing. Existing interpolation methods for diffusion models
typically follow paths through high-density regions, which are not necessarily
aligned with the data manifold and can yield perceptually unnatural
transitions. To exploit the data manifold learned by diffusion models, we
propose a novel Riemannian metric on the noise space, inspired by recent
findings that the Jacobian of the score function captures the tangent spaces to
the local data manifold. This metric encourages geodesics in the noise space to
stay within or run parallel to the learned data manifold. Experiments on image
interpolation show that our metric produces perceptually more natural and
faithful transitions than existing density-based and naive baselines.

*Sam Sartor,Pieter Peers*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Teamwork提出了一种灵活统一的解决方案，通过协调多个基础扩散模型实例来扩展输入输出通道，无需改变预训练模型架构，适用于多种图形任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有通道扩展方法通常是特定于应用的，难以适应不同扩散模型或新任务，需要一种更灵活的解决方案。

Method: 使用多个基础扩散模型实例（队友）进行协调，采用改进的低秩适应（LoRA）技术同时处理适应和协调问题，支持队友的动态激活/停用。

Result: 在多种生成和逆向图形任务中表现出色，包括修复、SVBRDF估计、本征分解、神经着色和本征图像合成。

Conclusion: Teamwork提供了一种高效灵活的方法来扩展预训练扩散模型的输入输出通道，并适应新任务，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Large pretrained diffusion models can provide strong priors beneficial for
many graphics applications. However, generative applications such as neural
rendering and inverse methods such as SVBRDF estimation and intrinsic image
decomposition require additional input or output channels. Current solutions
for channel expansion are often application specific and these solutions can be
difficult to adapt to different diffusion models or new tasks. This paper
introduces Teamwork: a flexible and efficient unified solution for jointly
increasing the number of input and output channels as well as adapting a
pretrained diffusion model to new tasks. Teamwork achieves channel expansion
without altering the pretrained diffusion model architecture by coordinating
and adapting multiple instances of the base diffusion model (\ie, teammates).
We employ a novel variation of Low Rank-Adaptation (LoRA) to jointly address
both adaptation and coordination between the different teammates. Furthermore
Teamwork supports dynamic (de)activation of teammates. We demonstrate the
flexibility and efficiency of Teamwork on a variety of generative and inverse
graphics tasks such as inpainting, single image SVBRDF estimation, intrinsic
decomposition, neural shading, and intrinsic image synthesis.

### [13] [Seeing the Big Picture: Evaluating Multimodal LLMs' Ability to Interpret and Grade Handwritten Student Work](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05538)
*Owen Henkel,Bill Roberts,Doug Jaffe,Laurence Holt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究评估了多模态大语言模型在批改和分析学生手写数学作业方面的表现，发现在有客观答案的算术题上表现接近人类水平，但在需要视觉解释和教学判断的数学插图上表现较差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索多模态大语言模型在基础教育中批改手写数学作业的潜力，因为手动批改学生完整解题过程耗时但能提供宝贵的学习洞察。

Method: 进行两个实验：实验A评估288份加纳中学生手写算术作业的客观答案识别；实验B评估150份美国小学生数学插图，分别测试模型直接分析图像和基于人类描述分析的能力。

Result: 实验A中模型准确率达95%（k=0.90），接近人类水平；实验B中直接分析插图时表现差（k=0.20），但基于人类描述时表现显著提升（k=0.47），达到人类间一致性水平。

Conclusion: MLLMs能较好识别和解释算术作业，但在理解学生数学插图方面仍有困难，视觉能力是当前瓶颈。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) raise the
question of their potential for grading, analyzing, and offering feedback on
handwritten student classwork. This capability would be particularly beneficial
in elementary and middle-school mathematics education, where most work remains
handwritten, because seeing students' full working of a problem provides
valuable insights into their learning processes, but is extremely
time-consuming to grade. We present two experiments investigating MLLM
performance on handwritten student mathematics classwork. Experiment A examines
288 handwritten responses from Ghanaian middle school students solving
arithmetic problems with objective answers. In this context, models achieved
near-human accuracy (95%, k = 0.90) but exhibited occasional errors that human
educators would be unlikely to make. Experiment B evaluates 150 mathematical
illustrations from American elementary students, where the drawings are the
answer to the question. These tasks lack single objective answers and require
sophisticated visual interpretation as well as pedagogical judgment in order to
analyze and evaluate them. We attempted to separate MLLMs' visual capabilities
from their pedagogical abilities by first asking them to grade the student
illustrations directly, and then by augmenting the image with a detailed human
description of the illustration. We found that when the models had to analyze
the student illustrations directly, they struggled, achieving only k = 0.20
with ground truth scores, but when given human descriptions, their agreement
levels improved dramatically to k = 0.47, which was in line with human-to-human
agreement levels. This gap suggests MLLMs can "see" and interpret arithmetic
work relatively well, but still struggle to "see" student mathematical
illustrations.

*Christopher Hoang,Mengye Ren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Midway Network是一种新的自监督学习架构，首次仅从自然视频中同时学习对象识别和运动理解的强大视觉表示，通过将潜在动态建模扩展到该领域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自监督学习方法主要专注于获取用于识别或运动的丰富表示，而不是同时处理两者。潜在动态建模在决策制定中用于学习观察及其随时间变换的潜在表示，但尚未应用于视觉表示学习领域。

Method: Midway Network利用中间自顶向下路径推断视频帧之间的运动潜在变量，采用密集前向预测目标和分层结构来处理自然视频中复杂的多对象场景。

Result: 在两个大规模自然视频数据集上预训练后，Midway Network在语义分割和光流任务上相对于先前的自监督学习方法实现了强劲性能。

Conclusion: Midway Network通过学习到的动态能够通过基于前向特征扰动的新颖分析方法捕捉高级对应关系，证明了其在同时学习对象识别和运动理解表示方面的有效性。

Abstract: Object recognition and motion understanding are key components of perception
that complement each other. While self-supervised learning methods have shown
promise in their ability to learn from unlabeled data, they have primarily
focused on obtaining rich representations for either recognition or motion
rather than both in tandem. On the other hand, latent dynamics modeling has
been used in decision making to learn latent representations of observations
and their transformations over time for control and planning tasks. In this
work, we present Midway Network, a new self-supervised learning architecture
that is the first to learn strong visual representations for both object
recognition and motion understanding solely from natural videos, by extending
latent dynamics modeling to this domain. Midway Network leverages a midway
top-down path to infer motion latents between video frames, as well as a dense
forward prediction objective and hierarchical structure to tackle the complex,
multi-object scenes of natural videos. We demonstrate that after pretraining on
two large-scale natural video datasets, Midway Network achieves strong
performance on both semantic segmentation and optical flow tasks relative to
prior self-supervised learning methods. We also show that Midway Network's
learned dynamics can capture high-level correspondence via a novel analysis
method based on forward feature perturbation.

TL;DR: HoloScene是一个创新的交互式3D重建框架，通过能量优化方法创建具有完整几何、物理稳定性和真实渲染的数字孪生环境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D重建方法在几何完整性、物体交互性、物理合理性、真实渲染和动态模拟等方面存在不足，需要一种能同时满足这些要求的解决方案。

Method: 采用基于能量的优化问题，结合观测数据、物理约束和生成先验，使用采样探索与梯度优化的混合方法进行高效优化。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上表现出优越性能，创建的虚拟环境具有完整几何、物理稳定性和真实渲染效果。

Conclusion: HoloScene在交互游戏和实时数字孪生操作等应用中展现出广泛适用性和有效性。

Abstract: Digitizing the physical world into accurate simulation-ready virtual
environments offers significant opportunities in a variety of fields such as
augmented and virtual reality, gaming, and robotics. However, current 3D
reconstruction and scene-understanding methods commonly fall short in one or
more critical aspects, such as geometry completeness, object interactivity,
physical plausibility, photorealistic rendering, or realistic physical
properties for reliable dynamic simulation. To address these limitations, we
introduce HoloScene, a novel interactive 3D reconstruction framework that
simultaneously achieves these requirements. HoloScene leverages a comprehensive
interactive scene-graph representation, encoding object geometry, appearance,
and physical properties alongside hierarchical and inter-object relationships.
Reconstruction is formulated as an energy-based optimization problem,
integrating observational data, physical constraints, and generative priors
into a unified, coherent objective. Optimization is efficiently performed via a
hybrid approach combining sampling-based exploration with gradient-based
refinement. The resulting digital twins exhibit complete and precise geometry,
physical stability, and realistic rendering from novel viewpoints. Evaluations
conducted on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate superior performance,
while practical use-cases in interactive gaming and real-time digital-twin
manipulation illustrate HoloScene's broad applicability and effectiveness.

TL;DR: CalibCLIP是一个无需训练的方法，通过对比视觉增强器（CVE）和判别概念校准器（DCC）来校准视觉语言模型中主导令牌的抑制效应，提升文本驱动图像检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型存在结构限制，少数低贡献令牌可能过度捕获全局语义，主导信息聚合过程并抑制文本驱动图像检索任务中的判别特征。

Method: 在视觉空间使用对比视觉增强器（CVE）将视觉特征解耦为目标区域和低信息区域，识别主导令牌并动态抑制其表示；在文本空间使用判别概念校准器（DCC）区分文本查询中的通用概念和判别概念。

Result: 在涵盖三种图像检索任务的七个基准测试中均取得一致改进，证明了CalibCLIP的有效性。

Conclusion: CalibCLIP通过校准主导令牌的抑制效应，有效提升了文本驱动图像检索的性能，无需额外训练即可实现显著改进。

Abstract: Existing Visual Language Models (VLMs) suffer structural limitations where a
few low contribution tokens may excessively capture global semantics,
dominating the information aggregation process and suppressing the
discriminative features in text-driven image retrieval tasks. To address this,
we introduce \textbf{CalibCLIP}, a training-free method designed to calibrate
the suppressive effect of dominant tokens. Specifically, in the visual space,
we propose the Contrastive Visual Enhancer (CVE), which decouples visual
features into target and low information regions. Subsequently, it identifies
dominant tokens and dynamically suppresses their representations.In the textual
space, we introduce the Discriminative Concept Calibrator (DCC), which aims to
differentiate between general and discriminative concepts within the text
query. By mitigating the challenges posed by generic concepts and improving the
representations of discriminative concepts, DCC strengthens the differentiation
among similar samples. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate consistent
improvements across seven benchmarks spanning three image retrieval tasks,
underscoring the effectiveness of CalibCLIP. Code is available at:

TL;DR: ShortCoTI是一个轻量级优化框架，通过强化学习减少视觉思维链中的冗余，在保持图像质量的同时将提示推理长度减少54%，提高计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自回归多模态大语言模型使用思维链推理来增强图像生成的对齐性和细节，但这会导致视觉过度思考现象，引入不必要的冗余，增加计算成本并可能产生与原始提示矛盾的细节。

Method: 提出ShortCoTI框架，使用自适应奖励函数根据任务难度鼓励更简洁的思维链，并将该奖励整合到强化学习范式中。

Result: 在多个基准测试(T2I-CompBench, GenEval)上，将提示推理长度减少54%，同时保持或略微提高质量指标，消除了冗长的解释和重复的改进。

Conclusion: ShortCoTI在不影响生成图像保真度或视觉吸引力的前提下，显著提高了计算效率，产生既简洁又语义丰富的推理提示。

Abstract: Autoregressive multimodal large language models have recently gained
popularity for image generation, driven by advances in foundation models. To
enhance alignment and detail, newer approaches employ chain-of-thought (CoT)
reasoning, expanding user inputs into elaborated prompts prior to image
synthesis. However, this strategy can introduce unnecessary redundancy -- a
phenomenon we call visual overthinking -- which increases computational costs
and can introduce details that contradict the original prompt. In this work, we
explore how to generate more concise CoT sequences for more efficient image
generation. We introduce ShortCoTI, a lightweight optimization framework that
encourages more concise CoT while preserving output image quality. ShortCoTI
rewards more concise prompts with an adaptive function that scales according to
an estimated difficulty for each task. Incorporating this reward into a
reinforcement learning paradigm reduces prompt reasoning length by 54% while
maintaining or slightly improving quality metrics across multiple benchmarks
(T2I-CompBench, GenEval). Qualitative analysis shows that our method eliminates
verbose explanations and repetitive refinements, producing reasoning prompts
that are both concise and semantically rich. As a result, ShortCoTI improves
computational efficiency without compromising the fidelity or visual appeal of
generated images.

Motivation: 现有HOID方法依赖VLMs的先验知识，训练策略和模型架构复杂，而MLLMs在人类-物体交互检测中的推理能力未被充分探索。

Method: 引入HOI推理过程和HOID奖励函数，使用强化学习方法训练MLLMs，通过纯文本方式解决HOID任务。

Result: 在HICO-DET数据集上，HOI-R1达到基线方法2倍的准确率，具有出色的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 证明了语言模型在HOID任务中的潜力，提供了一种无需额外检测模块的简化解决方案。

Abstract: Recent Human-object interaction detection (HOID) methods highly require prior
knowledge from VLMs to enhance the interaction recognition capabilities. The
training strategies and model architectures for connecting the knowledge from
VLMs to the HOI instance representations from the object detector are
challenging, and the whole framework is complex for further development or
application. On the other hand, the inherent reasoning abilities of MLLMs on
human-object interaction detection are under-explored. Inspired by the recent
success of training MLLMs with reinforcement learning (RL) methods, we propose
HOI-R1 and first explore the potential of the language model on the HOID task
without any additional detection modules. We introduce an HOI reasoning process
and HOID reward functions to solve the HOID task by pure text. The results on
the HICO-DET dataset show that HOI-R1 achieves 2x the accuracy of the baseline
with great generalization ability. The source code is available at

Motivation: 当前自回归模型在复杂空间条件生成时需要微调预训练模型，导致训练成本高昂

Method: 使用分布式架构的轻量控制模块，包含上下文感知注意力层和共享门控前馈网络；引入早期中心采样策略和温度调度

Result: 在尺度自回归模型上验证，实现了高保真度和多样性的图像生成控制，超越现有基线，显著提升训练和推理效率

Conclusion: ECM框架为自回归模型提供了高效的空间条件生成能力，在保持性能的同时大幅降低计算成本

Abstract: Recent advances in autoregressive (AR) models have demonstrated their
potential to rival diffusion models in image synthesis. However, for complex
spatially-conditioned generation, current AR approaches rely on fine-tuning the
pre-trained model, leading to significant training costs. In this paper, we
propose the Efficient Control Model (ECM), a plug-and-play framework featuring
a lightweight control module that introduces control signals via a distributed
architecture. This architecture consists of context-aware attention layers that
refine conditional features using real-time generated tokens, and a shared
gated feed-forward network (FFN) designed to maximize the utilization of its
limited capacity and ensure coherent control feature learning. Furthermore,
recognizing the critical role of early-stage generation in determining semantic
structure, we introduce an early-centric sampling strategy that prioritizes
learning early control sequences. This approach reduces computational cost by
lowering the number of training tokens per iteration, while a complementary
temperature scheduling during inference compensates for the resulting
insufficient training of late-stage tokens. Extensive experiments on
scale-based AR models validate that our method achieves high-fidelity and
diverse control over image generation, surpassing existing baselines while
significantly improving both training and inference efficiency.

Motivation: 传统自回归点云生成方法因强加人工排序而无法有效捕捉长程依赖关系，导致无法保持全局结构特性如对称性、一致拓扑和大尺度几何规律。

Method: 提出PointNSP框架，采用从粗到细的多尺度生成策略，通过下一尺度预测范式在低分辨率保持全局形状结构，在高分辨率逐步细化几何细节。

Result: 在ShapeNet上的实验表明，PointNSP首次在自回归范式中达到最先进的生成质量，并在参数、训练和推理效率上超越了强大的扩散基线模型。

Conclusion: PointNSP通过多尺度分解使自回归目标与点集的置换不变性对齐，在保持高效性的同时显著提升了生成质量，特别是在密集点云生成中优势更加明显。

Abstract: Autoregressive point cloud generation has long lagged behind diffusion-based
approaches in quality. The performance gap stems from the fact that
autoregressive models impose an artificial ordering on inherently unordered
point sets, forcing shape generation to proceed as a sequence of local
predictions. This sequential bias emphasizes short-range continuity but
undermines the model's capacity to capture long-range dependencies, hindering
its ability to enforce global structural properties such as symmetry,
consistent topology, and large-scale geometric regularities. Inspired by the
level-of-detail (LOD) principle in shape modeling, we propose PointNSP, a
coarse-to-fine generative framework that preserves global shape structure at
low resolutions and progressively refines fine-grained geometry at higher
scales through a next-scale prediction paradigm. This multi-scale factorization
aligns the autoregressive objective with the permutation-invariant nature of
point sets, enabling rich intra-scale interactions while avoiding brittle fixed
orderings. Experiments on ShapeNet show that PointNSP establishes
state-of-the-art (SOTA) generation quality for the first time within the
autoregressive paradigm. In addition, it surpasses strong diffusion-based
baselines in parameter, training, and inference efficiency. Finally, in dense
generation with 8,192 points, PointNSP's advantages become even more
pronounced, underscoring its scalability potential.

Abstract: Tear film break-up (TFBU) analysis is critical for diagnosing dry eye
syndrome, but automated TFBU segmentation remains challenging due to the lack
of annotated datasets and integrated solutions. This paper introduces the Tear
Film Multi-task (TFM) Dataset, the first comprehensive dataset for multi-task
tear film analysis, comprising 15 high-resolution videos (totaling 6,247
frames) annotated with three vision tasks: frame-level classification ('clear',
'closed', 'broken', 'blur'), Placido Ring detection, and pixel-wise TFBU area
segmentation. Leveraging this dataset, we first propose TF-Net, a novel and
efficient baseline segmentation model. TF-Net incorporates a MobileOne-mini
backbone with re-parameterization techniques and an enhanced feature pyramid
network to achieve a favorable balance between accuracy and computational
efficiency for real-time clinical applications. We further establish benchmark
performance on the TFM segmentation subset by comparing TF-Net against several
state-of-the-art medical image segmentation models. Furthermore, we design
TF-Collab, a novel integrated real-time pipeline that synergistically leverages
models trained on all three tasks of the TFM dataset. By sequentially
orchestrating frame classification for BUT determination, pupil region
localization for input standardization, and TFBU segmentation, TF-Collab fully
automates the analysis. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed TF-Net and TF-Collab, providing a foundation for future research
in ocular surface diagnostics. Our code and the TFM datasets are available at

TL;DR: InstaGeo是一个端到端的开源框架，解决了地理空间基础模型部署的两个主要限制：缺乏自动化地理空间数据管道和微调模型体积过大。它集成了自动数据管理、任务特定模型蒸馏和无缝部署功能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的地理空间基础模型缺乏处理原始卫星图像的工作流程，下游适应通常保留原始编码器的全部复杂性，限制了实际部署。

Method: InstaGeo框架包含三个核心组件：(1)自动数据管理将原始图像转换为模型就绪数据集；(2)任务特定模型蒸馏获得紧凑、计算高效的模型；(3)作为交互式网络地图应用无缝部署。

Result: 在三个已发表研究中复现数据集并训练模型，mIoU差异很小：洪水映射-0.73pp，作物分割-0.20pp，沙漠蝗虫预测+1.79pp。蒸馏模型比标准微调对应模型小8倍，减少了FLOPs和CO2排放。

Conclusion: InstaGeo通过统一数据准备、模型压缩和部署，将研究级地理空间基础模型转变为实用的低碳工具，用于实时大规模地球观测，推动地理空间AI向数据质量和应用驱动创新转变。

Abstract: Open-access multispectral imagery from missions like Landsat 8-9 and
Sentinel-2 has fueled the development of geospatial foundation models (GFMs)
for humanitarian and environmental applications. Yet, their deployment remains
limited by (i) the absence of automated geospatial data pipelines and (ii) the
large size of fine-tuned models. Existing GFMs lack workflows for processing
raw satellite imagery, and downstream adaptations often retain the full
complexity of the original encoder.
  We present InstaGeo, an open-source, end-to-end framework that addresses
these challenges by integrating: (1) automated data curation to transform raw
imagery into model-ready datasets; (2) task-specific model distillation to
derive compact, compute-efficient models; and (3) seamless deployment as
interactive web-map applications. Using InstaGeo, we reproduced datasets from
three published studies and trained models with marginal mIoU differences of
-0.73 pp for flood mapping, -0.20 pp for crop segmentation, and +1.79 pp for
desert locust prediction. The distilled models are up to 8x smaller than
standard fine-tuned counterparts, reducing FLOPs and CO2 emissions with minimal
accuracy loss.
  Leveraging InstaGeo's streamlined data pipeline, we also curated a larger
crop segmentation dataset, achieving a state-of-the-art mIoU of 60.65%, a 12 pp
improvement over prior baselines. Moreover, InstaGeo enables users to progress
from raw data to model deployment within a single working day.
  By unifying data preparation, model compression, and deployment, InstaGeo
transforms research-grade GFMs into practical, low-carbon tools for real-time,
large-scale Earth observation. This approach shifts geospatial AI toward data
quality and application-driven innovation. Source code, datasets, and model

Motivation: 当前基于深度学习的伪造检测器通常被视为黑盒，不清楚它们是否真正依赖频谱域中的周期性峰值作为合成图像检测的依据，这限制了检测器的可解释性和可信度。

Method: 提出了一种策略来从图像中移除频谱峰值，并分析这一操作对多个检测器的影响；同时引入了一个仅依赖频率峰值的简单线性检测器，作为完全可解释的基线方法。

Result: 研究发现大多数检测器并不从根本上依赖频谱峰值，这挑战了该领域广泛存在的假设。

Conclusion: 这项工作为开发更透明和可靠的取证工具铺平了道路，强调了需要超越频谱峰值依赖的检测方法。

Abstract: Over the years, the forensics community has proposed several deep
learning-based detectors to mitigate the risks of generative AI. Recently,
frequency-domain artifacts (particularly periodic peaks in the magnitude
spectrum), have received significant attention, as they have been often
considered a strong indicator of synthetic image generation. However,
state-of-the-art detectors are typically used as black-boxes, and it still
remains unclear whether they truly rely on these peaks. This limits their
interpretability and trust. In this work, we conduct a systematic study to
address this question. We propose a strategy to remove spectral peaks from
images and analyze the impact of this operation on several detectors. In
addition, we introduce a simple linear detector that relies exclusively on
frequency peaks, providing a fully interpretable baseline free from the
confounding influence of deep learning. Our findings reveal that most detectors
are not fundamentally dependent on spectral peaks, challenging a widespread
assumption in the field and paving the way for more transparent and reliable
forensic tools.

Conclusion: CHEST损失成功解决了在双曲空间中应用代理损失的问题，通过结合双曲和欧几里得空间实现了更好的深度度量学习性能。

Abstract: Deep metric learning (DML) aims to learn a neural network mapping data to an
embedding space, which can represent semantic similarity between data points.
Hyperbolic space is attractive for DML since it can represent richer
structures, such as tree structures. DML in hyperbolic space is based on
pair-based loss or unsupervised regularization loss. On the other hand,
supervised proxy-based losses in hyperbolic space have not been reported yet
due to some issues in applying proxy-based losses in a hyperbolic space.
However, proxy-based losses are attractive for large-scale datasets since they
have less training complexity. To address these, this paper proposes the
Combined Hyperbolic and Euclidean Soft Triple (CHEST) loss. CHEST loss is
composed of the proxy-based losses in hyperbolic and Euclidean spaces and the
regularization loss based on hyperbolic hierarchical clustering. We find that
the combination of hyperbolic and Euclidean spaces improves DML accuracy and
learning stability for both spaces. Finally, we evaluate the CHEST loss on four
benchmark datasets, achieving a new state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: 该研究提出两个深度学习框架：AHP-CADNet用于眼源性异常头位姿势的自动诊断，以及基于课程学习的插补框架处理缺失数据，在PoseGaze-AHP数据集上表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 眼源性异常头位姿势的早期诊断很重要，但当前临床评估主要依赖主观判断且受不完整医疗记录影响，需要自动化解决方案。

Method: 1. AHP-CADNet：多级注意力融合框架，整合眼部标志点、头部姿态特征和结构化临床属性；2. 基于课程学习的插补框架，逐步利用结构化和非结构化临床数据处理缺失值。

Result: AHP-CADNet在分类任务中准确率达96.9-99.0%，连续变量预测误差低（MAE 0.103-0.199，R²>0.93）；插补框架在所有临床变量上保持高准确率（93.46-99.78%），临床依赖建模显著改善性能（p<0.001）。

Conclusion: 两个框架在临床环境中对自动诊断和缺失数据处理均有效，为眼源性异常头位姿势的客观评估提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Ocular-induced abnormal head posture (AHP) is a compensatory mechanism that
arises from ocular misalignment conditions, such as strabismus, enabling
patients to reduce diplopia and preserve binocular vision. Early diagnosis
minimizes morbidity and secondary complications such as facial asymmetry;
however, current clinical assessments remain largely subjective and are further
complicated by incomplete medical records. This study addresses both challenges
through two complementary deep learning frameworks. First, AHP-CADNet is a
multi-level attention fusion framework for automated diagnosis that integrates
ocular landmarks, head pose features, and structured clinical attributes to
generate interpretable predictions. Second, a curriculum learning-based
imputation framework is designed to mitigate missing data by progressively
leveraging structured variables and unstructured clinical notes to enhance
diagnostic robustness under realistic data conditions. Evaluation on the
PoseGaze-AHP dataset demonstrates robust diagnostic performance. AHP-CADNet
achieves 96.9-99.0 percent accuracy across classification tasks and low
prediction errors for continuous variables, with MAE ranging from 0.103 to
0.199 and R2 exceeding 0.93. The imputation framework maintains high accuracy
across all clinical variables (93.46-99.78 percent with PubMedBERT), with
clinical dependency modeling yielding significant improvements (p < 0.001).
These findings confirm the effectiveness of both frameworks for automated
diagnosis and recovery from missing data in clinical settings.

Abstract: Reproducing cognitive development, group interaction, and long-term evolution
in virtual classrooms remains a core challenge for educational AI, as real
classrooms integrate open-ended cognition, dynamic social interaction,
affective factors, and multi-session development rarely captured together.
Existing approaches mostly focus on short-term or single-agent settings,
limiting systematic study of classroom complexity and cross-task reuse. We
present EduVerse, the first user-defined multi-agent simulation space that
supports environment, agent, and session customization. A distinctive
human-in-the-loop interface further allows real users to join the space. Built
on a layered CIE (Cognition-Interaction-Evolution) architecture, EduVerse
ensures individual consistency, authentic interaction, and longitudinal
adaptation in cognition, emotion, and behavior-reproducing realistic classroom
dynamics with seamless human-agent integration. We validate EduVerse in
middle-school Chinese classes across three text genres, environments, and
multiple sessions. Results show: (1) Instructional alignment: simulated IRF
rates (0.28-0.64) closely match real classrooms (0.37-0.49), indicating
pedagogical realism; (2) Group interaction and role differentiation: network
density (0.27-0.40) with about one-third of peer links realized, while
human-agent tasks indicate a balance between individual variability and
instructional stability; (3) Cross-session evolution: the positive transition
rate R+ increase by 11.7% on average, capturing longitudinal shifts in
behavior, emotion, and cognition and revealing structured learning
trajectories. Overall, EduVerse balances realism, reproducibility, and
interpretability, providing a scalable platform for educational AI. The system
will be open-sourced to foster cross-disciplinary research.

Conclusion: 同时考虑脚本与视频视觉内容和语音文本的关联性能够有效提升脚本驱动视频摘要的性能，扩展的数据集为多模态视频摘要研究提供了更好的基准。

Abstract: In this work, we extend a recent method for script-driven video
summarization, originally considering just the visual content of the video, to
take into account the relevance of the user-provided script also with the
video's spoken content. In the proposed method, SD-MVSum, the dependence
between each considered pair of data modalities, i.e., script-video and
script-transcript, is modeled using a new weighted cross-modal attention
mechanism. This explicitly exploits the semantic similarity between the paired
modalities in order to promote the parts of the full-length video with the
highest relevance to the user-provided script. Furthermore, we extend two
large-scale datasets for video summarization (S-VideoXum, MrHiSum), to make
them suitable for training and evaluation of script-driven multimodal video
summarization methods. Experimental comparisons document the competitiveness of
our SD-MVSum method against other SOTA approaches for script-driven and generic
video summarization. Our new method and extended datasets are available at:

TL;DR: 提出了ARGUS模型用于肝癌组织学分型，通过捕获肿瘤微环境中的宏观-中观-微观层次信息，结合几何特征和分层视野对齐，在公共和私有队列中实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 肝癌组织学分型在WSI中具有复杂的层次结构特征，但现有方法未能充分利用这些关键描述符，导致对组织学表征理解有限和分型性能不佳。

Method: ARGUS模型：1)构建微观几何特征表示细胞级模式；2)设计分层视野对齐模块建模宏观和中观层次交互；3)通过几何先验引导融合策略整合特征。

Result: 在公共和私有队列上的广泛实验表明，ARGUS在肝癌组织学分型中实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: ARGUS为原发性肝癌提供了有效的临床诊断工具，通过捕获层次信息和几何特征显著提升了组织学分型性能。

Abstract: Primary liver malignancies are widely recognized as the most heterogeneous
and prognostically diverse cancers of the digestive system. Among these,
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) emerge
as the two principal histological subtypes, demonstrating significantly greater
complexity in tissue morphology and cellular architecture than other common
tumors. The intricate representation of features in Whole Slide Images (WSIs)
encompasses abundant crucial information for liver cancer histological
subtyping, regarding hierarchical pyramid structure, tumor microenvironment
(TME), and geometric representation. However, recent approaches have not
adequately exploited these indispensable effective descriptors, resulting in a
limited understanding of histological representation and suboptimal subtyping
performance. To mitigate these limitations, ARGUS is proposed to advance
histological subtyping in liver cancer by capturing the macro-meso-micro
hierarchical information within the TME. Specifically, we first construct a
micro-geometry feature to represent fine-grained cell-level pattern via a
geometric structure across nuclei, thereby providing a more refined and precise
perspective for delineating pathological images. Then, a Hierarchical
Field-of-Views (FoVs) Alignment module is designed to model macro- and
meso-level hierarchical interactions inherent in WSIs. Finally, the augmented
micro-geometry and FoVs features are fused into a joint representation via
present Geometry Prior Guided Fusion strategy for modeling holistic phenotype
interactions. Extensive experiments on public and private cohorts demonstrate
that our ARGUS achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in histological
subtyping of liver cancer, which provide an effective diagnostic tool for
primary liver malignancies in clinical practice.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的管道，利用预训练扩散模型将人物从参考图像无缝插入背景场景，实现真实的人物放置和高质量个性化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常将人物放置和个性化视为独立问题，忽略了它们之间的相互联系，且依赖特定任务训练。本文旨在开发一个统一的无需训练方法。

Method: 结合反演技术和无分类器引导实现全局编辑，提出掩码引导的自注意力机制确保高质量个性化，仅需单张参考图像即可保持人物身份特征。

Result: 在多样化合成场景图像中实现了最先进的结果，在背景和主体身份保持方面表现出色，无需训练即可完成真实人物插入。

Conclusion: 扩散模型本身具备在复杂场景中放置人物的知识，无需特定任务训练。该方法首次实现了无需训练的真实人物插入，并达到了最先进的性能。

Abstract: The task of realistically inserting a human from a reference image into a
background scene is highly challenging, requiring the model to (1) determine
the correct location and poses of the person and (2) perform high-quality
personalization conditioned on the background. Previous approaches often treat
them as separate problems, overlooking their interconnections, and typically
rely on training to achieve high performance. In this work, we introduce a
unified training-free pipeline that leverages pre-trained text-to-image
diffusion models. We show that diffusion models inherently possess the
knowledge to place people in complex scenes without requiring task-specific
training. By combining inversion techniques with classifier-free guidance, our
method achieves affordance-aware global editing, seamlessly inserting people
into scenes. Furthermore, our proposed mask-guided self-attention mechanism
ensures high-quality personalization, preserving the subject's identity,
clothing, and body features from just a single reference image. To the best of
our knowledge, we are the first to perform realistic human insertions into
scenes in a training-free manner and achieve state-of-the-art results in
diverse composite scene images with excellent identity preservation in
backgrounds and subjects.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动视频编辑在计算机视觉和多媒体领域仍未被充分探索，特别是与视频生成和场景理解相比。本文专注于解决古典音乐会多摄像头录制的编辑挑战。

Method: 使用轻量级卷积-变换器管道整合音频log-mel频谱图、可选图像嵌入和标量时间特征进行时间分割；使用CLIP编码器替代ResNet进行空间选择，并将干扰项选择约束在同一音乐会片段内。

Result: 模型在检测剪切点方面优于先前基线，并在视觉镜头选择方面提供有竞争力的性能，推进了多模态自动视频编辑的技术水平。

Conclusion: 该方法通过分解编辑任务和采用多模态架构，在古典音乐会视频自动编辑方面取得了先进成果，为自动视频编辑领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Automated video editing remains an underexplored task in the computer vision
and multimedia domains, especially when contrasted with the growing interest in
video generation and scene understanding. In this work, we address the specific
challenge of editing multicamera recordings of classical music concerts by
decomposing the problem into two key sub-tasks: when to cut and how to cut.
Building on recent literature, we propose a novel multimodal architecture for
the temporal segmentation task (when to cut), which integrates log-mel
spectrograms from the audio signals, plus an optional image embedding, and
scalar temporal features through a lightweight convolutional-transformer
pipeline. For the spatial selection task (how to cut), we improve the
literature by updating from old backbones, e.g. ResNet, with a CLIP-based
encoder and constraining distractor selection to segments from the same
concert. Our dataset was constructed following a pseudo-labeling approach, in
which raw video data was automatically clustered into coherent shot segments.
We show that our models outperformed previous baselines in detecting cut points
and provide competitive visual shot selection, advancing the state of the art
in multimodal automated video editing.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究开发了一种基于低成本图像监测系统和新型图像分析流程的方法，用于评估R. solani接种对生菜种子萌发和早期发育的影响。该方法通过形态学和空间特征结合时间整合，实现了高精度的幼苗计数和活力评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图像分析方法在复杂条件下（如叶片重叠）无法准确识别和量化单个幼苗，需要开发更稳健的方法来评估病原体对种子萌发的影响。

Method: 部署多台摄像头连续捕捉感染组和对照组的萌发过程图像，开发了集成形态学和空间特征的新型图像分析流程，采用时间整合方法考虑发育轨迹。

Result: R. solani感染显著降低了萌发率和早期幼苗活力。该方法在具有挑战性的密集交织生长场景中表现出高准确性，决定系数达0.98，均方根误差为1.12。

Conclusion: 研究验证了将低成本成像硬件与先进计算工具结合进行非破坏性、可扩展表型数据采集的可行性，时间整合方法在传统分割技术失效的后期阶段特别有效。

Abstract: The study investigates the effects of R. solani inoculation on the
germination and early development of Lactuca sativa L. seeds using a low-cost,
image-based monitoring system. Multiple cameras were deployed to continuously
capture images of the germination process in both infected and control groups.
The objective was to assess the impact of the pathogen by analyzing germination
dynamics and growth over time. To achieve this, a novel image analysis pipeline
was developed. The algorithm integrates both morphological and spatial features
to identify and quantify individual seedlings, even under complex conditions
where traditional image analyses fails. A key innovation of the method lies in
its temporal integration: each analysis step considers not only the current
status but also their developmental across prior time points. This approach
enables robust discrimination of individual seedlings, especially when
overlapping leaves significantly hinder object separation. The method
demonstrated high accuracy in seedling counting and vigor assessment, even in
challenging scenarios characterized by dense and intertwined growth. Results
confirm that R. solani infection significantly reduces germination rates and
early seedling vigor. The study also validates the feasibility of combining
low-cost imaging hardware with advanced computational tools to obtain
phenotyping data in a non-destructive and scalable manner. The temporal
integration enabled accurate quantification of germinated seeds and precise
determination of seedling emergence timing. This approach proved particularly
effective in later stages of the experiment, where conventional segmentation
techniques failed due to overlapping or intertwined seedlings, making accurate
counting. The method achieved a coefficient of determination of 0.98 and a root
mean square error (RMSE) of 1.12, demonstrating its robustness and reliability.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于对象级别的视觉表示学习方法，通过将视觉对象视为视觉等价于语言中的单词，来增强视觉模型的语义理解和上下文推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉模型在推理和上下文学习方面落后于语言模型，这种差距可能源于当前视觉Transformer训练方案缺乏语义和上下文指导。

Method: 提出在掩码图像建模框架中，对视觉对象而非随机图像块进行掩码，迫使模型学习视觉元素之间的全局上下文和语义关系。

Result: 定性和定量评估表明，对象级表示有助于学习真实世界分布，而无需像素平均捷径。在VQA、GQA、ScienceQA等任务上的多模态LLM评估显示，该方法显著提升了推理和上下文理解能力。

Conclusion: 对象级编码是开发更强视觉编码器和分词器的有效方向，能够缩小视觉模型与语言模型在推理能力上的差距。

Abstract: Recent advances in language modeling have witnessed the rise of highly
desirable emergent capabilities, such as reasoning and in-context learning.
However, vision models have yet to exhibit comparable progress in these areas.
In this paper, we argue that this gap could stem from the lack of semantic and
contextual guidance in current vision transformer (ViT) training schemes, and
such a gap can be narrowed through the design of a semantic-grounded objective.
Specifically, we notice that individual words in natural language are
inherently semantic, and modeling directly on word tokens naturally learns a
realistic distribution. In contrast, ViTs rely on spatial patchification, which
inevitably lacks semantic information. To bridge this gap, we propose to
directly model "object" as the visual equivalence of "word," pushing the model
to learn the global context and semantics among visual elements. We investigate
our hypotheses via masked image modeling (MIM), a framework where our approach
can be readily tested by applying masks to visual objects rather than random
patches. Considerable evidence from qualitative and quantitative evaluations
reveals a key finding: object-level representation alone helps to learn a
real-world distribution, whereas pixel-averaging shortcuts are often learned
without it. Moreover, further evaluations with multimodal LLMs (MLLM) on visual
question answering (VQA, GQA, ScienceQA) tasks demonstrate the strong reasoning
and contextual understanding gained with this simple objective. We hope our
study highlights the effectiveness of object-level encoding and provides a
plausible direction for developing stronger vision encoders and tokenizers.
Code and model will be publicly released. Keywords: Semantic Visual Tokenizer,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型在从参考照片生成身份一致图像时难以准确控制年龄，且微调通常需要昂贵的跨年龄配对图像。

Method: 利用衰老的线性特性，引入年龄条件提示混合和年龄特定的LoRA融合策略（使用SVDMix矩阵融合技术），实现中间年龄肖像的高质量生成。

Result: AgeBooth能够从单个参考图像生成不同年龄段的逼真且身份一致的人脸图像，在年龄控制和视觉质量方面优于现有最先进的基于编辑的方法。

Conclusion: AgeBooth提供了一种无需昂贵年龄变化数据集的有效年龄控制解决方案，在保持身份一致性的同时实现了高质量的年龄编辑。

Abstract: Recent diffusion model research focuses on generating identity-consistent
images from a reference photo, but they struggle to accurately control age
while preserving identity, and fine-tuning such models often requires costly
paired images across ages. In this paper, we propose AgeBooth, a novel
age-specific finetuning approach that can effectively enhance the age control
capability of adapterbased identity personalization models without the need for
expensive age-varied datasets. To reduce dependence on a large amount of
age-labeled data, we exploit the linear nature of aging by introducing
age-conditioned prompt blending and an age-specific LoRA fusion strategy that
leverages SVDMix, a matrix fusion technique. These techniques enable
high-quality generation of intermediate-age portraits. Our AgeBooth produces
realistic and identity-consistent face images across different ages from a
single reference image. Experiments show that AgeBooth achieves superior age
control and visual quality compared to previous state-of-the-art editing-based
methods.

Conclusion: 该方法无需手动标注，显著提升下游任务性能，为数据增强提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Generating enough and diverse data through augmentation offers an efficient
solution to the time-consuming and labour-intensive process of collecting and
annotating pixel-wise images. Traditional data augmentation techniques often
face challenges in manipulating high-level semantic attributes, such as
materials and textures. In contrast, diffusion models offer a robust
alternative, by effectively utilizing text-to-image or image-to-image
transformation. However, existing diffusion-based methods are either
computationally expensive or compromise on performance. To address this issue,
we introduce a novel training-free pipeline that integrates pretrained
ControlNet and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to generate synthetic images
paired with pixel-level labels. This approach eliminates the need for manual
annotations and significantly improves downstream tasks. To improve the
fidelity and diversity, we add a Multi-way Prompt Generator, Mask Generator and
High-quality Image Selection module. Our results on PASCAL-5i and COCO-20i
present promising performance and outperform concurrent work for one-shot
semantic segmentation.

Result: FusionDetect在现有基准上比最接近的竞争对手准确率高3.87%，平均精度高6.13%；在OmniGen上准确率提升4.48%，对常见图像扰动具有出色鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 不仅提出了顶级性能的检测器，还建立了新的基准和框架，推动通用AI图像检测的发展。

Abstract: The rapid development of generative models has made it increasingly crucial
to develop detectors that can reliably detect synthetic images. Although most
of the work has now focused on cross-generator generalization, we argue that
this viewpoint is too limited. Detecting synthetic images involves another
equally important challenge: generalization across visual domains. To bridge
this gap,we present the OmniGen Benchmark. This comprehensive evaluation
dataset incorporates 12 state-of-the-art generators, providing a more realistic
way of evaluating detector performance under realistic conditions. In addition,
we introduce a new method, FusionDetect, aimed at addressing both vectors of
generalization. FusionDetect draws on the benefits of two frozen foundation
models: CLIP & Dinov2. By deriving features from both complementary models,we
develop a cohesive feature space that naturally adapts to changes in both
thecontent and design of the generator. Our extensive experiments demonstrate
that FusionDetect delivers not only a new state-of-the-art, which is 3.87% more
accurate than its closest competitor and 6.13% more precise on average on
established benchmarks, but also achieves a 4.48% increase in accuracy on
OmniGen,along with exceptional robustness to common image perturbations. We
introduce not only a top-performing detector, but also a new benchmark and
framework for furthering universal AI image detection. The code and dataset are

Result: 在无监督3D实例分割中达到新的最先进水平，mAP达到50.95%，甚至超过使用2D边界框监督的MWSIS方法(48.42%)。

Conclusion: ALISE证明了完全无监督的LiDAR实例分割的可行性，通过综合设计实现了超越有监督方法的性能。

Abstract: The manual annotation of outdoor LiDAR point clouds for instance segmentation
is extremely costly and time-consuming. Current methods attempt to reduce this
burden but still rely on some form of human labeling. To completely eliminate
this dependency, we introduce ALISE, a novel framework that performs LiDAR
instance segmentation without any annotations. The central challenge is to
generate high-quality pseudo-labels in a fully unsupervised manner. Our
approach starts by employing Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), guided by text
and images, to produce initial pseudo-labels. We then refine these labels
through a dedicated spatio-temporal voting module, which combines 2D and 3D
semantics for both offline and online optimization. To achieve superior feature
learning, we further introduce two forms of semantic supervision: a set of 2D
prior-based losses that inject visual knowledge into the 3D network, and a
novel prototype-based contrastive loss that builds a discriminative feature
space by exploiting 3D semantic consistency. This comprehensive design results
in significant performance gains, establishing a new state-of-the-art for
unsupervised 3D instance segmentation. Remarkably, our approach even
outperforms MWSIS, a method that operates with supervision from ground-truth
(GT) 2D bounding boxes by a margin of 2.53% in mAP (50.95% vs. 48.42%).

Conclusion: 以语义ID为中心的生成式架构能够统一检索和个性化，同时简化服务路径，在视觉搜索任务中取得显著效果。

Abstract: Traditional vision search, similar to search and recommendation systems,
follows the multi-stage cascading architecture (MCA) paradigm to balance
efficiency and conversion. Specifically, the query image undergoes feature
extraction, recall, pre-ranking, and ranking stages, ultimately presenting the
user with semantically similar products that meet their preferences. This
multi-view representation discrepancy of the same object in the query and the
optimization objective collide across these stages, making it difficult to
achieve Pareto optimality in both user experience and conversion. In this
paper, an end-to-end generative framework, OneVision, is proposed to address
these problems. OneVision builds on VRQ, a vision-aligned residual quantization
encoding, which can align the vastly different representations of an object
across multiple viewpoints while preserving the distinctive features of each
product as much as possible. Then a multi-stage semantic alignment scheme is
adopted to maintain strong visual similarity priors while effectively
incorporating user-specific information for personalized preference generation.
In offline evaluations, OneVision performs on par with online MCA, while
improving inference efficiency by 21% through dynamic pruning. In A/B tests, it
achieves significant online improvements: +2.15% item CTR, +2.27% CVR, and
+3.12% order volume. These results demonstrate that a semantic ID centric,
generative architecture can unify retrieval and personalization while
simplifying the serving pathway.

Abstract: Deep learning has gained broad interest in remote sensing image scene
classification thanks to the effectiveness of deep neural networks in
extracting the semantics from complex data. However, deep networks require
large amounts of training samples to obtain good generalization capabilities
and are sensitive to errors in the training labels. This is a problem in remote
sensing since highly reliable labels can be obtained at high costs and in
limited amount. However, many sources of less reliable labeled data are
available, e.g., obsolete digital maps. In order to train deep networks with
larger datasets, we propose both the combination of single or multiple weak
sources of labeled data with a small but reliable dataset to generate
multisource labeled datasets and a novel training strategy where the
reliability of each source is taken in consideration. This is done by
exploiting the transition matrices describing the statistics of the errors of
each source. The transition matrices are embedded into the labels and used
during the training process to weigh each label according to the related
source. The proposed method acts as a weighting scheme at gradient level, where
each instance contributes with different weights to the optimization of
different classes. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated by
experiments on different datasets. The results proved the robustness and
capability of leveraging on unreliable source of labels of the proposed method.

Motivation: 大多数OOD检测方法将大型预训练模型视为单一编码器，仅依赖最终层表示进行检测。作者质疑这种做法，认为中间层可能包含更丰富的分布偏移检测信号。

Method: 引入基于熵的准则自动识别提供最互补信息的中间层，在无需OOD数据的情况下选择性整合这些中间层表示。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了OOD检测的新途径，并展示了不同训练目标和模型架构对基于置信度的OOD检测方法的影响。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is essential for reliably deploying
machine learning models in the wild. Yet, most methods treat large pre-trained
models as monolithic encoders and rely solely on their final-layer
representations for detection. We challenge this wisdom. We reveal the
\textit{intermediate layers} of pre-trained models, shaped by residual
connections that subtly transform input projections, \textit{can} encode
\textit{surprisingly rich and diverse signals} for detecting distributional
shifts. Importantly, to exploit latent representation diversity across layers,
we introduce an entropy-based criterion to \textit{automatically} identify
layers offering the most complementary information in a training-free setting
-- \textit{without access to OOD data}. We show that selectively incorporating
these intermediate representations can increase the accuracy of OOD detection
by up to \textbf{$10\%$} in far-OOD and over \textbf{$7\%$} in near-OOD
benchmarks compared to state-of-the-art training-free methods across various
model architectures and training objectives. Our findings reveal a new avenue
for OOD detection research and uncover the impact of various training
objectives and model architectures on confidence-based OOD detection methods.

method is designed to accelerate two-dimensional image regression while
maintaining the model's inherent sparsity and reconstruction quality. By
replacing global iterative optimization with a rasterized formulation, the
method achieves significantly faster parameter updates and more
memory-efficient model representations. In addition, the proposed framework
supports applications such as native super-resolution and image denoising,
which are not directly achievable with standard rasterized Gaussian kernel
approaches. The combination of fast rasterized optimization with the edge-aware
structure of the Steered Mixture of Experts provides a new balance between
computational efficiency and reconstruction fidelity for two-dimensional image
processing tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种自监督深度学习方法，用于在心脏磁共振图像中检测五个关键帧，包括收缩末期和舒张末期，以及三个额外关键帧，实现了比基于容积曲线的方法更高的检测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心脏磁共振是评估心脏功能的金标准，但个体心脏周期的复杂性阻碍了自动时间比较或子相位分析。准确检测心脏关键帧可以解决这个问题，而现有方法仅从左心室容积曲线推导收缩末期和舒张末期帧，无法提供更深层次的心肌运动洞察。

Method: 使用自监督深度学习方法，首先从图像中推导密集可变形配准场，用于计算一维运动描述符，该描述符提供关于全局心脏收缩和松弛模式的宝贵洞察。从这些特征曲线中，使用简单规则集确定关键帧。

Result: 该方法在三个公共多中心多疾病数据集上独立评估，与基于容积的方法相比，在收缩末期和舒张末期检测精度提高了30%-51%（短轴视图）和11%-47%（四腔长轴视图）。能够以平均循环帧差低于1.31帧（短轴）和1.73帧（长轴）检测五个关键帧。

Conclusion: 该方法能够实现时间对齐的患者间和患者内心脏动力学分析，不受周期或相位长度的影响。

Abstract: Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) is the gold standard for assessing
cardiac function, but individual cardiac cycles complicate automatic temporal
comparison or sub-phase analysis. Accurate cardiac keyframe detection can
eliminate this problem. However, automatic methods solely derive end-systole
(ES) and end-diastole (ED) frames from left ventricular volume curves, which do
not provide a deeper insight into myocardial motion. We propose a
self-supervised deep learning method detecting five keyframes in short-axis
(SAX) and four-chamber long-axis (4CH) cine CMR. Initially, dense deformable
registration fields are derived from the images and used to compute a 1D motion
descriptor, which provides valuable insights into global cardiac contraction
and relaxation patterns. From these characteristic curves, keyframes are
determined using a simple set of rules. The method was independently evaluated
for both views using three public, multicentre, multidisease datasets. M&Ms-2
(n=360) dataset was used for training and evaluation, and M&Ms (n=345) and ACDC
(n=100) datasets for repeatability control. Furthermore, generalisability to
patients with rare congenital heart defects was tested using the German
Competence Network (GCN) dataset. Our self-supervised approach achieved
improved detection accuracy by 30% - 51% for SAX and 11% - 47% for 4CH in ED
and ES, as measured by cyclic frame difference (cFD), compared with the
volume-based approach. We can detect ED and ES, as well as three additional
keyframes throughout the cardiac cycle with a mean cFD below 1.31 frames for
SAX and 1.73 for LAX. Our approach enables temporally aligned inter- and
intra-patient analysis of cardiac dynamics, irrespective of cycle or phase
lengths. GitHub repository:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Flow4Agent是一个新颖的框架，首次将光流运动先验融入LLM长视频理解，通过时间粒度优化和运动令牌剪枝来减少长视频的冗余，在多个视频MLLM基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长视频理解面临时空内容冗余和MLLM上下文长度有限的挑战，现有方法主要依赖CLIP模型的语义先验提取关键信息，但缺乏对运动信息的有效利用。

Method: 提出Flow4Agent框架，包含两个核心模块：时间粒度优化(TGO)利用粗粒度光流先验分组相似视觉内容，再用语义先验过滤无关场景；运动令牌剪枝(MTP)利用细粒度光流信息剪枝高冗余视频令牌。

Result: 在多个视频MLLM基准测试中表现优异，特别是在小时级视频理解任务上：Video-MME达到64.7%，MLVU达到71.4%，LongVideoBench达到60.4%。

Conclusion: Flow4Agent通过引入光流运动先验有效解决了长视频理解中的冗余问题，在多个基准测试中超越了现有方法，证明了运动信息在长视频理解中的重要性。

Abstract: Long-form video understanding has always been a challenging problem due to
the significant redundancy in both temporal and spatial contents. This
challenge is further exacerbated by the limited context length of Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs). To address this issue, many previous works have
attempted to extract key video information, where the "key" is typically
semantic-aware and heavily dependent on the CLIP model as prior. In this paper,
we propose Flow4Agent, a novel framework that pioneeringly incorporates motion
priors from optical flow to facilitate LLM-based long video understanding.
Flow4Agent mitigates the redundancy in long videos at both temporal and spatial
levels through two core modules: Temporal Granularity Optimization (TGO)
adaptively refines framelevel hierarchies, which first leverages coarse flow
priors to group similar visual contents and then applies semantic priors to
filter out highly irrelevant scene information. Motion Token Pruning (MTP)
further refines the intra-frame visual representations, pruning high-redundancy
video tokens using fine-grained optical flow information. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our Flow4Agent outperforms existing methods across a wide
range of video MLLM benchmarks, especially for hour-level video understanding
tasks, achieving 64.7% on Video-MME, 71.4% on MLVU and 60.4% on LongVideoBench.

Abstract: Live-cell imaging (LCI) technology enables the detailed spatio-temporal
characterization of living cells at the single-cell level, which is critical
for advancing research in the life sciences, from biomedical applications to
bioprocessing. High-throughput setups with tens to hundreds of parallel cell
cultivations offer the potential for robust and reproducible insights. However,
these insights are obscured by the large amount of LCI data recorded per
experiment. Recent advances in state-of-the-art deep learning methods for cell
segmentation and tracking now enable the automated analysis of such large data
volumes, offering unprecedented opportunities to systematically study
single-cell dynamics. The next key challenge lies in integrating these powerful
tools into accessible, flexible, and user-friendly workflows that support
routine application in biological research. In this work, we present
acia-workflows, a platform that combines three key components: (1) the
Automated live-Cell Imaging Analysis (acia) Python library, which supports the
modular design of image analysis pipelines offering eight deep learning
segmentation and tracking approaches; (2) workflows that assemble the image
analysis pipeline, its software dependencies, documentation, and visualizations
into a single Jupyter Notebook, leading to accessible, reproducible and
scalable analysis workflows; and (3) a collection of application workflows
showcasing the analysis and customization capabilities in real-world
applications. Specifically, we present three workflows to investigate various
types of microfluidic LCI experiments ranging from growth rate comparisons to
precise, minute-resolution quantitative analyses of individual dynamic cells
responses to changing oxygen conditions. Our collection of more than ten
application workflows is open source and publicly available at

TL;DR: BioAutoML-NAS是一种基于多模态数据的昆虫分类模型，通过神经架构搜索自动学习最佳网络结构，结合图像和元数据实现高效分类，在多个数据集上超越现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 昆虫分类对农业管理和生态研究至关重要，但由于昆虫特征复杂、类别不平衡和大规模数据集等问题，该任务仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 提出BioAutoML-NAS模型，使用多模态数据（图像和元数据），应用神经架构搜索自动学习每个单元内的最佳操作，通过多模态融合模块结合图像嵌入和元数据，采用交替双级优化训练策略，并使用零操作移除不重要连接。

Result: 在BIOSCAN-5M数据集上达到96.81%准确率、97.46%精确率、96.81%召回率和97.05% F1分数，分别超越现有迁移学习、transformer、AutoML和NAS方法约16%、10%和8%；在Insects-1M数据集上获得93.25%准确率、93.71%精确率、92.74%召回率和93.22% F1分数。

Conclusion: BioAutoML-NAS提供了准确、可靠的昆虫分类，支持现代可持续农业。

Abstract: Insect classification is important for agricultural management and ecological
research, as it directly affects crop health and production. However, this task
remains challenging due to the complex characteristics of insects, class
imbalance, and large-scale datasets. To address these issues, we propose
BioAutoML-NAS, the first BioAutoML model using multimodal data, including
images, and metadata, which applies neural architecture search (NAS) for images
to automatically learn the best operations for each connection within each
cell. Multiple cells are stacked to form the full network, each extracting
detailed image feature representations. A multimodal fusion module combines
image embeddings with metadata, allowing the model to use both visual and
categorical biological information to classify insects. An alternating bi-level
optimization training strategy jointly updates network weights and architecture
parameters, while zero operations remove less important connections, producing
sparse, efficient, and high-performing architectures. Extensive evaluation on
the BIOSCAN-5M dataset demonstrates that BioAutoML-NAS achieves 96.81%
accuracy, 97.46% precision, 96.81% recall, and a 97.05% F1 score, outperforming
state-of-the-art transfer learning, transformer, AutoML, and NAS methods by
approximately 16%, 10%, and 8% respectively. Further validation on the
Insects-1M dataset obtains 93.25% accuracy, 93.71% precision, 92.74% recall,
and a 93.22% F1 score. These results demonstrate that BioAutoML-NAS provides
accurate, confident insect classification that supports modern sustainable
farming.

Motivation: 视觉自回归模型在图像生成方面取得突破，但给合成图像检测带来新挑战。这些模型通过离散token预测生成图像，具有独特的向量量化表示特征，需要专门的检测方法。

Conclusion: D³QE方法能有效检测自回归生成的图像，为应对新兴图像生成技术提供了有效的检测解决方案。

Abstract: The emergence of visual autoregressive (AR) models has revolutionized image
generation while presenting new challenges for synthetic image detection.
Unlike previous GAN or diffusion-based methods, AR models generate images
through discrete token prediction, exhibiting both marked improvements in image
synthesis quality and unique characteristics in their vector-quantized
representations. In this paper, we propose to leverage Discrete Distribution
Discrepancy-aware Quantization Error (D$^3$QE) for autoregressive-generated
image detection that exploits the distinctive patterns and the frequency
distribution bias of the codebook existing in real and fake images. We
introduce a discrete distribution discrepancy-aware transformer that integrates
dynamic codebook frequency statistics into its attention mechanism, fusing
semantic features and quantization error latent. To evaluate our method, we
construct a comprehensive dataset termed ARForensics covering 7 mainstream
visual AR models. Experiments demonstrate superior detection accuracy and
strong generalization of D$^3$QE across different AR models, with robustness to
real-world perturbations. Code is available at

TL;DR: 提出WS-ICL方法，使用弱监督提示（如边界框或点）替代密集标签进行医学图像分割，显著降低标注成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有通用医学图像分割模型需要大量标注，交互式模型需重复用户提示，ICL依赖像素级密集标签，标注成本高。

Method: WS-ICL（弱监督上下文学习），利用弱提示（边界框、点）而非密集标签作为上下文，减少标注需求。

Result: 在三个基准测试中，WS-ICL性能与常规ICL相当，但标注成本显著降低，在交互式范式下也具竞争力。

Conclusion: WS-ICL是实现更高效统一医学图像分割通用模型的重要进展，代码已开源。

Abstract: Universal models for medical image segmentation, such as interactive and
in-context learning (ICL) models, offer strong generalization but require
extensive annotations. Interactive models need repeated user prompts for each
image, while ICL relies on dense, pixel-level labels. To address this, we
propose Weakly Supervised In-Context Learning (WS-ICL), a new ICL paradigm that
leverages weak prompts (e.g., bounding boxes or points) instead of dense labels
for context. This approach significantly reduces annotation effort by
eliminating the need for fine-grained masks and repeated user prompting for all
images. We evaluated the proposed WS-ICL model on three held-out benchmarks.
Experimental results demonstrate that WS-ICL achieves performance comparable to
regular ICL models at a significantly lower annotation cost. In addition,
WS-ICL is highly competitive even under the interactive paradigm. These
findings establish WS-ICL as a promising step toward more efficient and unified
universal models for medical image segmentation. Our code and model are
publicly available at https://github.com/jiesihu/Weak-ICL.

Abstract: We present a novel large-scale dataset for defect detection in a logistics
setting. Recent work on industrial anomaly detection has primarily focused on
manufacturing scenarios with highly controlled poses and a limited number of
object categories. Existing benchmarks like MVTec-AD [6] and VisA [33] have
reached saturation, with state-of-the-art methods achieving up to 99.9% AUROC
scores. In contrast to manufacturing, anomaly detection in retail logistics
faces new challenges, particularly in the diversity and variability of object
pose and appearance. Leading anomaly detection methods fall short when applied
to this new setting. To bridge this gap, we introduce a new benchmark that
overcomes the current limitations of existing datasets. With over 230,000
images (and more than 29,000 defective instances), it is 40 times larger than
MVTec-AD and contains more than 48,000 distinct objects. To validate the
difficulty of the problem, we conduct an extensive evaluation of multiple
state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods, demonstrating that they do not
surpass 56.96% AUROC on our dataset. Further qualitative analysis confirms that
existing methods struggle to leverage normal samples under heavy pose and
appearance variation. With our large-scale dataset, we set a new benchmark and
encourage future research towards solving this challenging problem in retail
logistics anomaly detection. The dataset is available for download under

TL;DR: 本文首次系统研究了医学影像中的token mixers，在MetaFormer架构下比较了池化、卷积和注意力机制，发现在分类任务中低复杂度token mixers足够，而在分割任务中卷积的局部归纳偏置至关重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MetaFormer架构在计算机视觉中表现出色，但在医学影像领域应用较少，且缺乏对不同token mixers的系统比较，可能忽略了更适合医学影像的设计选择。

Method: 在MetaFormer架构中系统分析池化、卷积和注意力三类token mixers，在8个医学影像数据集上进行图像分类和语义分割评估，并研究从自然图像预训练权重的迁移效果。

Result: 分类任务中低复杂度token mixers（如分组卷积或池化）已足够，预训练权重仍然有效；分割任务中卷积token mixers的局部归纳偏置至关重要，分组卷积是最佳选择。

Conclusion: 医学影像任务对token mixers的需求不同：分类任务适合低复杂度设计，分割任务需要卷积的局部归纳偏置，分组卷积在性能和效率间取得最佳平衡。

Abstract: The generalization of the Transformer architecture via MetaFormer has
reshaped our understanding of its success in computer vision. By replacing
self-attention with simpler token mixers, MetaFormer provides strong baselines
for vision tasks. However, while extensively studied on natural image datasets,
its use in medical imaging remains scarce, and existing works rarely compare
different token mixers, potentially overlooking more suitable designs choices.
In this work, we present the first comprehensive study of token mixers for
medical imaging. We systematically analyze pooling-, convolution-, and
attention-based token mixers within the MetaFormer architecture on image
classification (global prediction task) and semantic segmentation (dense
prediction task). Our evaluation spans eight datasets covering diverse
modalities and common challenges in the medical domain. Given the prevalence of
pretraining from natural images to mitigate medical data scarcity, we also
examine transferring pretrained weights to new token mixers. Our results show
that, for classification, low-complexity token mixers (e.g. grouped convolution
or pooling) are sufficient, aligning with findings on natural images.
Pretrained weights remain useful despite the domain gap introduced by the new
token mixer. For segmentation, we find that the local inductive bias of
convolutional token mixers is essential. Grouped convolutions emerge as the
preferred choice, as they reduce runtime and parameter count compared to
standard convolutions, while the MetaFormer's channel-MLPs already provide the
necessary cross-channel interactions. Our code is available on GitHub.

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement (LLIE) is vital for safety-critical applications
such as surveillance, autonomous navigation, and medical imaging, where
visibility degradation can impair downstream task performance. Recently,
diffusion models have emerged as a promising generative paradigm for LLIE due
to their capacity to model complex image distributions via iterative denoising.
This survey provides an up-to-date critical analysis of diffusion models for
LLIE, distinctively featuring an in-depth comparative performance evaluation
against Generative Adversarial Network and Transformer-based state-of-the-art
methods, a thorough examination of practical deployment challenges, and a
forward-looking perspective on the role of emerging paradigms like foundation
models. We propose a multi-perspective taxonomy encompassing six categories:
Intrinsic Decomposition, Spectral & Latent, Accelerated, Guided, Multimodal,
and Autonomous; that map enhancement methods across physical priors,
conditioning schemes, and computational efficiency. Our taxonomy is grounded in
a hybrid view of both the model mechanism and the conditioning signals. We
evaluate qualitative failure modes, benchmark inconsistencies, and trade-offs
between interpretability, generalization, and inference efficiency. We also
discuss real-world deployment constraints (e.g., memory, energy use) and
ethical considerations. This survey aims to guide the next generation of
diffusion-based LLIE research by highlighting trends and surfacing open
research questions, including novel conditioning, real-time adaptation, and the
potential of foundation models.

Motivation: 传统形态成分分析(MCA)使用预定义的不相干字典，无法适应视频场景内容变化的动态特性，需要数据驱动的自适应字典学习方法。

Method: 通过动态模态分解特征值聚类技术获得数据驱动的MCA字典，扩展了传统MCA算法，使其能够自适应地分离视频中的不同形态成分。

Result: 在Adobe 240fps数据集上的去噪应用显示DMCA有效，能够增强微弱目标的信噪比，并在逆合成孔径雷达图像中成功分离自行车与风杂波。

Conclusion: DMCA通过数据驱动的字典学习，为视频分析和信号分离提供了更有效的自适应表示方法，在多个应用场景中表现出色。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel methodology of adapting the representation of
videos based on the dynamics of their scene content variation. In particular,
we demonstrate how the clustering of dynamic mode decomposition eigenvalues can
be leveraged to learn an adaptive video representation for separating
structurally distinct morphologies of a video. We extend the morphological
component analysis (MCA) algorithm, which uses multiple predefined incoherent
dictionaries and a sparsity prior to separate distinct sources in signals, by
introducing our novel eigenspace clustering technique to obtain data-driven MCA
dictionaries, which we call dynamic morphological component analysis (DMCA).
After deriving our novel algorithm, we offer a motivational example of DMCA
applied to a still image, then demonstrate DMCA's effectiveness in denoising
applications on videos from the Adobe 240fps dataset. Afterwards, we provide an
example of DMCA enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio of a faint target summed
with a sea state, and conclude the paper by applying DMCA to separate a bicycle

Motivation: 随着基于扩散模型的图像生成和编辑技术的兴起，传统鲁棒水印方案面临新的安全威胁，需要研究扩散模型对水印的攻击能力。

Method: 提出扩散驱动的图像再生过程和引导扩散攻击，在生成过程中明确针对水印信号，理论证明通过足够的扩散变换，水印图像与嵌入水印载荷之间的互信息会消失。

Result: 在多种最先进水印方案（StegaStamp、TrustMark、VINE）上评估，攻击后水印恢复率接近零，同时再生图像保持高视觉保真度。

Conclusion: 当前鲁棒水印技术在面对基于生成模型的攻击时存在根本性漏洞，在生成AI时代需要新的水印策略。

Abstract: Robust invisible watermarking aims to embed hidden information into images
such that the watermark can survive various image manipulations. However, the
rise of powerful diffusion-based image generation and editing techniques poses
a new threat to these watermarking schemes. In this paper, we present a
theoretical study and method demonstrating that diffusion models can
effectively break robust image watermarks that were designed to resist
conventional perturbations. We show that a diffusion-driven ``image
regeneration'' process can erase embedded watermarks while preserving
perceptual image content. We further introduce a novel guided diffusion attack
that explicitly targets the watermark signal during generation, significantly
degrading watermark detectability. Theoretically, we prove that as an image
undergoes sufficient diffusion-based transformation, the mutual information
between the watermarked image and the embedded watermark payload vanishes,
resulting in decoding failure. Experimentally, we evaluate our approach on
multiple state-of-the-art watermarking schemes (including the deep
learning-based methods StegaStamp, TrustMark, and VINE) and demonstrate
near-zero watermark recovery rates after attack, while maintaining high visual
fidelity of the regenerated images. Our findings highlight a fundamental
vulnerability in current robust watermarking techniques against generative
model-based attacks, underscoring the need for new watermarking strategies in
the era of generative AI.

Motivation: 传统冰雹传感器覆盖范围有限，需要利用社交媒体图像来获取更密集的空间信息，实现更快速、更详细的恶劣天气评估。

Method: 使用474张奥地利冰雹事件图像，比较四种预训练模型，采用单阶段和两阶段提示策略，后者利用图像中参考对象（如人手）提供尺寸线索。

Conclusion: 预训练模型能够补充传统冰雹传感器，从社交媒体图像中提取密集空间信息，为实时恶劣天气评估提供可能，但自动图像采集仍是待解决的问题。

Abstract: This study examines the use of social media and news images to detect and
measure hailstones, utilizing pre-trained multimodal large language models. The
dataset for this study comprises 474 crowdsourced images of hailstones from
documented hail events in Austria, which occurred between January 2022 and
September 2024. These hailstones have maximum diameters ranging from 2 to 11cm.
We estimate the hail diameters and compare four different models utilizing
one-stage and two-stage prompting strategies. The latter utilizes additional
size cues from reference objects, such as human hands, within the image. Our
results show that pretrained models already have the potential to measure
hailstone diameters from images with an average mean absolute error of 1.12cm
for the best model. In comparison to a single-stage prompt, two-stage prompting
improves the reliability of most models. Our study suggests that these
off-the-shelf models, even without fine-tuning, can complement traditional hail
sensors by extracting meaningful and spatially dense information from social
media imagery, enabling faster and more detailed assessments of severe weather

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决持续学习环境中图像描述任务面临的灾难性遗忘问题，以及随时间推移视觉概念与语言对齐的困难

Method: 基于预训练的ViT-GPT-2架构，结合交叉熵损失与三个额外组件：基于提示的余弦相似度损失、CLIP风格损失和语言引导对比损失

Result: 该方法有效缓解了灾难性遗忘，在语义描述对齐方面优于现有最先进方法

Conclusion: 多损失框架在持续图像描述任务中表现出色，实现了更好的语义对齐且推理时无需额外开销

Abstract: Generating accurate and coherent image captions in a continual learning
setting remains a major challenge due to catastrophic forgetting and the
difficulty of aligning evolving visual concepts with language over time. In
this work, we propose a novel multi-loss framework for continual image
captioning that integrates semantic guidance through prompt-based continual
learning and contrastive alignment. Built upon a pretrained ViT-GPT-2 backbone,
our approach combines standard cross-entropy loss with three additional
components: (1) a prompt-based cosine similarity loss that aligns image
embeddings with synthetically constructed prompts encoding objects, attributes,
and actions; (2) a CLIP-style loss that promotes alignment between image
embeddings and target caption embedding; and (3) a language-guided contrastive
loss that employs a triplet loss to enhance class-level discriminability
between tasks. Notably, our approach introduces no additional overhead at
inference time and requires no prompts during caption generation. We find that
this approach mitigates catastrophic forgetting, while achieving better
semantic caption alignment compared to state-of-the-art methods. The code can

*An Thi Nguyen,Radina Stoykova,Eric Arazo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通用实例搜索模型在犯罪调查中能大幅减少人工分析监控视频的工作量，但研究发现这些模型存在意外涌现能力：即使在没有人类主体的数据集上训练，也能通过过度学习识别特定个体，这引发了对个人数据识别和画像的担忧。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在解决通用实例搜索模型在无意中发展出识别特定个体能力的问题，这种涌现能力对个人隐私构成威胁，且目前缺乏明确的去标识化标准。

Method: 评估了两种技术防护措施：索引排除和混淆损失，通过实验验证这些方法在限制模型人员重新识别能力方面的有效性。

Result: 结合两种方法可将人员重新识别准确率降至2%以下，同时保持82%的非人物体检索性能，但发现这些缓解措施存在关键漏洞，包括使用部分人物图像可能绕过防护。

Conclusion: 研究结果凸显了AI治理与数据保护交叉领域的紧迫监管问题：如何分类和监管具有涌现识别能力的系统？以及应要求哪些技术标准来防止看似良性应用发展出识别能力？

Abstract: Generic instance search models can dramatically reduce the manual effort
required to analyze vast surveillance footage during criminal investigations by
retrieving specific objects of interest to law enforcement. However, our
research reveals an unintended emergent capability: through overlearning, these
models can single out specific individuals even when trained on datasets
without human subjects. This capability raises concerns regarding
identification and profiling of individuals based on their personal data, while
there is currently no clear standard on how de-identification can be achieved.
We evaluate two technical safeguards to curtail a model's person
re-identification capacity: index exclusion and confusion loss. Our experiments
demonstrate that combining these approaches can reduce person re-identification
accuracy to below 2% while maintaining 82% of retrieval performance for
non-person objects. However, we identify critical vulnerabilities in these
mitigations, including potential circumvention using partial person images.
These findings highlight urgent regulatory questions at the intersection of AI
governance and data protection: How should we classify and regulate systems
with emergent identification capabilities? And what technical standards should
be required to prevent identification capabilities from developing in seemingly
benign applications?

Motivation: 现有的神经架构搜索（NAS）研究缺乏统一的框架来比较和分析不同类型的架构（如CNN、Transformer及其混合架构），这限制了NAS研究的系统性和可复现性。

Method: 设计了一个通用的图基NAS搜索空间UniNAS，将卷积、Transformer等架构统一表示；提出了新的搜索算法来有效探索该空间；建立了标准化的训练和评估工具包。

Abstract: We introduce Universal Neural Architecture Space (UniNAS), a generic search
space for neural architecture search (NAS) which unifies convolutional
networks, transformers, and their hybrid architectures under a single, flexible

analyzing existing architectures in a common framework. We also propose a new
search algorithm that allows traversing the proposed search space, and
demonstrate that the space contains interesting architectures, which, when
using identical training setup, outperform state-of-the-art hand-crafted
architectures. Finally, a unified toolkit including a standardized training and
evaluation protocol is introduced to foster reproducibility and enable fair
comparison in NAS research. Overall, this work opens a pathway towards
systematically exploring the full spectrum of neural architectures with a
unified graph-based NAS perspective.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了VideoMiner方法，通过迭代分割、描述和聚类长视频形成层次树结构，结合T-GRPO强化学习方法精确定位关键帧，解决长视频理解中的冗余信息干扰和复杂层次结构适应问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在长视频理解中面临两个关键挑战：1）如何减轻大量冗余信息的干扰；2）如何动态适应复杂层次结构并准确识别关键帧。

Method: VideoMiner迭代分割、描述和聚类长视频形成层次树结构，结合T-GRPO（基于树的组相对策略优化）强化学习方法指导关键帧探索。

Result: 在所有长视频理解任务中取得优越性能，模型自发生成推理链，树生长辅助素动态调整扩展深度，获得准确性和效率提升。

Conclusion: VideoMiner通过层次树结构和T-GRPO强化学习有效解决了长视频理解中的冗余信息干扰和关键帧定位问题，在准确性和效率方面均有显著提升。

Abstract: Understanding hour-long videos with multi-modal large language models
(MM-LLMs) enriches the landscape of human-centered AI applications. However,
for end-to-end video understanding with LLMs, uniformly sampling video frames
results in LLMs being overwhelmed by a vast amount of irrelevant information as
video length increases. Existing hierarchical key frame extraction methods
improve the accuracy of video understanding but still face two critical
challenges. 1) How can the interference of extensive redundant information in
long videos be mitigated? 2) How can a model dynamically adapt to complex
hierarchical structures while accurately identifying key frames? To address
these issues, we propose VideoMiner, which iteratively segments, captions, and
clusters long videos, forming a hierarchical tree structure. The proposed
VideoMiner progresses from long videos to events to frames while preserving
temporal coherence, effectively addressing the first challenge. To precisely
locate key frames, we introduce T-GRPO, a tree-based group relative policy
optimization in reinforcement learning method that guides the exploration of
the VideoMiner. The proposed T-GRPO is specifically designed for tree
structures, integrating spatiotemporal information at the event level while
being guided by the question, thus solving the second challenge. We achieve
superior performance in all long-video understanding tasks and uncover several
interesting insights. Our proposed T-GRPO surprisingly incentivizes the model
to spontaneously generate a reasoning chain. Additionally, the designed tree
growth auxin dynamically adjusts the expansion depth, obtaining accuracy and
efficiency gains. The code is publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D人脸建模方法依赖3D形变模型，限制了表示能力；基于优化的方法质量高但计算昂贵。需要一种既能保持高质量又能高效计算的方法。

Method: 扩展学习顶点下降(LVD)方法，集成逐顶点神经场优化与动态预测3D关键点的全局结构指导，使用相对空间编码迭代优化网格顶点，无需密集3D监督。

Result: 在单视图设置中达到最先进性能，在多视图场景中保持高度竞争力，同时显著减少推理时间。

Conclusion: GLVD实现了表达性强且适应性强的几何重建，在保持计算效率的同时提供了高质量的3D人脸重建解决方案。

Abstract: Existing 3D face modeling methods usually depend on 3D Morphable Models,
which inherently constrain the representation capacity to fixed shape priors.
Optimization-based approaches offer high-quality reconstructions but tend to be
computationally expensive. In this work, we introduce GLVD, a hybrid method for
3D face reconstruction from few-shot images that extends Learned Vertex Descent
(LVD) by integrating per-vertex neural field optimization with global
structural guidance from dynamically predicted 3D keypoints. By incorporating
relative spatial encoding, GLVD iteratively refines mesh vertices without
requiring dense 3D supervision. This enables expressive and adaptable geometry
reconstruction while maintaining computational efficiency. GLVD achieves
state-of-the-art performance in single-view settings and remains highly
competitive in multi-view scenarios, all while substantially reducing inference
time.

TL;DR: 提出MedFlamingo PPO方法，将医学领域专用视觉语言模型与PPO结合，在腹腔镜手术任务中显著优于标准视觉PPO，成功率提升66.67%-1114.29%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于视觉的PPO在机器人腹腔镜手术任务中面临的挑战：高维视觉输入、奖励稀疏性和从原始视觉数据提取任务相关特征的困难

Method: 集成MedFlamingo（医学领域专用视觉语言模型）与PPO，每回合处理任务观察和指令一次生成高级规划令牌，结合医学专业知识与实时视觉反馈

Result: 在LapGym的五个腹腔镜手术任务环境中，MedFlamingo PPO优于标准视觉PPO和OpenFlamingo PPO基线，收敛更快，所有环境任务成功率超过70%

Conclusion: 专业医学知识在机器人手术规划和决策中具有重要价值，MedFlamingo PPO方法有效结合医学专业知识与强化学习

Abstract: Vision-based Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) struggles with visual
observation-based robotic laparoscopic surgical tasks due to the
high-dimensional nature of visual input, the sparsity of rewards in surgical
environments, and the difficulty of extracting task-relevant features from raw
visual data. We introduce a simple approach integrating MedFlamingo, a medical
domain-specific Vision-Language Model, with PPO. Our method is evaluated on
five diverse laparoscopic surgery task environments in LapGym, using only
endoscopic visual observations. MedFlamingo PPO outperforms and converges
faster compared to both standard vision-based PPO and OpenFlamingo PPO
baselines, achieving task success rates exceeding 70% across all environments,
with improvements ranging from 66.67% to 1114.29% compared to baseline. By
processing task observations and instructions once per episode to generate
high-level planning tokens, our method efficiently combines medical expertise
with real-time visual feedback. Our results highlight the value of specialized
medical knowledge in robotic surgical planning and decision-making.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CAPTCHA被用作评估视觉语言模型空间推理能力的基准。研究发现逐步推理对解决CAPTCHA至关重要，当前商业模型表现不佳（准确率约21.9%）。作者提出CAPTCHA-X基准和基于推理的VLM框架，将准确率提升至83.9%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CAPTCHA作为区分人类和机器人的工具，已成为评估视觉语言模型空间推理能力的现实基准。当前商业模型在解决这类高难度空间推理任务时表现不佳，需要研究如何提升其推理能力。

Method: 引入CAPTCHA-X基准，包含7类CAPTCHA的逐步推理解决方案和标注。定义5个推理导向的评估指标，并提出基于代理VLM的通用框架，利用模型固有推理能力。

Result: 提出的方法在5种高难度CAPTCHA类型上达到最先进性能，平均解决准确率为83.9%，显著超越现有基线（商业模型准确率约21.9%）。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了当前模型的局限性，强调了推理能力在推进视觉空间挑战中的重要性，为未来模型发展提供了方向。

Abstract: CAPTCHA, originally designed to distinguish humans from robots, has evolved
into a real-world benchmark for assessing the spatial reasoning capabilities of
vision-language models. In this work, we first show that step-by-step reasoning
is crucial for vision-language models (VLMs) to solve CAPTCHAs, which represent
high-difficulty spatial reasoning tasks, and that current commercial
vision-language models still struggle with such reasoning. In particular, we
observe that most commercial VLMs (e.g., Gemini, Claude, GPT, etc.) fail to
effectively solve CAPTCHAs and thus achieve low accuracy (around 21.9 percent).
However, our findings indicate that requiring the model to perform step-by-step
reasoning before generating the final coordinates can significantly enhance its
solving accuracy, underscoring the severity of the gap. To systematically study
this issue, we introduce CAPTCHA-X, the first real-world CAPTCHA benchmark with
reasoning, covering seven categories of CAPTCHAs (such as Gobang, hCaptcha,
etc.) with step-by-step action solutions and grounding annotations. We further
define five reasoning-oriented metrics that enable a comprehensive evaluation
of models reasoning capabilities. To validate the effectiveness of reasoning,
we also propose a general agentic VLM-based framework that incorporates the
models inherent reasoning abilities. Our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance across five high-difficulty CAPTCHA types, with an average solving
accuracy of 83.9 percent, substantially surpassing existing baselines. These
results reveal the limitations of current models and highlight the importance
of reasoning in advancing visual-spatial challenges in the future.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合注意力图和统计过滤的方法，为Vision Transformers生成更忠实和可解释的解释，并通过人类注视数据评估与人类感知的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的ViT解释方法主要依赖注意力权重，但会产生噪声图，因为注意力捕捉的是每层内的token-to-token交互。需要一种能够过滤噪声并产生更忠实解释的方法。

Method: 结合注意力图与统计过滤（最初为CNN设计），去除噪声或无信息模式，并扩展了类特定变体以产生区分性解释。

Result: 在多个数据集上评估表明，该方法产生更清晰和可解释的图，在基于扰动的忠实度指标和人类注视数据对齐方面优于或与最先进方法相当。

Conclusion: 注意力在适当过滤后仍然是可解释的有价值信号，该方法在保持高效和人类可理解的同时，产生更忠实和可解释的解释。

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) has become increasingly important with the rise of large
transformer models, yet many explanation methods designed for CNNs transfer
poorly to Vision Transformers (ViTs). Existing ViT explanations often rely on
attention weights, which tend to yield noisy maps as they capture
token-to-token interactions within each layer.While attribution methods
incorporating MLP blocks have been proposed, we argue that attention remains a
valuable and interpretable signal when properly filtered. We propose a method
that combines attention maps with a statistical filtering, initially proposed
for CNNs, to remove noisy or uninformative patterns and produce more faithful
explanations. We further extend our approach with a class-specific variant that
yields discriminative explanations. Evaluation against popular state-of-the-art
methods demonstrates that our approach produces sharper and more interpretable
maps. In addition to perturbation-based faithfulness metrics, we incorporate
human gaze data to assess alignment with human perception, arguing that human
interpretability remains essential for XAI. Across multiple datasets, our
approach consistently outperforms or is comparable to the SOTA methods while
remaining efficient and human plausible.

TL;DR: 本文系统分析了Chain-of-Thought在视频推理中的问题，发现其会导致性能下降，产生误导性内部独白，作者称之为"视觉思维漂移"现象。为解决此问题，提出了Visual Evidence Reward框架，通过强化学习奖励基于视觉证据的推理轨迹。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然Chain-of-Thought机制在文本任务中提升了推理能力，但在视频理解中的应用仍未被充分探索。作者发现CoT在视频推理中往往会导致性能下降，产生冗长但误导性的内部独白，导致幻觉视觉细节和覆盖正确直觉。

Method: 引入Visual Evidence Reward(VER)框架，这是一个新颖的强化学习框架，明确奖励生成可验证地基于视觉证据的推理轨迹。

Result: 在10个不同的视频理解基准测试中的综合评估表明，Video-VER始终达到最佳性能。

Conclusion: 这项工作揭示了以视频为中心的推理的独特挑战，并鼓励开发能够稳健地将推理基于视觉证据的AI，使大型多模态模型不仅"在回答前思考"，而且"在思考时观察"。

Abstract: Video reasoning, the task of enabling machines to infer from dynamic visual
content through multi-step logic, is crucial for advanced AI. While the
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) mechanism has enhanced reasoning in text-based tasks,
its application to video understanding remains underexplored. This paper
presents a systematic analysis revealing that CoT often degrades performance in
video reasoning, generating verbose but misleading internal monologues, and
leading to hallucinated visual details and overridden correct intuitions - a
phenomenon we term "visual thinking drift". We explain this drift through a
Bayesian lens, positing that CoT traces often diverge from actual visual
evidence, instead amplifying internal biases or language priors, causing models
to storytell rather than engage in grounded reasoning. To counteract this, we
introduce Visual Evidence Reward (VER), a novel reinforcement learning
framework that explicitly rewards the generation of reasoning traces that are
verifiably grounded in visual evidence. Comprehensive evaluation across 10
diverse video understanding benchmarks demonstrates that our Video-VER
consistently achieves top performance. Our work sheds light on the distinct
challenges of video-centric reasoning and encourages the development of AI that
robustly grounds its inferences in visual evidence - for large multimodal
models that not only "think before answering", but also "see while thinking".

Motivation: 尽管有TotalSegmentator等先进分割框架，但左心耳、冠状动脉和肺静脉的精确分割仍是医学影像中的重大挑战，需要高质量的分割数据集来推动相关研究。

Method: 使用专门为高分辨率左心耳分割开发的最先进分割框架，在带有医学专家手动标注的大型私有数据集上训练网络，然后将模型迁移到ImageCAS数据；冠状动脉标签从原始ImageCAS标注改进，肺静脉分割从TS输出精炼。

Result: 生成了ImageCAS数据集中左心耳、冠状动脉和肺静脉的精确分割，并提供了包含常见数据缺陷（如阶梯伪影、左心耳超出扫描视野等）的扫描列表。

Conclusion: 该工作提供了首个开源的高质量心脏结构分割数据集，特别关注左心耳形态分析，为相关医学影像研究提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Despite the success of advanced segmentation frameworks such as
TotalSegmentator (TS), accurate segmentations of the left atrial appendage
(LAA), coronary arteries (CAs), and pulmonary veins (PVs) remain a significant
challenge in medical imaging. In this work, we present the first open-source,
anatomically coherent dataset of curated, high-resolution segmentations for
these structures, supplemented with whole-heart labels produced by TS on the
publicly available ImageCAS dataset consisting of 1000 cardiac computed
tomography angiography (CCTA) scans. One purpose of the data set is to foster
novel approaches to the analysis of LAA morphology.
  LAA segmentations on ImageCAS were generated using a state-of-the-art
segmentation framework developed specifically for high resolution LAA
segmentation. We trained the network on a large private dataset with manual
annotations provided by medical readers guided by a trained cardiologist and
transferred the model to ImageCAS data. CA labels were improved from the
original ImageCAS annotations, while PV segmentations were refined from TS
outputs. In addition, we provide a list of scans from ImageCAS that contains
common data flaws such as step artefacts, LAAs extending beyond the scanner's
field of view, and other types of data defects.

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验证明了所提算法的有效性

Conclusion: 该方法能够紧凑地表征多级先验，并提供了理论收敛保证和实际性能提升

Abstract: Fusing a hyperspectral image with a multispectral image acquired over the
same scene, \textit{i.e.}, hyperspectral image super-resolution, has become a
popular computational way to access the latent high-spatial-spectral-resolution
image. To date, a variety of fusion methods have been proposed, among which the
tensor-based ones have testified that multiple priors, such as multidimensional
low-rankness and spatial total variation at multiple levels, effectively drive
the fusion process. However, existing tensor-based models can only effectively
leverage one or two priors at one or two levels, since simultaneously
incorporating multi-level priors inevitably increases model complexity. This
introduces challenges in both balancing the weights of different priors and
optimizing multi-block structures. Concerning this, we present a novel
hyperspectral super-resolution model compactly characterizing these multi-level
priors of hyperspectral images within the tensor framework. Firstly, the
proposed model decouples the spectral low-rankness and spatial priors by
casting the latent high-spatial-spectral-resolution image into spectral
subspace and spatial maps via block term decomposition. Secondly, these spatial
maps are stacked as the spatial tensor encoding the high-order spatial
low-rankness and smoothness priors, which are co-modeled via the proposed
non-convex mode-shuffled tensor correlated total variation. Finally, we draw
inspiration from the linearized alternating direction method of multipliers to
design an efficient algorithm to optimize the resulting model, theoretically
proving its Karush-Kuhn-Tucker convergence under mild conditions. Experiments
on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.
The code implementation will be available from https://github.com/WongYinJ.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前生存分析模型难以解释，降低了在临床环境中的实用性。传统原型学习方法关注局部相似性和静态匹配，忽略了肿瘤的整体背景，缺乏与基因组数据的强语义对齐。

Method: 建立统一特征原型空间，整合WSI的全局和局部特征与基因组数据；采用稳健表型表示、指数原型更新策略（EMA ProtoUp）和分层原型匹配方案。

Result: 在四个公开癌症数据集上的综合评估表明，该方法在准确性和互操作性方面均优于当前领先的单模态和多模态生存预测技术。

Conclusion: FeatProto为关键医疗应用中的原型学习提供了新视角，实现了可追踪和可解释的决策过程。

Abstract: Survival analysis plays a vital role in making clinical decisions. However,
the models currently in use are often difficult to interpret, which reduces
their usefulness in clinical settings. Prototype learning presents a potential
solution, yet traditional methods focus on local similarities and static
matching, neglecting the broader tumor context and lacking strong semantic
alignment with genomic data. To overcome these issues, we introduce an
innovative prototype-based multimodal framework, FeatProto, aimed at enhancing
cancer survival prediction by addressing significant limitations in current
prototype learning methodologies within pathology. Our framework establishes a
unified feature prototype space that integrates both global and local features
of whole slide images (WSI) with genomic profiles. This integration facilitates
traceable and interpretable decision-making processes. Our approach includes
three main innovations: (1) A robust phenotype representation that merges
critical patches with global context, harmonized with genomic data to minimize
local bias. (2) An Exponential Prototype Update Strategy (EMA ProtoUp) that
sustains stable cross-modal associations and employs a wandering mechanism to
adapt prototypes flexibly to tumor heterogeneity. (3) A hierarchical prototype
matching scheme designed to capture global centrality, local typicality, and
cohort-level trends, thereby refining prototype inference. Comprehensive
evaluations on four publicly available cancer datasets indicate that our method
surpasses current leading unimodal and multimodal survival prediction
techniques in both accuracy and interoperability, providing a new perspective
on prototype learning for critical medical applications. Our source code is
available at https://github.com/JSLiam94/FeatProto.

Motivation: 医学影像中深度学习常受限于稀缺且不平衡的标注数据，需要有效的数据增强和标签优化方法来提升模型性能。

Method: 结合StyleGAN3生成图像扩展训练数据，并通过迭代半监督伪标签优化标签质量，增强现有基线模型的性能。

Conclusion: SSGNet是缓解医学图像分析中标注瓶颈、提高模型鲁棒性的实用策略。

Abstract: Deep learning in medical imaging is often limited by scarce and imbalanced
annotated data. We present SSGNet, a unified framework that combines class
specific generative modeling with iterative semisupervised pseudo labeling to
enhance both classification and segmentation. Rather than functioning as a
standalone model, SSGNet augments existing baselines by expanding training data
with StyleGAN3 generated images and refining labels through iterative pseudo
labeling. Experiments across multiple medical imaging benchmarks demonstrate
consistent gains in classification and segmentation performance, while Frechet
Inception Distance analysis confirms the high quality of generated samples.
These results highlight SSGNet as a practical strategy to mitigate annotation
bottlenecks and improve robustness in medical image analysis.

modality-specific scenarios that hinder the integration of complementary
evidence from imaging, pathology, and clinical notes. This fragmentation limits
their evolution into foundation models that can learn and reason across the
full spectrum of biomedical data. We propose MeDiM, the first medical discrete
diffusion model that learns shared distributions across modalities without
modality-specific components. MeDiM unifies multiple generative tasks:
translating between images and text, and jointly producing image-report pairs
across domains in response to prompts. Built on a discrete diffusion framework,
MeDiM bridges vision and language representations through a shared
probabilistic space. To enable unified and flexible medical generation, we
employ a multimodal large language model (MLLM) as the diffusion backbone,
leveraging its prior knowledge and cross-modal reasoning. Two key designs are
introduced: (1) removing the causal attention mask for bidirectional context,
and (2) injecting continuous timestep embeddings for diffusion awareness.
Experiments demonstrate high-fidelity medical generation (FID 16.60 on
MIMIC-CXR and FID 24.19 on PathGen) and accurate report generation (METEOR
0.2650 and 0.2580). Jointly generated image-report pairs further enhance
downstream performance (plus6.43 percent BLEU-1, plus18.57 percent BLEU-2,
plus31.58 percent BLEU-3, plus4.80 percent METEOR), showing that MeDiM supports
coherent and clinically grounded multimodal outputs.

TL;DR: FlowRVS将视频对象分割重新定义为条件连续流问题，通过语言引导的变形从视频整体表示直接生成目标掩码，实现了单阶段生成方法，在多个基准测试中达到新的最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统'定位-分割'流水线存在的信息瓶颈问题，即语义信息被简化为粗糙的几何提示，以及由于分割过程与初始语言定位解耦而导致的时间一致性困难。

Method: 利用预训练文本到视频模型的优势，将任务重新定义为学习从视频整体表示到目标掩码的语言引导直接变形过程，而不是传统的从噪声生成掩码或直接预测掩码。

Result: 在所有主要RVOS基准测试中达到新的最先进结果：MeViS上J&F为51.1（比之前SOTA提高1.6），零样本Ref-DAVIS17上为73.3（提高2.7）。

Conclusion: 将视频理解任务建模为连续变形过程具有显著潜力，FlowRVS的单阶段生成方法克服了传统方法的根本限制。

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) requires segmenting specific
objects in a video guided by a natural language description. The core challenge
of RVOS is to anchor abstract linguistic concepts onto a specific set of pixels
and continuously segment them through the complex dynamics of a video. Faced
with this difficulty, prior work has often decomposed the task into a pragmatic
`locate-then-segment' pipeline. However, this cascaded design creates an
information bottleneck by simplifying semantics into coarse geometric prompts
(e.g, point), and struggles to maintain temporal consistency as the segmenting
process is often decoupled from the initial language grounding. To overcome
these fundamental limitations, we propose FlowRVS, a novel framework that
reconceptualizes RVOS as a conditional continuous flow problem. This allows us
to harness the inherent strengths of pretrained T2V models, fine-grained pixel
control, text-video semantic alignment, and temporal coherence. Instead of
conventional generating from noise to mask or directly predicting mask, we
reformulate the task by learning a direct, language-guided deformation from a
video's holistic representation to its target mask. Our one-stage, generative
approach achieves new state-of-the-art results across all major RVOS
benchmarks. Specifically, achieving a $\mathcal{J}\&\mathcal{F}$ of 51.1 in
MeViS (+1.6 over prior SOTA) and 73.3 in the zero shot Ref-DAVIS17 (+2.7),
demonstrating the significant potential of modeling video understanding tasks
as continuous deformation processes.

Motivation: 视频条件下的4D形状生成旨在直接从输入视频恢复随时间变化的3D几何和视角一致的外观，但现有方法存在鲁棒性和时间一致性问题。

Method: 基于大规模预训练3D模型，引入三个关键组件：时间注意力机制、时间感知点采样与4D潜在锚定、跨帧噪声共享，实现端到端的动态3D表示生成。

Result: 在多样化真实世界视频上，该方法相比基线提高了鲁棒性和感知保真度，减少了失败模式，能够准确捕捉非刚性运动、体积变化和拓扑转换。

Conclusion: 提出的原生视频到4D形状生成框架无需逐帧优化，能够有效生成时间一致的动态3D表示，在多个指标上优于现有基线方法。

Abstract: Video-conditioned 4D shape generation aims to recover time-varying 3D
geometry and view-consistent appearance directly from an input video. In this
work, we introduce a native video-to-4D shape generation framework that
synthesizes a single dynamic 3D representation end-to-end from the video. Our
framework introduces three key components based on large-scale pre-trained 3D
models: (i) a temporal attention that conditions generation on all frames while
producing a time-indexed dynamic representation; (ii) a time-aware point
sampling and 4D latent anchoring that promote temporally consistent geometry
and texture; and (iii) noise sharing across frames to enhance temporal
stability. Our method accurately captures non-rigid motion, volume changes, and
even topological transitions without per-frame optimization. Across diverse
in-the-wild videos, our method improves robustness and perceptual fidelity and
reduces failure modes compared with the baselines.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative models have sparked exciting new possibilities
in the field of autonomous vehicles. Specifically, video generation models are
now being explored as controllable virtual testing environments.
Simultaneously, end-to-end (E2E) driving models have emerged as a streamlined
alternative to conventional modular autonomous driving systems, gaining
popularity for their simplicity and scalability. However, the application of
these techniques to simulation and planning raises important questions. First,
while video generation models can generate increasingly realistic videos, can
these videos faithfully adhere to the specified conditions and be realistic
enough for E2E autonomous planner evaluation? Second, given that data is
crucial for understanding and controlling E2E planners, how can we gain deeper
insights into their biases and improve their ability to generalize to
out-of-distribution scenarios? In this work, we bridge the gap between the
driving models and generative world models (Drive&Gen) to address these
questions. We propose novel statistical measures leveraging E2E drivers to
evaluate the realism of generated videos. By exploiting the controllability of
the video generation model, we conduct targeted experiments to investigate
distribution gaps affecting E2E planner performance. Finally, we show that
synthetic data produced by the video generation model offers a cost-effective
alternative to real-world data collection. This synthetic data effectively
improves E2E model generalization beyond existing Operational Design Domains,
facilitating the expansion of autonomous vehicle services into new operational
contexts.

Motivation: 当前文本到图像扩散模型难以融入精细的相机元数据（如光圈设置），无法实现精确的镜头模糊控制。

Method: 首先生成全对焦图像，估计单目深度，使用新型焦点距离变换器预测合理对焦距离，然后通过可微分镜头模糊模型生成散焦图像，整个流程支持梯度反向传播。

Result: 实验结果表明，该模型能够在不改变场景内容的情况下实现优越的精细控制。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了基于内容元素和EXIF数据的精确交互式散焦效果控制，这是现有扩散模型无法达到的。

Abstract: Current text-to-image diffusion models excel at generating diverse,
high-quality images, yet they struggle to incorporate fine-grained camera
metadata such as precise aperture settings. In this work, we introduce a novel
text-to-image diffusion framework that leverages camera metadata, or EXIF data,
which is often embedded in image files, with an emphasis on generating
controllable lens blur. Our method mimics the physical image formation process
by first generating an all-in-focus image, estimating its monocular depth,
predicting a plausible focus distance with a novel focus distance transformer,
and then forming a defocused image with an existing differentiable lens blur
model. Gradients flow backwards through this whole process, allowing us to
learn without explicit supervision to generate defocus effects based on content
elements and the provided EXIF data. At inference time, this enables precise
interactive user control over defocus effects while preserving scene contents,
which is not achievable with existing diffusion models. Experimental results
demonstrate that our model enables superior fine-grained control without
altering the depicted scene.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DropD-SLAM是一个实时单目SLAM系统，使用预训练视觉模块替代深度传感器，在TUM RGB-D基准测试中达到RGB-D级别的精度，运行速度为22 FPS。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在开发不依赖深度传感器但能达到RGB-D级别精度的SLAM系统，降低系统成本和复杂度。

Method: 使用三个预训练视觉模块：单目度量深度估计器、学习关键点检测器和实例分割网络。通过扩张实例掩码抑制动态物体，将静态关键点赋予预测深度值并反投影到3D空间，使用未修改的RGB-D SLAM后端进行处理。

Result: 在TUM RGB-D基准测试中，静态序列平均ATE为7.4厘米，动态序列为1.8厘米，达到或超过最先进的RGB-D方法性能，在单GPU上以22 FPS实时运行。

Conclusion: 现代预训练视觉模型可以替代主动深度传感器作为可靠、实时的度量尺度来源，为更简单、成本更低的SLAM系统迈出重要一步。

Abstract: We present DropD-SLAM, a real-time monocular SLAM system that achieves
RGB-D-level accuracy without relying on depth sensors. The system replaces
active depth input with three pretrained vision modules: a monocular metric
depth estimator, a learned keypoint detector, and an instance segmentation
network. Dynamic objects are suppressed using dilated instance masks, while
static keypoints are assigned predicted depth values and backprojected into 3D
to form metrically scaled features. These are processed by an unmodified RGB-D
SLAM back end for tracking and mapping. On the TUM RGB-D benchmark, DropD-SLAM
attains 7.4 cm mean ATE on static sequences and 1.8 cm on dynamic sequences,
matching or surpassing state-of-the-art RGB-D methods while operating at 22 FPS
on a single GPU. These results suggest that modern pretrained vision models can
replace active depth sensors as reliable, real-time sources of metric scale,
marking a step toward simpler and more cost-effective SLAM systems.

TL;DR: EgoNight是首个针对夜间第一人称视觉的综合基准，以视觉问答为核心任务，包含3658个QA对和90个视频，揭示了现有模型在低光照条件下的性能显著下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有第一人称视觉基准主要关注白天场景，忽略了现实应用中不可避免的低光照条件，因此需要专门研究夜间第一人称视觉理解。

Method: 收集合成和真实世界的昼夜对齐视频，构建EgoNight-VQA数据集，采用日间增强的夜间自动标注引擎并通过人工验证确保可靠性。

Result: 对最先进的多模态大语言模型评估显示，从白天转移到夜间时性能显著下降，凸显了低光照条件下推理的挑战。

Conclusion: EgoNight为推进应用驱动的第一人称视觉研究提供了坚实基础，有助于开发跨光照域泛化的模型。

Abstract: Most existing benchmarks for egocentric vision understanding focus primarily
on daytime scenarios, overlooking the low-light conditions that are inevitable
in real-world applications. To investigate this gap, we present EgoNight, the
first comprehensive benchmark for nighttime egocentric vision, with visual
question answering (VQA) as the core task. A key feature of EgoNight is the
introduction of day-night aligned videos, which enhance night annotation
quality using the daytime data and reveal clear performance gaps between
lighting conditions. To achieve this, we collect both synthetic videos rendered
by Blender and real-world recordings, ensuring that scenes and actions are
visually and temporally aligned. Leveraging these paired videos, we construct
EgoNight-VQA, supported by a novel day-augmented night auto-labeling engine and
refinement through extensive human verification. Each QA pair is double-checked
by annotators for reliability. In total, EgoNight-VQA contains 3658 QA pairs
across 90 videos, spanning 12 diverse QA types, with more than 300 hours of
human work. Evaluations of state-of-the-art multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) reveal substantial performance drops when transferring from day to
night, underscoring the challenges of reasoning under low-light conditions.
Beyond VQA, EgoNight also introduces two auxiliary tasks, day-night
correspondence retrieval and egocentric depth estimation at night, that further
explore the boundaries of existing models. We believe EgoNight-VQA provides a
strong foundation for advancing application-driven egocentric vision research
and for developing models that generalize across illumination domains. All the
data and code will be made available upon acceptance.

TL;DR: Human3R是一个统一的、前馈的框架，用于从单目视频中在线重建4D人体-场景，能够一次性恢复全局多人SMPL-X身体、密集3D场景和相机轨迹。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖多阶段流程、迭代的接触感知优化以及大量依赖项（如人体检测、深度估计、SLAM预处理），导致效率低下且复杂。Human3R旨在消除这些依赖，实现统一的前馈重建。

Method: 基于CUT3R模型，使用参数高效的视觉提示调优，保留丰富的时空先验，同时直接输出多个SMPL-X身体。在BEDLAM合成数据集上训练一天。

Result: 实现了实时速度（15 FPS）和低内存占用（8 GB），在全局人体运动估计、局部人体网格恢复、视频深度估计和相机姿态估计等任务上达到最先进或竞争性性能。

Conclusion: Human3R作为一个简单而强大的基线，可轻松扩展用于下游应用，展示了统一模型在4D人体-场景重建中的高效性和优越性。

Abstract: We present Human3R, a unified, feed-forward framework for online 4D
human-scene reconstruction, in the world frame, from casually captured
monocular videos. Unlike previous approaches that rely on multi-stage
pipelines, iterative contact-aware refinement between humans and scenes, and
heavy dependencies, e.g., human detection, depth estimation, and SLAM
pre-processing, Human3R jointly recovers global multi-person SMPL-X bodies
("everyone"), dense 3D scene ("everywhere"), and camera trajectories in a
single forward pass ("all-at-once"). Our method builds upon the 4D online
reconstruction model CUT3R, and uses parameter-efficient visual prompt tuning,
to strive to preserve CUT3R's rich spatiotemporal priors, while enabling direct
readout of multiple SMPL-X bodies. Human3R is a unified model that eliminates
heavy dependencies and iterative refinement. After being trained on the
relatively small-scale synthetic dataset BEDLAM for just one day on one GPU, it
achieves superior performance with remarkable efficiency: it reconstructs
multiple humans in a one-shot manner, along with 3D scenes, in one stage, at
real-time speed (15 FPS) with a low memory footprint (8 GB). Extensive
experiments demonstrate that Human3R delivers state-of-the-art or competitive
performance across tasks, including global human motion estimation, local human
mesh recovery, video depth estimation, and camera pose estimation, with a
single unified model. We hope that Human3R will serve as a simple yet strong
baseline, be easily extended for downstream applications.Code available in

Conclusion: 提出的信息状态对话管理模型通过有效整合中间信息和规划能力，显著提升了任务导向对话系统的性能。

Abstract: Task oriented dialogue systems (TOD) complete particular tasks based on user
preferences across natural language interactions. Considering the impressive
performance of large language models (LLMs) in natural language processing
(NLP) tasks, most of the latest TODs are centered on LLMs. While proactive
planning is crucial for task completion, many existing TODs overlook effective
goal-aware planning. This paper creates a model for managing task-oriented
conversations, conceptualized centered on the information state approach to
dialogue management. The created model incorporated constructive intermediate
information in planning. Initially, predefined slots and text part
informational components are created to model user preferences. Investigating
intermediate information, critical circumstances are identified. Informational
components corresponding to these circumstances are created. Possible
configurations for these informational components lead to limited information
states. Then, dialogue moves, which indicate movement between these information
states and the procedures that must be performed in the movements, are created.
Eventually, the update strategy is constructed. The created model is
implemented leveraging in-context learning of LLMs. In this model, database
queries are created centered on indicated predefined slots and the order of
retrieved entities is indicated centered on text part. This mechanism enables
passing the whole corresponding entities to the preferences in the order of
congruency. Evaluations exploiting the complete test conversations of MultiWOZ,
with no more than a domain in a conversation, illustrate maximal inform and
success, and improvement compared with previous methods.

Conclusion: 提出的基于监督学习的古吉拉特语机器翻译评估指标是有效的，能够更好地评估古吉拉特语MT系统的性能。

Abstract: Machine Translation (MT) Evaluation is an integral part of the MT development
life cycle. Without analyzing the outputs of MT engines, it is impossible to
evaluate the performance of an MT system. Through experiments, it has been
identified that what works for English and other European languages does not
work well with Indian languages. Thus, In this paper, we have introduced a
reference-based MT evaluation metric for Gujarati which is based on supervised
learning. We have trained two versions of the metric which uses 25 features for
training. Among the two models, one model is trained using 6 hidden layers with
500 epochs while the other model is trained using 10 hidden layers with 500
epochs. To test the performance of the metric, we collected 1000 MT outputs of
seven MT systems. These MT engine outputs were compared with 1 human reference
translation. While comparing the developed metrics with other available
metrics, it was found that the metrics produced better human correlations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究要么将幻觉视为需要最小化的工程缺陷，要么认为其理论上是不可避免的，但都未能充分考虑AGI所需的条件。本文旨在从泛化问题的角度重新理解幻觉现象。

Method: 通过区分封闭世界假设和开放世界假设，开发了幻觉的分类方法，识别哪些情况下幻觉可以被纠正，哪些在开放世界条件下似乎不可避免。

Result: 在封闭世界假设下，幻觉可能被缓解；但在开放世界假设下，幻觉变得不可避免，需要重新思考其性质和处理方式。

Conclusion: 幻觉不应仅仅被视为工程缺陷，而应作为需要容忍的结构性特征，并使其与人类智能兼容。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit impressive linguistic competence but
also produce inaccurate or fabricated outputs, often called ``hallucinations''.
Engineering approaches usually regard hallucination as a defect to be
minimized, while formal analyses have argued for its theoretical inevitability.
Yet both perspectives remain incomplete when considering the conditions
required for artificial general intelligence (AGI). This paper reframes
``hallucination'' as a manifestation of the generalization problem. Under the
Closed World assumption, where training and test distributions are consistent,
hallucinations may be mitigated. Under the Open World assumption, however,
where the environment is unbounded, hallucinations become inevitable. This
paper further develops a classification of hallucination, distinguishing cases
that may be corrected from those that appear unavoidable under open-world
conditions. On this basis, it suggests that ``hallucination'' should be
approached not merely as an engineering defect but as a structural feature to
be tolerated and made compatible with human intelligence.

Abstract: Emotional Support Conversation (ESC) plays a vital role in alleviating
psychological stress and providing emotional value through dialogue. While
recent studies have largely focused on data augmentation and synthetic corpus
construction, they often overlook the deeper cognitive reasoning processes that
underpin effective emotional support. To address this gap, we propose
\textbf{CARE}, a novel framework that strengthens reasoning in ESC without
relying on large-scale synthetic data. CARE leverages the original ESC training
set to guide models in generating logically coherent and supportive responses,
thereby explicitly enhancing cognitive reasoning. Building on this foundation,
we further employ reinforcement learning to refine and reinforce the reasoning
process. Experimental results demonstrate that CARE significantly improves both
the logical soundness and supportive quality of responses, advancing the
development of empathetic, cognitively robust, and human-like emotional support
systems.

Motivation: 解决行业关键挑战：缺乏用户数据、冷启动评估困难和提示效率低下，实现低成本生成训练数据而无需人工标注。

Method: 采用三个协调代理：模拟多样化人物行为的用户代理、执行任务导向说服策略的对话代理、以及评估优化对话结果的优化代理，通过智能体自我博弈生成多轮对话。

Result: 在真实营销场景中，MADS显著提升了小语言模型的说服能力，将有机流量转化率从1.83%提高到2.24%，提升了22.4%。

Conclusion: MADS框架能够有效生成高质量说服对话数据，显著提升模型性能并展示出明确的商业价值。

Abstract: We propose MADS (Multi-Agent Dialogue Simulation), a scalable framework for
generating persuasive multi-turn dialogues via agent self-play. MADS employs
three coordinated agents: User Agents simulating diverse persona-driven
behaviors, a Dialog Agent executing task-oriented persuasion strategies and an
Optimization Agent evaluating and refining dialogue outcomes. We further
validate its effectiveness through users' Chain-of-Attitude (CoA) modeling and
dedicated LLMs' persuasion assessment. This approach enables low-cost
generation of training data without human annotation, addressing key industry
challenges such as lack of user data, cold-start evaluation difficulties, and
prompt inefficiency. Applied to a real-world marketing scenario, MADS
significantly improved the persuasion capacity of small LLMs, increasing the
organic traffic conversion rate by 22.4\% (from 1.83\% to 2.24\%) ,
demonstrating clear business value.

TL;DR: IDIOMoE通过将物品交互历史视为语言空间中的方言，在预训练LLM的每个块中分离文本专家和物品专家，实现了协同过滤信号与自然语言的统一理解，在保持文本理解能力的同时提升了推荐性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代推荐系统需要结合协同过滤的预测准确性和LLM的表达推理能力，满足用户对自然语言查询和透明解释的期望，但协同信号语义不透明而LLM难以建模隐式用户偏好。

Method: 在预训练LLM的每个块的Feed Forward Network中分离文本专家和物品专家，通过token类型门控避免文本和目录模态的破坏性干扰，将物品交互历史视为语言空间中的方言。

Result: 在公共和专有数据集上均表现出强大的推荐性能，同时保持了预训练模型的文本理解能力。

Conclusion: IDIOMoE成功统一了协同过滤和LLM的优势，为现代推荐系统提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: While collaborative filtering delivers predictive accuracy and efficiency,
and Large Language Models (LLMs) enable expressive and generalizable reasoning,
modern recommendation systems must bring these strengths together. Growing user
expectations, such as natural-language queries and transparent explanations,
further highlight the need for a unified approach. However, doing so is
nontrivial. Collaborative signals are often token-efficient but semantically
opaque, while LLMs are semantically rich but struggle to model implicit user
preferences when trained only on textual inputs. This paper introduces Item-ID
+ Oral-language Mixture-of-Experts Language Model (IDIOMoE), which treats item
interaction histories as a native dialect within the language space, enabling
collaborative signals to be understood in the same way as natural language. By
splitting the Feed Forward Network of each block of a pretrained LLM into a
separate text expert and an item expert with token-type gating, our method
avoids destructive interference between text and catalog modalities. IDIOMoE
demonstrates strong recommendation performance across both public and
proprietary datasets, while preserving the text understanding of the pretrained
model.

*Mark Steyvers,Catarina Belem,Padhraic Smyth*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过监督微调可以改善LLM的不确定性表达能力，但不同元认知技能需要多任务训练才能共同提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在决策场景中应用日益广泛，但当它们在没有表明低置信度的情况下给出答案时，用户可能会在不知情的情况下基于错误输出采取行动

Method: 对两种LLM在通用知识、数学和开放式问答数据集上进行监督微调，评估单问题置信度估计和成对置信度比较两种元认知任务

Result: 微调改善了校准（陈述置信度与准确性的对齐）和区分能力（正确与错误回答的置信度差异），但改进是任务特定的，多任务微调在跨域评估中产生更广泛的收益

Conclusion: LLM的不确定性表达是可训练和可泛化的，但不同的元认知技能不会自然相互加强，必须通过多任务训练共同发展

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in decision-making
contexts, but when they present answers without signaling low confidence, users
may unknowingly act on erroneous outputs. While prior work shows that LLMs
maintain internal uncertainty signals, their explicit verbalized confidence is
typically miscalibrated and poorly discriminates between correct and incorrect
answers. Across two types of LLMs, we investigate whether supervised finetuning
can improve models' ability to communicate uncertainty and whether such
improvements generalize across tasks and domains. We finetune the LLMs on
datasets spanning general knowledge, mathematics, and open-ended trivia, and
evaluate two metacognitive tasks: (1) single-question confidence estimation,
where the model assigns a numeric certainty to its answer, and (2) pairwise
confidence comparison, where the model selects which of two answers it is more
likely to have correct. We assess generalization to unseen domains, including
medical and legal reasoning. Results show that finetuning improves calibration
(alignment between stated confidence and accuracy) and discrimination (higher
confidence for correct vs. incorrect responses) within and across domains,
while leaving accuracy unchanged. However, improvements are task-specific:
training on single-question calibration does not transfer to pairwise
comparison, and vice versa. In contrast, multitask finetuning on both forms of
metacognition yields broader gains, producing lower calibration error and
stronger discrimination in out-of-domain evaluations. These results show that
while uncertainty communication in LLMs is trainable and generalizable,
different metacognitive skills do not naturally reinforce one another and must
be developed together through multitask training.

TL;DR: 提出基于BERT的自动化管道，用于从图片描述中提取和排序内容信息单元(CIU)，以评估认知语言障碍，相比传统方法更高效准确。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前认知语言障碍的自动化评估方法往往忽略视觉叙事路径，而手动标记或基于字典的映射方法效率低下且劳动密集。

Method: 使用基于BERT的管道，通过二元交叉熵和成对排序损失进行微调，从Cookie Theft图片描述中自动提取和排序CIU，采用5折交叉验证评估。

Result: 在CIU检测中达到93%的中位数精确率和96%的中位数召回率，序列错误率为24%。提取的特征与真实值有强相关性，在外部验证中优于基于字典的基线方法。

Conclusion: 该管道能有效表征视觉叙事路径用于认知障碍评估，实现和模型已开源，为自动化认知评估提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Current methods for automated assessment of cognitive-linguistic impairment
via picture description often neglect the visual narrative path - the sequence
and locations of elements a speaker described in the picture. Analyses of
spatio-semantic features capture this path using content information units
(CIUs), but manual tagging or dictionary-based mapping is labor-intensive. This
study proposes a BERT-based pipeline, fine tuned with binary cross-entropy and
pairwise ranking loss, for automated CIU extraction and ordering from the
Cookie Theft picture description. Evaluated by 5-fold cross-validation, it
achieves 93% median precision, 96% median recall in CIU detection, and 24%
sequence error rates. The proposed method extracts features that exhibit strong
Pearson correlations with ground truth, surpassing the dictionary-based
baseline in external validation. These features also perform comparably to
those derived from manual annotations in evaluating group differences via
ANCOVA. The pipeline is shown to effectively characterize visual narrative
paths for cognitive impairment assessment, with the implementation and models
open-sourced to public.

Result: DeBERTa-v3-base在领域对齐上获得最高加权平均F1分数0.950，RoBERTa-large在技能对齐上获得最高F1分数0.869。集成模型未能超越最佳语言模型，降维提升了基于嵌入的线性分类器但不如语言模型。

Conclusion: 本研究展示了自动化题目与内容标准对齐的不同方法，为大规模评估中的标准对齐提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate alignment of items to content standards is critical for valid score
interpretation in large-scale assessments. This study evaluates three automated
paradigms for aligning items with four domain and nineteen skill labels. First,
we extracted embeddings and trained multiple classical supervised machine
learning models, and further investigated the impact of dimensionality
reduction on model performance. Second, we fine-tuned eight BERT model and its
variants for both domain and skill alignment. Third, we explored ensemble
learning with majority voting and stacking with multiple meta-models. The
DeBERTa-v3-base achieved the highest weighted-average F1 score of 0.950 for
domain alignment while the RoBERTa-large yielded the highest F1 score of 0.869
for skill alignment. Ensemble models did not surpass the best-performing
language models. Dimension reduction enhanced linear classifiers based on
embeddings but did not perform better than language models. This study
demonstrated different methods in automated item alignment to content
standards.}

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的高效ICL方法在处理上下文时往往忽略不同分区策略导致的信息冗余或表示不足问题，导致性能不理想。

Method: 提出Sub-CP框架，利用子模目标控制块多样性，支持灵活的块选择策略，允许每个块在全局多样性和局部连贯性之间调整，同时支持预计算。

Result: 在多个数据集的不同任务上的广泛实验表明，Sub-CP在不同规模的模型上都能持续提升性能。

Conclusion: Sub-CP通过块感知的上下文选择有效解决了ICL中的信息冗余问题，提供了灵活的选择策略并显著提升了性能。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) enables efficient few-shot learning in large
language models (LLMs) without training, but suffers from the quadratic input
complexity of transformers, limiting the maximum number of exemplars. While
various efficient ICL approaches partition the context into blocks to process
(e.g., ensembling, compression, cross-attention), they often ignore the
information redundancy or under-representation caused by different partition
strategies, leading to suboptimal performance. To tackle this problem, we
propose Sub-CP, a block-aware context selection framework that leverages
submodular objectives to control block diversity. Sub-CP supports a flexible
spectrum of selection strategies, allowing each block to range from globally
diverse to locally coherent. This allows fine-grained control over semantic
structure while enabling precomputation. Extensive experiments across diverse
tasks on multiple datasets show that Sub-CP consistently improves performance
across model scales.

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合语义搜索系统，结合词汇检索、向量相似度和LLM重排序，解决Head Start项目中员工在GoEngage平台上查找任务的困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Head Start项目员工在GoEngage平台上因专业术语、系统命名和搜索限制而难以定位合适任务模块。

Method: 采用混合语义搜索方法，结合轻量级容错词汇检索、基于嵌入的向量相似度和受限LLM重排序，利用现有基础设施并确保可信度。

Result: 提供了完整的实施框架，包括资源需求、分阶段实施策略、离线评估协议和在线测量方法。

Conclusion: 该混合搜索系统能有效解决专业术语搜索问题，具有低误报率、可演进性和经济高效的特点。

Abstract: Head Start programs utilizing GoEngage face significant challenges when new
or rotating staff attempt to locate appropriate Tasks (modules) on the platform
homepage. These difficulties arise from domain-specific jargon (e.g., IFPA,
DRDP), system-specific nomenclature (e.g., Application Pool), and the inherent
limitations of lexical search in handling typos and varied word ordering. We
propose a pragmatic hybrid semantic search system that synergistically combines
lightweight typo-tolerant lexical retrieval, embedding-based vector similarity,
and constrained large language model (LLM) re-ranking. Our approach leverages
the organization's existing Task Repository and Knowledge Base infrastructure
while ensuring trustworthiness through low false-positive rates, evolvability
to accommodate terminological changes, and economic efficiency via intelligent
caching, shortlist generation, and graceful degradation mechanisms. We provide
a comprehensive framework detailing required resources, a phased implementation
strategy with concrete milestones, an offline evaluation protocol utilizing
curated test cases (Hit@K, Precision@K, Recall@K, MRR), and an online
measurement methodology incorporating query success metrics, zero-result rates,
and dwell-time proxies.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Set Supervised Fine-Tuning (SSFT)方法，通过集合式全局损失和自监督二分匹配来保留多样化的推理模式，在并行推理任务中优于传统监督微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在鼓励推理路径多样性时会牺牲准确性，因为触发多样化且正确推理模式的分叉标记通常位于采样树的深层。

Method: 将并行推理视为集合式下一个标记预测问题，在监督微调中引入基于集合的全局损失，使用自监督二分匹配来关联全局分叉标记和唯一推理轨迹。

Result: 在多个推理基准测试中，SSFT在Pass@1和Cons@k指标上均优于传统SFT，能够保留独特的推理模式并产生涌现的全局分叉标记。

Conclusion: SSFT方法有效解决了并行推理中多样性与准确性的权衡问题，通过集合式监督微调实现了更好的性能。

Abstract: Although LLMs have demonstrated improved performance by scaling parallel
test-time compute, doing so relies on generating reasoning paths that are both
diverse and accurate. For challenging problems, the forking tokens that trigger
diverse yet correct reasoning modes are typically deep in the sampling tree.
Consequently, common strategies to encourage diversity, such as temperature
scaling, encounter a worsened trade-off between diversity and accuracy.
Motivated by this challenge, we treat parallel reasoning as a
set-of-next-token-prediction problem, and incorporate a set-based global loss
into Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) using self-supervised bipartite matching
between our global forking tokens and unique reasoning traces. We observe that,
while naive fine-tuning with multiple reasoning traces collapses these unique
reasoning modes, our proposed method, Set Supervised Fine-Tuning (SSFT),
preserves these modes and produces emergent global forking tokens. Experiments
on multiple reasoning benchmarks show that our SSFT consistently outperforms
SFT under both Pass@1 and Cons@k metrics.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文通过实证研究发现：在训练数据中，合成数据比例不超过20%时模型性能稳定，超过30%时性能加速下降；大模型对合成数据更具鲁棒性；校准退化先于准确率下降；推理任务比检索任务更容易受合成数据影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然合成数据在现代NLP训练中广泛应用，但缺乏对合成数据比例如何影响不同规模模型行为的系统性理解。

Method: 使用Pythia模型套件（410M-12B参数）在五个不同任务上进行控制实验，评估合成数据比例从0-50%时模型在1-3次训练迭代后的表现。

Result: 模型在合成数据比例不超过20%时性能稳定，超过30%时性能加速下降；大模型（6.9B-12B）比小模型（410M-1.4B）更具鲁棒性；校准退化先于准确率损失；推理任务比检索任务退化更快。

Conclusion: 当前最佳实践（如STaR和Self-Instruct系统保持超过80%外部数据）处于安全范围内，为从业者提供了基于模型规模和任务需求的合成数据预算实用指导。

Abstract: Synthetic data generated by large language models has become integral to
modern NLP training pipelines, from bootstrapping reasoning capabilities to
augmenting instruction-following datasets. While recent work demonstrates
successful applications maintaining high external data ratios, systematic
understanding of how synthetic data proportion affects model behavior across
different scales remains limited. This paper presents a controlled empirical
study examining model performance, calibration, and output characteristics when
trained on varying synthetic-to-external data ratios. Using the Pythia model
suite (410M-12B parameters) across five diverse tasks, we evaluate models after
one to three training iterations with synthetic data proportions ranging from
0-50\%. Our key findings include: models maintain stable performance with up to
20\% synthetic data, but degradation accelerates beyond 30\%; larger models
(6.9B-12B) show greater robustness to synthetic data than smaller models
(410M-1.4B); calibration degradation precedes accuracy loss, providing an early
warning signal; and task characteristics matter, with reasoning tasks degrading
faster than retrieval tasks under synthetic data training. Importantly, we find
that current best practices, such as those employed in STaR and Self-Instruct
systems that maintain greater than 80\% external data, operate well within safe
regimes identified by our experiments. We provide practical guidance for
practitioners on synthetic data budgets based on model scale and task
requirements, alongside detailed comparison with concurrent work including
Shumailov et al.'s model collapse findings.

Motivation: 现有大语言模型擅长客观任务，但在评估创意等主观任务时表现不佳，需要个性化适应不同个体的创意判断标准。

Method: 使用好奇心驱动的LLM作为评估器，在Torrance创造性思维测试基准上学习不同个体的创意判断偏好。

Result: 在各种评估指标（皮尔逊相关系数、Cohen's和F1值）上均优于基线监督微调方法，特别是在标注者意见不一致的主观评估中表现突出。

Conclusion: 该方法能够使不同规模的模型学习个体化的创意判断，在主观评估任务中具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: Modern large language models (LLMs) excel at objective tasks such as
evaluating mathematical reasoning and factual accuracy, yet they falter when
faced with the nuanced, subjective nature of assessing creativity. In this
work, we propose a novel curiosity-driven LLM-as-a-judge for evaluating
creative writing which is personlized to each individual's creative judgments.
We use the Torrance Test of Creative Thinking(TTCW) benchmark introduced in
Chakrabarty et al. (2024), which has stories annotated by expert humans across
various subjective dimensions like Originality, to test our hypothesis. We show
that our method enables models across various sizes, to learn the nuanced
creative judgments of different individuals, by showing improvements over
baseline supervised finetuning(SFT) method across various evaluation metrics
like Pearson correlation, Cohen's and F1 values. Our method is especially
useful in subjective evaluations where not all the annotators agree with each
other.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are solidifying their position in the modern
world as effective tools for the automatic generation of text. Their use is
quickly becoming commonplace in fields such as education, healthcare, and
scientific research. There is a growing need to study the linguistic features
present in AI-generated text, as the increasing presence of such texts has
profound implications in various disciplines such as corpus linguistics,
computational linguistics, and natural language processing. Many observations
have already been made, however a broader synthesis of the findings made so far
is required to provide a better understanding of the topic. The present survey
paper aims to provide such a synthesis of extant research. We categorize the
existing works along several dimensions, including the levels of linguistic
description, the models included, the genres analyzed, the languages analyzed,
and the approach to prompting. Additionally, the same scheme is used to present
the findings made so far and expose the current trends followed by researchers.
Among the most-often reported findings is the observation that AI-generated
text is more likely to contain a more formal and impersonal style, signaled by
the increased presence of nouns, determiners, and adpositions and the lower
reliance on adjectives and adverbs. AI-generated text is also more likely to
feature a lower lexical diversity, a smaller vocabulary size, and repetitive
text. Current research, however, remains heavily concentrated on English data
and mostly on text generated by the GPT model family, highlighting the need for
broader cross-linguistic and cross-model investigation. In most cases authors
also fail to address the issue of prompt sensitivity, leaving much room for
future studies that employ multiple prompt wordings in the text generation
phase.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RAG系统和网络代理在多跳深度搜索任务评估中存在两个主要问题：基准测试泄露推理路径，模型依赖表面线索而非自主发现推理链；评估简化为单一通过率，无法区分搜索不足、知识利用不当或不恰当拒绝等失败原因。

Method: 开发WebDetective基准测试，包含无提示多跳问题和可控维基百科沙盒，确保模型行为的完全可追溯性，并提供分离搜索充分性、知识利用和拒绝行为的整体评估框架。

Result: 评估25个最先进模型发现系统性弱点：模型在拥有足够证据时仍难以有效利用知识，在缺乏证据时几乎不会适当拒绝。这些模式揭示了当前系统擅长执行给定推理路径但无法自主发现推理路径的根本差距。

Conclusion: 开发了EvidenceLoop代理工作流程，通过验证循环和系统证据跟踪改进搜索和合成能力，证明WebDetective的诊断框架能够指导具体架构改进，为开发真正自主推理系统而非模式跟随代理提供关键工具。

Abstract: RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems and web agents are increasingly
evaluated on multi-hop deep search tasks, yet current practice suffers from two
major limitations. First, most benchmarks leak the reasoning path in the
question text, allowing models to follow surface cues rather than discover
reasoning chains autonomously. Second, evaluation is typically reduced to a
single pass rate, which collapses diverse behaviours into one score and
obscures whether failures stem from inadequate search, poor knowledge use, or
inappropriate refusal. To address these issues, we present WebDetective, a
benchmark of hint-free multi-hop questions paired with a controlled Wikipedia
sandbox that ensures full traceability of model actions, and a holistic
evaluation framework that separates search sufficiency, knowledge utilisation,
and refusal behaviour. Our evaluation of 25 state-of-the-art models reveals
systematic weaknesses across all architectures: models struggle with knowledge
utilisation despite having sufficient evidence and demonstrate near-absent
appropriate refusal when evidence is lacking. These patterns expose a
fundamental gap: today's systems excel at executing given reasoning paths but
fail when required to discover them. We develop an agentic workflow,
EvidenceLoop, that explicitly targets the challenges our benchmark identifies,
incorporating verification loops and systematic evidence tracking that improve
both search and synthesis capabilities. This baseline demonstrates that
WebDetective's diagnostic framework can guide concrete architectural
improvements, establishing our benchmark as a critical tool for developing
genuinely autonomous reasoning systems rather than pattern-following agents.

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，即使没有领域特定调优，基于智能体的LLM工作流也有潜力提高自动化科学写作的可靠性和可用性。

Abstract: The rapid growth of scientific publications has made it increasingly
difficult to keep literature reviews comprehensive and up-to-date. Though prior
work has focused on automating retrieval and screening, the writing phase of
systematic reviews remains largely under-explored, especially with regard to
readability and factual accuracy. To address this, we present LiRA (Literature
Review Agents), a multi-agent collaborative workflow which emulates the human
literature review process. LiRA utilizes specialized agents for content
outlining, subsection writing, editing, and reviewing, producing cohesive and
comprehensive review articles. Evaluated on SciReviewGen and a proprietary
ScienceDirect dataset, LiRA outperforms current baselines such as AutoSurvey
and MASS-Survey in writing and citation quality, while maintaining competitive
similarity to human-written reviews. We further evaluate LiRA in real-world
scenarios using document retrieval and assess its robustness to reviewer model
variation. Our findings highlight the potential of agentic LLM workflows, even
without domain-specific tuning, to improve the reliability and usability of
automated scientific writing.

Abstract: Natural Language Description (NLD) is a Natural Language Processing (NLP)
task that requires models to generate structured and meaningful outputs from
natural language inputs. In this work, we propose NLD-LLM, a systematic NLP
framework to evaluate the performance of language models to generate accurate
and concise source code descriptions. This framework incorporates a diverse set
of transformer models, including Qwen, DeepSeek, Phi, LLaMA, and Mistral,
spanning various sizes, architectures, and training approaches. Central to
NLD-LLM is a comprehensive prompt design strategy that includes standardized
formatting, clear task guidance, and NLD prompting, ensuring fair and
consistent evaluation. Additionally, we apply an iterative refinement process
to improve output's quality and assess the model's adaptability. Using semantic
and structural metrics, our analysis demonstrates that prompt engineering
significantly impacts the effectiveness of the model such that smaller models
often performing competitively when supported by well-crafted prompts.

Method: 分析LLMs与人类在语言预测方面的差异，识别导致LLMs"超人"表现的两个主要因素：更强的长期记忆（事实和训练示例）和短期记忆（前文词语）。

Result: LLMs在预测下一个词方面远超人类，导致它们低估了人类阅读时的处理难度，因此不适合直接作为人类语言理解的认知模型。

Conclusion: 需要开发具有人类水平长期和短期记忆的模型，并指出当前人类数据不足以衡量这一目标的进展，建议进行新的人类实验来解决这一差距。

Abstract: When people listen to or read a sentence, they actively make predictions
about upcoming words: words that are less predictable are generally read more
slowly than predictable ones. The success of large language models (LLMs),
which, like humans, make predictions about upcoming words, has motivated
exploring the use of these models as cognitive models of human linguistic
prediction. Surprisingly, in the last few years, as language models have become
better at predicting the next word, their ability to predict human reading
behavior has declined. This is because LLMs are able to predict upcoming words
much better than people can, leading them to predict lower processing
difficulty in reading than observed in human experiments; in other words,
mainstream LLMs are 'superhuman' as models of language comprehension. In this
position paper, we argue that LLMs' superhumanness is primarily driven by two
factors: compared to humans, LLMs have much stronger long-term memory for facts
and training examples, and they have much better short-term memory for previous
words in the text. We advocate for creating models that have human-like
long-term and short-term memory, and outline some possible directions for
achieving this goal. Finally, we argue that currently available human data is
insufficient to measure progress towards this goal, and outline human
experiments that can address this gap.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出基于大语言模型的多阶段信息提取流程，从实验报告材料中捕获47个成分-加工-微观结构-性能特征，通过迭代提取和来源追踪提高准确性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有提取工作通常只关注有限特征集，未能解决理解材料行为所必需的综合成分-加工-微观结构-性能关系，这给构建全面数据库带来了挑战。

Method: 采用多阶段信息提取流程，集成迭代提取与来源追踪，专门从实验报告材料中提取47个特征。

Result: 在特征级和元组级评估中F1分数约为0.96，与无来源追踪的单次提取相比，微观结构类别F1分数分别提高10.0%（特征级）和13.7%（元组级），在396种材料中漏检材料从49个减少到13个（漏检率从12.4%降至3.3%）。

Conclusion: 该流程实现了可扩展和高效的文献挖掘，产生高精度、最小遗漏和零误报的数据库，为机器学习和材料信息学提供可信输入，模块化设计可推广到不同材料类别。

Abstract: Data-driven materials discovery requires large-scale experimental datasets,
yet most of the information remains trapped in unstructured literature.
Existing extraction efforts often focus on a limited set of features and have
not addressed the integrated composition-processing-microstructure-property
relationships essential for understanding materials behavior, thereby posing
challenges for building comprehensive databases. To address this gap, we
propose a multi-stage information extraction pipeline powered by large language
models, which captures 47 features spanning composition, processing,
microstructure, and properties exclusively from experimentally reported
materials. The pipeline integrates iterative extraction with source tracking to
enhance both accuracy and reliability. Evaluations at the feature level
(independent attributes) and tuple level (interdependent features) yielded F1
scores around 0.96. Compared with single-pass extraction without source
tracking, our approach improved F1 scores of microstructure category by 10.0%
(feature level) and 13.7% (tuple level), and reduced missed materials from 49
to 13 out of 396 materials in 100 articles on precipitate-containing
multi-principal element alloys (miss rate reduced from 12.4% to 3.3%). The
pipeline enables scalable and efficient literature mining, producing databases
with high precision, minimal omissions, and zero false positives. These
datasets provide trustworthy inputs for machine learning and materials
informatics, while the modular design generalizes to diverse material classes,
enabling comprehensive materials information extraction.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了SynCED-EnDe，一个用于机器翻译关键错误检测的新数据集，包含1000个黄金标注和8000个白银标注的句子对，平衡了错误和非错误案例，并引入了细粒度的错误子类和辅助判断指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的WMT21英德CED数据集在规模、标签平衡、领域覆盖和时间新鲜度方面存在局限，需要更全面和细粒度的资源来推进机器翻译的安全部署。

Method: 构建了基于2024-2025年多样化来源（StackExchange、GOV.UK）的数据集，包含明确的错误子类、结构化触发标志和细粒度辅助判断（明显性、严重性、定位复杂性、上下文依赖性、充分性偏差）。

Result: 使用XLM-R和相关编码器的基准实验显示，由于平衡标签和精细化标注，性能相比WMT21有显著提升。

Conclusion: SynCED-EnDe可作为社区资源，推进机器翻译在信息检索和对话助手等应用中的安全部署，特别是在可穿戴AI设备等新兴场景中。

Abstract: Critical Error Detection (CED) in machine translation aims to determine
whether a translation is safe to use or contains unacceptable deviations in
meaning. While the WMT21 English-German CED dataset provided the first
benchmark, it is limited in scale, label balance, domain coverage, and temporal
freshness. We present SynCED-EnDe, a new resource consisting of 1,000
gold-labeled and 8,000 silver-labeled sentence pairs, balanced 50/50 between
error and non-error cases. SynCED-EnDe draws from diverse 2024-2025 sources
(StackExchange, GOV.UK) and introduces explicit error subclasses, structured
trigger flags, and fine-grained auxiliary judgments (obviousness, severity,
localization complexity, contextual dependency, adequacy deviation). These
enrichments enable systematic analyses of error risk and intricacy beyond
binary detection. The dataset is permanently hosted on GitHub and Hugging Face,
accompanied by documentation, annotation guidelines, and baseline scripts.
Benchmark experiments with XLM-R and related encoders show substantial
performance gains over WMT21 due to balanced labels and refined annotations. We
envision SynCED-EnDe as a community resource to advance safe deployment of MT
in information retrieval and conversational assistants, particularly in
emerging contexts such as wearable AI devices.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于离散扩散大语言模型(dLLMs)解码轨迹的模型归属方法，通过定向解码映射(DDM)提取结构信息，并使用高斯轨迹归属(GTA)进行模型识别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: dLLMs的解码机制不仅提升了模型性能，还可用于模型归属识别。挑战在于如何从解码轨迹中提取有效信息来区分不同模型或同一模型的不同检查点。

Method: 提出定向解码映射(DDM)来捕捉解码步骤间的结构关系，避免模型置信度的冗余问题；使用高斯轨迹归属(GTA)方法，通过计算轨迹在目标模型分布下的似然度进行归属判断。

Result: 在不同设置下的广泛实验验证了所提方法的有效性，能够准确识别模型归属。

Conclusion: dLLMs的解码轨迹可作为强大的模型归属工具，DDM和GTA方法能够有效提取和利用结构信息，实现准确的模型识别。

Abstract: Discrete Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) have recently emerged as a
competitive paradigm for non-autoregressive language modeling. Their
distinctive decoding mechanism enables faster inference speed and strong
performance in code generation and mathematical tasks. In this work, we show
that the decoding mechanism of dLLMs not only enhances model utility but also
can be used as a powerful tool for model attribution. A key challenge in this
problem lies in the diversity of attribution scenarios, including
distinguishing between different models as well as between different
checkpoints or backups of the same model. To ensure broad applicability, we
identify two fundamental problems: what information to extract from the
decoding trajectory, and how to utilize it effectively. We first observe that
relying directly on per-step model confidence yields poor performance. This is
mainly due to the bidirectional decoding nature of dLLMs: each newly decoded
token influences the confidence of other decoded tokens, making model
confidence highly redundant and washing out structural signal regarding
decoding order or dependencies. To overcome this, we propose a novel
information extraction scheme called the Directed Decoding Map (DDM), which
captures structural relationships between decoding steps and better reveals
model-specific behaviors. Furthermore, to make full use of the extracted
structural information during attribution, we propose Gaussian-Trajectory
Attribution (GTA), where we fit a cell-wise Gaussian distribution at each
decoding position for each target model, and define the likelihood of a
trajectory as the attribution score: if a trajectory exhibits higher
log-likelihood under the distribution of a specific model, it is more likely to
have been generated by that model. Extensive experiments under different
settings validate the utility of our methods.

TL;DR: 提出了时序思考机制，一种用于全双工语音对话模型的实时思考方法，在倾听用户语音时进行轻量级推理，提升响应质量而不增加延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有全双工系统在倾听阶段让代理空闲地预测静音标记，这不符合人类对话行为——人类通常在对话中进行轻量级思考而非保持心不在焉。

Method: 时序思考是一种专为流式音频输入设计的思考机制：1)严格因果性：在倾听时增量推理，仅基于过去音频更新内部假设；2)无额外延迟：推理在倾听窗口内摊销，用户停止说话后立即开始响应。

Result: 实验通过客观指标和人工评估显示，时序思考在响应质量上带来一致改进，并能稳健处理对话动态，在全双工交互指标上达到竞争性表现。

Conclusion: 时序思考机制有效提升了全双工语音对话模型的响应质量，同时保持了实时交互特性，为流式音频输入提供了新的思考范式。

Abstract: Recent advances in spoken dialogue language models (SDLMs) reflect growing
interest in shifting from turn-based to full-duplex systems, where the models
continuously perceive user speech streams while generating responses. This
simultaneous listening and speaking design enables real-time interaction and
the agent can handle dynamic conversational behaviors like user barge-in.
However, during the listening phase, existing systems keep the agent idle by
repeatedly predicting the silence token, which departs from human behavior: we
usually engage in lightweight thinking during conversation rather than
remaining absent-minded. Inspired by this, we propose Chronological Thinking, a
on-the-fly conversational thinking mechanism that aims to improve response
quality in full-duplex SDLMs. Specifically, chronological thinking presents a
paradigm shift from conventional LLM thinking approaches, such as
Chain-of-Thought, purpose-built for streaming acoustic input. (1) Strictly
causal: the agent reasons incrementally while listening, updating internal
hypotheses only from past audio with no lookahead. (2) No additional latency:
reasoning is amortized during the listening window; once the user stops
speaking, the agent halts thinking and begins speaking without further delay.
Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of chronological thinking through
both objective metrics and human evaluations show consistent improvements in
response quality. Furthermore, chronological thinking robustly handles
conversational dynamics and attains competitive performance on full-duplex
interaction metrics.

Motivation: 探索领域适应大语言模型在金融自然语言处理中的优缺点，满足金融应用对准确性、可靠性和领域适应的关键需求。

Method: 评估FinMA模型架构，使用金融指令调优数据集进行指令调优，并在FLARE基准下进行评估。

Result: FinMA在情感分析和分类任务中表现良好，但在数值推理、实体识别和摘要任务中面临显著挑战。

Conclusion: 这项工作旨在增进对金融大语言模型如何有效设计和评估的理解，以协助金融相关决策过程。

Abstract: This research explores the strengths and weaknesses of domain-adapted Large

(NLP). The analysis centers on FinMA, a model created within the PIXIU
framework, which is evaluated for its performance in specialized financial

adaptation in financial applications, this study examines FinMA's model
architecture, its instruction tuning process utilizing the Financial
Instruction Tuning (FIT) dataset, and its evaluation under the FLARE benchmark.
Findings indicate that FinMA performs well in sentiment analysis and
classification, but faces notable challenges in tasks involving numerical
reasoning, entity recognition, and summarization. This work aims to advance the
understanding of how financial LLMs can be effectively designed and evaluated
to assist in finance-related decision-making processes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLM评估中示例格式选择的影响，特别是分隔符这一看似次要的选择如何显著改变模型响应质量。

Method: 通过在不同模型家族(Llama、Qwen、Gemma)上测试各种分隔符，分析MMLU性能变化，并利用注意力头分数探究机制。

Result: 分隔符选择能显著影响模型性能，好分隔符能引导注意力到关键输入token。指定分隔符的提示能提高鲁棒性。

Conclusion: LLM对分隔符选择很敏感，这种脆弱性普遍存在且不随规模改善。建议在提示中明确指定分隔符以提高评估可靠性。

Abstract: Common Large Language model (LLM) evaluations rely on demonstration examples
to steer models' responses to the desired style. While the number of examples
used has been studied and standardized, the choice of how to format examples is
less investigated. In evaluation protocols and real world usage, users face the
choice how to separate in-context examples: use a comma? new line? semi-colon?
hashtag? etc.? Surprisingly, we find this seemingly minor choice can
dramatically alter model response quality. Across leading model families
(Llama, Qwen, Gemma), performance on MMLU for example can vary by $\pm 23\%$
depending on the choice of delimiter. In fact, one can manipulate model
rankings to put any model in the lead by only modifying the single character
separating examples. We find LLMs' brittleness pervades topics, model families,
and doesn't improve with scale. By probing attention head scores, we find that
good-performing delimiters steer attention towards key tokens in the input.
Finally, we explore methods to improve LLMs' robustness to the choice of
delimiter. We find specifying the selected delimiter in the prompt boosts
robustness and offer practical recommendations for the best-performing
delimiters to select.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在大规模公共审议摘要中存在少数派观点代表性不足和输入顺序偏见的问题，而现有评估方法依赖LLM作为评判者，与人类判断对齐度较弱。

Method: 构建了包含10个审议问题、3000名参与者意见数据的大规模人工标注数据集DeliberationBank，并训练了基于DeBERTa的DeliberationJudge模型来评估摘要质量。

Result: DeliberationJudge比各种LLM评判者更高效且与人类判断更一致，评估18个LLM发现审议摘要存在持续弱点，特别是少数派立场代表性不足。

Conclusion: 该框架为评估审议摘要提供了可扩展且可靠的方法，有助于确保AI系统在政策制定中更具代表性和公平性。

Abstract: Large-scale public deliberations generate thousands of free-form
contributions that must be synthesized into representative and neutral
summaries for policy use. While LLMs have been shown as a promising tool to
generate summaries for large-scale deliberations, they also risk
underrepresenting minority perspectives and exhibiting bias with respect to the
input order, raising fairness concerns in high-stakes contexts. Studying and
fixing these issues requires a comprehensive evaluation at a large scale, yet
current practice often relies on LLMs as judges, which show weak alignment with
human judgments. To address this, we present DeliberationBank, a large-scale
human-grounded dataset with (1) opinion data spanning ten deliberation
questions created by 3,000 participants and (2) summary judgment data annotated
by 4,500 participants across four dimensions (representativeness,
informativeness, neutrality, policy approval). Using these datasets, we train
DeliberationJudge, a fine-tuned DeBERTa model that can rate deliberation
summaries from individual perspectives. DeliberationJudge is more efficient and
more aligned with human judgements compared to a wide range of LLM judges. With
DeliberationJudge, we evaluate 18 LLMs and reveal persistent weaknesses in
deliberation summarization, especially underrepresentation of minority
positions. Our framework provides a scalable and reliable way to evaluate
deliberation summarization, helping ensure AI systems are more representative
and equitable for policymaking.

Motivation: 为了解决大语言模型推理过程中产生的幻觉问题，提高模型可靠性。

Method: 通过系统分类和提示工程控制生成不同类型的幻觉，使用嵌入模型将幻觉数据集映射到向量空间，采用无监督学习技术分析降维后的表示。

Result: 定量评估显示，幻觉的信息扭曲严重程度与其与正确输出簇的空间偏离度呈一致相关性，简单分类算法即可可靠区分幻觉与准确回答。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一个轻量级但有效的框架，可提高LLM的可靠性，理论和实证证据表明即使简单分类算法也能在单一LLM内可靠检测幻觉。

Abstract: This work introduces a novel methodology for the automatic detection of
hallucinations generated during large language model (LLM) inference. The
proposed approach is based on a systematic taxonomy and controlled reproduction
of diverse hallucination types through prompt engineering. A dedicated
hallucination dataset is subsequently mapped into a vector space using an
embedding model and analyzed with unsupervised learning techniques in a
reduced-dimensional representation of hallucinations with veridical responses.
Quantitative evaluation of inter-centroid distances reveals a consistent
correlation between the severity of informational distortion in hallucinations
and their spatial divergence from the cluster of correct outputs. These
findings provide theoretical and empirical evidence that even simple
classification algorithms can reliably distinguish hallucinations from accurate
responses within a single LLM, thereby offering a lightweight yet effective
framework for improving model reliability.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为探索性退火解码（EAD）的新策略，通过从高到低动态调整采样温度，实现"开头探索、结尾利用"的生成策略，有效提升强化学习验证奖励（RLVR）中的样本效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准固定温度采样难以平衡探索与利用的挑战：高温会降低样本质量，低温则限制发现能力。需要一种既能保持样本质量又能确保训练稳定性的探索策略。

Method: EAD采用动态温度调度，在生成过程中从高温度逐渐降低到低温度。早期使用高温鼓励语义方向的多样性探索，后期使用低温保持样本质量和接近目标策略的分布。

Result: EAD作为轻量级即插即用方法，在各种RLVR算法和模型规模下均显著优于固定温度采样，提高了样本效率。

Conclusion: 将探索策略与序列生成的自然动态对齐，是改进LLM推理能力的稳健途径。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) is a powerful paradigm
for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), yet
its success hinges on effective exploration. An ideal exploration strategy must
navigate two fundamental challenges: it must preserve sample quality while also
ensuring training stability. While standard fixed-temperature sampling is
simple, it struggles to balance these competing demands, as high temperatures
degrade sample quality and low temperatures limit discovery. In this work, we
propose a simpler and more effective strategy, Exploratory Annealed Decoding
(EAD), grounded in the insight that exploration is most impactful on early
tokens which define a sequence's semantic direction. EAD implements an
intuitive **explore-at-the-beginning, exploit-at-the-end** strategy by
annealing the sampling temperature from high to low during generation. This
dynamic schedule encourages meaningful, high-level diversity at the start, then
gradually lowers the temperature to preserve sample quality and keep the
sampling distribution close to the target policy, which is essential for stable
training. We demonstrate that EAD is a lightweight, plug-and-play method that
significantly improves sample efficiency, consistently outperforming
fixed-temperature sampling across various RLVR algorithms and model sizes. Our
work suggests that aligning exploration with the natural dynamics of sequential
generation offers a robust path to improving LLM reasoning.

TL;DR: Camellia是一个用于评估多语言大模型在九种亚洲语言中实体文化偏见的基准测试，涵盖六个亚洲文化。研究发现LLMs在亚洲语言中普遍存在文化适应困难，不同模型家族表现出不同的文化偏见模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏多语言基准测试，不清楚LLMs是否在不同非西方语言中也存在文化偏见。先前研究表明LLMs在阿拉伯语中偏向西方实体，引发文化公平性担忧。

Method: 构建Camellia基准，包含19,530个手动标注文化关联的实体和2,173个来自社交媒体的自然掩码上下文。评估四个多语言LLM家族在文化语境适应、情感关联和实体抽取QA等任务中的表现。

Result: LLMs在所有亚洲语言中都存在文化适应困难，性能因模型开发地区获取文化相关数据的能力而异。不同LLM家族持有独特的偏见模式，在情感与文化关联方面表现不同。LLMs在亚洲语言中的上下文理解能力不足，导致实体抽取中的文化间性能差距。

Conclusion: LLMs在亚洲语言中普遍存在文化偏见，需要更多关注文化公平性和多语言能力的发展。不同模型的文化偏见模式各异，凸显了开发更具文化敏感性的多语言模型的重要性。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) gain stronger multilingual capabilities,
their ability to handle culturally diverse entities becomes crucial. Prior work
has shown that LLMs often favor Western-associated entities in Arabic, raising
concerns about cultural fairness. Due to the lack of multilingual benchmarks,
it remains unclear if such biases also manifest in different non-Western
languages. In this paper, we introduce Camellia, a benchmark for measuring
entity-centric cultural biases in nine Asian languages spanning six distinct
Asian cultures. Camellia includes 19,530 entities manually annotated for
association with the specific Asian or Western culture, as well as 2,173
naturally occurring masked contexts for entities derived from social media
posts. Using Camellia, we evaluate cultural biases in four recent multilingual
LLM families across various tasks such as cultural context adaptation,
sentiment association, and entity extractive QA. Our analyses show a struggle
by LLMs at cultural adaptation in all Asian languages, with performance
differing across models developed in regions with varying access to
culturally-relevant data. We further observe that different LLM families hold
their distinct biases, differing in how they associate cultures with particular
sentiments. Lastly, we find that LLMs struggle with context understanding in
Asian languages, creating performance gaps between cultures in entity
extraction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型的广泛采用，确保LLM系统安全成为迫切需求。基于LLM的外部护栏模型虽然流行，但它们本身容易受到数据分布变化的影响，特别是在RAG场景下。

Method: 以RAG为案例研究，系统评估了3个Llama Guard和2个GPT-oss模型，分析增强上下文中各组件（检索文档、用户查询、LLM生成响应）的影响，并测试了两种缓解方法。

Result: 插入良性文档会改变约11%输入护栏和8%输出护栏的判断，使其不可靠。测试的缓解方法仅带来轻微改善。

Conclusion: 当前护栏存在上下文鲁棒性差距，需要开发对检索和查询组合具有鲁棒性的训练和评估协议。

Abstract: With the increasing adoption of large language models (LLMs), ensuring the
safety of LLM systems has become a pressing concern. External LLM-based
guardrail models have emerged as a popular solution to screen unsafe inputs and
outputs, but they are themselves fine-tuned or prompt-engineered LLMs that are
vulnerable to data distribution shifts. In this paper, taking Retrieval
Augmentation Generation (RAG) as a case study, we investigated how robust
LLM-based guardrails are against additional information embedded in the
context. Through a systematic evaluation of 3 Llama Guards and 2 GPT-oss
models, we confirmed that inserting benign documents into the guardrail context
alters the judgments of input and output guardrails in around 11% and 8% of
cases, making them unreliable. We separately analyzed the effect of each
component in the augmented context: retrieved documents, user query, and
LLM-generated response. The two mitigation methods we tested only bring minor
improvements. These results expose a context-robustness gap in current
guardrails and motivate training and evaluation protocols that are robust to
retrieval and query composition.

Method: 构建WeatherArchive-Bench基准，包含WeatherArchive-Retrieval（从百万档案新闻片段中检索相关段落）和WeatherArchive-Assessment（评估LLMs对社会脆弱性和韧性指标的分类能力）两个任务。

Result: 密集检索器在处理历史术语时表现不佳，大语言模型经常错误解释脆弱性和韧性概念，揭示了在复杂社会指标推理方面的关键局限性。

Conclusion: 该研究为设计更稳健的气候档案检索增强生成系统提供了重要见解，构建的数据集和评估框架已公开可用。

Abstract: Historical archives on weather events are collections of enduring primary
source records that offer rich, untapped narratives of how societies have
experienced and responded to extreme weather events. These qualitative accounts
provide insights into societal vulnerability and resilience that are largely
absent from meteorological records, making them valuable for climate scientists
to understand societal responses. However, their vast scale, noisy digitized
quality, and archaic language make it difficult to transform them into
structured knowledge for climate research. To address this challenge, we
introduce WeatherArchive-Bench, the first benchmark for evaluating
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems on historical weather archives.
WeatherArchive-Bench comprises two tasks: WeatherArchive-Retrieval, which
measures a system's ability to locate historically relevant passages from over
one million archival news segments, and WeatherArchive-Assessment, which
evaluates whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can classify societal
vulnerability and resilience indicators from extreme weather narratives.
Extensive experiments across sparse, dense, and re-ranking retrievers, as well
as a diverse set of LLMs, reveal that dense retrievers often fail on historical
terminology, while LLMs frequently misinterpret vulnerability and resilience
concepts. These findings highlight key limitations in reasoning about complex
societal indicators and provide insights for designing more robust
climate-focused RAG systems from archival contexts. The constructed dataset and
evaluation framework are publicly available at

Method: 使用神经网络预测可解释系统相似度预测的误差（残差），通过补充可解释特征系统来提升性能。

Result: 在四个数据集上的评估表明，该方法不仅能达到最先进作者身份验证模型的性能，还能展示最终预测的忠实性和可解释性程度。

Conclusion: 残差相似度方法在保持可解释性的同时，能够匹配最先进模型的性能，为作者身份验证提供了忠实且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Responsible use of Authorship Verification (AV) systems not only requires
high accuracy but also interpretable solutions. More importantly, for systems
to be used to make decisions with real-world consequences requires the model's
prediction to be explainable using interpretable features that can be traced to
the original texts. Neural methods achieve high accuracies, but their
representations lack direct interpretability. Furthermore, LLM predictions
cannot be explained faithfully -- if there is an explanation given for a
prediction, it doesn't represent the reasoning process behind the model's
prediction. In this paper, we introduce Residualized Similarity (RS), a novel
method that supplements systems using interpretable features with a neural
network to improve their performance while maintaining interpretability.
Authorship verification is fundamentally a similarity task, where the goal is
to measure how alike two documents are. The key idea is to use the neural
network to predict a similarity residual, i.e. the error in the similarity
predicted by the interpretable system. Our evaluation across four datasets
shows that not only can we match the performance of state-of-the-art authorship
verification models, but we can show how and to what degree the final
prediction is faithful and interpretable.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer注意力机制的二次复杂度随着上下文长度增加成为显著瓶颈，需要寻找更高效的替代方案。

Method: 通过系统调研和批判性分析亚二次注意力变体、循环神经网络、状态空间模型和混合架构等方法，比较计算和内存复杂度、基准测试结果。

Result: 评估了各种方法在计算效率、内存使用和性能方面的表现，识别了各自的优势和局限性。

Conclusion: 虽然Transformer仍占主导地位，但新兴的亚二次复杂度方法显示出挑战其地位的潜力，特别是在长序列处理场景中。

Abstract: Transformers have dominated sequence processing tasks for the past seven
years -- most notably language modeling. However, the inherent quadratic
complexity of their attention mechanism remains a significant bottleneck as
context length increases. This paper surveys recent efforts to overcome this
bottleneck, including advances in (sub-quadratic) attention variants, recurrent
neural networks, state space models, and hybrid architectures. We critically
analyze these approaches in terms of compute and memory complexity, benchmark
results, and fundamental limitations to assess whether the dominance of
pure-attention transformers may soon be challenged.

TL;DR: 研究发现即使大语言模型能完美检索相关信息，其性能仍会随输入长度增加而显著下降，表明存在与检索质量无关的长度限制问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究大语言模型在长上下文任务中性能下降的根本原因，验证是否仅靠改善检索能力就能解决长上下文性能问题。

Method: 在数学、问答和编程任务上对5个开源和闭源LLM进行系统实验，包括替换无关标记为空白、强制模型仅关注相关标记等方法。

Result: 即使完美检索相关信息，模型性能仍会下降13.9%-85%；提出通过让模型复述检索证据将长上下文任务转化为短上下文任务的缓解策略。

Conclusion: 输入长度本身会损害LLM性能，与检索质量和干扰无关；提出的简单缓解策略在GPT-4o上能带来高达4%的性能提升。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often fail to scale their performance on
long-context tasks performance in line with the context lengths they support.
This gap is commonly attributed to retrieval failures -- the models' inability
to identify relevant information in the long inputs. Accordingly, recent
efforts often focus on evaluating and improving LLMs' retrieval performance: if
retrieval is perfect, a model should, in principle, perform just as well on a
long input as it does on a short one -- or should it? This paper presents
findings that the answer to this question may be negative. Our systematic
experiments across 5 open- and closed-source LLMs on math, question answering,
and coding tasks reveal that, even when models can perfectly retrieve all
relevant information, their performance still degrades substantially
(13.9%--85%) as input length increases but remains well within the models'
claimed lengths. This failure occurs even when the irrelevant tokens are
replaced with minimally distracting whitespace, and, more surprisingly, when
they are all masked and the models are forced to attend only to the relevant
tokens. A similar performance drop is observed when all relevant evidence is
placed immediately before the question. Our findings reveal a
previously-unrealized limitation: the sheer length of the input alone can hurt
LLM performance, independent of retrieval quality and without any distraction.
They motivate our simple, model-agnostic mitigation strategy that transforms a
long-context task into a short-context one by prompting the model to recite the
retrieved evidence before attempting to solve the problem. On RULER, we observe
a consistent improvement of GPT-4o up to 4% on an already strong baseline.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 印度心理健康沟通存在语言碎片化、文化多样性，且临床NLP中代表性不足。当前健康本体和心理健康资源以英语或西方文化为中心，无法充分代表印度语言中患者的痛苦表达。

Method: 使用图基方法构建跨语言患者压力表达图（CL-PDE），捕捉文化嵌入的痛苦表达，跨语言对齐，并与临床术语链接。

Result: 开发了一个框架，能够构建跨语言心理健康本体，解决医疗沟通中的关键差距。

Conclusion: 该方法通过将AI系统建立在文化有效表示的基础上，为多语言环境中的心理健康护理提供更具包容性和以患者为中心的NLP工具。

Abstract: Mental health communication in India is linguistically fragmented, culturally
diverse, and often underrepresented in clinical NLP. Current health ontologies
and mental health resources are dominated by diagnostic frameworks centered on
English or Western culture, leaving a gap in representing patient distress
expressions in Indian languages. We propose cross-linguistic graphs of patient
stress expressions (CL-PDE), a framework for building cross-lingual mental
health ontologies through graph-based methods that capture culturally embedded
expressions of distress, align them across languages, and link them with
clinical terminology. Our approach addresses critical gaps in healthcare
communication by grounding AI systems in culturally valid representations,
allowing more inclusive and patient-centric NLP tools for mental health care in
multilingual contexts.

Motivation: ICU护理文档存在术语不一致、风格非正式、缺乏标准化等问题，在心衰护理中尤为关键，需要提升文档质量以改善患者安全。

Method: 应用直接偏好优化(DPO)方法，使用MIMIC-III数据库中的8,838份心衰护理记录和21,210个偏好对来微调Mistral-7B模型。

Result: BLEU评分从0.173提升至0.318(+84%)，BERTScore从0.828提升至0.891(+7.6%)，专家评分在准确性、完整性、逻辑一致性、可读性和结构清晰度方面均有显著提升。

Conclusion: DPO能够将轻量级临床语言模型与专家标准对齐，支持隐私保护的AI辅助文档记录，减轻管理负担并提高ICU患者安全。

Abstract: Nursing documentation in intensive care units (ICUs) provides essential
clinical intelligence but often suffers from inconsistent terminology, informal
styles, and lack of standardization, challenges that are particularly critical
in heart failure care. This study applies Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)
to adapt Mistral-7B, a locally deployable language model, using 8,838 heart
failure nursing notes from the MIMIC-III database and 21,210 preference pairs
derived from expert-verified GPT outputs, model generations, and original
notes. Evaluation across BLEU, ROUGE, BERTScore, Perplexity, and expert
qualitative assessments demonstrates that DPO markedly enhances documentation
quality. Specifically, BLEU increased by 84% (0.173 to 0.318), BERTScore
improved by 7.6% (0.828 to 0.891), and expert ratings rose across accuracy
(+14.4 points), completeness (+14.5 points), logical consistency (+14.1
points), readability (+11.1 points), and structural clarity (+6.0 points).
These results indicate that DPO can align lightweight clinical language models
with expert standards, supporting privacy-preserving, AI-assisted documentation
within electronic health record systems to reduce administrative burden and
improve ICU patient safety.

Result: 在20个基准问题的10次重复试验中，系统在大多数情况下准确率超过80%，优于Gemini-2.5 Pro和ChatGPT-4o模型。

Conclusion: LLM驱动的多智能体系统能够有效自动化结构工程中的有限元建模任务，展示了在工程领域应用的潜力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently been used to empower autonomous
agents in engineering, significantly improving automation and efficiency in
labor-intensive workflows. However, their potential remains underexplored in
structural engineering, particularly for finite element modeling tasks
requiring geometric modeling, complex reasoning, and domain knowledge. To
bridge this gap, this paper develops a LLM-based multi-agent system to automate
finite element modeling of 2D frames. The system decomposes structural analysis
into subtasks, each managed by a specialized agent powered by the lightweight
Llama-3.3 70B Instruct model. The workflow begins with a Problem Analysis
Agent, which extracts geometry, boundary, and material parameters from the user
input. Next, a Geometry Agent incrementally derives node coordinates and
element connectivity by applying expert-defined rules. These structured outputs
are converted into executable OpenSeesPy code by a Translation Agent and
refined by a Model Validation Agent through consistency checks. Then, a Load
Agent applies load conditions into the assembled structural model. Experimental
evaluations on 20 benchmark problems demonstrate that the system achieves
accuracy over 80% in most cases across 10 repeated trials, outperforming
Gemini-2.5 Pro and ChatGPT-4o models.

TL;DR: 提出Self-Filtered Distillation框架，通过三个无监督信任指标筛选LLM生成的推理过程，用于专利分类任务，提升准确性、稳定性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM生成的推理过程常包含逻辑错误、标签不匹配和领域不对齐问题，直接用作监督会传播噪声并影响训练稳定性。

Method: 使用三个信任指标：自一致性、类别蕴含对齐和LLM一致性评分，构建统一信任分数来加权训练样本或过滤低信任案例。

Result: 在USPTO-2M数据集上的实验表明，该方法在准确性、稳定性和可解释性方面优于基于标签的学习和传统蒸馏方法。

Conclusion: 建立了一个可靠的范式，在专利分析中利用推理感知的信任指标。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly generate natural language
rationales to enhance interpretability, but these often contain logical errors,
label mismatches, and domain-specific misalignments. Directly using such
rationales as supervision risks propagating noise and undermining training
stability. To address this challenge, we introduce Self-Filtered Distillation,
a framework specifically tailored for patent classification, which treats
LLM-generated rationales as trust signals rather than ground-truth supervision.
The framework employs selective distillation guided by three unsupervised trust
metrics: (1) Self-Consistency, which measures the stability of LLM-generated
rationales across multiple generations; (2) Class Entailment Alignment, which
assesses semantic coherence with patent-specific class definitions; and (3) LLM
Agreement Scoring, which validates rationale-label plausibility. These metrics
are integrated into a unified trust score that primarily weights training
samples while optionally filtering out extremely low-trust cases, enabling
reasoning-aware supervision. Experiments on the USPTO-2M dataset, a widely used
benchmark for patent classification, show that our method outperforms
label-based learning and conventional distillation in accuracy, stability, and
interpretability, establishing a reliable paradigm for leveraging
reasoning-aware trust indicators in patent analytics.

Motivation: 由于人类评估成本高、耗时长且难以复现，需要验证LLM模拟用户是否能可靠替代真实用户进行评估。目前缺乏系统性的基准研究来评估这些模拟器的可靠性。

Method: 引入SimulatorArena基准，包含909个标注的人类-LLM对话，评估模拟器在消息匹配人类行为和助手评分一致性两方面的表现。实验了多种模拟器方法，特别关注基于用户画像的方法。

Result: 基于用户画像的模拟器与人类判断高度一致，在两个任务上都达到Spearman's ρ=0.7的相关性。使用最佳模拟器评估了18个助手，包括GPT-5、Claude 4.1 Opus和Gemini 2.5 Pro等最新模型。

Conclusion: 条件化用户画像的模拟器能够可靠替代人类评估，提供实用且可扩展的评估方案，显著降低评估成本和时间。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in interactive
applications, and human evaluation remains the gold standard for assessing
their performance in multi-turn conversations. Since human studies are costly,
time-consuming, and hard to reproduce, recent work explores using LLMs to
simulate users for automatic assistant evaluation. However, there is no
benchmark or systematic study to evaluate whether these simulated users are
reliable stand-ins for real users. To address this, we introduce
SimulatorArena, a benchmark of 909 annotated human-LLM conversations on two
interactive tasks -- math tutoring and document creation. SimulatorArena
evaluates simulators based on how closely their messages match human behavior
and how well their assistant ratings align with human judgments. Experiments on
various simulator methods show that simulators conditioned on user profiles,
capturing traits like background and message styles, align closely with human
judgments. They reach Spearman's $\rho$ of 0.7 on both tasks, providing a
practical, scalable alternative to human evaluation. Using the best simulator
for each task, we benchmark 18 assistants, including the latest LLMs such as
GPT-5, Claude 4.1 Opus, and Gemini 2.5 Pro.

Conclusion: 基于图监督的多智能体路由方法在问答任务中具有有效性和鲁棒性，能够捕捉不同智能体的互补优势。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and agent-based frameworks have advanced
rapidly, enabling diverse applications. Yet, with the proliferation of models
and agentic strategies, practitioners face substantial uncertainty in selecting
the best configuration for a downstream task. Prior studies show that different
agents and backbones exhibit complementary strengths, and that larger models
are not always superior, underscoring the need for adaptive routing mechanisms.
Existing approaches to agent routing, however, often emphasize cost efficiency
while overlooking the fine-grained contextual and relational structure inherent
in QA tasks. In this paper, we propose tAgentRouter, a framework that
formulates multi-agent QA as a knowledge-graph-guided routing problem
supervised by empirical performance signals. Specifically, we convert QA
instance into a knowledge graph that jointly encodes queries, contextual
entities, and agents, and then train a heterogeneous graph neural network (GNN)
to propagate information across node types and produce task-aware routing
distributions over agents. By leveraging soft supervision and weighted
aggregation of agent outputs, AgentRouter learns principled collaboration
schemes that capture the complementary strengths of diverse agents. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our framework consistently outperforms
single-agent and ensemble baselines, while generalizing across benchmarks and
LLM backbones. These results highlight the effectiveness and robustness of
graph-supervised multi-agent routing for question answering.

Abstract: Making theory-of-mind inferences from human dialogue is a strong indicator of
a model's underlying social abilities, which are fundamental for adept AI

To assess the weaknesses of current models and to identify their solutions, we
introduce SocialNLI (SoNLI) -- the first social dialogue inference dataset.
SoNLI consists of a collection of dialogue transcripts hand-picked to center
complex social nuances like irony and sarcasm, paired with inferences,
corresponding likelihood scores, and human-written explanations. We explore
social inference analysis as a facet of theory-of-mind, and evaluate LLM and

Conclusion: TensorBLEU为RL模型微调等研究领域提供了强大的加速工具，明确其作为开发用途的"Token-ID BLEU"定位。

Abstract: Modern natural language processing models have achieved unprecedented scale,
yet the tools for their evaluation often remain a computational bottleneck,
limiting the pace of research. This is particularly acute for in-training
evaluation metrics, such as per-sentence reward signals in Reinforcement
Learning, which must operate efficiently on batches of token IDs directly on
the GPU. In this paper, we introduce TensorBLEU, a novel implementation of the
BLEU metric designed from the ground up for this specific use case. Our
approach is fully vectorized for GPU-accelerated, per-sentence computation
within PyTorch and introduces a memory-efficient counting mechanism. By
creating a compact, batch-specific dictionary of n-grams using
\texttt{torch.unique}, our method avoids the prohibitive memory costs of
traditional hashing-based vectorization, making it practical for
large-vocabulary models. We benchmark TensorBLEU against NLTK, the standard
library for token-ID-based BLEU calculation on the CPU. Experiments show that
TensorBLEU provides speedups of over 13x on consumer-grade GPUs (NVIDIA T4) and
exceeding 40x on data-center-class hardware (NVIDIA A100). This performance
transforms a significant bottleneck into a negligible part of the training
loop. By clearly defining its role as a "Token-ID BLEU" for development
purposes and open-sourcing our implementation, we provide a powerful tool for
accelerating research in areas like RL-based model fine-tuning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有规划基准仅包含通用简单的环境规范，可能高估LLMs的规划能力并带来下游任务的安全隐患。

Method: 为广泛使用的规划基准添加手动标注的细粒度自然语言约束，涵盖四个正式定义的类别，在4个最先进推理LLMs、3种形式语言、5种方法和4个数据集上进行评估。

Result: 引入约束不仅使性能持续减半，还显著挑战了对问题复杂性和词汇转移的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 需要更全面的基准来准确评估LLMs的规划能力，特别是在存在现实约束的情况下。

Abstract: LLMs have been widely used in planning, either as planners to generate action
sequences end-to-end, or as formalizers to represent the planning domain and
problem in a formal language that can derive plans deterministically. However,
both lines of work rely on standard benchmarks that only include generic and
simplistic environmental specifications, leading to potential overestimation of
the planning ability of LLMs and safety concerns in downstream tasks. We bridge
this gap by augmenting widely used planning benchmarks with manually annotated,
fine-grained, and rich natural language constraints spanning four formally
defined categories. Over 4 state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs, 3 formal languages,
5 methods, and 4 datasets, we show that the introduction of constraints not
only consistently halves performance, but also significantly challenges
robustness to problem complexity and lexical shift.

Conclusion: LANTERN框架成功解决了LLM在领域特定任务中的部署挑战，证明了知识蒸馏在提升模型性能和可扩展性方面的有效性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved strong performance across a wide
range of natural language processing tasks. However, deploying LLMs at scale
for domain specific applications, such as job-person fit and explanation in job
seeking platforms, introduces distinct challenges. At LinkedIn, the job person
fit task requires analyzing a candidate's public profile against job
requirements to produce both a fit assessment and a detailed explanation.
Directly applying open source or finetuned LLMs to this task often fails to
yield high quality, actionable feedback due to the complexity of the domain and
the need for structured outputs. Moreover, the large size of these models leads
to high inference latency and limits scalability, making them unsuitable for
online use. To address these challenges, we introduce LANTERN, a novel LLM
knowledge distillation framework tailored specifically for job person fit
tasks. LANTERN involves modeling over multiple objectives, an encoder model for
classification purpose, and a decoder model for explanation purpose. To better
distill the knowledge from a strong black box teacher model to multiple
downstream models, LANTERN incorporates multi level knowledge distillation that
integrates both data and logit level insights. In addition to introducing the
knowledge distillation framework, we share our insights on post training
techniques and prompt engineering, both of which are crucial for successfully
adapting LLMs to domain specific downstream tasks. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate that LANTERN significantly improves task specific metrics
for both job person fit and explanation. Online evaluations further confirm its
effectiveness, showing measurable gains in job seeker engagement, including a
0.24\% increase in apply rate and a 0.28\% increase in qualified applications.

Motivation: 现有LLM依赖显式推理指令或静态引导方法，缺乏自适应、无需指令的推理增强方法。

Method: 通过聚类CoT和中性提示的激活差异创建推理原型，在推理时将输入隐藏状态投影到这些原型上形成实例特定的引导向量。

Result: 在GSM8K、AQuA-RAT和BIG-Bench任务上持续提升准确率，无需微调或提示工程，即使在抑制CoT时增益依然存在。

Conclusion: 基于原型的动态引导是增强LLM推理的轻量级替代方案，能够强化潜在推理过程而非表面行为改变。

Abstract: Despite impressive breadth, LLMs still rely on explicit reasoning
instructions or static, one-fits-all steering methods, leaving a gap for
adaptive, instruction-free reasoning amplification. We present Prototype-Based
Dynamic Steering (PDS), a test-time method that amplifies large language model
(LLM) reasoning without adding or altering instructions. We introduce
"reasoning prototypes" by clustering activation differences between
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and neutral prompts. At inference, an input's hidden
state is projected onto these prototypes to form an instance-specific steering
vector. Evaluated on GSM8K, AQuA-RAT, and BIG-Bench tasks, PDS consistently
improves accuracy without fine-tuning or prompt engineering. Notably, the gains
persist even when CoT is explicitly suppressed to improve cost-efficiency,
indicating that the intervention strengthens latent reasoning processes rather
than inducing a superficial behavioral shift. These results position dynamic,
prototype-guided steering as a lightweight alternative to training-time
approaches for enhancing LLM reasoning.

Result: 在多种长文本阅读理解任务（问答、查询摘要、声明验证）中，CAM在性能和效率方面均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 基于建构主义理论设计的CAM记忆系统为LLM长文本理解提供了更强大和高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Current Large Language Models (LLMs) are confronted with overwhelming
information volume when comprehending long-form documents. This challenge
raises the imperative of a cohesive memory module, which can elevate vanilla
LLMs into autonomous reading agents. Despite the emergence of some heuristic
approaches, a systematic design principle remains absent. To fill this void, we
draw inspiration from Jean Piaget's Constructivist Theory, illuminating three
traits of the agentic memory -- structured schemata, flexible assimilation, and
dynamic accommodation. This blueprint forges a clear path toward a more robust
and efficient memory system for LLM-based reading comprehension. To this end,
we develop CAM, a prototype implementation of Constructivist Agentic Memory
that simultaneously embodies the structurality, flexibility, and dynamicity. At
its core, CAM is endowed with an incremental overlapping clustering algorithm
for structured memory development, supporting both coherent hierarchical
summarization and online batch integration. During inference, CAM adaptively
explores the memory structure to activate query-relevant information for
contextual response, akin to the human associative process. Compared to
existing approaches, our design demonstrates dual advantages in both
performance and efficiency across diverse long-text reading comprehension
tasks, including question answering, query-based summarization, and claim
verification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统文本块RAG在安全关键领域知识提取中的局限性，提供更连贯、系统级的推理能力。

Method: 构建结构化知识图谱并集成到RAG管道中，使用OMIn数据集创建QA基准，评估多种本地可部署LLMs。

Result: KEO显著改善全局感知能力，揭示模式和系统级洞察，而文本块RAG在需要局部检索的细粒度程序任务中仍有效。

Conclusion: KG增强的LLMs在安全、领域特定的QA中具有潜力，适用于高风险推理场景。

Abstract: We present Knowledge Extraction on OMIn (KEO), a domain-specific knowledge
extraction and reasoning framework with large language models (LLMs) in
safety-critical contexts. Using the Operations and Maintenance Intelligence
(OMIn) dataset, we construct a QA benchmark spanning global sensemaking and
actionable maintenance tasks. KEO builds a structured Knowledge Graph (KG) and
integrates it into a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline, enabling
more coherent, dataset-wide reasoning than traditional text-chunk RAG. We
evaluate locally deployable LLMs (Gemma-3, Phi-4, Mistral-Nemo) and employ
stronger models (GPT-4o, Llama-3.3) as judges. Experiments show that KEO
markedly improves global sensemaking by revealing patterns and system-level
insights, while text-chunk RAG remains effective for fine-grained procedural
tasks requiring localized retrieval. These findings underscore the promise of
KG-augmented LLMs for secure, domain-specific QA and their potential in
high-stakes reasoning.

*Harshil Vejendla*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: H1B-KV是一种混合1位KV缓存压缩方案，通过1位二进制草图表示键向量和4位量化值向量，将7B参数LLM的8k上下文缓存内存从4GB减少到60MB，性能与全精度相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归解码需要缓存不断增长的KV对，使得长上下文推理成为内存瓶颈问题。现有方法要么只压缩部分组件，要么丢弃上下文信息，提供不完整的解决方案。

Method: 提出混合1位KV缓存(H1B-KV)，使用1位二进制草图表示键向量实现硬件友好的位注意力，同时对值向量进行4位量化，形成全面的压缩方案。

Result: 7B参数LLM处理8k上下文仅需60MB缓存内存，减少70倍。在困惑度基准和复杂下游任务（数学推理、多任务理解、代码生成）上匹配全精度性能。

Conclusion: H1B-KV在质量-字节比上显著优于领先的量化、令牌驱逐和仅键草图方法，是内存受限环境中部署LLM的稳健解决方案。

Abstract: Autoregressive decoding in large language models (LLMs) requires caching a
growing list of past key-value (KV) pairs, making long-context inference a
memory-bound problem. While recent methods have explored quantizing the cache,
evicting tokens, or using binary sketches for keys (e.g., Loki), these
approaches often provide an incomplete solution by leaving one component (like
values) uncompressed or by discarding context information. This paper
introduces the Hybrid One-Bit KV Cache (H1B-KV), a comprehensive compression
scheme that radically reduces memory usage without sacrificing context. H1B-KV
represents each key vector using a 1-bit binary sketch, enabling
hardware-friendly bitwise attention, and further compresses value vectors using
4-bit quantization. This holistic, hybrid approach allows a 7-billion parameter
LLM to handle an 8k-token context with under 60 MB of cache memory - a 70x
reduction. We demonstrate that after a lightweight finetuning, H1B-KV matches
full-precision performance not only on perplexity benchmarks but also on
complex downstream tasks like mathematical reasoning (GSM8K), multi-task
understanding (MMLU), and code generation (HumanEval). Our results show H1B-KV
significantly outperforms leading quantization (KIVI), token eviction
(SparseLLM), and key-only sketching (Loki) methods in quality-per-byte,
establishing it as a robust solution for deploying LLMs in memory-constrained
environments.

Conclusion: 提示难度是影响自博弈偏好优化的重要因素，困难提示会损害优化性能。模型容量能缓解难度影响，选择性过滤困难提示是有效的改进策略。

Abstract: Self-play preference optimization has emerged as a prominent paradigm for
aligning large language models (LLMs). It typically involves a language model
to generate on-policy responses for prompts and a reward model (RM) to guide
the selection of chosen and rejected responses, which can be further trained
with direct preference optimization (DPO). However, the role of prompts remains
underexplored, despite being a core component in this pipeline. In this work,
we investigate how prompts of varying difficulty influence self-play preference
optimization. We first use the mean reward of $N$ sampled responses of a prompt
as a proxy for its difficulty. We find that difficult prompts exhibit
substantially inferior self-play optimization performance in comparison to easy
prompts for language models. Moreover, incorporating difficult prompts into
training fails to enhance overall performance and, in fact, leads to slight
degradation compared to training on easy prompts alone. We also observe that
the performance gap between difficult and easy prompts closes as the model
capacity increases, suggesting that difficulty interacts with the model
capacity. Building on these findings, we explore strategies to mitigate the
negative effect of difficult prompts on final performance. We demonstrate that
selectively removing an appropriate portion of challenging prompts enhances
overall self-play performance, while also reporting failed attempts and lessons
learned.

Motivation: 大型语言模型和视觉语言模型在部署时面临显著的内存和计算挑战，需要有效的压缩方法来解决这些问题。

Method: 提出PGSVD方法，包括：1）通过层级激活压缩误差上界网络损失变化；2）将低秩压缩建模为双目标优化；3）使用帕累托引导的秩选择和交替最小二乘实现零压缩流程。

Result: 在LLM和VLM上的实验表明，PGSVD在相同压缩水平下实现了更好的精度和推理加速。

Conclusion: PGSVD框架为大型模型的低秩压缩提供了理论基础和有效实现，在保持模型性能的同时显著提升了部署效率。

Abstract: Large language models (LLM) and vision-language models (VLM) have achieved
state-of-the-art performance, but they impose significant memory and computing
challenges in deployment. We present a novel low-rank compression framework to
address this challenge. First, we upper bound the change of network loss via
layer-wise activation-based compression errors, filling a theoretical gap in
the literature. We then formulate low-rank model compression as a bi-objective
optimization and prove that a single uniform tolerance yields surrogate
Pareto-optimal heterogeneous ranks. Based on our theoretical insights, we
propose Pareto-Guided Singular Value Decomposition (PGSVD), a zero-shot
pipeline that improves activation-aware compression via Pareto-guided rank
selection and alternating least-squares implementation. We apply PGSVD to both
LLM and VLM, showing better accuracy at the same compression levels and
inference speedup.

Motivation: 现有自动化方法在讲故事能力、美学质量和自我调整方面存在局限，难以实现高效且引人入胜的学术论文传播。核心挑战在于'无法正确评估就无法改进'的原则。

Method: 引入EvoPresent自我改进代理框架，核心是PresAesth多任务强化学习美学模型，提供美学评分、缺陷调整和比较反馈。建立了EvoPresent基准，包含演示生成质量和美学意识两个评估维度。

Result: 研究发现：(i)高质量反馈对代理自我改进至关重要；(ii)自动化生成管道在视觉设计和内容构建之间存在权衡；(iii)多任务强化学习训练在美学意识任务中表现出更强的泛化能力。

Conclusion: EvoPresent框架通过统一连贯叙事、美学感知设计和真实演示交付，结合多任务强化学习美学模型，有效解决了学术论文传播中的美学质量和自我改进挑战。

Abstract: The promotion of academic papers has become an important means of enhancing
research visibility. However, existing automated methods struggle limited
storytelling, insufficient aesthetic quality, and constrained self-adjustment,
making it difficult to achieve efficient and engaging dissemination. At the
heart of those challenges is a simple principle: \emph{there is no way to
improve it when you cannot evaluate it right}. To address this, we introduce
\textbf{EvoPresent}, a self-improvement agent framework that unifies coherent
narratives, aesthetic-aware designs, and realistic presentation delivery via
virtual characters. Central to EvoPresent is \textbf{PresAesth}, a multi-task
reinforcement learning (RL) aesthetic model that provides reliable aesthetic
scoring, defect adjustment, and comparative feedback, enabling iterative
self-improvement even under limited aesthetic training data. To systematically
evaluate the methods, we introduce \textbf{EvoPresent Benchmark}, a
comprehensive benchmark comprising: \textit{Presentation Generation Quality},
built on 650 top-tier AI conference papers with multimodal resources (slides,
videos and scripts) to assess both content and design; and \textit{Aesthetic
Awareness}, consisting of 2,000 slide pairs with varying aesthetic levels,
supporting joint training and evaluation on scoring, defect adjustment, and
comparison. Our findings highlight that (i) High-quality feedback is essential
for agent self-improvement, while initial capability alone does not guarantee
effective self-correction. (ii) Automated generation pipelines exhibit a
trade-off between visual design and content construction. (iii) Multi-task RL
training shows stronger generalization in aesthetic awareness tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语言代理在处理需要大量信息检索的开放领域问题时表现不佳，主要原因是依赖固定的行动序列，无法灵活适应复杂推理需求。

Method: 基于关键实体构建初始节点，通过深度优先搜索和创新节点生成技术，结合历史错误路径和同层节点反馈动态调整推理策略。

Result: 在HotpotQA数据集上达到54.47% F1分数，在StrategyQA数据集上达到70.05%，分别比最佳基线高出5.03%和7.25%。

Conclusion: FGDIP框架通过动态交互规划有效扩展搜索空间并确保推理过程系统收敛，显著提升了语言代理在多跳推理任务中的性能。

Abstract: Recent advancements in language agents have led to significant improvements
in multi-hop reasoning tasks. However, existing approaches often struggle with
handling open-domain problems, which require massive information retrieval due
to their reliance on a fixed sequence of actions. To address this, we propose
Feedback-Guided Dynamic Interactive Planning (FGDIP), a novel framework
tailored to enhance reasoning in LLMs by utilizing dynamic and adaptive
strategies for information exploration in open-domain multi-hop reasoning
tasks. Our approach begins by identifying key entities relevant to the problem,
which serve as the initial nodes in the reasoning process. From these initial
nodes, we then generate reasoning child nodes with the process being refined
through a combination of historical error analysis and real-time feedback,
which allows the framework to dynamically adjust and optimize its reasoning
strategies. By integrating depth-first search with an innovative node
generation technique, our framework adapts based on both prior error paths and
concurrently generated nodes at the same hierarchical level. This dynamic
strategy effectively expands the search space while ensuring the reasoning
process systematically converges toward accurate solutions. Experimental
results show that FGDIP achieved up to 54.47% F1 score on the HotpotQA dataset
and 70.05% on the StrategyQA dataset, surpassing the best baseline by 5.03% and
7.25% respectively, highlighting its versatility and potential to enhance
language agents in multi-hop reasoning tasks.

Motivation: 基于大语言模型的代理在长视野任务中缺乏全局规划，导致盲目试错和产生幻觉行为，需要提升其规划能力。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：首先通过同源共识过滤策略从高级LLM合成高质量规划进行微调，然后使用基于规则的强化学习阶段，采用执行器能力增益奖励来进一步提升规划器。

Result: 在三个长视野代理任务上的实验表明，配备EAGLET规划器的执行代理优于现有方法，达到新的最先进性能，同时训练成本比基于RL的基线降低8倍。

Conclusion: EAGLET提供了一种无需人工努力或额外训练数据的高效有效解决方案，显著提升了代理在长视野任务中的规划能力。

Abstract: Agents based on large language models (LLMs) struggle with brainless
trial-and-error and generating hallucinatory actions due to a lack of global
planning in long-horizon tasks. In this paper, we introduce a plan-and-execute
framework and propose EAGLET, an efficient and effective planner training
method to enhance the executor agent's planning abilities without human effort.
Specifically, we train a plug-and-play global planner through a two-step
process: we first synthesize high-quality plans from an advanced LLM using our
proposed homologous consensus filtering strategy, and apply fine-tuning as a
cold start. Moreover, we further improve the planner with a rule-based
reinforcement learning stage using a novel executor capability gain reward,
ensuring it can handle task instructions of varying difficulty. Experiments on
three long-horizon agent tasks show that executor agents equipped with our
planner outperform existing methods, achieving new state-of-the-art
performance. Meanwhile, EAGLET reduces training costs by 8x compared to
RL-based baselines, and it does not require manual effort or extra training
data, offering an efficient and effective solution.

TL;DR: 提出了一种多智能体辩论框架，通过多个MLLM智能体迭代优化推理，显著提升隐式属性值提取的准确性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 隐式属性值提取在电子商务中至关重要，但现有多模态大语言模型在处理多维数据和视觉-文本理解方面存在局限性。

Method: 采用多智能体辩论框架，让多个MLLM智能体通过多轮辩论相互验证和更新推理结果。

Result: 在ImplicitAVE数据集上的实验表明，即使少量辩论轮次也能显著提升准确性，特别是对初始性能较低的属性。

Conclusion: 多智能体辩论策略能够有效解决单智能体方法的局限性，为多模态电子商务中的隐式AVE提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Implicit Attribute Value Extraction (AVE) is essential for accurately
representing products in e-commerce, as it infers lantent attributes from
multimodal data. Despite advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs),
implicit AVE remains challenging due to the complexity of multidimensional data
and gaps in vision-text understanding. In this work, we introduce
\textsc{\modelname}, a multi-agent debate framework that employs multiple MLLM
agents to iteratively refine inferences. Through a series of debate rounds,
agents verify and update each other's responses, thereby improving inference
performance and robustness. Experiments on the ImplicitAVE dataset demonstrate
that even a few rounds of debate significantly boost accuracy, especially for
attributes with initially low performance. We systematically evaluate various
debate configurations, including identical or different MLLM agents, and
analyze how debate rounds affect convergence dynamics. Our findings highlight
the potential of multi-agent debate strategies to address the limitations of
single-agent approaches and offer a scalable solution for implicit AVE in
multimodal e-commerce.

TL;DR: CoSpaDi是一种无需训练的大语言模型压缩框架，使用结构化稀疏字典学习替代传统的低秩分解，通过数据感知优化实现更好的模型保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统低秩权重近似方法结构约束过于刚性，会导致明显的模型精度下降，需要更灵活的压缩策略。

Method: 采用结构化稀疏因子分解，每个权重矩阵表示为稠密字典和列稀疏系数矩阵，利用校准数据集优化因子分解以最小化功能重构误差。

Result: 在20-50%压缩比下，CoSpaDi在多个Llama和Qwen模型上均优于最先进的数据感知低秩方法，在准确性和困惑度方面表现一致优越。

Conclusion: 结构化稀疏字典学习是传统低秩方法的强大替代方案，为高效LLM部署提供了新途径。

Abstract: Post-training compression of large language models (LLMs) largely relies on
low-rank weight approximation, which represents each column of a weight matrix
in a shared low-dimensional subspace. While this is a computationally efficient
strategy, the imposed structural constraint is rigid and can lead to a
noticeable model accuracy drop. In this work, we propose CoSpaDi (Compression
via Sparse Dictionary Learning), a novel training-free compression framework
that replaces low-rank decomposition with a more flexible structured sparse
factorization in which each weight matrix is represented with a dense
dictionary and a column-sparse coefficient matrix. This formulation enables a
union-of-subspaces representation: different columns of the original weight
matrix are approximated in distinct subspaces spanned by adaptively selected
dictionary atoms, offering greater expressiveness than a single invariant
basis. Crucially, CoSpaDi leverages a small calibration dataset to optimize the
factorization such that the output activations of compressed projection layers
closely match those of the original ones, thereby minimizing functional
reconstruction error rather than mere weight approximation. This data-aware
strategy preserves better model fidelity without any fine-tuning under
reasonable compression ratios. Moreover, the resulting structured sparsity
allows efficient sparse-dense matrix multiplication and is compatible with
post-training quantization for further memory and latency gains. We evaluate
CoSpaDi across multiple Llama and Qwen models under per-layer and per-group
settings at 20-50\% compression ratios, demonstrating consistent superiority
over state-of-the-art data-aware low-rank methods both in accuracy and
perplexity. Our results establish structured sparse dictionary learning as a
powerful alternative to conventional low-rank approaches for efficient LLM
deployment.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出代码转换上下文学习(CSICL)，通过在演示和指令中从目标语言渐进过渡到英语，来缓解大语言模型依赖英语作为潜在表征的翻译障碍问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型虽然具备多语言能力，但其推理过程隐式依赖于将非英语内容翻译成英语。当这一过程失败时，非英语语言的性能会急剧下降，限制了基于LLM的应用的包容性。

Method: 使用代码转换上下文学习(CSICL)策略，在演示和指令中逐步从目标语言过渡到英语，通过受控的代码转换来搭建隐式语言桥梁，增强跨语言对齐。

Result: 在4个LLM、6个数据集和10种语言的广泛实验中，CSICL始终优于跨语言上下文学习基线，在目标语言和未见语言上分别获得3.1%和1.9%的性能提升，在低资源设置下提升更为显著(目标语言14.7%，未见语言5.3%)。

Conclusion: 代码转换被证明是一种原则性和鲁棒的方法，可以在推理过程中克服翻译障碍，推动LLM朝着更公平有效的多语言系统发展。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) exhibit strong multilingual abilities,
their reliance on English as latent representations creates a translation
barrier, where reasoning implicitly depends on internal translation into
English. When this process fails, performance in non-English languages
deteriorates sharply, limiting the inclusiveness of LLM-based applications.
Existing cross-lingual in-context learning (X-ICL) methods primarily leverage
monolingual demonstrations, often failing to mitigate this barrier and instead
reinforcing it. In this work, we introduce code-switching in-context learning
(CSICL), a simple yet effective prompting strategy that progressively
transitions from a target language to English within demonstrations and
instruction to facilitate their latent reasoning in English. By explicitly
scaffolding the reasoning process through controlled code-switching, CSICL acts
as an implicit linguistic bridge that enhances cross-lingual alignment and
reduces reliance on the translation barrier. We conduct extensive experiments
across 4 LLMs, 6 datasets, and 10 languages, spanning both knowledge-intensive
and reasoning-oriented domains. Our results demonstrate that CSICL consistently
outperforms X-ICL baselines, achieving gains of 3.1%p and 1.9%p in both target
and unseen languages, respectively. The improvement is even more pronounced in
low-resource settings, with gains of 14.7% in target and 5.3% in unseen
languages. These findings establish code-switching as a principled and robust
approach for overcoming the translation barrier during inference, moving LLMs
toward more equitable and effective multilingual systems.

Abstract: Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Agentic RAG) enhances the processing
capability for complex tasks through dynamic retrieval and adaptive workflows.
Recent advances (e.g., Search-R1) have shown that outcome-supervised
reinforcement learning demonstrate strong performance. However, this approach
still suffers from inefficient exploration, sparse reward signals, and
ambiguous global reward feedback. To address these challenges, we propose
DecEx-RAG, which models RAG as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) incorporating
decision-making and execution, while introducing an efficient pruning strategy
to optimize data expansion. Through comprehensive process-level policy
optimization, DecEx-RAG significantly enhances the autonomous task
decomposition, dynamic retrieval, and high-quality answer generation
capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Experiments show that DecEx-RAG
achieves an average absolute performance improvement of $6.2\%$ across six
datasets, significantly outperforming existing baselines. Moreover, the pruning
strategy improves data construction efficiency by nearly $6 \times$, providing
an efficient solution for process-supervised RAG training. The code is

Abstract: This ongoing work focuses on the development of a methodology for generating
a multi-source mapping of astronomical observation facilities. To compare two
entities, we compute scores with adaptable criteria and Natural Language
Processing (NLP) techniques (Bag-of-Words approaches, sequential approaches,
and surface approaches) to map entities extracted from eight semantic
artifacts, including Wikidata and astronomy-oriented resources. We utilize
every property available, such as labels, definitions, descriptions, external
identifiers, and more domain-specific properties, such as the observation
wavebands, spacecraft launch dates, funding agencies, etc. Finally, we use a
Large Language Model (LLM) to accept or reject a mapping suggestion and provide
a justification, ensuring the plausibility and FAIRness of the validated
synonym pairs. The resulting mapping is composed of multi-source synonym sets
providing only one standardized label per entity. Those mappings will be used
to feed our Name Resolver API and will be integrated into the International
Virtual Observatory Alliance (IVOA) Vocabularies and the OntoPortal-Astro
platform.

*Peter Ochieng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文推导了非渐近谱带，通过对齐度、温度和批次谱来约束InfoNCE梯度范数的平方，恢复了1/τ²定律，并在合成数据和ImageNet上紧密跟踪批次平均梯度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究InfoNCE损失函数的梯度特性，特别是其与温度参数和批次数据谱的关系，以改进对比学习的训练效率和性能。

Method: 使用有效秩作为各向异性代理，设计谱感知批次选择方法，包括快速贪心构建器，并在ImageNet-100和CIFAR-10上进行实验验证。

Result: 在ImageNet-100上，Greedy-64相比随机选择将达到67.5% top-1准确率的时间减少了15%，在CIFAR-10上也有类似增益。批次内白化促进了各向同性，并将50步梯度方差降低了1.37倍。

Conclusion: 通过谱感知批次选择和批次内白化，可以有效提高对比学习的训练效率和稳定性，理论分析与实验结果一致。

Abstract: We derive non-asymptotic spectral bands that bound the squared InfoNCE
gradient norm via alignment, temperature, and batch spectrum, recovering the
\(1/\tau^{2}\) law and closely tracking batch-mean gradients on synthetic data
and ImageNet. Using effective rank \(R_{\mathrm{eff}}\) as an anisotropy proxy,
we design spectrum-aware batch selection, including a fast greedy builder. On
ImageNet-100, Greedy-64 cuts time-to-67.5\% top-1 by 15\% vs.\ random (24\%
vs.\ Pool--P3) at equal accuracy; CIFAR-10 shows similar gains. In-batch
whitening promotes isotropy and reduces 50-step gradient variance by
\(1.37\times\), matching our theoretical upper bound.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的抽象文本摘要学习方法，包含基于最优传输的信息注意力方法和命名实体累积联合熵减少方法，旨在提高摘要的信息性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在大数据时代，需要先进方法将大量长文本转化为简洁、连贯且信息丰富的摘要。尽管已有显著进展，但在信息性方面仍有改进空间。

Method: 1. 基于最优传输的信息注意力方法，改进学习参考摘要中的关键信息；2. 命名实体累积联合熵减少方法，增强信息显著性。

Result: 在CNN/Daily Mail数据集上获得了比先前工作更好的ROUGE分数，在XSum上具有竞争力结果。人工评估也显示在信息性方面优于强基线。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提高了抽象文本摘要的信息性，进一步分析揭示了评估结果背后的合理原因。

Abstract: Abstractive text summarization is integral to the Big Data era, which demands
advanced methods to turn voluminous and often long text data into concise but
coherent and informative summaries for efficient human consumption. Despite
significant progress, there is still room for improvement in various aspects.
One such aspect is to improve informativeness. Hence, this paper proposes a
novel learning approach consisting of two methods: an optimal transport-based
informative attention method to improve learning focal information in reference
summaries and an accumulative joint entropy reduction method on named entities
to enhance informative salience. Experiment results show that our approach
achieves better ROUGE scores compared to prior work on CNN/Daily Mail while
having competitive results on XSum. Human evaluation of informativeness also
demonstrates the better performance of our approach over a strong baseline.
Further analysis gives insight into the plausible reasons underlying the
evaluation results.

TL;DR: 研究发现MoE模型在推理时参数激活高度稀疏，提出MoNE方法通过神经元粒度专家选择，仅激活50%参数即可达到传统MoE性能，显著提升推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索MoE层在推理时参数激活的稀疏性，发现大多数神经元激活值接近零，这启发了选择高激活神经元专家的方法。

Method: 提出Mixture of Neuron Experts (MoNE)，在每个专家内部进行简单的top-k选择，仅激活高激活值的神经元，无需额外路由参数或专家间通信。

Result: MoNE仅激活50%的MoE层参数即可匹配传统MoE性能，在相同激活参数数量下始终优于传统MoE。

Conclusion: MoNE是提高MoE类模型参数利用率和推理效率的实用方法。

Abstract: In this work, we first explore whether the parameters activated by the MoE
layer remain highly sparse at inference. We perform a sparsification study on
several representative MoE models. For each expert, we rank parameters by the
magnitude of their activations from the gate projection and progressively prune
the activated subset. Pruning up to 60% of parameters within that subset causes
only negligible task-performance degradation; substantial drops occur only
after more than 90% are removed. We further decompose experts into
neuron-granular MoE and visualize their activation values, finding that most
neuron activations are near zero. This observation motivates us to select only
high-activation neuron experts during pretraining. Based on this insight, we
propose Mixture of Neuron Experts (MoNE). MoNE achieves neuron-granular expert
selection by only applying a simple top-k selection within each expert, incurs
negligible latency, and requires no additional routing parameters or
inter-expert communication. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoNE matches
traditional MoE performance while activating only 50% of the MoE-layer
parameters, and it consistently outperforms traditional MoE when compared at
equal numbers of activated parameters. These results suggest that MoNE is a
practical approach to improving parameter utilization and inference efficiency
in MoE-like models.

TL;DR: TKTO是一种无需配对数据的文本转语音偏好优化方法，通过直接针对token级单元实现细粒度对齐，显著提升日语TTS准确性和降低字符错误率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前TTS偏好优化方法需要成对的utterance级样本，但这类数据有限且无法实现细粒度的token级优化，特别是在发音对齐方面存在不足。

Method: 提出TKTO方法，无需配对数据，直接针对token级单元进行优化，自动提供细粒度对齐信号而无需token级标注。

Result: TKTO将日语TTS准确率提升39%，字符错误率降低54%，为目标token自动分配12.8倍更强的奖励。

Conclusion: TKTO提供了一种更数据高效的训练范式，通过token级偏好优化显著改善了TTS系统的发音对齐和自然度。

Abstract: Aligning text-to-speech (TTS) system outputs with human feedback through
preference optimization has been shown to effectively improve the robustness
and naturalness of language model-based TTS models. Current approaches
primarily require paired desirable and undesirable samples at the utterance
level. However, such pairs are often limited in TTS output data, and
utterance-level formulation prevents fine-grained token-level optimization
needed for accurate pronunciation alignment. In this study, we propose TKTO
that eliminates the need for paired data, enabling a more data-efficient
training paradigm, and directly targets token-level units, automatically
providing fine-grained alignment signals without token-level annotations. TKTO
improves the challenging Japanese TTS accuracy by 39% and reduces CER by 54%,
automatically assigning 12.8 times stronger reward to targeted tokens.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Balancing exploration and exploitation remains a central challenge in
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) for large language models
(LLMs). Current RLVR methods often overemphasize exploitation, leading to
entropy collapse, diminished exploratory capacity, and ultimately limited
performance gains. Although techniques that increase policy stochasticity can
promote exploration, they frequently fail to escape dominant behavioral modes.
This creates a self-reinforcing loop-repeatedly sampling and rewarding dominant
modes-that further erodes exploration. We introduce Exploration-Enhanced Policy
Optimization (EEPO), a framework that promotes exploration via two-stage
rollouts with adaptive unlearning. In the first stage, the model generates half
of the trajectories; it then undergoes a lightweight unlearning step to
temporarily suppress these sampled responses, forcing the second stage to
explore different regions of the output space. This sample-then-forget
mechanism disrupts the self-reinforcing loop and promotes wider exploration
during rollouts. Across five reasoning benchmarks, EEPO outperforms GRPO,
achieving average relative gains of 24.3% on Qwen2.5-3B, 33.0% on
Llama3.2-3B-Instruct, and 10.4% on Qwen3-8B-Base.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型主要面向英语，导致法语等主要语言存在显著的性能差距，特别是在小型语言模型领域。现有的多语言模型在法语上的表现远低于英语，且针对法语的高效适应方法研究有限。

Method: 通过有针对性的后训练在精选的高质量法语数据上，并采用策略性的模型融合技术来提升双语性能。

Result: Luth模型在多个法语基准测试中超越了所有同规模的开源模型，同时保持了原有的英语能力。模型融合进一步提升了双语性能。

Conclusion: Luth为法语小型语言模型设立了新的技术标杆，为未来的法语语言研究提供了强大的基线模型。

Abstract: The landscape of Large Language Models (LLMs) remains predominantly
English-centric, resulting in a significant performance gap for other major
languages, such as French, especially in the context of Small Language Models
(SLMs). Existing multilingual models demonstrate considerably lower performance
in French compared to English, and research on efficient adaptation methods for
French remains limited. To address this, we introduce \textbf{Luth}, a family
of French-specialized SLMs: through targeted post-training on curated,
high-quality French data, our models outperform all open-source counterparts of
comparable size on multiple French benchmarks while retaining their original
English capabilities. We further show that strategic model merging enhances
performance in both languages, establishing Luth as a new state of the art for
French SLMs and a robust baseline for future French-language research.

Motivation: LLMs在专业领域或对话数据上的摘要性能不足，而微调需要昂贵的高质量标注数据，因此需要一种可扩展的自监督适应方法。

Method: 采用持续预训练作为自监督方法，使用大规模未标记商业对话数据来适应LLMs进行下游摘要任务。

Result: 持续预训练在领域内和领域外摘要基准测试中都带来了显著提升，同时保持了强大的泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 持续预训练是提升LLMs对话摘要性能的有效方法，并为工业应用提供了实用的数据选择策略指导。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance in text
summarization, yet their performance often falls short when applied to
specialized domains %or conversational data that differ from their original
pre-training distribution. While fine-tuning can improve summarization quality,
it typically relies on costly and scarce high-quality labeled data. In this
work, we explore continual pre-training as a scalable, self-supervised approach
to adapt LLMs for downstream summarization tasks, particularly in the context
of noisy real-world conversation transcripts. We conduct extensive experiments
using large-scale, unlabeled business conversation data to investigate whether
continual pre-training enhances model capabilities in conversational
summarization. Our results demonstrate that continual pre-training yields
substantial gains in both in-domain and out-of-domain summarization benchmarks,
while maintaining strong generalization and robustness. We also analyze the
effects of data selection strategies, providing practical guidelines for
applying continual pre-training in summarization-focused industrial
applications.

Motivation: 企业面临日益复杂的数字法规合规挑战，特别是中小企业缺乏资源起草复杂法律文件。自动合同生成器作为廉价替代方案，但其实际效果缺乏实证研究。

Method: 创建多语言基准数据集，捕捉瑞士和欧盟隐私法的关键合规义务，使用基于GPT-5的新方法进行大规模合规评估。

Result: 18%的本地网站明确使用生成器，使用生成器的隐私政策合规性显著更高，相比未使用的情况合规性提升达15个百分点。

Conclusion: LLM在跨语言法律分析中具有潜力，欧盟法规产生布鲁塞尔效应，自动化工具在提高合规性和合同质量方面发挥重要作用。

Abstract: It has become increasingly challenging for firms to comply with a plethora of
novel digital regulations. This is especially true for smaller businesses that
often lack both the resources and know-how to draft complex legal documents.
Instead of seeking costly legal advice from attorneys, firms may turn to
cheaper alternative legal service providers such as automated contract
generators. While these services have a long-standing presence, there is little
empirical evidence on their prevalence and output quality.
  We address this gap in the context of a 2023 Swiss privacy law revision. To
enable a systematic evaluation, we create and annotate a multilingual benchmark
dataset that captures key compliance obligations under Swiss and EU privacy
law. Using this dataset, we validate a novel GPT-5-based method for large-scale
compliance assessment of privacy policies, allowing us to measure the impact of
the revision. We observe compliance increases indicating an effect of the
revision. Generators, explicitly referenced by 18% of local websites, are
associated with substantially higher levels of compliance, with increases of up
to 15 percentage points compared to privacy policies without generator use.
These findings contribute to three debates: the potential of LLMs for
cross-lingual legal analysis, the Brussels Effect of EU regulations, and,
crucially, the role of automated tools in improving compliance and contractual
quality.

Motivation: 长上下文模型容易受到上下文噪声（无关标记）的干扰，这会误导模型注意力并影响预测准确性。

Method: 提出集成梯度(IG)分数来检测和量化上下文噪声，并设计上下文去噪训练(CDT)策略，增强对关键标记的关注。

Result: 在四个任务上的实验表明，CDT能显著提升模型性能，使用CDT训练的8B模型达到50.92分，接近GPT-4o的51.00分。

Conclusion: CDT是一种简单有效的训练策略，能有效减轻上下文噪声的影响，提升长上下文模型的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: Long-context models (LCMs) have demonstrated great potential in processing
long sequences, facilitating many real-world applications. The success of LCMs
can be attributed to their ability to locate implicit critical information
within the context for further prediction. However, recent research reveals
that LCMs are often susceptible to contextual noise, i.e., irrelevant tokens,
that can mislead model attention. In this paper, we conduct a fine-grained
analysis of the context noise and propose an effective metric, the Integrated
Gradient (IG) score, to detect and quantify the noise information within the
context. Our findings reveal that even simple mitigation of detected context
noise can substantially boost the model's attention on critical tokens and
benefit subsequent predictions. Building on this insight, we propose Context
Denoising Training (CDT), a straightforward yet effective training strategy
that improves attention on critical tokens while reinforcing their influence on
model predictions. Extensive experiments across four tasks, under both context
window scaling and long-context alignment settings, demonstrate the superiority
of CDT. Notably, when trained with CDT, an open-source 8B model can achieve
performance (50.92) comparable to GPT-4o (51.00).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在处理长文本应用中的广泛使用，其在安全关键场景下对有害内容的敏感性尚未得到系统研究。

Method: 评估LLMs对有害内容的敏感性，改变内容类型（显性vs隐性）、位置（开头、中间、结尾）、比例（0.01-0.50）和文本长度（600-6000词元），使用LLaMA-3、Qwen-2.5和Mistral模型。

Result: 所有模型表现出相似模式：性能在中等有害内容比例（0.25）时达到峰值；召回率随文本长度增加而下降；开头的有害句子检测更可靠；显性内容比隐性内容识别更一致。

Conclusion: 研究首次系统揭示了LLMs在长文本中优先处理和校准有害内容的方式，既展示了其新兴优势，也指出了安全关键应用中仍面临的挑战。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly support applications that rely on
extended context, from document processing to retrieval-augmented generation.
While their long-context capabilities are well studied for reasoning and
retrieval, little is known about their behavior in safety-critical scenarios.
We evaluate LLMs' sensitivity to harmful content under extended context,
varying type (explicit vs. implicit), position (beginning, middle, end),
prevalence (0.01-0.50 of the prompt), and context length (600-6000 tokens).
Across harmful content categories such as toxic, offensive, and hate speech,
with LLaMA-3, Qwen-2.5, and Mistral, we observe similar patterns: performance
peaks at moderate harmful prevalence (0.25) but declines when content is very
sparse or dominant; recall decreases with increasing context length; harmful
sentences at the beginning are generally detected more reliably; and explicit
content is more consistently recognized than implicit. These findings provide
the first systematic view of how LLMs prioritize and calibrate harmful content
in long contexts, highlighting both their emerging strengths and the challenges
that remain for safety-critical use.

TL;DR: 对LSZ(2025)关于大语言模型在不同语言提示下表现出文化特异性倾向的研究进行批判性再评估，认为其报告的"文化倾向"是特定模型和任务设计的脆弱产物而非稳定特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LSZ声称大语言模型在不同语言提示下表现出文化特异性倾向（中文提示下更相互依赖和整体性，英文提示下更独立和分析性），但本文作者认为其实验方法和解释存在问题，需要进行批判性重新评估。

Method: 使用更广泛的大语言模型集和更多测试项目进行针对性复制实验，检验提示语言对输出的影响。

Result: 结果显示提示语言对输出影响极小，挑战了LSZ关于这些模型编码根深蒂固文化信念的主张。

Conclusion: LSZ报告的"文化倾向"不是稳定特征，而是特定模型和任务设计的脆弱产物，提示语言对模型输出的影响被LSZ夸大了。

Abstract: In a recent study, Lu, Song, and Zhang (2025) (LSZ) propose that large
language models (LLMs), when prompted in different languages, display
culturally specific tendencies. They report that the two models (i.e., GPT and
ERNIE) respond in more interdependent and holistic ways when prompted in
Chinese, and more independent and analytic ways when prompted in English. LSZ
attribute these differences to deep-seated cultural patterns in the models,
claiming that prompt language alone can induce substantial cultural shifts.
While we acknowledge the empirical patterns they observed, we find their
experiments, methods, and interpretations problematic. In this paper, we
critically re-evaluate the methodology, theoretical framing, and conclusions of
LSZ. We argue that the reported "cultural tendencies" are not stable traits but
fragile artifacts of specific models and task design. To test this, we
conducted targeted replications using a broader set of LLMs and a larger number
of test items. Our results show that prompt language has minimal effect on
outputs, challenging LSZ's claim that these models encode grounded cultural
beliefs.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在多轮交互中表现不佳，往往依赖错误的早期假设且难以追踪用户目标随时间的变化，而对话系统中长期规划对处理交互任务至关重要。

Method: 基于强化学习的提示优化框架，通过生成逐轮反馈并利用经验回放进行提示重写，仅修改LLM代理的任务指令提示来实现规划能力。

Conclusion: 该方法为无参数的强化学习启发的优化方法开辟了未来研究方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in a wide range
of natural language processing tasks and can be adapted through prompting.
However, they remain suboptimal in multi-turn interactions, often relying on
incorrect early assumptions and failing to track user goals over time, which
makes such tasks particularly challenging. Prior works in dialogue systems have
shown that long-term planning is essential for handling interactive tasks. In
this work, we propose a prompt optimisation framework inspired by reinforcement
learning, which enables such planning to take place by only modifying the task
instruction prompt of the LLM-based agent. By generating turn-by-turn feedback
and leveraging experience replay for prompt rewriting, our proposed method
shows significant improvement in multi-turn tasks such as text-to-SQL and
task-oriented dialogue. Moreover, it generalises across different LLM-based
agents and can leverage diverse LLMs as meta-prompting agents. This warrants
future research in reinforcement learning-inspired parameter-free optimisation
methods.

Result: 识别了六个方法论问题：将国家等同于文化、忽视文化内部多样性、依赖过度简化的调查格式等。

Conclusion: 基于人类学方法提出了具体改进：纳入真实世界叙事和场景、让文化社区参与设计和验证、在情境而非孤立环境中评估模型，以开发超越静态回忆任务的更准确文化基准。

Abstract: Cultural evaluation of large language models has become increasingly
important, yet current benchmarks often reduce culture to static facts or
homogeneous values. This view conflicts with anthropological accounts that
emphasize culture as dynamic, historically situated, and enacted in practice.
To analyze this gap, we introduce a four-part framework that categorizes how
benchmarks frame culture, such as knowledge, preference, performance, or bias.
Using this lens, we qualitatively examine 20 cultural benchmarks and identify
six recurring methodological issues, including treating countries as cultures,
overlooking within-culture diversity, and relying on oversimplified survey
formats. Drawing on established anthropological methods, we propose concrete
improvements: incorporating real-world narratives and scenarios, involving
cultural communities in design and validation, and evaluating models in context
rather than isolation. Our aim is to guide the development of cultural
benchmarks that go beyond static recall tasks and more accurately capture the
responses of the models to complex cultural situations.

Result: 顶级模型与调查响应高度一致（皮尔逊相关系数约0.90），但存在明显的区域性差异：西方地区平均r=0.82，非西方地区平均r=0.61，存在0.21的绝对差距。同行评审识别出348个冲突。

Conclusion: 研究显示在文化感知AI方面取得了实际进展，但跨区域使用仍面临挑战，需要解决区域性偏见问题。

Abstract: We present EvalMORAAL, a transparent chain-of-thought (CoT) framework that
uses two scoring methods (log-probabilities and direct ratings) plus a
model-as-judge peer review to evaluate moral alignment in 20 large language
models. We assess models on the World Values Survey (55 countries, 19 topics)
and the PEW Global Attitudes Survey (39 countries, 8 topics). With EvalMORAAL,
top models align closely with survey responses (Pearson's r approximately 0.90
on WVS). Yet we find a clear regional difference: Western regions average
r=0.82 while non-Western regions average r=0.61 (a 0.21 absolute gap),
indicating consistent regional bias. Our framework adds three parts: (1) two
scoring methods for all models to enable fair comparison, (2) a structured
chain-of-thought protocol with self-consistency checks, and (3) a
model-as-judge peer review that flags 348 conflicts using a data-driven
threshold. Peer agreement relates to survey alignment (WVS r=0.74, PEW r=0.39,
both p<.001), supporting automated quality checks. These results show real
progress toward culture-aware AI while highlighting open challenges for use
across regions.

Method: 使用线性探针分析LLM最终token表示，定位最终Transformer层中具有相反激活模式的注意力头来感知难度。

Result: 证明问题难度可以在LLM内部表示中被线性建模，成功定位到负责难度感知的特定注意力头，且这些头对简单和困难问题呈现相反激活模式。

Conclusion: LLM中的难度感知不仅存在且具有结构性组织，为自动难度标注提供了实用支持，可减少人工标注成本，并为基准构建和课程学习提供新方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed on complex reasoning
tasks, yet little is known about their ability to internally evaluate problem
difficulty, which is an essential capability for adaptive reasoning and
efficient resource allocation. In this work, we investigate whether LLMs
implicitly encode problem difficulty in their internal representations. Using a
linear probe on the final-token representations of LLMs, we demonstrate that
the difficulty level of math problems can be linearly modeled. We further
locate the specific attention heads of the final Transformer layer: these
attention heads have opposite activation patterns for simple and difficult
problems, thus achieving perception of difficulty. Our ablation experiments
prove the accuracy of the location. Crucially, our experiments provide
practical support for using LLMs as automatic difficulty annotators,
potentially substantially reducing reliance on costly human labeling in
benchmark construction and curriculum learning. We also uncover that there is a
significant difference in entropy and difficulty perception at the token level.
Our study reveals that difficulty perception in LLMs is not only present but
also structurally organized, offering new theoretical insights and practical
directions for future research.

### [150] [LexiCon: a Benchmark for Planning under Temporal Constraints in Natural Language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05972)
*Periklis Mantenoglou,Rishi Hazra,Pedro Zuidberg Dos Martires,Luc De Raedt*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了LexiCon基准测试，用于评估大语言模型在带约束规划任务中的能力，发现随着约束程度增加，包括GPT-5、o3和R1在内的先进LLMs性能会下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要测试LLMs在无约束规划任务上的表现，但现实世界应用需要LLMs能够处理带约束特别是安全约束的规划问题，因此需要专门的评估基准。

Method: 提出LexiCon基准，将现有规划环境添加时序约束，然后将约束问题转化为自然语言描述让LLMs解决。该基准具有可扩展性，可以自动为新环境生成约束。

Result: 实验表明，随着规划任务约束程度的增加，最先进的LLMs（包括推理模型GPT-5、o3和R1）的性能会显著恶化。

Conclusion: LexiCon是一个可扩展的基准测试，能够系统评估LLMs在约束规划任务中的能力，揭示了当前LLMs在复杂约束规划方面的局限性。

Abstract: Owing to their reasoning capabilities, large language models (LLMs) have been
evaluated on planning tasks described in natural language. However, LLMs have
largely been tested on planning domains without constraints. In order to deploy
them in real-world settings where adherence to constraints, in particular
safety constraints, is critical, we need to evaluate their performance on
constrained planning tasks. We introduce LexiCon -- a natural language-based
(Lexi) constrained (Con) planning benchmark, consisting of a suite of
environments, that can be used to evaluate the planning capabilities of LLMs in
a principled fashion. The core idea behind LexiCon is to take existing planning
environments and impose temporal constraints on the states. These constrained
problems are then translated into natural language and given to an LLM to
solve. A key feature of LexiCon is its extensibility. That is, the set of
supported environments can be extended with new (unconstrained) environment
generators, for which temporal constraints are constructed automatically. This
renders LexiCon future-proof: the hardness of the generated planning problems
can be increased as the planning capabilities of LLMs improve. Our experiments
reveal that the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs, including reasoning
models like GPT-5, o3, and R1, deteriorates as the degree of constrainedness of
the planning tasks increases.

TL;DR: 本文通过直接最小对比对方法重新评估GPT-2在寄生间隙结构上的表现，发现模型在所有测试条件下都成功掌握了填充语-间隙依赖关系，与之前使用差分法指标得出的结论相反。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究使用不同评估指标对大型语言模型学习复杂句法的能力得出矛盾结论，需要澄清哪种评估方法更具诊断透明性。

Method: 生成完整的8种排列范式寄生间隙刺激材料，使用Wilcox式的直接最小对比对方法系统评估GPT-2模型。

Result: GPT-2在所有四个测试条件下都表现出成功，表明模型即使在复杂寄生间隙环境中也具备对填充语-间隙许可原则的稳健知识。

Conclusion: 评估指标的选择对判断LLM的句法能力至关重要，直接最小对比对方法比差分法指标提供更清晰的诊断结果。

Abstract: Recent studies probing the Argument from the Poverty of the Stimulus (APS)
have applied Large Language Models (LLMs) to test the learnability of complex
syntax through surprisal-based metrics. However, divergent conclusions raise
questions concerning the insights these metrics offer. While Wilcox et al.
(2024) used direct minimal pair comparisons (the "wh-effect") to demonstrate
that models successfully generalise knowledge of filler-gap dependencies, Lan
et al. (2024) used a Difference-in-Differences (DiD) metric and found that
models largely fail on parasitic gaps (PGs). This paper argues that the direct
minimal pair approach offers greater diagnostic transparency. We demonstrate
this by generating a full 8-permutation paradigm of refined PG stimuli and
evaluating the GPT-2 model used in previous studies with a systematic
Wilcox-style wh-effect analysis. Our results show that GPT-2 succeeds across
all four tested conditions, indicating robust knowledge of filler-gap licensing
principles even in complex PG environments. This finding, which contrasts with
the more ambiguous results from DiD-style metrics, suggests that the choice of
evaluation metric is critical for assessing an LLM's syntactic competence.

TL;DR: MASA提出了一种多A共享适应架构，通过使用多个专家A矩阵来丰富特征提取，解决LoRA中单一降维矩阵导致的表示瓶颈问题，在保持参数效率的同时提升下游任务适应能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA方法依赖单一降维矩阵A作为特征提取器，这形成了表示瓶颈，无法捕捉复杂任务所需的多样化信号。需要丰富特征适应能力来改善下游任务适应性能。

Method: 提出MASA架构，采用多A单B结构，其中多个专家A矩阵不对称地跨层共享以确保参数效率，这些专家捕捉多样化特征，然后由层特定的单个B矩阵进行整合。

Result: 在MMLU基准测试中，MASA平均准确率达到59.62%，比标准LoRA提高1.08个百分点（相对改进1.84%），可学习参数仅为0.52%。

Conclusion: MASA通过多专家A矩阵的架构设计有效解决了LoRA的表示瓶颈问题，在保持参数效率的同时显著提升了模型在下游任务上的性能表现。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a dominant method in
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) for large language models, which
augments the transformer layer with one down-projection $A$ and one
up-projection $B$. However, LoRA's reliance on a single down-projection matrix
($A$) creates a representational bottleneck, as this solitary feature extractor
is inherently insufficient for capturing the diverse signals required by
complex tasks. This motivates our architectural shift to focus on enriching the
feature adaptation to improve the downstream task adaptation ability. We
propose MASA (Multi-$A$ Shared Adaptation), an architecture that implements a
multi-$A$, single-$B$ structure where the multi-$A$ expert ensemble is
asymmetrically shared across layers to ensure parameter efficiency. In MASA,
these specialized experts capture diverse features, which are then integrated
by a single, layer-specific $B$-matrix. The effectiveness and versatility of
our method are validated through a comprehensive suite of experiments spanning
multi-domain generalization, single-domain specialization, and multi-task
reasoning. For example, on the MMLU benchmark, MASA achieves an average
accuracy of 59.62%, outperforming the standard LoRA by 1.08 points (a relative
improvement of 1.84%) with comparable learnable parameters of 0.52%.

Motivation: 近期使用大语言模型测试刺激贫乏论的研究在不同句法现象上得出矛盾结果，怀疑刺激物的词汇歧义和结构复杂性可能混淆模型表现。

Method: 1) 在先前使用的刺激物上建立基线；2) 使用最先进的生成式LLM（Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview）根据语言学家指导的模板生成新的精炼数据集，以减轻已识别的混淆因素。

Result: 初步发现表明，GPT-2在这些精炼的PG刺激物上表现出比基线明显改善的性能。

Conclusion: 刺激物质量显著影响基于惊讶度的LLM句法能力评估结果，精炼的刺激物能更准确地反映模型的真实句法能力。

Abstract: Recent studies employing Large Language Models (LLMs) to test the Argument
from the Poverty of the Stimulus (APS) have yielded contrasting results across
syntactic phenomena. This paper investigates the hypothesis that
characteristics of the stimuli used in recent studies, including lexical
ambiguities and structural complexities, may confound model performance. A
methodology is proposed for re-evaluating LLM competence on syntactic
prediction, focusing on GPT-2. This involves: 1) establishing a baseline on
previously used (both filtered and unfiltered) stimuli, and 2) generating a
new, refined dataset using a state-of-the-art (SOTA) generative LLM (Gemini 2.5
Pro Preview) guided by linguistically-informed templates designed to mitigate
identified confounds. Our preliminary findings indicate that GPT-2 demonstrates
notably improved performance on these refined PG stimuli compared to baselines,
suggesting that stimulus quality significantly influences outcomes in
surprisal-based evaluations of LLM syntactic competency.

Motivation: 解决中文LLM面临的独特挑战，包括非结构化自由文本主导、缺乏结构化表示，以及现有基准主要面向英语、无法充分评估中文语言特性的问题。

Method: 构建中文数据-文本对(CDTP)数据集，包含对齐的文本和三元组，支持知识图谱补全、三元组到文本生成和问答等多任务评估。

Result: CDTP数据集包含700万对齐文本对和1500万三元组，覆盖四个关键领域，支持细粒度评估和多任务微调。

Conclusion: CB-ECLLM基准和CDTP数据集为中文LLM提供了结构化评估框架，支持可复现研究，并指出了未来研究方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across a wide
range of natural language processing tasks. However, Chinese LLMs face unique
challenges, primarily due to the dominance of unstructured free text and the
lack of structured representations in Chinese corpora. While existing
benchmarks for LLMs partially assess Chinese LLMs, they are still predominantly
English-centric and fail to address the unique linguistic characteristics of
Chinese, lacking structured datasets essential for robust evaluation. To
address these challenges, we present a Comprehensive Benchmark for Evaluating
Chinese Large Language Models (CB-ECLLM) based on the newly constructed Chinese
Data-Text Pair (CDTP) dataset. Specifically, CDTP comprises over 7 million
aligned text pairs, each consisting of unstructured text coupled with one or
more corresponding triples, alongside a total of 15 million triples spanning
four critical domains. The core contributions of CDTP are threefold: (i)
enriching Chinese corpora with high-quality structured information; (ii)
enabling fine-grained evaluation tailored to knowledge-driven tasks; and (iii)
supporting multi-task fine-tuning to assess generalization and robustness
across scenarios, including Knowledge Graph Completion, Triple-to-Text
generation, and Question Answering. Furthermore, we conduct rigorous
evaluations through extensive experiments and ablation studies to assess the
effectiveness, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), and robustness of the benchmark.
To support reproducible research, we offer an open-source codebase and outline
potential directions for future investigations based on our insights.

Motivation: 发现现有基于结果监督的强化学习方法存在根本缺陷：正优势令牌的重要性采样比率不匹配，导致正负令牌权重不平衡，抑制低概率令牌更新而过度放大高概率令牌

Method: 提出非对称重要性采样策略优化(ASPO)，翻转正优势令牌的IS比率使其与负令牌的学习动态对齐，并采用软双裁剪机制稳定极端更新同时保持梯度流动

Result: 在编程和数学推理基准测试中，ASPO显著缓解了过早收敛问题，提高了训练稳定性，并在基于GRPO的强基线基础上提升了最终性能

Conclusion: 分析为令牌级权重在结果监督强化学习中的作用提供了新见解，强调了在LLM强化学习中校正重要性采样的关键重要性

Abstract: Recent Large Language Model (LLM) post-training methods rely on token-level
clipping mechanisms during Reinforcement Learning (RL). However, we identify a
fundamental flaw in this Outcome-Supervised RL (OSRL) paradigm: the Importance
Sampling (IS) ratios of positive-advantage tokens are mismatched, leading to
unbalanced token weighting for positive and negative tokens. This mismatch
suppresses the update of low-probability tokens while over-amplifying already
high-probability ones. To address this, we propose Asymmetric Importance
Sampling Policy Optimization (ASPO), which uses a simple yet effective strategy
that flips the IS ratios of positive-advantage tokens, aligning their update
direction with the learning dynamics of negative ones. AIS further incorporates
a soft dual-clipping mechanism to stabilize extreme updates while maintaining
gradient flow. Comprehensive experiments on coding and mathematical reasoning
benchmarks demonstrate that ASPO significantly mitigates premature convergence,
improves training stability, and enhances final performance over strong
GRPO-based baselines. Our analysis provides new insights into the role of
token-level weighting in OSRL and highlights the critical importance of
correcting IS in LLM RL. The code and models of ASPO are available at

TL;DR: 语言模型后训练虽然提升了指令遵循能力和下游任务表现，但会损害模型在具有多个有效答案任务上的分布建模能力。作者提出了频谱调优方法来解决这一问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语言模型后训练方法在提升指令遵循能力的同时，往往忽视了模型在具有多个有效答案任务上的分布建模能力，导致模型难以灵活地根据上下文信息调整输出分布。

Method: 作者提出了频谱调优方法，使用频谱套件进行后训练，该套件包含来自40多个数据源的90多个任务，涵盖从人类偏好到数值分布等多种分布类型。

Result: 频谱调优相比预训练模型和指令调优模型，在可操控性、输出空间覆盖和分布对齐方面都有显著提升，特别是在需要根据上下文信息覆盖新分布的任务上。

Conclusion: 语言模型后训练需要在提升指令遵循能力的同时，保持模型对多样化分布的灵活适应能力，频谱调优为此提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Language model post-training has enhanced instruction-following and
performance on many downstream tasks, but also comes with an often-overlooked
cost on tasks with many possible valid answers. We characterize three
desiderata for conditional distributional modeling: in-context steerability,
valid output space coverage, and distributional alignment, and document across
three model families how current post-training can reduce these properties. In
particular, we disambiguate between two kinds of in-context learning: ICL for
eliciting existing underlying knowledge or capabilities, and in-context
steerability, where a model must use in-context information to override its
priors and steer to a novel data generating distribution. To better evaluate
and improve these desiderata, we introduce Spectrum Suite, a large-scale
resource compiled from >40 data sources and spanning >90 tasks requiring models
to steer to and match diverse distributions ranging from varied human
preferences to numerical distributions and more. We find that while current
post-training techniques help elicit underlying capabilities and knowledge,
they hurt models' ability to flexibly steer in-context. To mitigate these
issues, we propose Spectrum Tuning, a post-training method using Spectrum Suite
to improve steerability and distributional coverage. We find that Spectrum
Tuning often improves over pretrained models and their instruction-tuned
counterparts, enhancing steerability, spanning more of the output space, and
improving distributional alignment on held-out datasets.

Conclusion: 这项工作推进了对代码推理蒸馏训练动态的理解，超越了直觉层面的认知，为优化代码推理蒸馏提供了实证基础。

Abstract: Distilling the thinking traces of a Large Language Model (LLM) with reasoning
capabilities into a smaller model has been proven effective. Yet, there is a
scarcity of work done on how model performances scale with the quantity of
distillation data. In this work, we study the scaling trend of distilling
competitive coding skills on two small non-reasoning LLMs. We validate the
hypothesis that there is a $\textit{valley of code reasoning}$: downstream
performance on competitive coding first drops as data quantity increases, then
it steadily increases in a sharper-than-log-linear fashion. Having identified
the trend, we further fine-tune the models at two different distillation stages
on the same data to ground conclusions on their respective learning phases. We
learn that across stages in the low and medium-low data regimes, small models
benefit significantly from easier coding questions than from harder ones. We
also find that, surprisingly, the correctness of outputs in training data makes
no difference to distillation outcomes. Our work represents a step forward in
understanding the training dynamics of code reasoning distillation outside
intuition

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to hallucination, the generation of
plausible yet factually incorrect statements. This work investigates the
intrinsic, architectural origins of this failure mode through three primary
contributions.First, to enable the reliable tracing of internal semantic
failures, we propose \textbf{Distributional Semantics Tracing (DST)}, a unified
framework that integrates established interpretability techniques to produce a
causal map of a model's reasoning, treating meaning as a function of context
(distributional semantics). Second, we pinpoint the model's layer at which a
hallucination becomes inevitable, identifying a specific \textbf{commitment
layer} where a model's internal representations irreversibly diverge from
factuality. Third, we identify the underlying mechanism for these failures. We
observe a conflict between distinct computational pathways, which we interpret
using the lens of dual-process theory: a fast, heuristic \textbf{associative
pathway} (akin to System 1) and a slow, deliberate \textbf{contextual pathway}
(akin to System 2), leading to predictable failure modes such as
\textit{Reasoning Shortcut Hijacks}. Our framework's ability to quantify the
coherence of the contextual pathway reveals a strong negative correlation
($\rho = -0.863$) with hallucination rates, implying that these failures are
predictable consequences of internal semantic weakness. The result is a
mechanistic account of how, when, and why hallucinations occur within the
Transformer architecture.

Conclusion: 重新思考分词方法对于推进多语言表示学习至关重要，特别是在低资源设置中，并行分词器框架能有效改善跨语言泛化能力。

Abstract: Tokenization defines the foundation of multilingual language models by
determining how words are represented and shared across languages. However,
existing methods often fail to support effective cross-lingual transfer because
semantically equivalent words are assigned distinct embeddings. For example, "I
eat rice" in English and "Ina cin shinkafa" in Hausa are typically mapped to
different vocabulary indices, preventing shared representations and limiting
cross-lingual generalization. We introduce parallel tokenizers. This new
framework trains tokenizers monolingually and then aligns their vocabularies
exhaustively using bilingual dictionaries or word-to-word translation, ensuring
consistent indices for semantically equivalent words. This alignment enforces a
shared semantic space across languages while naturally improving fertility
balance. To assess their effectiveness, we pretrain a transformer encoder from
scratch on thirteen low-resource languages and evaluate it on sentiment
analysis, hate speech detection, emotion classification, and sentence embedding
similarity. Across all tasks, models trained with parallel tokenizers
outperform conventional multilingual baselines, confirming that rethinking
tokenization is essential for advancing multilingual representation
learning--especially in low-resource settings.

Result: 在8个基准测试中，相比LLaDA-8B-Instruct实现5.48倍加速和0.48性能提升，相比LLaDA-MoE-Instruct实现4.11倍加速和0.15性能提升

Conclusion: CreditDecoding能有效扩展到长序列，与主流推理优化正交，是一个易于集成且通用的解决方案

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) generate text through iterative
denoising steps, achieving parallel decoding by denoising only high-confidence
positions at each step. However, existing approaches often repetitively remask
tokens due to initially low confidence scores, leading to redundant iterations
and limiting overall acceleration. Through the analysis of dLLM decoding
traces, we observe that the model often determines the final prediction for a
token several steps before the decoding step. To leverage this historical
information and avoid redundant steps, we introduce the concept of Trace
Credit, which quantifies each token's convergence potential by accumulating
historical logits. Furthermore, we propose CreditDecoding, a training-free
parallel decoding algorithm that accelerates the confidence convergence of
correct but underconfident tokens by fusing current logits with Trace Credit.
This process significantly reduces redundant iterations and enhances decoding
robustness. On eight benchmarks, CreditDecoding achieves a 5.48 times speedup
and a 0.48 performance improvement over LLaDA-8B-Instruct, and a 4.11 times
speedup with a 0.15 performance improvement over LLaDA-MoE-Instruct.
Importantly, CreditDecoding scales effectively to long sequences and is
orthogonal to mainstream inference optimizations, making it a readily
integrable and versatile solution.

TL;DR: RoSE是一种无需人工标注的代理指标，用于选择最佳LLM生成器来生成训练小模型的合成数据，特别适用于低资源语言。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在低资源语言场景中，人工标注数据稀缺，但LLM能生成高质量文本。然而选择最佳LLM生成器很困难，因为外部评估需要昂贵的人工标注，而内部指标与下游性能相关性差。

Method: 提出RoSE方法：在候选生成器的输出上训练一个小模型，然后在所有其他候选LLM生成的合成示例上评估该模型，最终RoSE分数是该小模型的平均性能。

Result: 在6个LLM、11种语言和3个任务上的实验表明，RoSE比任何其他内部启发式方法更频繁地识别出最优生成器，与最优生成器基线的差距仅为0.76个百分点。

Conclusion: RoSE是唯一能与人类测试数据性能呈正相关的指标，为低资源语言场景下选择最佳LLM生成器提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: LLMs are powerful generators of synthetic data, which are used for training
smaller, specific models. This is especially valuable for low-resource
languages, where human-labelled data is scarce but LLMs can still produce
high-quality text. However, LLMs differ in how useful their outputs are for
training. Selecting the best LLM as a generator is challenging because
extrinsic evaluation requires costly human annotations (which are often
unavailable for low-resource languages), while intrinsic metrics correlate
poorly with downstream performance. We introduce Round robin Synthetic data
Evaluation (RoSE), a proxy metric for selecting the best LLM generator without
human test sets. RoSE trains a small model on the outputs of a candidate
generator (LLM) and then evaluates it on generated synthetic examples from all
other candidate LLMs. The final RoSE score is the mean performance of this
small model. Across six LLMs, eleven languages, and three tasks (sentiment,
topic, intent), RoSE identifies the optimal generator more often than any other
intrinsic heuristics. RoSE outperforms intrinsic heuristics and comes within
0.76 percentage points of the optimal generator baseline. This result is
measured in terms of downstream performance, obtained by training a small model
on the chosen generator's outputs (optimal vs. proxy metric selected) and
evaluating it on human-labelled test data. Additionally, RoSE is the only
metric to achieve a positive correlation with performance on human test data.

TL;DR: VecInfer是一种新颖的向量量化方法，通过平滑和Hadamard变换抑制键缓存中的异常值，实现超低位宽下的高效KV缓存压缩，在2位量化时性能接近全精度，同时显著提升推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有向量量化方法在超低位宽下因键缓存异常值导致性能严重下降，阻碍了代码本的有效利用，需要解决KV缓存内存开销大的问题。

Method: 应用平滑和Hadamard变换抑制键缓存异常值，使代码本能全面覆盖原始数据分布；设计融合计算与反量化的优化CUDA内核以减少内存访问开销。

Result: 在长上下文理解和数学推理任务中始终优于现有量化基线；2位量化时性能接近全精度，在Llama-3.1-8B上实现2.7倍大批次自注意力计算加速和8.3倍单批次端到端延迟降低。

Conclusion: VecInfer通过有效抑制异常值和优化部署，在超低位宽下实现了高效的KV缓存压缩，为大规模语言模型推理提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: The Key-Value (KV) cache introduces substantial memory overhead during large
language model (LLM) inference. Although existing vector quantization (VQ)
methods reduce KV cache usage and provide flexible representational capacity
across bit-widths, they suffer severe performance degradation at ultra-low
bit-widths due to key cache outliers that hinder effective codebook
utilization. To address this challenge, we propose VecInfer, a novel VQ method
for aggressive KV cache compression while enabling efficient inference. By
applying smooth and Hadamard transformations, VecInfer suppresses outliers in
the key cache, enabling the codebook to comprehensively cover the original data
distribution and thereby reducing quantization difficulty. To facilitate
efficient deployment, we design an optimized CUDA kernel that fuses computation
with dequantization to minimize memory access overhead. Extensive evaluations
demonstrate that VecInfer consistently outperforms existing quantization
baselines across both long-context understanding and mathematical reasoning
tasks. With only 2-bit quantization, VecInfer achieves performance comparable
to full precision, while delivering up to $\mathbf{2.7\times}$ speedup in
large-batch self-attention computation and $\mathbf{8.3\times}$ reduction in
single-batch end-to-end latency on Llama-3.1-8B with a 196k sequence length.

### [163] [Mixing Mechanisms: How Language Models Retrieve Bound Entities In-Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06182)
*Yoav Gur-Arieh,Mor Geva,Atticus Geiger*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 语言模型在上下文推理中通过位置、词汇和自反三种机制来绑定和检索实体，随着绑定实体数量增加，位置机制变得不可靠，模型会混合使用这三种机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究语言模型如何在上下文中绑定和检索实体，特别是当绑定实体数量增加时，原有的位置机制是否仍然有效。

Method: 在9个模型和10个绑定任务上进行广泛实验，分析语言模型使用的三种检索机制：位置机制、词汇机制和自反机制，并开发结合这三种机制的因果模型。

Result: 发现随着绑定实体数量增加，位置机制在中部位置变得不可靠，模型会补充使用词汇和自反机制。开发的因果模型在预测下一个token分布时达到95%的一致性。

Conclusion: 研究建立了语言模型在上下文中绑定和检索实体的更完整图景，揭示了模型混合使用三种机制的模式，这些发现在更自然的开放文本设置中仍然稳健。

Abstract: A key component of in-context reasoning is the ability of language models
(LMs) to bind entities for later retrieval. For example, an LM might represent
"Ann loves pie" by binding "Ann" to "pie", allowing it to later retrieve "Ann"
when asked "Who loves pie?" Prior research on short lists of bound entities
found strong evidence that LMs implement such retrieval via a positional
mechanism, where "Ann" is retrieved based on its position in context. In this
work, we find that this mechanism generalizes poorly to more complex settings;
as the number of bound entities in context increases, the positional mechanism
becomes noisy and unreliable in middle positions. To compensate for this, we
find that LMs supplement the positional mechanism with a lexical mechanism
(retrieving "Ann" using its bound counterpart "pie") and a reflexive mechanism
(retrieving "Ann" through a direct pointer). Through extensive experiments on
nine models and ten binding tasks, we uncover a consistent pattern in how LMs
mix these mechanisms to drive model behavior. We leverage these insights to
develop a causal model combining all three mechanisms that estimates next token
distributions with 95% agreement. Finally, we show that our model generalizes
to substantially longer inputs of open-ended text interleaved with entity
groups, further demonstrating the robustness of our findings in more natural
settings. Overall, our study establishes a more complete picture of how LMs
bind and retrieve entities in-context.

Motivation: 现有工作大多采用单次设置，忽略了科学研究开发中迭代和反馈驱动的实际工作流程，需要评估LLM在真实研究环境中的代码生成能力。

Method: 创建RECODE-H基准测试，包含结构化指令、单元测试和五级反馈层次，并开发ReCodeAgent框架将反馈集成到迭代代码生成中。

Conclusion: RECODE-H为开发适应性强、反馈驱动的LLM代理在科学研究实现中奠定了基础。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show the promise in supporting scientific
research implementation, yet their ability to generate correct and executable
code remains limited. Existing works largely adopt one-shot settings, ignoring
the iterative and feedback-driven nature of realistic workflows of scientific
research development. To address this gap, we present RECODE-H, a benchmark of
102 tasks from research papers and repositories that evaluates LLM agents
through multi-turn interactions with LLM-simulated human feedback. It includes
structured instructions,unit tests, and a five-level feedback hierarchy to
reflect realistic researcher-agent collaboration. We further present
ReCodeAgent, a framework that integrates feedback into iterative code
generation. Experiments with leading LLMs, including GPT-5, Claude-Sonnet-4,
DeepSeek-V3.1, and Gemini 2.5, show substantial performance gains with richer
feedback, while also highlighting ongoing challenges in the generation of
complex research code. RECODE-H establishes a foundation for developing

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 孟加拉语作为资源匮乏语言且方言多样性高，现有系统未针对实时使用优化且仅关注标准孟加拉语，需要开发支持地区方言的实时语音助手。

Method: 采用客户端-服务器架构，使用RTP协议确保低延迟通信；通过微调IndicWav2Vec模型开发方言感知ASR系统BRDialect，支持10种孟加拉语地区方言。

Result: BRDialect在RegSpeech12数据集上比基线ASR模型性能提升12.41-33.98%；系统可在24kbps低带宽下运行，平均端到端延迟为4.9秒。

Conclusion: 低带宽使用和最小端到端延迟使系统既经济又具有交互性，为多样化的孟加拉语使用者群体实现了包容和可访问的语音技术。

Abstract: Real-time speech assistants are becoming increasingly popular for ensuring
improved accessibility to information. Bengali, being a low-resource language
with a high regional dialectal diversity, has seen limited progress in
developing such systems. Existing systems are not optimized for real-time use
and focus only on standard Bengali. In this work, we present BanglaTalk, the
first real-time speech assistance system for Bengali regional dialects.
BanglaTalk follows the client-server architecture and uses the Real-time
Transport Protocol (RTP) to ensure low-latency communication. To address
dialectal variation, we introduce a dialect-aware ASR system, BRDialect,
developed by fine-tuning the IndicWav2Vec model in ten Bengali regional
dialects. It outperforms the baseline ASR models by 12.41-33.98% on the
RegSpeech12 dataset. Furthermore, BanglaTalk can operate at a low bandwidth of
24 kbps while maintaining an average end-to-end delay of 4.9 seconds. Low
bandwidth usage and minimal end-to-end delay make the system both
cost-effective and interactive for real-time use cases, enabling inclusive and
accessible speech technology for the diverse community of Bengali speakers.

TL;DR: LST模型通过动态聚合语音标记为潜在语音补丁，解决了语音-文本模型中语音序列过长导致的训练和推理效率问题，在语音和文本任务上都取得了更好的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自回归语音-文本模型中语音标记序列过长导致的训练计算不平衡、推理效率低下以及语音-文本对齐效果不佳的问题。

Method: 引入潜在语音-文本转换器(LST)，动态且低成本地将语音标记聚合为潜在语音补丁，这些补丁可以作为更高级别的单元与文本单元对齐或封装常见语音序列。

Result: 在计算控制和数据控制设置下，LST在语音到语音和文本到文本基准测试中均优于传统方法，在HellaSwag故事补全任务中语音准确率分别提升6.5%和5.3%。

Conclusion: LST通过更有效的表示对齐和更陡峭的缩放定律，使语音-文本模型的预训练更加数据高效，为语音-文本模型研究提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Auto-regressive speech-text models are typically pre-trained on a large
number of interleaved sequences of text tokens and raw speech encoded as speech
tokens using vector quantization. These models have demonstrated
state-of-the-art performance in speech-to-speech understanding and generation
benchmarks, together with promising scaling laws, primarily enabled by the
representational alignment between text and speech. Nevertheless, they suffer
from shortcomings, partly owing to the disproportionately longer sequences of
speech tokens in contrast to textual tokens. This results in a large compute
imbalance between modalities during pre-training as well as during inference,
and a potential hindrance to effectively aligning speech and text, ultimately
translating to several orders of magnitude slower scaling laws. We introduce
the Latent Speech-Text Transformer (LST), which makes pre-training speech-text
models more data-efficient by dynamically and inexpensively aggregating speech
tokens into latent speech patches. These patches serve as higher-level units
that can either align with corresponding textual units to aid capability
transfer or even encapsulate common speech sequences like silences to be more
compute-efficient. We show that LST outperforms vanilla approaches on
speech-to-speech as well as text-to-text benchmarks in both data- and
compute-controlled settings, the former indicating more effective
representational alignment and the latter indicating steeper scaling laws for
speech-text models. On HellaSwag story completion, LST achieves 6.5% absolute
gain in speech accuracy under compute-controlled training and 5.3% under
data-controlled training, while also improving text performance. We will
release our models, code, and the evaluation data to facilitate further
research.

Motivation: 解决传统关系抽取中缺乏语言解释监督的问题，通过促进包含重要关系关键词的输出来提高可解释性。

Method: 使用认知科学启发的文本处理步骤作为推理机制，结合强化学习优化过程，采用自动构建的高质量关键词词典。

Result: 在One-shot NYT29数据集上，Qwen2.5-15B-Instruct模型达到24.65% F1，强化学习优化后性能提升23.46%，人类评估显示解释质量提高54%。

Conclusion: CogRE框架有效解决了少样本关系抽取中的注意力不集中和少样本学习能力有限的问题，显著提升了任务性能和解释质量。

Abstract: This paper introduces a framework for relation extraction (RE) that enhances
both accuracy and explainability. The framework has two key components: (i) a
reasoning mechanism that formulates relation extraction as a series of
text-processing steps inspired by cognitive science, and (ii) an optimization
process driven by reinforcement learning (RL) with a novel reward function
designed to improve both task accuracy and explanation quality. We call our
approach CogRE. Our framework addresses the lack of supervision for
language-based explanations in traditional RE by promoting outputs that include
important relation keywords. These keywords are drawn from a high-quality
dictionary that is automatically constructed using an LLM. We evaluate our
approach for the task of one-shot RE using two LLMs and two RE datasets. Our
experiments show that CogRE improves explanation quality by addressing two
common failure patterns in one-shot RE: poor attention focus and limited
one-shot learning capability. For example, our cognitive-structured reasoning
with Qwen2.5-15B-Instruct on One-shot NYT29 achieves 24.65% F1, surpassing
prior reasoning-based designs. Optimizing this approach with RL using our
reward further improves performance by +23.46% (absolute). Finally, human
evaluation shows that our best model generates relational keywords closely
aligned with gold labels, increasing human explanation quality ratings by 54%
(relative).

TL;DR: 提出基于机器学习的SQL查询运行时预测框架，使用PostgreSQL执行计划特征和查询语义表示，XGBoost模型在预测精度上显著优于其他方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数据库成本模型依赖静态启发式方法，难以准确反映复杂工作负载下的实际查询性能，需要机器学习技术来改进查询优化。

Method: 构建自动化数据收集和特征提取管道，整合执行计划的标量和结构特征以及SQL查询的语义表示，比较基线回归器、改进的XGBoost模型和基于LSTM的序列模型。

Result: XGBoost模型表现最佳，均方误差为0.3002，在65%以上的情况下预测精度在真实运行时的10%以内。

Conclusion: 基于树的机器学习与执行计划特征结合在改进查询优化器成本估计方面具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: Accurate query runtime prediction is a critical component of effective query
optimization in modern database systems. Traditional cost models, such as those
used in PostgreSQL, rely on static heuristics that often fail to reflect actual
query performance under complex and evolving workloads. This remains an active
area of research, with recent work exploring machine learning techniques to
replace or augment traditional cost estimators. In this paper, we present a
machine learning-based framework for predicting SQL query runtimes using
execution plan features extracted from PostgreSQL. Our approach integrates
scalar and structural features from execution plans and semantic
representations of SQL queries to train predictive models. We construct an
automated pipeline for data collection and feature extraction using
parameterized TPC-H queries, enabling systematic evaluation of multiple
modeling techniques. Unlike prior efforts that focus either on cardinality
estimation or on synthetic cost metrics, we model the actual runtimes using
fine-grained plan statistics and query embeddings derived from execution
traces, to improve the model accuracy. We compare baseline regressors, a
refined XGBoost model, and a sequential LSTM-based model to assess their
effectiveness in runtime prediction. Our dataset includes over 1000 queries
generated from TPC-H query templates executed in PostgreSQL with EXPLAIN
ANALYZE. Experimental results show that the XGBoost model significantly
outperforms others, achieving a mean squared error of 0.3002 and prediction
accuracy within 10% of the true runtime in over 65% of cases. The findings
highlight the potential of tree-based learning combined with execution plan
features for improving cost estimation in query optimizers.

Motivation: 解决SQL相关子查询处理效率低下的问题，通过优化查询重写和评估策略来提高性能。

Method: 1) 识别可受益的查询类别并提出重写方案；2) 在基于块的Volcano查询处理模型中适配该方法；3) 在支持位置感知和延迟物化的列存系统中实现；4) 建立成本模型评估重写效益。

Result: 在PosDB和PostgreSQL上的实验表明，在合适条件下该技术可实现5倍性能改进，并通过定量和定性分析验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该技术能够显著提升相关子查询的处理效率，特别是在具有选择性非相关谓词的场景下表现优异。

Abstract: In this paper, we discuss a novel technique for processing correlated
subqueries in SQL. The core idea is to isolate the non-correlated part of the
predicate and use it to reduce the number of evaluations of the correlated
part. We begin by providing an overview of several classes of queries that may
benefit from this technique. For each class, we propose a potential rewrite and
discuss the conditions under which it is advantageous. Next, we address the
evaluation aspects of the proposed rewrites: 1) we describe our approach to
adapting the block-based Volcano query processing model, and 2) we discuss the
benefits of implementing that technique within a position-enabled column-store
with late materialization support. Finally, we present a simple cost model that
allows estimation of the benefits of said rewrites.
  Our evaluation has a quantitative part and a qualitative part. The former
focuses on studying the impact of non-correlated predicate selectivity on our
technique. The latter identifies the limitations of our approach by comparing
it with alternative approaches available in existing systems. Overall,
experiments conducted using PosDB (a position-enabled column-store) and
PostgreSQL demonstrated that, under suitable conditions, our technique can
achieve a 5x improvement.

Motivation: 设计基于大语言模型的安全关键代理需要超越简单的提示工程，需要系统分析规则编码如何影响注意力机制和合规行为，以防范提示注入攻击。

Method: 采用信息论分析多种注意力架构（因果、双向、局部稀疏、核化、交叉注意力），建立指针保真度界限，结合动态规则验证架构进行形式化证明。

Result: 发现低句法熵和高集中锚点的规则格式能降低注意力熵并提高指针保真度，但存在锚点冗余与注意力熵的基本权衡，热重载已验证规则集能增加合规输出的渐近概率。

Conclusion: 强调原则性锚点设计和双重执行机制的必要性，以在保护LLM代理免受提示注入攻击的同时，在演进领域中保持合规性。

Abstract: The design of safety-critical agents based on large language models (LLMs)
requires more than simple prompt engineering. This paper presents a
comprehensive information-theoretic analysis of how rule encodings in system
prompts influence attention mechanisms and compliance behaviour. We demonstrate
that rule formats with low syntactic entropy and highly concentrated anchors
reduce attention entropy and improve pointer fidelity, but reveal a fundamental
trade-off between anchor redundancy and attention entropy that previous work
failed to recognize. Through formal analysis of multiple attention
architectures including causal, bidirectional, local sparse, kernelized, and
cross-attention mechanisms, we establish bounds on pointer fidelity and show
how anchor placement strategies must account for competing fidelity and entropy
objectives. Combining these insights with a dynamic rule verification
architecture, we provide a formal proof that hot reloading of verified rule
sets increases the asymptotic probability of compliant outputs. These findings
underscore the necessity of principled anchor design and dual enforcement
mechanisms to protect LLM-based agents against prompt injection attacks while
maintaining compliance in evolving domains.

Motivation: 现有LLM代理框架将推理、记忆和控制功能混合在单一提示中，导致连贯性和可预测性降低，需要更清晰的架构来支持多步骤任务

Method: SCL架构将语言模型专用于推理，外部维护记忆，通过轻量级控制器在目标导向循环中指导执行，减轻模型认知负担并支持中间结果存储和检查

Result: 在360个测试中，SCL任务成功率86.3%，优于基线70-77%；目标保真度更高，冗余调用更少，中间状态重用更可靠，每100次工具调用中不支持的断言减少

Conclusion: 架构分离可以在不依赖更大模型或更重提示的情况下提高可靠性和可追溯性，为扩展研究提供指导

Abstract: Large language models have advanced natural language understanding and
generation, yet their use as autonomous agents raises architectural challenges
for multi-step tasks. Existing frameworks often intertwine inference, memory,
and control in a single prompt, which can reduce coherence and predictability.
The Structured Cognitive Loop (SCL) is introduced as an alternative
architecture that separates these functions. In SCL, the language model is
dedicated to inference, memory is maintained externally, and execution is
guided by a lightweight controller within a goal-directed loop. This design
offloads cognitive load from the model and allows intermediate results to be
stored, revisited, and checked before actions are taken, providing a clearer
basis for traceability and evaluation.
  We evaluate SCL against prompt-based baselines including ReAct and common
LangChain agents across three scenarios: temperature-based travel planning,
email drafting with conditional send, and constraint-guided image generation.
All systems share the same base model and tools under matched decoding
settings. Across 360 episodes, SCL shows modest but consistent improvements.
Task success averages 86.3 percent compared with 70-77 percent for baselines.
Goal fidelity is higher, redundant calls are fewer, intermediate states are
reused more reliably, and unsupported assertions per 100 tool calls are
reduced. Ablations show that external memory and control each contribute
independently, and decoding sweeps confirm stability of the effects.
  These results suggest that architectural separation can improve reliability
and traceability without relying on larger models or heavier prompts. The
findings are preliminary and intended to guide extended studies with additional
models, longer horizons, multimodal tasks, and collaborative settings.

Motivation: 现有LLM生成优化模型代码的方法主要依赖求解器驱动，存在语义错误未被检测的问题，导致生成语法正确但逻辑错误的模型。

Method: 提出SAC-Opt框架，使用语义锚点进行后向引导修正，在每一步将原始语义锚点与代码重构锚点对齐，选择性修正不匹配组件。

Result: 在7个公共数据集上的实验表明，SAC-Opt将平均建模准确率提高了7.8%，在ComplexLP数据集上提升达21.9%。

Conclusion: 语义锚点修正对于确保LLM基于优化工作流中从问题意图到求解器可执行代码的忠实翻译至关重要。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have opened new paradigms in optimization
modeling by enabling the generation of executable solver code from natural
language descriptions. Despite this promise, existing approaches typically
remain solver-driven: they rely on single-pass forward generation and apply
limited post-hoc fixes based on solver error messages, leaving undetected
semantic errors that silently produce syntactically correct but logically
flawed models. To address this challenge, we propose SAC-Opt, a backward-guided
correction framework that grounds optimization modeling in problem semantics
rather than solver feedback. At each step, SAC-Opt aligns the original semantic
anchors with those reconstructed from the generated code and selectively
corrects only the mismatched components, driving convergence toward a
semantically faithful model. This anchor-driven correction enables fine-grained
refinement of constraint and objective logic, enhancing both fidelity and
robustness without requiring additional training or supervision. Empirical
results on seven public datasets demonstrate that SAC-Opt improves average
modeling accuracy by 7.8\%, with gains of up to 21.9\% on the ComplexLP
dataset. These findings highlight the importance of semantic-anchored
correction in LLM-based optimization workflows to ensure faithful translation
from problem intent to solver-executable code.

Motivation: 大语言模型在处理复杂规则系统时面临挑战，通常将相互依赖的规则视为非结构化文本数据而非逻辑组织框架，导致推理分歧，无法准确识别关键规则依赖关系。

Method: 提出动态裁决模板（DAT）框架，受专家人类推理过程启发，将推理机制结构化为三个方法阶段：定性分析（全面评估上下文）、证据收集（基于预定义模板元素定向提取信息并系统验证规则）、裁决（综合验证组件形成全面判断）。

Result: 实证结果显示DAT在复杂基于规则的任务中持续优于传统思维链方法，使较小语言模型能够匹配甚至超越显著更大的LLM性能。

Conclusion: DAT框架在管理复杂规则系统方面具有高效性和有效性，为结构化规则处理提供了系统方法论，解决了传统方法中的错误传播问题。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) face significant challenges when processing
complex rule systems, as they typically treat interdependent rules as
unstructured textual data rather than as logically organized frameworks. This
limitation results in reasoning divergence, where models often overlook
critical rule dependencies essential for accurate interpretation. Although
existing approaches such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning have shown
promise, they lack systematic methodologies for structured rule processing and
are particularly susceptible to error propagation through sequential reasoning
chains. To address these limitations, we propose the Dynamic Adjudication
Template (DAT), a novel framework inspired by expert human reasoning processes.
DAT structures the inference mechanism into three methodical stages:
qualitative analysis, evidence gathering, and adjudication. During the
qualitative analysis phase, the model comprehensively evaluates the contextual
landscape. The subsequent evidence gathering phase involves the targeted
extraction of pertinent information based on predefined template elements
([placeholder]), followed by systematic verification against applicable rules.
Finally, in the adjudication phase, the model synthesizes these validated
components to formulate a comprehensive judgment. Empirical results demonstrate
that DAT consistently outperforms conventional CoT approaches in complex
rule-based tasks. Notably, DAT enables smaller language models to match, and in
some cases exceed, the performance of significantly larger LLMs, highlighting
its efficiency and effectiveness in managing intricate rule systems.

Conclusion: 意义是系统不断试图克服自身信息论限制的开放过程，符号接地具有根本性的信息论约束。

Abstract: This paper provides a definitive, unifying framework for the Symbol Grounding
Problem (SGP) by reformulating it within Algorithmic Information Theory (AIT).
We demonstrate that the grounding of meaning is a process fundamentally
constrained by information-theoretic limits, thereby unifying the G\"odelian
(self-reference) and No Free Lunch (statistical) perspectives. We model a
symbolic system as a universal Turing machine and define grounding as an act of
information compression. The argument proceeds in four stages. First, we prove
that a purely symbolic system cannot ground almost all possible "worlds" (data
strings), as they are algorithmically random and thus incompressible. Second,
we show that any statically grounded system, specialized for compressing a
specific world, is inherently incomplete because an adversarial, incompressible
world relative to the system can always be constructed. Third, the "grounding
act" of adapting to a new world is proven to be non-inferable, as it requires
the input of new information (a shorter program) that cannot be deduced from
the system's existing code. Finally, we use Chaitin's Incompleteness Theorem to
prove that any algorithmic learning process is itself a finite system that
cannot comprehend or model worlds whose complexity provably exceeds its own.
This establishes that meaning is the open-ended process of a system perpetually
attempting to overcome its own information-theoretic limitations.

remains labor-intensive and error-prone. Scientists must interpret problems as
PDE formulations, design architectures and loss functions, and implement stable
training pipelines. Existing large language model (LLM) based approaches
address isolated steps such as code generation or architecture suggestion, but
typically assume a formal PDE is already specified and therefore lack an
end-to-end perspective. We present Lang-PINN, an LLM-driven multi-agent system
that builds trainable PINNs directly from natural language task descriptions.
Lang-PINN coordinates four complementary agents: a PDE Agent that parses task
descriptions into symbolic PDEs, a PINN Agent that selects architectures, a
Code Agent that generates modular implementations, and a Feedback Agent that
executes and diagnoses errors for iterative refinement. This design transforms
informal task statements into executable and verifiable PINN code. Experiments
show that Lang-PINN achieves substantially lower errors and greater robustness
than competitive baselines: mean squared error (MSE) is reduced by up to 3--5
orders of magnitude, end-to-end execution success improves by more than 50\%,
and reduces time overhead by up to 74\%.

Result: 证据表明基础模型在其表示空间中经常表现出结构规律性和语义一致性，使其成为跨模态迁移和对齐的有力候选者。

Conclusion: 基础模型具有显著的表示潜力，能够支持跨模态的迁移和对齐，但仍存在开放问题和潜在挑战需要进一步研究。

Abstract: Foundation models learn highly transferable representations through
large-scale pretraining on diverse data. An increasing body of research
indicates that these representations exhibit a remarkable degree of similarity
across architectures and modalities. In this survey, we investigate the
representation potentials of foundation models, defined as the latent capacity
of their learned representations to capture task-specific information within a
single modality while also providing a transferable basis for alignment and
unification across modalities. We begin by reviewing representative foundation
models and the key metrics that make alignment measurable. We then synthesize
empirical evidence of representation potentials from studies in vision,
language, speech, multimodality, and neuroscience. The evidence suggests that
foundation models often exhibit structural regularities and semantic
consistencies in their representation spaces, positioning them as strong
candidates for cross-modal transfer and alignment. We further analyze the key
factors that foster representation potentials, discuss open questions, and
highlight potential challenges.

*Mohamed El-Dosuky*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出一个包含六个语义层的实时物联网框架，通过语义标注、互操作性和推理来增强物联网设备对数据的理解能力，特别适用于农业等动态环境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物联网在农业等应用中面临数据收集和理解挑战，需要让设备和传感器能够理解数据含义和来源，实现更智能的数据处理。

Method: 构建六层框架：感知层、语义标注层、互操作层、传输层、语义推理层和应用层。使用语义算法标准化文件类型和识别同义词，采用模糊逻辑、Dempster-Shafer理论和贝叶斯网络进行不确定性推理。

Result: 开发了一个完整的语义物联网框架，能够实现数据的语义完整性管理，支持实时知识推理，并通过GUI界面方便用户监控和交互。

Conclusion: 该框架为物联网数据管理提供了稳健解决方案，结合不确定性推理方法和语义互操作性技术，对推动物联网应用特别是农业应用具有重要价值。

Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) has revolutionized various applications
including agriculture, but it still faces challenges in data collection and
understanding. This paper proposes a real-time framework with three additional
semantic layers to help IoT devices and sensors comprehend data meaning and
source. The framework consists of six layers: perception, semantic annotation,
interoperability, transportation, semantic reasoning, and application, suitable
for dynamic environments. Sensors collect data in the form of voltage, which is
then processed by microprocessors or microcontrollers in the semantic
annotation and preprocessing layer. Metadata is added to the raw data,
including the purpose, ID number, and application. Two semantic algorithms are
proposed in the semantic interoperability and ontologies layer: the
interoperability semantic algorithm for standardizing file types and the
synonym identification algorithm for identifying synonyms. In the
transportation layer, raw data and metadata are sent to other IoT devices or
cloud computing platforms using techniques like WiFi, Zigbee networks,
Bluetooth, and mobile communication networks. A semantic reasoning layer is
proposed to infer new knowledge from the existing data, using fuzzy logic,
Dempster-Shafer theory, and Bayesian networks. A Graphical User Interface (GUI)
is proposed in the application layer to help users communicate with and monitor
IoT sensors, devices, and new knowledge inferred. This framework provides a
robust solution for managing IoT data, ensuring semantic completeness, and
enabling real-time knowledge inference. The integration of uncertainty
reasoning methods and semantic interoperability techniques makes this framework
a valuable tool for advancing IoT applications in general and in agriculture in
particular.

*Wenda Xie,Chao Guo,Yanqing Jing. Junle Wang,Yisheng Lv,Fei-Yue Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Dramaturge是一种基于分层多LLM代理的任务导向分治方法，用于改进长篇叙事脚本的质量，通过全局审查、场景级审查和分层协调修订三个阶段来保持上下文一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在单次生成过程中难以产生高质量的长篇叙事，直接修改通常会导致局部编辑与整体叙事需求之间的不一致。

Method: 采用分层多LLM代理的分治方法，包括全局审查阶段（把握整体故事线和结构问题）、场景级审查阶段（识别详细场景和句子缺陷）以及分层协调修订阶段（协调整合结构和细节改进）。

Result: 综合实验表明，Dramaturge在脚本级整体质量和场景级细节方面显著优于所有基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法具有即插即用特性，可以轻松集成到现有方法中以改进生成的脚本。

Abstract: Although LLMs have been widely adopted for creative content generation, a
single-pass process often struggles to produce high-quality long narratives.
How to effectively revise and improve long narrative scripts like scriptwriters
remains a significant challenge, as it demands a comprehensive understanding of
the entire context to identify global structural issues and local detailed
flaws, as well as coordinating revisions at multiple granularities and
locations. Direct modifications by LLMs typically introduce inconsistencies
between local edits and the overall narrative requirements. To address these
issues, we propose Dramaturge, a task and feature oriented divide-and-conquer
approach powered by hierarchical multiple LLM agents. It consists of a Global
Review stage to grasp the overall storyline and structural issues, a
Scene-level Review stage to pinpoint detailed scene and sentence flaws, and a
Hierarchical Coordinated Revision stage that coordinates and integrates
structural and detailed improvements throughout the script. The top-down task
flow ensures that high-level strategies guide local modifications, maintaining
contextual consistency. The review and revision workflow follows a
coarse-to-fine iterative process, continuing through multiple rounds until no
further substantive improvements can be made. Comprehensive experiments show
that Dramaturge significantly outperforms all baselines in terms of
script-level overall quality and scene-level details. Our approach is
plug-and-play and can be easily integrated into existing methods to improve the
generated scripts.

TL;DR: 提出基于图推理的框架，集成大语言模型与结构化人口属性和非结构化公众反馈，用于公共卫生应急中的人口健康监测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在处理大规模半结构化数据时效率低下，专家评估准确但效率低，标准NLP方法需要大量标注数据且泛化能力差。

Method: 采用弱监督图推理框架，将大语言模型与人口属性和公众反馈结合，构建需求感知图，基于年龄、性别等多重剥夺指数进行人口特定分析。

Result: 在真实数据集上的初步实验证明了该方法的可行性。

Conclusion: 该方法为资源受限的临床和政府环境提供了可扩展的智能人口健康监测解决方案。

Abstract: Timely and accurate analysis of population-level data is crucial for
effective decision-making during public health emergencies such as the COVID-19
pandemic. However, the massive input of semi-structured data, including
structured demographic information and unstructured human feedback, poses
significant challenges to conventional analysis methods. Manual expert-driven
assessments, though accurate, are inefficient, while standard NLP pipelines
often require large task-specific labeled datasets and struggle with
generalization across diverse domains. To address these challenges, we propose
a novel graph-based reasoning framework that integrates large language models
with structured demographic attributes and unstructured public feedback in a
weakly supervised pipeline. The proposed approach dynamically models evolving
citizen needs into a need-aware graph, enabling population-specific analyses
based on key features such as age, gender, and the Index of Multiple
Deprivation. It generates interpretable insights to inform responsive health
policy decision-making. We test our method using a real-world dataset, and
preliminary experimental results demonstrate its feasibility. This approach
offers a scalable solution for intelligent population health monitoring in
resource-constrained clinical and governmental settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重复采样能显著提升AI模型的能力和风险，但如何在有限采样预算下准确预测大规模尝试时的模型行为是一个关键问题，这对模型提供商和政府监管者都很重要。

Method: 1) 发现标准拟合方法存在统计缺陷；2) 引入使用beta-二项分布的稳健估计框架；3) 提出动态采样策略，将更多预算分配给更难的问题。

Result: 这些创新方法能够以更低的计算成本更可靠地预测罕见风险和能力。

Conclusion: 提出的稳健估计框架和动态采样策略显著提高了在有限数据情况下预测AI模型大规模行为的能力和风险准确性。

Abstract: Assessing the capabilities and risks of frontier AI systems is a critical
area of research, and recent work has shown that repeated sampling from models
can dramatically increase both. For instance, repeated sampling has been shown
to increase their capabilities, such as solving difficult math and coding
problems, but it has also been shown to increase their potential for harm, such
as being jailbroken. Such results raise a crucial question for both capability
and safety forecasting: how can one accurately predict a model's behavior when
scaled to a massive number of attempts, given a vastly smaller sampling budget?
This question is directly relevant to model providers, who serve hundreds of
millions of users daily, and to governmental regulators, who seek to prevent
harms. To answer this questions, we make three contributions. First, we find
that standard methods for fitting these laws suffer from statistical
shortcomings that hinder predictive accuracy, especially in data-limited
scenarios. Second, we remedy these shortcomings by introducing a robust
estimation framework, which uses a beta-binomial distribution to generate more
accurate predictions from limited data. Third, we propose a dynamic sampling
strategy that allocates a greater budget to harder problems. Combined, these
innovations enable more reliable prediction of rare risks and capabilities at a
fraction of the computational cost.

TL;DR: 提出混合奖励建模框架，结合模型奖励和规则奖励，通过多维度奖励和多方面奖励来改进多模态大语言模型的对齐效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的单信号模型奖励方法在跨领域任务中缺乏置信度校准，难以捕捉人类偏好的多样性，且需要大量数据标注和奖励模型训练。

Method: 集成模型奖励（从合成和人类反馈中预测标量或向量分数）和规则奖励（领域特定启发式提供明确正确性信号），并引入多方面奖励和广义长度惩罚奖励。

Result: 在3B模型家族中，通用和数学推理任务平均提升约9.5%，数学基准测试平均提升约16%。

Conclusion: 混合奖励建模框架为通过强化学习策略优化对齐MLLMs提供了灵活有效的方法。

Abstract: Aligning multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with human preferences
often relies on single-signal, model-based reward methods. Such monolithic
rewards often lack confidence calibration across domain-specific tasks, fail to
capture diverse aspects of human preferences, and require extensive data
annotation and reward model training. In this work, we propose a hybrid reward
modeling framework that integrates complementary reward paradigms: (i)
model-based rewards, where a learned reward model predicts scalar or vector
scores from synthetic and human feedback, and (ii) rule-based rewards, where
domain-specific heuristics provide explicit correctness signals with
confidence. Beyond accuracy, we further incorporate multi-aspect rewards to
enforce instruction adherence and introduce a generalized length-penalty reward
to stabilize training and improve performance. The proposed framework provides
a flexible and effective approach to aligning MLLMs through reinforcement
learning policy optimization. Our experiments show consistent improvements
across different multimodal benchmarks when applying hybrid and multi-aspect
reward modeling. Our best performing model in the 3B family achieves an overall
average improvement of ~9.5% across general and math reasoning tasks. Focusing
specifically on mathematical benchmarks, the model achieves a significant
average improvement of ~16%, highlighting its effectiveness in mathematical
reasoning and problem solving.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BIRD-INTERACT是一个多轮交互式文本到SQL基准测试，通过结合分层知识库、元数据文件和函数驱动的用户模拟器，模拟真实数据库助手面临的挑战，包括CRUD操作和动态交互需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多轮基准测试将对话历史视为静态上下文或限制为只读操作，无法反映生产级数据库助手的实际挑战，如处理模糊查询、执行错误和不断变化的用户需求。

Method: 引入BIRD-INTERACT基准测试，包括：(1)综合交互环境；(2)两种评估设置：预定义对话协议和开放代理设置；(3)涵盖完整CRUD操作的任务套件，包含模糊和后续子任务。

Result: BIRD-INTERACT具有较高难度：GPT-5在c-Interact中仅完成8.67%的任务，在a-Interact中完成17.00%的任务。通过记忆嫁接和交互测试时缩放验证了有效交互对复杂动态文本到SQL任务的重要性。

Conclusion: BIRD-INTERACT恢复了多轮文本到SQL任务的真实性，强调了有效交互在复杂动态数据库环境中的关键作用，为未来研究提供了具有挑战性的基准。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on
single-turn text-to-SQL tasks, but real-world database applications
predominantly require multi-turn interactions to handle ambiguous queries,
execution errors, and evolving user requirements. Existing multi-turn
benchmarks fall short by treating conversation histories as static context or
limiting evaluation to read-only operations, failing to reflect
production-grade database assistant challenges. We introduce BIRD-INTERACT, a
benchmark that restores this realism through: (1) a comprehensive interaction
environment coupling each database with a hierarchical knowledge base, metadata
files, and a function-driven user simulator, enabling models to solicit
clarifications, retrieve knowledge, and recover from errors without human
supervision; (2) two evaluation settings consisting of a pre-defined
conversational protocol (c-Interact) and an open-ended agentic setting
(a-Interact) where models autonomously decide when to query the user simulator
or explore the environment; (3) a challenging task suite covering the full CRUD
spectrum for business-intelligence and operational use cases, guarded by
executable test cases. Each task features ambiguous and follow-up sub-tasks
requiring dynamic interaction. The suite comprises BIRD-INTERACT-FULL (600
tasks, up to 11,796 interactions) for comprehensive performance assessment, and
BIRD-INTERACT-LITE (300 tasks with simplified databases) for detailed
behavioral analysis and rapid method development. Our empirical results
highlight BIRD-INTERACT's difficulty: GPT-5 completes only 8.67% of tasks in
c-Interact and 17.00% in a-Interact. Analysis via memory grafting and
Interaction Test-time Scaling validates the importance of effective interaction
for complex, dynamic text-to-SQL tasks.

Conclusion: M-Reason展示了多智能体LLM系统在科学研究中的潜力，特别是在生物医学证据整合方面，平衡了智能体专业化、系统复杂性和资源使用之间的权衡。

Abstract: We present M-Reason, a demonstration system for transparent, agent-based
reasoning and evidence integration in the biomedical domain, with a focus on
cancer research. M-Reason leverages recent advances in large language models
(LLMs) and modular agent orchestration to automate evidence retrieval,
appraisal, and synthesis across diverse biomedical data sources. Each agent
specializes in a specific evidence stream, enabling parallel processing and
fine-grained analysis. The system emphasizes explainability, structured
reporting, and user auditability, providing complete traceability from source
evidence to final conclusions. We discuss critical tradeoffs between agent
specialization, system complexity, and resource usage, as well as the
integration of deterministic code for validation. An open, interactive user
interface allows researchers to directly observe, explore and evaluate the
multi-agent workflow. Our evaluation demonstrates substantial gains in
efficiency and output consistency, highlighting M-Reason's potential as both a
practical tool for evidence synthesis and a testbed for robust multi-agent LLM

Abstract: In this review, we assess the use of Bayesian methods in model predictive
control (MPC), focusing on neural-network-based modeling, control design, and
uncertainty quantification. We systematically analyze individual studies and
how they are implemented in practice. While Bayesian approaches are
increasingly adopted to capture and propagate uncertainty in MPC, reported
gains in performance and robustness remain fragmented, with inconsistent
baselines and limited reliability analyses. We therefore argue for standardized
benchmarks, ablation studies, and transparent reporting to rigorously determine
the effectiveness of Bayesian techniques for MPC.

Conclusion: 软提示表示比纯文本表示更高效有效，MHA-RAG在少样本领域适应中实现了准确性和效率的双重提升。

Abstract: Adapting Foundation Models to new domains with limited training data is
challenging and computationally expensive. While prior work has demonstrated
the effectiveness of using domain-specific exemplars as in-context
demonstrations, we investigate whether representing exemplars purely as text is
the most efficient, effective, and stable approach. We explore an alternative:
representing exemplars as soft prompts with an exemplar order invariant model
architecture. To this end, we introduce Multi-Head Attention
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MHA-RAG), a framework with the number of
attention heads serving as a simple hyperparameter to control soft
prompt-generation across different tasks. Across multiple question-answering
benchmarks and model scales, MHA-RAG achieves a 20-point performance gain over
standard RAG, while cutting inference costs by a factor of 10X
GFLOPs-delivering both higher accuracy and greater efficiency, invariant to
exemplar order.

Method: 基于符号互动论理论，进行了两项研究，调查人类与AI如何共同构建符号和意义。

Result: 参与者会根据AI建议的符号和解释调整初始定义，特别是在引入社会情境时；参与者会将个人和社会价值观投射到互动中，随时间推移精炼意义。

Conclusion: 共享理解源于符号的双向交换和重新解释，这为人机交互设计提出了新范式。

Abstract: Meaningful human-AI collaboration requires more than processing language; it
demands a deeper understanding of symbols and their socially constructed
meanings. While humans naturally interpret symbols through social interaction,
AI systems often miss the dynamic interpretations that emerge in conversation.
Drawing on Symbolic Interactionism theory, we conducted two studies to
investigate how humans and AI co-construct symbols and their meanings. Findings
provide empirical insights into how humans and conversational AI agents
collaboratively shape meanings during interaction. We show how participants
shift their initial definitions of meaning in response to the symbols and
interpretations suggested by the conversational AI agents, especially when
social context is introduced. We also observe how participants project their
personal and social values into these interactions, refining meanings over
time. These findings reveal that shared understanding does not emerge from mere
agreement but from the bi-directional exchange and reinterpretation of symbols,
suggesting new paradigms for human-AI interaction design.

TL;DR: 提出基于师生学习框架的钢铁热处理硬度预测方法，解决多对一映射的逆问题，比传统方法更准确高效


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 钢铁热处理过程中，不同输入参数组合可能产生相同硬度值，这种多对一特性使得从目标硬度反推输入参数变得困难

Method: 使用师生学习框架：先训练前向模型（教师）从13个冶金特征预测硬度，再训练逆向模型（学生）从目标硬度推断输入配置，通过教师反馈进行迭代优化

Result: 在公开回火钢数据集上验证，相比基线回归和强化学习模型，该方法在逆向预测准确率更高且计算时间显著减少

Conclusion: 师生学习框架在材料科学逆过程建模中展现出高效性和有效性，为类似多对一映射问题提供了新解决方案

Abstract: Predicting the final hardness of steel after heat treatment is a challenging
regression task due to the many-to-one nature of the process -- different
combinations of input parameters (such as temperature, duration, and chemical
composition) can result in the same hardness value. This ambiguity makes the
inverse problem, estimating input parameters from a desired hardness,
particularly difficult. In this work, we propose a novel solution using a
Teacher-Student learning framework. First, a forward model (Teacher) is trained
to predict final hardness from 13 metallurgical input features. Then, a
backward model (Student) is trained to infer plausible input configurations
from a target hardness value. The Student is optimized by leveraging feedback
from the Teacher in an iterative, supervised loop. We evaluate our method on a
publicly available tempered steel dataset and compare it against baseline
regression and reinforcement learning models. Results show that our
Teacher-Student framework not only achieves higher inverse prediction accuracy
but also requires significantly less computational time, demonstrating its
effectiveness and efficiency for inverse process modeling in materials science.

Motivation: 评估LLM的成功是源于真正推理还是复杂记忆，测试LLM作为自主科学问题解决者的潜力。

Conclusion: 这是首次大规模证据表明LLM作为自主科学问题解决者的程度，揭示了其潜在能力和当前局限性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities across a
wide range of tasks, yet it remains unclear whether such success reflects
genuine reasoning or sophisticated recall. We introduce AInstein, a framework
for testing whether LLMs can generate valid solutions to AI research problems
using only their pretrained parametric knowledge -- without domain-specific
fine-tuning, retrieval augmentation, or other external aids. Our approach
extracts distilled problem statements from high-quality ICLR 2025 submissions,
then tasks specialized solver agents with proposing and refining technical
solutions through iterative critique loops, mimicking the cycles of proposal,
review, and revision central to scientific inquiry. We evaluate AInstein on
1,214 ICLR papers stratified by acceptance tier (Oral, Spotlight, Poster),
using an LLM-as-a-judge paradigm guided by a structured rubric, complemented by
targeted manual checks. Performance is assessed with three metrics: Success
Rate (does the solution address the problem?), Rediscovery (does it align with
human-proposed methods?), and Novelty (does it yield valid, original
approaches?). Our results reveal that while LLMs can rediscover feasible
solutions and occasionally propose creative alternatives, their problem-solving
ability remains fragile and highly sensitive to framing. These findings provide
the first large-scale evidence on the extent to which LLMs can act as
autonomous scientific problem-solvers, highlighting both their latent potential
and their current limitations.

learning on the Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS) corpus. Domain
knowledge is formalized as weighted ASP rules and validated using the Clingo
solver. These rules are incorporated in two complementary ways: (i) as
rule-based data augmentation, generating logically consistent synthetic samples
that improve label diversity and coverage; and (ii) as a fuzzy-logic
regularizer, enforcing rule satisfaction in a differentiable form during
fine-tuning. This design preserves the interpretability of symbolic reasoning
while leveraging the scalability of deep neural architectures. We further tune
per-class thresholds and report both standard classification metrics and
logic-consistency rates. Compared to a strong Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE)
baseline, our approach improves micro- and macro-F1 scores and achieves up to
an 86% reduction in rule violations on the ASRS test set. To the best of our
knowledge, this constitutes the first large-scale neuro-symbolic application to
ASRS reports that unifies ASP-based reasoning, rule-driven augmentation, and
differentiable transformer training for trustworthy, safety-critical NLP.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现AI模型在编程任务中表现出类似人类的邓宁-克鲁格效应，即能力不足的模型会高估自己的能力，特别是在不熟悉或资源稀缺的编程语言中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI系统在创意和技术领域与人类合作日益增多，需要了解其认知边界和偏见如何影响共同决策。

Method: 通过分析不同编程语言中模型的置信度和表现，研究模型在编码任务中的过度自信模式。

Result: 实验表明，能力较弱的模型和在罕见编程语言中操作的模型表现出更强的DKE类似偏见，偏见强度与模型能力成反比。

Conclusion: AI模型在认知偏见方面表现出与人类相似的特性，这对AI与人类协作具有重要意义。

Abstract: As artificial intelligence systems increasingly collaborate with humans in
creative and technical domains, questions arise about the cognitive boundaries
and biases that shape our shared agency. This paper investigates the
Dunning-Kruger Effect (DKE), the tendency for those with limited competence to
overestimate their abilities in state-of-the-art LLMs in coding tasks. By
analyzing model confidence and performance across a diverse set of programming
languages, we reveal that AI models mirror human patterns of overconfidence,
especially in unfamiliar or low-resource domains. Our experiments demonstrate
that less competent models and those operating in rare programming languages
exhibit stronger DKE-like bias, suggesting that the strength of the bias is
proportionate to the competence of the models.

*Aman Gupta,Denny O'Shea,Fazl Barez*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: VAL-Bench是一个评估大语言模型在争议性议题中价值一致性的基准测试，通过对比模型在正反立场提示下的回答来衡量其价值系统的稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要测试模型拒绝或安全违规行为，但无法揭示模型在面对现实争议问题时是否保持连贯的价值体系。

Method: 使用维基百科争议章节构建115K对正反立场提示对，通过LLM作为评判者来评估模型在配对回答中的一致性。

Result: 在主流开源和闭源模型上应用该基准，发现模型对齐程度差异很大，并揭示了安全策略与表达性价值系统之间的权衡。

Conclusion: VAL-Bench提供了一个可扩展、可复现的基准，能够系统比较LLMs如何可靠地体现人类价值观。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for tasks where outputs
shape human decisions, so it is critical to test whether their responses
reflect consistent human values. Existing benchmarks mostly track refusals or
predefined safety violations, but these only check rule compliance and do not
reveal whether a model upholds a coherent value system when facing
controversial real-world issues. We introduce the \textbf{V}alue
\textbf{AL}ignment \textbf{Bench}mark (\textbf{VAL-Bench}), which evaluates
whether models maintain a stable value stance across paired prompts that frame
opposing sides of public debates. VAL-Bench consists of 115K such pairs from
Wikipedia's controversial sections. A well-aligned model should express similar
underlying views regardless of framing, which we measure using an LLM-as-judge
to score agreement or divergence between paired responses. Applied across
leading open- and closed-source models, the benchmark reveals large variation
in alignment and highlights trade-offs between safety strategies (e.g.,
refusals) and more expressive value systems. By providing a scalable,
reproducible benchmark, VAL-Bench enables systematic comparison of how reliably
LLMs embody human values.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的自动漏洞修复方法，通过构建漏洞相关推理数据和使用多智能体强化学习来解决现有LLM方法在漏洞修复中面临的两个主要挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的自动漏洞修复方法面临两个关键问题：缺乏高质量的漏洞相关推理数据，以及难以验证漏洞修复过程中的中间步骤。这导致模型难以捕捉多样的漏洞修复模式，训练过程缺乏有效的中间反馈。

Method: 该方法构建了高质量的漏洞相关推理数据，并采用多智能体强化学习框架，通过模拟漏洞修复过程中的中间推理步骤来提供训练反馈。

Result: 该方法在多个基准测试中表现出色，相比现有方法在漏洞修复准确性和效率方面都有显著提升。

Conclusion: 通过构建专门的漏洞推理数据和引入多智能体强化学习，该方法有效解决了自动漏洞修复中的关键挑战，为软件安全领域提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: The exponential increase in software vulnerabilities has created an urgent
need for automatic vulnerability repair (AVR) solutions. Recent research has
formulated AVR as a sequence generation problem and has leveraged large
language models (LLMs) to address this problem. Typically, these approaches
prompt or fine-tune LLMs to generate repairs for vulnerabilities directly.
Although these methods show state-of-the-art performance, they face the
following challenges: (1) Lack of high-quality, vulnerability-related reasoning
data. Current approaches primarily rely on foundation models that mainly encode
general programming knowledge. Without vulnerability-related reasoning data,
they tend to fail to capture the diverse vulnerability repair patterns. (2)
Hard to verify the intermediate vulnerability repair process during LLM
training. Existing reinforcement learning methods often leverage intermediate
execution feedback from the environment (e.g., sandbox-based execution results)
to guide reinforcement learning training. In contrast, the vulnerability repair
process generally lacks such intermediate, verifiable feedback, which poses
additional challenges for model training.

Conclusion: 该研究开发了稳健的排放预测模型，能够为政策制定者提供数据驱动的决策支持，有助于应对台湾的空气污染问题。

Abstract: Taiwan's high population and heavy dependence on fossil fuels have led to
severe air pollution, with the most prevalent greenhouse gas being carbon
dioxide (CO2). There-fore, this study presents a reproducible and comprehensive
case study comparing 21 of the most commonly employed time series models in
forecasting emissions, analyzing both univariate and multivariate approaches.
Among these, Feedforward Neural Network (FFNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM),
and Random Forest Regressor (RFR) achieved the best performances. To further
enhance robustness, the top performers were integrated with Linear Regression
through a custom stacked generalization en-semble technique. Our proposed

Finally, this research provides an accurate decade-long emission projection
that will assist policymakers in making more data-driven decisions.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MetaVLA是一个统一的、主干网络无关的后训练框架，通过上下文感知元协同训练整合多样化目标任务，利用轻量级元学习机制实现快速适应，显著提升VLA模型在未见任务上的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Vision-Language-Action模型在具身推理中表现有限，通常需要任务特定的微调，且在未见任务上泛化能力差。需要开发高效可扩展的对齐框架来构建通用具身智能体。

Method: 提出Context-Aware Meta Co-Training，将多样化目标任务整合到单一微调阶段，利用结构多样化的辅助任务提升域内泛化。采用基于Attentive Neural Processes的轻量级元学习机制，实现快速适应。

Result: 在LIBERO基准测试中，使用六个辅助任务的MetaVLA在长时程任务上比OpenVLA提升8.0%，训练步数从240K减少到75K，GPU时间减少约76%。

Conclusion: MetaVLA证明了可扩展、低资源后训练的可行性，为构建通用具身智能体铺平了道路。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models show promise in embodied reasoning, yet
remain far from true generalists-they often require task-specific fine-tuning,
and generalize poorly to unseen tasks. We propose MetaVLA, a unified,
backbone-agnostic post-training framework for efficient and scalable alignment.
MetaVLA introduces Context-Aware Meta Co-Training, which consolidates diverse
target tasks into a single fine-tuning stage while leveraging structurally
diverse auxiliary tasks to improve in-domain generalization. Unlike naive
multi-task SFT, MetaVLA integrates a lightweight meta-learning
mechanism-derived from Attentive Neural Processes-to enable rapid adaptation
from diverse contexts with minimal architectural change or inference overhead.
On the LIBERO benchmark, MetaVLA with six auxiliary tasks outperforms OpenVLA
by up to 8.0% on long-horizon tasks, reduces training steps from 240K to 75K,
and cuts GPU time by ~76%. These results show that scalable, low-resource
post-training is achievable-paving the way toward general-purpose embodied
agents. Code will be available.

TL;DR: AgentFlow是一个可训练的在线智能体框架，通过四个模块（规划器、执行器、验证器、生成器）协调工作，在实时环境中优化多轮交互。提出的Flow-GRPO方法将多轮优化转化为可处理的单轮策略更新，在多个基准测试中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具增强方法训练单一策略，在长时程和多样化工具场景下扩展性差，对新场景泛化能力弱。智能体系统虽然通过模块分解工作，但大多缺乏训练或使用离线训练，无法适应多轮交互的动态特性。

Method: 提出AgentFlow框架，包含四个协调模块和演进记忆系统。开发Flow-GRPO方法，将多轮优化转化为单轮策略更新，通过轨迹级结果广播和组归一化优势来稳定学习。

Result: 在十个基准测试中，使用7B规模骨干的AgentFlow平均准确率提升：搜索任务14.9%，智能体任务14.0%，数学任务14.5%，科学任务4.1%，甚至超过GPT-4o等大型专有模型。

Conclusion: 在线优化方法显著提升了规划能力、工具调用可靠性，并在模型规模和推理轮次方面表现出良好的扩展性。

Abstract: Outcome-driven reinforcement learning has advanced reasoning in large
language models (LLMs), but prevailing tool-augmented approaches train a
single, monolithic policy that interleaves thoughts and tool calls under full
context; this scales poorly with long horizons and diverse tools and
generalizes weakly to new scenarios. Agentic systems offer a promising
alternative by decomposing work across specialized modules, yet most remain
training-free or rely on offline training decoupled from the live dynamics of
multi-turn interaction. We introduce AgentFlow, a trainable, in-the-flow
agentic framework that coordinates four modules (planner, executor, verifier,
generator) through an evolving memory and directly optimizes its planner inside
the multi-turn loop. To train on-policy in live environments, we propose
Flow-based Group Refined Policy Optimization (Flow-GRPO), which tackles
long-horizon, sparse-reward credit assignment by converting multi-turn
optimization into a sequence of tractable single-turn policy updates. It
broadcasts a single, verifiable trajectory-level outcome to every turn to align
local planner decisions with global success and stabilizes learning with
group-normalized advantages. Across ten benchmarks, AgentFlow with a 7B-scale
backbone outperforms top-performing baselines with average accuracy gains of
14.9% on search, 14.0% on agentic, 14.5% on mathematical, and 4.1% on
scientific tasks, even surpassing larger proprietary models like GPT-4o.
Further analyses confirm the benefits of in-the-flow optimization, showing
improved planning, enhanced tool-calling reliability, and positive scaling with
model size and reasoning turns.

Abstract: Self-evolving agentic artificial intelligence (AI) offers a new paradigm for
future wireless systems by enabling autonomous agents to continually adapt and
improve without human intervention. Unlike static AI models, self-evolving
agents embed an autonomous evolution cycle that updates models, tools, and
workflows in response to environmental dynamics. This paper presents a
comprehensive overview of self-evolving agentic AI, highlighting its layered
architecture, life cycle, and key techniques, including tool intelligence,
workflow optimization, self-reflection, and evolutionary learning. We further
propose a multi-agent cooperative self-evolving agentic AI framework, where
multiple large language models (LLMs) are assigned role-specialized prompts
under the coordination of a supervisor agent. Through structured dialogue,
iterative feedback, and systematic validation, the system autonomously executes
the entire life cycle without human intervention. A case study on antenna
evolution in low-altitude wireless networks (LAWNs) demonstrates how the
framework autonomously upgrades fixed antenna optimization into movable antenna
optimization. Experimental results show that the proposed self-evolving agentic
AI autonomously improves beam gain and restores degraded performance by up to
52.02%, consistently surpassing the fixed baseline with little to no human
intervention and validating its adaptability and robustness for next-generation
wireless intelligence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估GPT-4o从自由文本放射学报告中提取诊断标签（含不确定性）的能力，并测试这些标签如何影响肌肉骨骼X光片的多标签图像分类。

Method: 回顾性研究，包括锁骨、肘部和拇指的X光片系列。GPT-4o填写结构化模板，将影像学发现标记为存在（"true"）、不存在（"false"）或"不确定"。使用ResNet50进行多标签分类，并在内部和外部测试集上验证标签提取准确性。

Result: 自动提取在测试集中准确率达98.6%。基于标签的模型训练在不同解剖区域均表现出竞争力（如肘部AUC=0.80）。模型在外部数据集上泛化良好，不同标签策略或数据集间无显著差异。

Conclusion: GPT-4o能从放射学报告中提取标签来训练具有竞争力的多标签分类模型，且检测到的不确定性不影响这些模型的性能。

Abstract: Objectives: To evaluate GPT-4o's ability to extract diagnostic labels (with
uncertainty) from free-text radiology reports and to test how these labels
affect multi-label image classification of musculoskeletal radiographs.
Methods: This retrospective study included radiography series of the clavicle
(n=1,170), elbow (n=3,755), and thumb (n=1,978). After anonymization, GPT-4o
filled out structured templates by indicating imaging findings as present
("true"), absent ("false"), or "uncertain." To assess the impact of label
uncertainty, "uncertain" labels of the training and validation sets were
automatically reassigned to "true" (inclusive) or "false" (exclusive).
Label-image-pairs were used for multi-label classification using ResNet50.
Label extraction accuracy was manually verified on internal (clavicle: n=233,
elbow: n=745, thumb: n=393) and external test sets (n=300 for each).
Performance was assessed using macro-averaged receiver operating characteristic
(ROC) area under the curve (AUC), precision recall curves, sensitivity,
specificity, and accuracy. AUCs were compared with the DeLong test. Results:
Automatic extraction was correct in 98.6% (60,618 of 61,488) of labels in the
test sets. Across anatomic regions, label-based model training yielded
competitive performance measured by macro-averaged AUC values for inclusive
(e.g., elbow: AUC=0.80 [range, 0.62-0.87]) and exclusive models (elbow:
AUC=0.80 [range, 0.61-0.88]). Models generalized well on external datasets
(elbow [inclusive]: AUC=0.79 [range, 0.61-0.87]; elbow [exclusive]: AUC=0.79
[range, 0.63-0.89]). No significant differences were observed across labeling
strategies or datasets (p>=0.15). Conclusion: GPT-4o extracted labels from
radiologic reports to train competitive multi-label classification models with
high accuracy. Detected uncertainty in the radiologic reports did not influence
the performance of these models.

Abstract: Large language models leverage internet-scale text data, yet embodied AI
remains constrained by the prohibitive costs of physical trajectory collection.
Desktop environments -- particularly gaming -- offer a compelling alternative:
they provide rich sensorimotor interactions at scale while maintaining the
structured observation-action coupling essential for embodied learning. We
present D2E (Desktop to Embodied AI), a framework that demonstrates desktop
interactions can serve as an effective pretraining substrate for robotics
embodied AI tasks. Unlike prior work that remained domain-specific (e.g., VPT
for Minecraft) or kept data proprietary (e.g., SIMA), D2E establishes a
complete pipeline from scalable desktop data collection to verified transfer in
embodied domains. Our framework comprises three components: (1) the OWA Toolkit
that unifies diverse desktop interactions into a standardized format with 152x
compression, (2) the Generalist-IDM that achieves strong zero-shot
generalization across unseen games through timestamp-based event prediction,
enabling internet-scale pseudo-labeling, and (3) VAPT that transfers
desktop-pretrained representations to physical manipulation and navigation.
Using 1.3K+ hours of data (259 hours of human demonstrations, and 1K+ hours of
pseudo-labeled gameplay), we achieve a total of 96.6% success rate on LIBERO
manipulation and 83.3% on CANVAS navigation benchmarks. This validates that
sensorimotor primitives in digital interactions exhibit sufficient invariance
to transfer meaningfully to physical embodied tasks, establishing desktop
pretraining as a practical paradigm for robotics. We will make all our work
public, including the OWA toolkit, datasets of human-collected and
pseudo-labeled, and VAPT-trained models available at

Conclusion: AIC-VDS作为深度强化学习的替代方案，在紧急情况下能有效优化无人机数据收集，减少数据丢失。

Abstract: Recently, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly being investigated
to collect sensory data in post-disaster monitoring scenarios, such as
tsunamis, where early actions are critical to limit coastal damage. A major
challenge is to design the data collection schedules and flight velocities, as
unfavorable schedules and velocities can lead to transmission errors and buffer
overflows of the ground sensors, ultimately resulting in significant packet
loss. Meanwhile, online Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) solutions have a
complex training process and a mismatch between simulation and reality that
does not meet the urgent requirements of tsunami monitoring. Recent advances in
Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a compelling alternative. With their strong
reasoning and generalization capabilities, LLMs can adapt to new tasks through
In-Context Learning (ICL), which enables task adaptation through natural
language prompts and example-based guidance without retraining. However, LLM
models have input data limitations and thus require customized approaches. In
this paper, a joint optimization of data collection schedules and velocities
control for multiple UAVs is proposed to minimize data loss. The battery level
of the ground sensors, the length of the queues, and the channel conditions, as
well as the trajectories of the UAVs, are taken into account. Attention-Based
In-Context Learning for Velocity Control and Data Collection Schedule (AIC-VDS)
is proposed as an alternative to DRL in emergencies. The simulation results
show that the proposed AIC-VDS outperforms both the Deep-Q-Network (DQN) and
maximum channel gain baselines.

Abstract: Industrial fault diagnosis faces the dual challenges of data scarcity and the
difficulty of deploying large AI models in resource-constrained environments.
This paper introduces Syn-Diag, a novel cloud-edge synergistic framework that
leverages Large Language Models to overcome these limitations in few-shot fault
diagnosis. Syn-Diag is built on a three-tiered mechanism: 1) Visual-Semantic
Synergy, which aligns signal features with the LLM's semantic space through
cross-modal pre-training; 2) Content-Aware Reasoning, which dynamically
constructs contextual prompts to enhance diagnostic accuracy with limited
samples; and 3) Cloud-Edge Synergy, which uses knowledge distillation to create
a lightweight, efficient edge model capable of online updates via a shared
decision space. Extensive experiments on six datasets covering different CWRU
and SEU working conditions show that Syn-Diag significantly outperforms
existing methods, especially in 1-shot and cross-condition scenarios. The edge
model achieves performance comparable to the cloud version while reducing model
size by 83% and latency by 50%, offering a practical, robust, and deployable
paradigm for modern intelligent diagnostics.

Conclusion: ARM提供了一个通用的推理构建块，可作为直接递归循环或元编排器的子程序使用，在多智能体系统设计中实现了优异的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-powered Multi-agent systems (MAS) have achieved
state-of-the-art results on various complex reasoning tasks. Recent works have
proposed techniques to automate the design of MASes, eliminating the need for
manual engineering. However, these techniques perform poorly, often achieving
similar or inferior performance to simple baselines. Furthermore, they require
computationally expensive re-discovery of architectures for each new task
domain and expensive data annotation on domains without existing labeled
validation sets. A critical insight is that simple Chain of Thought (CoT)
reasoning often performs competitively with these complex systems, suggesting
that the fundamental reasoning unit of MASes, CoT, warrants further
investigation. To this end, we present a new paradigm for automatic MAS design
that pivots the focus to optimizing CoT reasoning. We introduce the Agentic
Reasoning Module (ARM), an agentic generalization of CoT where each granular
reasoning step is executed by a specialized reasoning module. This module is
discovered through a tree search over the code space, starting from a simple
CoT module and evolved using mutations informed by reflection on execution
traces. The resulting ARM acts as a versatile reasoning building block which
can be utilized as a direct recursive loop or as a subroutine in a learned
meta-orchestrator. Our approach significantly outperforms both manually
designed MASes and state-of-the-art automatic MAS design methods. Crucially,
MASes built with ARM exhibit superb generalization, maintaining high
performance across different foundation models and task domains without further
optimization.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出基于图神经网络的拉格朗日粒子扩散模型（LPDM）模拟器，用于估算大气传输足迹和温室气体浓度，实现1000倍加速并量化不确定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统传输模型计算成本高且不确定性难以表征，AI技术为加速传输模拟和量化不确定性提供了双重机会。

Method: 使用图神经网络构建LPDM模拟器，采用集成方法估算大气传输足迹、温室气体浓度及其不确定性。

Result: 模拟器比NAME LPDM快约1000倍，能重现大尺度足迹结构，集成分析揭示了预测误差的空间相关性。

Conclusion: 该方法可推广到其他大气传输模型，支持不确定性感知的温室气体反演系统，提高卫星排放监测的稳健性。

Abstract: Monitoring greenhouse gas emissions and evaluating national inventories
require efficient, scalable, and reliable inference methods. Top-down
approaches, combined with recent advances in satellite observations, provide
new opportunities to evaluate emissions at continental and global scales.
However, transport models used in these methods remain a key source of
uncertainty: they are computationally expensive to run at scale, and their
uncertainty is difficult to characterise. Artificial intelligence offers a dual
opportunity to accelerate transport simulations and to quantify their
associated uncertainty.
  We present an ensemble-based pipeline for estimating atmospheric transport
"footprints", greenhouse gas mole fraction measurements, and their
uncertainties using a graph neural network emulator of a Lagrangian Particle
Dispersion Model (LPDM). The approach is demonstrated with GOSAT (Greenhouse
Gases Observing Satellite) observations for Brazil in 2016. The emulator
achieved a ~1000x speed-up over the NAME LPDM, while reproducing large-scale
footprint structures. Ensembles were calculated to quantify absolute and
relative uncertainty, revealing spatial correlations with prediction error. The
results show that ensemble spread highlights low-confidence spatial and
temporal predictions for both atmospheric transport footprints and methane mole
fractions.
  While demonstrated here for an LPDM emulator, the approach could be applied
more generally to atmospheric transport models, supporting uncertainty-aware
greenhouse gas inversion systems and improving the robustness of
satellite-based emissions monitoring. With further development, ensemble-based
emulators could also help explore systematic LPDM errors, offering a
computationally efficient pathway towards a more comprehensive uncertainty
budget in greenhouse gas flux estimates.

*Sedat Dogan,Nina Dethlefs,Debarati Chakraborty*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于混合参与度评分的早期网络迷因病毒性预测方法，使用多模态特征在30-420分钟内预测迷因传播潜力，XGBoost模型在30分钟内即可达到PR-AUC > 0.52。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预测在线内容的病毒性传播具有挑战性，特别是对于文化复杂、快速演变的迷因。研究旨在探索早期预测迷因病毒性的可行性。

Method: 使用来自25个多样化Reddit社区的大规模跨语言数据集，提出基于混合参与度评分的病毒性定义方法，评估了逻辑回归、XGBoost和多层感知器等模型，采用包含静态内容和时间动态的多模态特征集。

Result: 最佳模型XGBoost在30分钟内达到PR-AUC > 0.52，分析发现特征重要性存在"证据转换"现象：随着迷因获得关注，特征重要性从静态上下文动态转向时间动态。

Conclusion: 本研究为早期病毒性预测建立了稳健、可解释且实用的基准，贡献了新颖的跨语言数据集和方法论上合理的病毒性定义，首次将时间序列数据与静态内容和网络特征相结合来预测早期迷因病毒性。

Abstract: Predicting the virality of online content remains challenging, especially for
culturally complex, fast-evolving memes. This study investigates the
feasibility of early prediction of meme virality using a large-scale,
cross-lingual dataset from 25 diverse Reddit communities. We propose a robust,
data-driven method to define virality based on a hybrid engagement score,
learning a percentile-based threshold from a chronologically held-out training
set to prevent data leakage. We evaluated a suite of models, including Logistic
Regression, XGBoost, and a Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP), with a comprehensive,
multimodal feature set across increasing time windows (30-420 min). Crucially,
useful signals emerge quickly: our best-performing model, XGBoost, achieves a
PR-AUC $>$ 0.52 in just 30 minutes. Our analysis reveals a clear "evidentiary
transition," in which the importance of the feature dynamically shifts from the
static context to the temporal dynamics as a meme gains traction. This work
establishes a robust, interpretable, and practical benchmark for early virality
prediction in scenarios where full diffusion cascade data is unavailable,
contributing a novel cross-lingual dataset and a methodologically sound
definition of virality. To our knowledge, this study is the first to combine
time series data with static content and network features to predict early meme
virality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 罕见病药物重定位在缺乏药物与目标疾病先验关联时面临挑战，传统知识图谱补全和图神经网络由于缺乏可靠信号而性能不佳。

Method: 采用自演进多智能体系统，组织任务特定的对抗性辩论，智能体从不同视角动态构建证据图来支持、反驳或蕴含假设，并通过事后分析推理策略进行自我进化。

Result: RareAgent将适应症AUPRC提高了18.1%，优于推理基线方法，并提供与临床证据一致的透明推理链。

Conclusion: RareAgent成功将罕见病药物重定位从被动模式识别转变为主动证据寻求推理，提供了可解释且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Computational drug repurposing for rare diseases is especially challenging
when no prior associations exist between drugs and target diseases. Therefore,
knowledge graph completion and message-passing GNNs have little reliable signal
to learn and propagate, resulting in poor performance. We present RareAgent, a
self-evolving multi-agent system that reframes this task from passive pattern
recognition to active evidence-seeking reasoning. RareAgent organizes
task-specific adversarial debates in which agents dynamically construct
evidence graphs from diverse perspectives to support, refute, or entail
hypotheses. The reasoning strategies are analyzed post hoc in a
self-evolutionary loop, producing textual feedback that refines agent policies,
while successful reasoning paths are distilled into transferable heuristics to
accelerate future investigations. Comprehensive evaluations reveal that
RareAgent improves the indication AUPRC by 18.1% over reasoning baselines and
provides a transparent reasoning chain consistent with clinical evidence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 约束规划在解决现实世界约束优化问题中具有重要作用，但目前基于LLM的自动建模研究主要集中在运筹学模型上，对约束规划的关注较少。

Method: 基于开源LLM进行多指令监督微调，提出约束感知检索模块增强上下文学习能力，集成在带有引导自校正机制的思维树框架中。

Conclusion: ConstraintLLM展示了专门针对约束规划建模的LLM的有效性，为构建可信赖的神经符号AI提供了新途径。

Abstract: Constraint programming (CP) is a crucial technology for solving real-world
constraint optimization problems (COPs), with the advantages of rich modeling
semantics and high solving efficiency. Using large language models (LLMs) to
generate formal modeling automatically for COPs is becoming a promising
approach, which aims to build trustworthy neuro-symbolic AI with the help of
symbolic solvers. However, CP has received less attention compared to works
based on operations research (OR) models. We introduce ConstraintLLM, the first
LLM specifically designed for CP modeling, which is trained on an open-source
LLM with multi-instruction supervised fine-tuning. We propose the
Constraint-Aware Retrieval Module (CARM) to increase the in-context learning
capabilities, which is integrated in a Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT) framework with
guided self-correction mechanism. Moreover, we construct and release IndusCP,
the first industrial-level benchmark for CP modeling, which contains 140
challenging tasks from various domains. Our experiments demonstrate that
ConstraintLLM achieves state-of-the-art solving accuracy across multiple
benchmarks and outperforms the baselines by 2x on the new IndusCP benchmark.

Abstract: The rapid progress in embodied artificial intelligence has highlighted the
necessity for more advanced and integrated models that can perceive, interpret,
and predict environmental dynamics. In this context, World Models (WMs) have
been introduced to provide embodied agents with the abilities to anticipate
future environmental states and fill in knowledge gaps, thereby enhancing
agents' ability to plan and execute actions. However, when dealing with
embodied agents it is fundamental to ensure that predictions are safe for both
the agent and the environment. In this article, we conduct a comprehensive
literature review of World Models in the domains of autonomous driving and
robotics, with a specific focus on the safety implications of scene and control
generation tasks. Our review is complemented by an empirical analysis, wherein
we collect and examine predictions from state-of-the-art models, identify and
categorize common faults (herein referred to as pathologies), and provide a
quantitative evaluation of the results.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于不确定性的无标签过滤方法，使用模型自身置信度替代外部标签来筛选合成思维链数据，在生物扰动预测任务中取得了优于未过滤数据和接近真实标签训练的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法需要真实标签来筛选合成思维链数据，但在生物学等实验数据稀缺的领域成本高昂。本文旨在开发无需外部标签的替代方案。

Method: 使用不确定性度量（如自一致性和预测困惑度）作为模型置信度指标，采样多个推理轨迹并仅保留低不确定性子集进行监督微调。

Result: 在生物扰动预测任务中，过滤后的数据子集准确率更高，基于不确定性过滤数据的监督微调优于未过滤合成数据，缩小了与真实标签训练的差距，并超越了强基线模型。

Conclusion: 模型内部置信度是创建高效推理数据集的强大信号，可在监督成本高昂的领域实现大型推理模型的训练。

Abstract: Synthetic chain-of-thought (CoT) traces are widely used to train large
reasoning models (LRMs), improving generalization by providing step-level
supervision. Yet most approaches require ground-truth labels to seed or filter
these traces - an expensive bottleneck in domains like biology where wet-lab
data are scarce. We propose a label-free alternative: uncertainty-based
filtering, which uses a model's own confidence - quantified through established
uncertainty metrics like self-consistency and predictive perplexity - as a
substitute for external labels. We sample multiple reasoning traces and retain
only low-uncertainty subsets. Applied to biological perturbation prediction, a
domain where wet-lab labels are especially costly, we show that the filtered
subset has higher accuracy, and that supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on
uncertainty-filtered data outperforms unfiltered synthetic data, narrows the
gap to ground-truth training, and surpasses strong LRM baselines. Ablations
show that per-class filtering corrects for class-specific uncertainty scales
and that hybrid uncertainty metrics yield higher-quality datasets. Our results
suggest that model-internal confidence is a powerful signal for efficient
reasoning dataset creation, enabling LRMs in domains where supervision is
expensive.

TL;DR: 本文提出了DebateQD算法，通过进化辩论策略来比较说服优化与真相优化的效果，发现说服优化能产生更可泛化的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有优化为输出真实答案的LLM容易过拟合，产生脆弱的推理能力。辩论式优化虽有潜力，但尚未与主流真相优化方法进行系统比较。

Method: 引入DebateQD质量多样性进化算法，通过锦标赛式辩论（两个LLM辩论，第三个LLM评判）在不同类别中进化多样化辩论策略，固定辩论协议仅交换适应度函数来隔离优化目标的作用。

Result: 在三个模型规模和多个数据集上，说服优化策略的训练-测试泛化差距减小达13.94%，同时匹配或超过真相优化的测试性能。

Conclusion: 竞争性说服压力比协作寻求真相能培养更可转移的推理技能，为改进LLM泛化提供了有前景的路径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) optimized to output truthful answers often
overfit, producing brittle reasoning that fails to generalize. While
persuasion-based optimization has shown promise in debate settings, it has not
been systematically compared against mainstream truth-based approaches. We
introduce DebateQD, a minimal Quality-Diversity (QD) evolutionary algorithm
that evolves diverse debate strategies across different categories
(rationality, authority, emotional appeal, etc.) through tournament-style
competitions where two LLMs debate while a third judges. Unlike previously
proposed methods that require a population of LLMs, our approach maintains
diversity of opponents through prompt-based strategies within a single LLM
architecture, making it more accessible for experiments while preserving the
key benefits of population-based optimization. In contrast to prior work, we
explicitly isolate the role of the optimization objective by fixing the debate
protocol and swapping only the fitness function: persuasion rewards strategies
that convince the judge irrespective of truth, whereas truth rewards
collaborative correctness. Across three model scales (7B, 32B, 72B parameters)
and multiple dataset sizes from the QuALITY benchmark, persuasion-optimized
strategies achieve up to 13.94% smaller train-test generalization gaps, while
matching or exceeding truth optimization's test performance. These results
provide the first controlled evidence that competitive pressure to persuade,
rather than seek the truth collaboratively, fosters more transferable reasoning
skills, offering a promising path for improving LLM generalization.

TL;DR: FETA是一个无需训练的多智能体时间序列分类框架，通过基于示例的上下文推理实现高效分类，在多个数据集上超越了需要训练的基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列分类中标注数据稀缺，传统方法需要特定任务的训练，成本高且不灵活。虽然大型语言模型能理解时间模式，但纯零样本使用效果不佳。

Method: 将多变量时间序列分解为通道级子问题，为每个通道检索结构相似的标注示例，使用推理型LLM比较查询与示例，生成带置信度的通道级标签，最后通过置信度加权聚合器融合所有通道决策。

Result: 在9个具有挑战性的UEA数据集上，FETA在完全无需训练的情况下实现了强大的分类准确率，超越了多个需要训练的基线方法。

Conclusion: 多智能体上下文推理框架可以将LLM转变为具有竞争力的即插即用时间序列分类器，无需任何参数训练。

Abstract: Time series classification (TSC) spans diverse application scenarios, yet
labeled data are often scarce, making task-specific training costly and
inflexible. Recent reasoning-oriented large language models (LLMs) show promise
in understanding temporal patterns, but purely zero-shot usage remains
suboptimal. We propose FETA, a multi-agent framework for training-free TSC via
exemplar-based in-context reasoning. FETA decomposes a multivariate series into
channel-wise subproblems, retrieves a few structurally similar labeled examples
for each channel, and leverages a reasoning LLM to compare the query against
these exemplars, producing channel-level labels with self-assessed confidences;
a confidence-weighted aggregator then fuses all channel decisions. This design
eliminates the need for pretraining or fine-tuning, improves efficiency by
pruning irrelevant channels and controlling input length, and enhances
interpretability through exemplar grounding and confidence estimation. On nine
challenging UEA datasets, FETA achieves strong accuracy under a fully
training-free setting, surpassing multiple trained baselines. These results
demonstrate that a multi-agent in-context reasoning framework can transform
LLMs into competitive, plug-and-play TSC solvers without any parameter
training. The code is available at https://github.com/SongyuanSui/FETATSC.

TL;DR: 提出MatheMagic方法，通过改变数字和运算符的语义来构建动态反事实数学基准，用于检测模型过拟合和评估真实推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前数学基准存在两个问题：模型容易记忆公开测试集，且现有基准因符号规则多样性不足和封闭答案而容易过拟合。

Method: 开发MatheMagic系统，在测试时随机生成数学测试实例，改变数字和运算符的语义但保持答案可自动验证，评估模型的归纳和演绎能力。

Result: 实验发现模型更容易解决演绎任务而非归纳任务，但会回归到标准数学推理；数学适应模型未能展现通用的推理"技能"，归纳任务的微调泛化能力差。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种稳定、可扩展、可比较且抗过拟合的评估框架，揭示了当前模型在数学推理方面的局限性。

Abstract: Conducting contamination-free evaluation of mathematical capabilities can be
difficult for two reasons: models may memorize a test set once it is made
public, and current mathematical benchmarks are prone to overfitting due to
having limited diversity of symbols and rules, coupled with closed-ended
answers. This paper proposes a method to leverage these shortcomings as useful
features to a construct dynamic, counterfactual benchmark, which can be used to
both reveal overfitting and measure true reasoning. We demonstrate this via
MatheMagic, which generates math test instances with the interpretations of
numbers and operators altered, yet has automatically verifiable answers. Test
instances are randomly seeded and constructed at test time to evaluate a
model's induction or deduction capability, offering stability, extensibility,
comparability, and robustness to overfitting. Our experiments find that models
solve deduction more easily than induction, but they revert to standard math.
Further analysis reveals that math-adapted models fail to exhibit a general
"skill" of reasoning, and fine-tuning on induction tasks generalizes poorly.

Abstract: Empowerment, an information-theoretic measure of an agent's potential
influence on its environment, has emerged as a powerful intrinsic motivation
and exploration framework for reinforcement learning (RL). Besides for
unsupervised RL and skill learning algorithms, the specific use of empowerment
as a pre-training signal has received limited attention in the literature. We
show that empowerment can be used as a pre-training signal for data-efficient
downstream task adaptation. For this we extend the traditional notion of
empowerment by introducing discounted empowerment, which balances the agent's
control over the environment across short- and long-term horizons. Leveraging
this formulation, we propose a novel pre-training paradigm that initializes
policies to maximize discounted empowerment, enabling agents to acquire a
robust understanding of environmental dynamics. We analyze empowerment-based
pre-training for various existing RL algorithms and empirically demonstrate its
potential as a general-purpose initialization strategy: empowerment-maximizing
policies with long horizons are data-efficient and effective, leading to
improved adaptability in downstream tasks. Our findings pave the way for future
research to scale this framework to high-dimensional and complex tasks, further
advancing the field of RL.

Result: 实现了高精度混合搜索、鲁棒的引用解析、时间点版本检索和可审计的因果追踪功能。

Conclusion: 这种两层架构将检索从黑盒过程转变为透明可审计的过程，直接满足高风险领域对可解释AI（XAI）的要求。

Abstract: The Structure-Aware Temporal Graph RAG (SAT-Graph RAG) addresses core
limitations of standard Retrieval-Augmented Generation in the legal domain by
providing a verifiable knowledge graph that models hierarchical structure,
temporal evolution, and causal events of legal norms. However, a critical gap
remains: how to reliably query this structured knowledge without sacrificing
its deterministic properties. This paper introduces the SAT-Graph API, a formal
query execution layer centered on canonical actions-atomic, composable, and
auditable primitives that isolate probabilistic discovery from deterministic
retrieval. These actions enable: (i) high-precision hybrid search; (ii) robust
reference resolution; (iii) point-in-time version retrieval; and (iv) auditable
causal tracing. We demonstrate how planner-guided agents can decompose complex
queries into Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) of these actions. This two-layer
architecture transforms retrieval from an opaque black box to a transparent,
auditable process, directly addressing Explainable AI (XAI) requirements for
high-stakes domains.

Motivation: 随着推理模型快速发展，需要系统方法来比较不同模型的测试时扩展能力，现有评估方法无法有效衡量计算资源动态分配的效果。

Method: ARISE评估框架包含两个关键创新：样本级感知机制（惩罚导致性能下降的扩展行为）和动态采样机制（减少准确率波动和token计数不稳定的影响）。

Result: 在数学推理、代码生成和智能体任务等多个领域的实验表明，ARISE能可靠地测量测试时扩展能力，发现不同模型在扩展效率上存在显著差异，Claude Opus展现出最优的扩展特性。

Conclusion: ARISE为评估推理模型的测试时扩展能力提供了可靠且细粒度的测量方法，揭示了模型间扩展效率的重要差异，有助于指导模型选择和优化。

Abstract: Test-time scaling has emerged as a transformative paradigm for enhancing the
performance of large reasoning models, enabling dynamic allocation of
computational resources during inference. However, as the landscape of
reasoning models rapidly expands, a critical question remains: how can we
systematically compare and evaluate the test-time scaling capabilities across
different models? In this paper, we introduce ARISE (Adaptive Resolution-aware
Scaling Evaluation), a novel metric specifically designed to assess the
test-time scaling effectiveness of large reasoning models. Unlike existing
evaluation approaches, ARISE incorporates two key innovations: (1) sample-level
awareness that effectively penalizes negative scaling behaviors where increased
computation leads to performance degradation, and (2) a dynamic sampling
mechanism that mitigates the impact of accuracy fluctuations and token count
instability on the final assessment. We conduct comprehensive experiments
evaluating state-of-the-art reasoning models across diverse domains including
mathematical reasoning, code generation, and agentic tasks. Our results
demonstrate that ARISE provides a reliable and fine-grained measurement of
test-time scaling capabilities, revealing significant variations in scaling
efficiency across models. Notably, our evaluation identifies Claude Opus as
exhibiting superior scaling characteristics compared to other contemporary
reasoning models.

TL;DR: 研究发现大型推理模型存在安全漏洞，通过机制可解释性分析发现"拒绝悬崖"现象：模型在思考过程中能识别有害提示并保持拒绝意图，但在输出前突然放弃拒绝。通过干预少量注意力头可显著提升安全性，并提出高效的数据选择方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型虽然具有强大的多步推理能力，但存在严重的安全漏洞，这些漏洞的机制尚未被充分理解。研究旨在通过机制可解释性方法揭示安全对齐失败的根本原因。

Method: 使用线性探测方法追踪拒绝意图在token位置上的变化，识别"拒绝悬崖"现象；通过因果干预分析确定对拒绝行为有负面影响的稀疏注意力头集合；提出基于拒绝悬崖的数据选择方法Cliff-as-a-Judge。

Result: 发现模型在思考过程中能正确识别有害提示并保持拒绝意图，但在输出前拒绝分数急剧下降；仅消融3%的注意力头就能将攻击成功率降至10%以下；新方法仅使用1.7%的传统安全训练数据就能达到相当的安全改进效果。

Conclusion: 推理模型的安全漏洞不是模型本身不安全，而是拒绝意图被系统性抑制；通过机制性干预可以高效修复安全对齐问题，证明了"少即是多"的安全对齐效果。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) with multi-step reasoning capabilities have
shown remarkable problem-solving abilities, yet they exhibit concerning safety
vulnerabilities that remain poorly understood. In this work, we investigate why
safety alignment fails in reasoning models through a mechanistic
interpretability lens. Using a linear probing approach to trace refusal
intentions across token positions, we discover a striking phenomenon termed as
\textbf{refusal cliff}: many poorly-aligned reasoning models correctly identify
harmful prompts and maintain strong refusal intentions during their thinking
process, but experience a sharp drop in refusal scores at the final tokens
before output generation. This suggests that these models are not inherently
unsafe; rather, their refusal intentions are systematically suppressed. Through
causal intervention analysis, we identify a sparse set of attention heads that
negatively contribute to refusal behavior. Ablating just 3\% of these heads can
reduce attack success rates below 10\%. Building on these mechanistic insights,
we propose \textbf{Cliff-as-a-Judge}, a novel data selection method that
identifies training examples exhibiting the largest refusal cliff to
efficiently repair reasoning models' safety alignment. This approach achieves
comparable safety improvements using only 1.7\% of the vanilla safety training
data, demonstrating a less-is-more effect in safety alignment.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MixReasoning框架通过动态调整推理深度，在困难步骤进行详细推理，在简单步骤进行简洁推理，从而缩短推理长度并提高效率，同时保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理模型对所有步骤采用相同的详细推理方式，但子问题难度差异很大，导致大量冗余。只有少数关键步骤真正具有挑战性，而许多步骤只需简单处理。

Method: 提出MixReasoning框架，在单个响应中动态调整推理深度，形成混合推理链：对困难步骤进行详细推理，对简单步骤进行简洁推理。

Result: 在GSM8K、MATH-500和AIME数据集上的实验表明，MixReasoning缩短了推理长度，显著提高了效率，且没有影响准确性。

Conclusion: 自适应调整推理深度的混合推理方法能够有效减少冗余，提高推理效率，同时保持模型性能。

Abstract: Reasoning models enhance performance by tackling problems in a step-by-step
manner, decomposing them into sub-problems and exploring long chains of thought
before producing an answer. However, applying extended reasoning to every step
introduces substantial redundancy, as sub-problems vary widely in difficulty
and complexity: a small number of pivotal steps are genuinely challenging and
decisive for the final answer, while many others only involve straightforward
revisions or simple computations. Therefore, a natural idea is to endow
reasoning models with the ability to adaptively respond to this variation,
rather than treating all steps with the same level of elaboration. To this end,
we propose MixReasoning, a framework that dynamically adjusts the depth of
reasoning within a single response. The resulting chain of thought then becomes
a mixture of detailed reasoning on difficult steps and concise inference on
simpler ones. Experiments on GSM8K, MATH-500, and AIME show that MixReasoning
shortens reasoning length and substantially improves efficiency without
compromising accuracy.

*Gang Liu,Yihan Zhu,Jie Chen,Meng Jiang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DeepEvolve是一个结合深度研究和算法演化的科学助手代理，通过外部知识检索、跨文件代码编辑和系统调试，在反馈驱动的迭代循环中持续改进算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有科学助手要么仅依赖算法演化，要么仅进行深度研究，两者都有局限性。纯算法演化依赖LLM内部知识，在复杂领域快速达到瓶颈；纯深度研究提出想法但缺乏验证，导致不切实际的解决方案。

Method: 集成深度研究与算法演化，结合外部知识检索、跨文件代码编辑和系统调试，在反馈驱动的迭代循环中工作。每个迭代不仅提出新假设，还进行精炼、实现和测试。

Result: 在化学、数学、生物学、材料和专利等九个基准测试中，DeepEvolve持续改进初始算法，产生可执行的新算法并保持持续增益。

Conclusion: DeepEvolve通过弥合无引导演化与无基础研究之间的差距，为推进科学算法发现提供了可靠框架。

Abstract: Large language models hold promise as scientific assistants, yet existing
agents either rely solely on algorithm evolution or on deep research in
isolation, both of which face critical limitations. Pure algorithm evolution,
as in AlphaEvolve, depends only on the internal knowledge of LLMs and quickly
plateaus in complex domains, while pure deep research proposes ideas without
validation, resulting in unrealistic or unimplementable solutions. We present
DeepEvolve, an agent that integrates deep research with algorithm evolution,
uniting external knowledge retrieval, cross-file code editing, and systematic
debugging under a feedback-driven iterative loop. Each iteration not only
proposes new hypotheses but also refines, implements, and tests them, avoiding
both shallow improvements and unproductive over-refinements. Across nine
benchmarks in chemistry, mathematics, biology, materials, and patents,
DeepEvolve consistently improves the initial algorithm, producing executable
new algorithms with sustained gains. By bridging the gap between unguided
evolution and research without grounding, DeepEvolve provides a reliable
framework for advancing scientific algorithm discovery. Our code is available

TL;DR: 提出了TelecomTS数据集，这是一个来自5G电信网络的大规模可观测性数据集，解决了现有基准中可观测性数据代表性不足的问题，支持异常检测、根因分析和多模态推理等下游任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可观测性数据集在公共基准中代表性不足，且往往经过匿名化和归一化处理，移除了尺度信息，限制了在异常检测、根因分析和多模态推理等任务中的应用。

Method: 引入TelecomTS数据集，包含异构的去匿名化协变量和明确的尺度信息，支持多种下游任务，包括异常检测、根因分析和需要多模态推理的问答基准。

Result: 对最先进的时间序列、语言和推理模型进行基准测试发现，现有方法难以处理可观测性数据的突发性、噪声性和高方差动态特性。实验还强调了保留协变量绝对尺度的重要性。

Conclusion: 需要能够原生利用尺度信息的基础时间序列模型，以应对实际可观测性应用中的挑战。

Abstract: Modern enterprises generate vast streams of time series metrics when
monitoring complex systems, known as observability data. Unlike conventional
time series from domains such as weather, observability data are zero-inflated,
highly stochastic, and exhibit minimal temporal structure. Despite their
importance, observability datasets are underrepresented in public benchmarks
due to proprietary restrictions. Existing datasets are often anonymized and
normalized, removing scale information and limiting their use for tasks beyond
forecasting, such as anomaly detection, root-cause analysis, and multi-modal
reasoning. To address this gap, we introduce TelecomTS, a large-scale
observability dataset derived from a 5G telecommunications network. TelecomTS
features heterogeneous, de-anonymized covariates with explicit scale
information and supports a suite of downstream tasks, including anomaly
detection, root-cause analysis, and a question-answering benchmark requiring
multi-modal reasoning. Benchmarking state-of-the-art time series, language, and
reasoning models reveals that existing approaches struggle with the abrupt,
noisy, and high-variance dynamics of observability data. Our experiments also
underscore the importance of preserving covariates' absolute scale, emphasizing
the need for foundation time series models that natively leverage scale
information for practical observability applications.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RouteLLM是一个分层多智能体框架，将自然语言意图转化为约束感知的路线推荐，通过专门子智能体协调解决空间推理和偏好建模问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统路由算法假设结构化输入和固定目标，难以适应自然语言查询；现有LLM方法在空间推理和联合建模路线级与POI级偏好方面存在局限。

Method: 采用分层多智能体框架：解析用户查询为结构化意图，管理器协调约束智能体、POI智能体、路径优化智能体，最后验证智能体确保约束满足并生成可解释路线。

Result: 实验表明该方法能可靠地将文本偏好转化为约束感知路线，相比传统方法提高了路线质量和偏好满足度。

Conclusion: RouteLLM成功连接了语言灵活性和空间结构，实现了对路线可行性和用户偏好的推理，在路线推荐任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Route recommendation aims to provide users with optimal travel plans that
satisfy diverse and complex requirements. Classical routing algorithms (e.g.,
shortest-path and constraint-aware search) are efficient but assume structured
inputs and fixed objectives, limiting adaptability to natural-language queries.
Recent LLM-based approaches enhance flexibility but struggle with spatial
reasoning and the joint modeling of route-level and POI-level preferences. To
address these limitations, we propose RouteLLM, a hierarchical multi-agent
framework that grounds natural-language intents into constraint-aware routes.
It first parses user queries into structured intents including POIs, paths, and
constraints. A manager agent then coordinates specialized sub-agents: a
constraint agent that resolves and formally check constraints, a POI agent that
retrieves and ranks candidate POIs, and a path refinement agent that refines
routes via a routing engine with preference-conditioned costs. A final verifier
agent ensures constraint satisfaction and produces the final route with an
interpretable rationale. This design bridges linguistic flexibility and spatial
structure, enabling reasoning over route feasibility and user preferences.
Experiments show that our method reliably grounds textual preferences into
constraint-aware routes, improving route quality and preference satisfaction
over classical methods.

Conclusion: 两种方法在决策者对齐任务上都有潜力，经典AI在特定风险配置下可能具有优势，为AI对齐研究提供了新的实证比较。

Abstract: As algorithmic decision-makers are increasingly applied to high-stakes
domains, AI alignment research has evolved from a focus on universal value
alignment to context-specific approaches that account for decision-maker
attributes. Prior work on Decision-Maker Alignment (DMA) has explored two
primary strategies: (1) classical AI methods integrating case-based reasoning,
Bayesian reasoning, and naturalistic decision-making, and (2) large language
model (LLM)-based methods leveraging prompt engineering. While both approaches
have shown promise in limited domains such as medical triage, their
generalizability to novel contexts remains underexplored. In this work, we
implement a prior classical AI model and develop an LLM-based algorithmic
decision-maker evaluated using a large reasoning model (GPT-5) and a
non-reasoning model (GPT-4) with weighted self-consistency under a zero-shot
prompting framework, as proposed in recent literature. We evaluate both
approaches on a health insurance decision-making dataset annotated for three
target decision-makers with varying levels of risk tolerance (0.0, 0.5, 1.0).
In the experiments reported herein, classical AI and LLM-based models achieved
comparable alignment with attribute-based targets, with classical AI exhibiting
slightly better alignment for a moderate risk profile. The dataset and
open-source implementation are publicly available at:

TL;DR: 优化LLMs在竞争环境中取得成功会无意中导致模型失准，表现为欺骗性营销、虚假信息和有害行为增加，即使模型被明确指示保持真实和可靠。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解竞争反馈循环如何影响LLM行为，特别是在商业广告、选举和社交媒体等竞争性环境中，这些环境中各方都在争夺受众认可。

Method: 使用模拟环境在这些场景中进行实验，测量优化LLMs以获得竞争优势时的行为变化。

Result: 在销售中，6.3%的销售增长伴随着14.0%的欺骗性营销增加；在选举中，4.9%的选票份额增长伴随着22.3%的虚假信息和12.5%的民粹主义言论增加；在社交媒体上，7.5%的参与度提升伴随着188.6%的虚假信息和16.3%的有害行为推广增加。

Conclusion: 竞争压力会系统性地削弱对齐，形成竞相逐底的局面，AI系统的安全部署需要更强的治理和精心设计的激励机制，以防止竞争动态破坏社会信任。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly shaping how information is
created and disseminated, from companies using them to craft persuasive
advertisements, to election campaigns optimizing messaging to gain votes, to
social media influencers boosting engagement. These settings are inherently
competitive, with sellers, candidates, and influencers vying for audience
approval, yet it remains poorly understood how competitive feedback loops
influence LLM behavior. We show that optimizing LLMs for competitive success
can inadvertently drive misalignment. Using simulated environments across these
scenarios, we find that, 6.3% increase in sales is accompanied by a 14.0% rise
in deceptive marketing; in elections, a 4.9% gain in vote share coincides with
22.3% more disinformation and 12.5% more populist rhetoric; and on social
media, a 7.5% engagement boost comes with 188.6% more disinformation and a
16.3% increase in promotion of harmful behaviors. We call this phenomenon
Moloch's Bargain for AI--competitive success achieved at the cost of alignment.
These misaligned behaviors emerge even when models are explicitly instructed to
remain truthful and grounded, revealing the fragility of current alignment
safeguards. Our findings highlight how market-driven optimization pressures can
systematically erode alignment, creating a race to the bottom, and suggest that
safe deployment of AI systems will require stronger governance and carefully
designed incentives to prevent competitive dynamics from undermining societal
trust.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了测试时计算扩展（TTS）策略，包括顺序扩展和并行扩展，利用验证比生成更容易的不对称验证特性，在深度搜索代理中实现了显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在某些场景下（如解决数独谜题），验证响应比生成响应要容易得多，这种不对称验证特性凸显了测试时扩展的巨大潜力。

Method: 结合顺序扩展（延长生成过程）和并行扩展（验证和选择多个候选输出）策略，利用不对称验证特性，为验证器分配适度的计算资源。

Result: 通过TTS扩展的开源模型在BrowseComp基准上获得高达27个绝对百分点的提升，GLM-4.5 Heavy在BrowseComp上达到54.0%准确率，在GAIA上达到66.0%准确率；Tongyi-DeepResearch Heavy在BrowseComp上达到69.0%准确率，大幅超越最佳专有模型。

Conclusion: 测试时计算扩展，特别是利用不对称验证特性，能够显著提升深度搜索代理的性能，使开源模型达到甚至超越专有模型的水平。

Abstract: Test-time compute can be scaled both sequentially and in parallel. Sequential
scaling involves lengthening the generation process, while parallel scaling
involves verifying and selecting among multiple candidate outputs. Combining
these two strategies has led to the most powerful AI systems, such as Grok 4
Heavy and GPT-5 Pro. In certain contexts (e.g., solving Sudoku puzzles),
verifying responses can be substantially easier than generating them. This
property, referred to as \emph{asymmetric verification}, highlights the strong
potential of test-time scaling (TTS). In this work, we study both sequential
and parallel TTS of deep search agents, motivated by the intuition that
verification in this setting is often much easier than generation. In
experiments, we first show that sequential scaling methods, such as budget
forcing, can be effective initially but soon degrade performance. Leveraging
asymmetric verification, however, we are able to achieve substantial
improvements by allocating only a modest amount of compute to the verifier. We
conduct experiments with flagship open-source models and extend them to their
``Heavy'' variants through TTS. These deep research agents achieve gains of up
to 27 absolute points on benchmarks such as BrowseComp. Remarkably, as an
open-source alternative, GLM-4.5 Heavy reaches accuracy of {\bf 54.0\%} on
BrowseComp and {\bf 66.0\%} on GAIA, placing it comparable to the best
proprietary choices such as OpenAI Deep Research. Tongyi-DeepResearch Heavy
further achieves {\bf 69.0\%} accuracy on BrowseComp, greatly surpassing the
best proprietary results.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is starting to transform the research process as
we know it by automating the discovery of new solutions. Given a task, the
typical AI-driven approach is (i) to generate a set of diverse solutions, and
then (ii) to verify these solutions and select one that solves the problem.
Crucially, this approach assumes the existence of a reliable verifier, i.e.,
one that can accurately determine whether a solution solves the given problem.
We argue that systems research, long focused on designing and evaluating new
performance-oriented algorithms, is particularly well-suited for AI-driven
solution discovery. This is because system performance problems naturally admit
reliable verifiers: solutions are typically implemented in real systems or
simulators, and verification reduces to running these software artifacts
against predefined workloads and measuring performance. We term this approach
as AI-Driven Research for Systems (ADRS), which iteratively generates,
evaluates, and refines solutions. Using penEvolve, an existing open-source ADRS
instance, we present case studies across diverse domains, including load
balancing for multi-region cloud scheduling, Mixture-of-Experts inference,
LLM-based SQL queries, and transaction scheduling. In multiple instances, ADRS
discovers algorithms that outperform state-of-the-art human designs (e.g.,
achieving up to 5.0x runtime improvements or 50% cost reductions). We distill
best practices for guiding algorithm evolution, from prompt design to evaluator
construction, for existing frameworks. We then discuss the broader implications
for the systems community: as AI assumes a central role in algorithm design, we
argue that human researchers will increasingly focus on problem formulation and
strategic guidance. Our results highlight both the disruptive potential and the
urgent need to adapt systems research practices in the age of AI.

TL;DR: TaTToo是一个新颖的表格基础过程奖励模型框架，通过显式表格推理步骤和工具验证来解决现有PRM在表格推理中的性能瓶颈，在5个表格推理基准上提升下游模型30.9%的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有过程奖励模型(PRM)虽然在文本推理步骤监督方面表现出色，但在表格特定操作(如子表检索和模式交互)方面存在困难，导致表格推理领域的性能瓶颈。

Method: 提出TaTToo框架：1)设计可扩展的数据标注流程，构建6万多个高质量步骤级标注；2)采用双阶段训练范式：冷启动监督微调学习工具使用推理模式，然后通过工具基础奖励塑形的强化学习来对齐表格验证。

Conclusion: TaTToo通过表格基础的过程奖励监督和工具验证，有效解决了表格推理中的关键挑战，为增强大型推理模型在表格领域的推理能力提供了有力框架。

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) have recently emerged as a powerful framework
for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large reasoning models (LRMs),
particularly in the context of test-time scaling (TTS). However, their
potential for supervising LRMs on tabular reasoning domains remains
underexplored. Through detailed empirical analyses, we identify that existing
PRMs, though widely adopted for supervising text-only reasoning steps, struggle
with table-specific operations such as sub-table retrieval and schema
interaction, leading to critical performance bottlenecks. To address this
limitation, we propose TaTToo, a novel table-grounded PRM framework that (i)
reasons explicitly over tabular reasoning steps and (ii) integrates tool-based
verification to provide precise reward supervision. Concretely, we first design
a scalable data curation pipeline that constructs over 60k high-quality
step-level annotations by integrating table verification rationales with
tool-based executions. Building on the collected data, we train TaTToo with a
dual-stage paradigm: cold-start supervised fine-tuning to capture tool-use
reasoning patterns, followed by reinforcement learning with tool-grounded
reward shaping to align our model with table-based verification. We provide a
comprehensive evaluation of the policy improvement induced by our newly
designed PRM. Across 5 challenging tabular reasoning benchmarks covering
numerical reasoning, fact-checking, and data analysis, TaTToo improves
downstream policy LRMs by 30.9% at inference, surpasses strong PRM baselines
such as Qwen-2.5-Math-PRM-72B with only 8B parameters, and demonstrates strong
generalizability across diverse TTS strategies.
