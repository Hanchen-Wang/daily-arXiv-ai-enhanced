### [1] [DrivingScene: A Multi-Task Online Feed-Forward 3D Gaussian Splatting Method for Dynamic Driving Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24734)
*Qirui Hou,Wenzhang Sun,Chang Zeng,Chunfeng Wang,Hao Li,Jianxun Cui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DrivingScene是一个从仅两帧环视图像在线重建4D动态驾驶场景的框架，通过轻量级残差流网络预测动态物体的非刚性运动，在nuScenes数据集上显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实时高保真重建动态驾驶场景面临复杂动态和稀疏视图的挑战，现有方法难以平衡质量和效率。

Method: 提出轻量级残差流网络，在学习的静态场景先验基础上预测动态物体的非刚性运动，通过场景流显式建模动态，并采用由粗到精的训练范式避免端到端方法的不稳定性。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上，仅使用图像的方法能在线生成高质量深度、场景流和3D高斯点云，在动态重建和新视角合成方面显著优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: DrivingScene框架成功解决了动态驾驶场景重建中质量与效率的平衡问题，为实时4D场景重建提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Real-time, high-fidelity reconstruction of dynamic driving scenes is
challenged by complex dynamics and sparse views, with prior methods struggling
to balance quality and efficiency. We propose DrivingScene, an online,
feed-forward framework that reconstructs 4D dynamic scenes from only two
consecutive surround-view images. Our key innovation is a lightweight residual
flow network that predicts the non-rigid motion of dynamic objects per camera
on top of a learned static scene prior, explicitly modeling dynamics via scene
flow. We also introduce a coarse-to-fine training paradigm that circumvents the
instabilities common to end-to-end approaches. Experiments on nuScenes dataset
show our image-only method simultaneously generates high-quality depth, scene
flow, and 3D Gaussian point clouds online, significantly outperforming
state-of-the-art methods in both dynamic reconstruction and novel view
synthesis.

### [2] [Towards Fine-Grained Human Motion Video Captioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24767)
*Guorui Song,Guocun Wang,Zhe Huang,Jing Lin,Xuefei Zhe,Jian Li,Haoqian Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出M-ACM模型，通过运动感知解码增强视频描述质量，利用人体网格恢复的运动表示来突出人体动态，减少幻觉并提高语义保真度和空间对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频描述模型难以捕捉细粒度运动细节，导致描述模糊或语义不一致。

Method: M-ACM框架结合运动感知解码，利用人体网格恢复提取运动表示，突出人体动态。

Result: 实验结果表明M-ACM在准确描述复杂人体运动和细微时间变化方面显著优于先前方法。

Conclusion: M-ACM为运动中心视频描述设立了新标准，并发布了HMI数据集和HMI-Bench基准来支持该领域研究。

Abstract: Generating accurate descriptions of human actions in videos remains a
challenging task for video captioning models. Existing approaches often
struggle to capture fine-grained motion details, resulting in vague or
semantically inconsistent captions. In this work, we introduce the
Motion-Augmented Caption Model (M-ACM), a novel generative framework that
enhances caption quality by incorporating motion-aware decoding. At its core,
M-ACM leverages motion representations derived from human mesh recovery to
explicitly highlight human body dynamics, thereby reducing hallucinations and
improving both semantic fidelity and spatial alignment in the generated
captions. To support research in this area, we present the Human Motion Insight
(HMI) Dataset, comprising 115K video-description pairs focused on human
movement, along with HMI-Bench, a dedicated benchmark for evaluating
motion-focused video captioning. Experimental results demonstrate that M-ACM
significantly outperforms previous methods in accurately describing complex
human motions and subtle temporal variations, setting a new standard for
motion-centric video captioning.

### [3] [Combining SAR Simulators to Train ATR Models with Synthetic Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24768)
*Benjamin Camus,Julien Houssay,Corentin Le Barbu,Eric Monteux,Cédric Saleun,Christian Cochin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 使用两个基于不同物理模型的SAR模拟器（MOCEM和Salsa）生成合成数据，结合ADASCA深度学习方法训练自动目标识别模型，在MSTAR真实数据上达到近88%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决SAR图像自动目标识别中缺乏真实标注数据的问题，通过合成数据训练模型，但单一模拟器的简化假设导致模型在真实数据上泛化能力差。

Method: 结合两种不同物理模型的SAR模拟器（MOCEM基于散射中心模型，Salsa基于光线追踪）生成合成数据集，使用ADASCA深度学习方法训练ATR模型。

Result: 在MSTAR真实测量数据上达到了接近88%的识别准确率。

Conclusion: 通过组合不同物理模型的模拟器可以生成更丰富的合成数据集，有效提升ATR模型在真实SAR图像上的泛化性能。

Abstract: This work aims to train Deep Learning models to perform Automatic Target
Recognition (ATR) on Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images. To circumvent the
lack of real labelled measurements, we resort to synthetic data produced by SAR
simulators. Simulation offers full control over the virtual environment, which
enables us to generate large and diversified datasets at will. However,
simulations are intrinsically grounded on simplifying assumptions of the real
world (i.e. physical models). Thus, synthetic datasets are not as
representative as real measurements. Consequently, ATR models trained on
synthetic images cannot generalize well on real measurements. Our contributions
to this problem are twofold: on one hand, we demonstrate and quantify the
impact of the simulation paradigm on the ATR. On the other hand, we propose a
new approach to tackle the ATR problem: combine two SAR simulators that are
grounded on different (but complementary) paradigms to produce synthetic
datasets. To this end, we use two simulators: MOCEM, which is based on a
scattering centers model approach, and Salsa, which resorts on a ray tracing
strategy. We train ATR models using synthetic dataset generated both by MOCEM
and Salsa and our Deep Learning approach called ADASCA. We reach an accuracy of
almost 88 % on the MSTAR measurements.

### [4] [Point-level Uncertainty Evaluation of Mobile Laser Scanning Point Clouds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24773)
*Ziyang Xu,Olaf Wysocki,Christoph Holst*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于机器学习的移动激光扫描点云不确定性评估框架，使用随机森林和XGBoost模型，通过局部几何特征预测点级误差，无需高精度参考数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统后向不确定性建模依赖高精度参考数据，成本高且难以大规模获取，需要一种更实用的不确定性评估方法。

Method: 使用随机森林和XGBoost集成学习模型，学习局部几何特征与点级误差之间的关系，采用空间分区数据集避免数据泄露。

Result: 两个模型都能有效捕捉几何特征与不确定性之间的非线性关系，平均ROC-AUC值超过0.87，高程变化、点密度和局部结构复杂性是最重要的预测特征。

Conclusion: 该框架为大规模点云质量控制和误差分析提供了可扩展的数据驱动解决方案。

Abstract: Reliable quantification of uncertainty in Mobile Laser Scanning (MLS) point
clouds is essential for ensuring the accuracy and credibility of downstream
applications such as 3D mapping, modeling, and change analysis. Traditional
backward uncertainty modeling heavily rely on high-precision reference data,
which are often costly or infeasible to obtain at large scales. To address this
issue, this study proposes a machine learning-based framework for point-level
uncertainty evaluation that learns the relationship between local geometric
features and point-level errors. The framework is implemented using two
ensemble learning models, Random Forest (RF) and XGBoost, which are trained and
validated on a spatially partitioned real-world dataset to avoid data leakage.
Experimental results demonstrate that both models can effectively capture the
nonlinear relationships between geometric characteristics and uncertainty,
achieving mean ROC-AUC values above 0.87. The analysis further reveals that
geometric features describing elevation variation, point density, and local
structural complexity play a dominant role in predicting uncertainty. The
proposed framework offers a data-driven perspective of uncertainty evaluation,
providing a scalable and adaptable foundation for future quality control and
error analysis of large-scale point clouds.

### [5] [Cross-Enhanced Multimodal Fusion of Eye-Tracking and Facial Features for Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24777)
*Yujie Nie,Jianzhang Ni,Yonglong Ye,Yuan-Ting Zhang,Yun Kwok Wing,Xiangqing Xu,Xin Ma,Lizhou Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种多模态交叉增强融合框架，结合眼动追踪和面部特征进行阿尔茨海默病检测，通过交叉注意力机制和方向感知卷积模块实现自适应多模态表征学习，在自建数据集上达到95.11%的分类准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿尔茨海默病的准确诊断对于及时干预至关重要，眼动追踪和面部特征作为认知功能的重要指标，但很少有研究探索它们的联合集成用于辅助AD诊断。

Method: 提出多模态交叉增强融合框架，包含两个关键模块：交叉增强融合注意力模块（CEFAM）通过交叉注意力和全局增强建模模态间交互，方向感知卷积模块（DACM）通过水平-垂直感受野捕获细粒度方向性面部特征。

Result: 在包含25名AD患者和25名健康对照的自建同步多模态数据集上，该框架优于传统的后期融合和特征拼接方法，在区分AD与HC时达到95.11%的分类准确率。

Conclusion: 该框架通过显式建模模态间依赖关系和模态特定贡献，展现出卓越的鲁棒性和诊断性能，为阿尔茨海默病的多模态辅助诊断提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is essential for enabling
timely intervention and slowing disease progression. Multimodal diagnostic
approaches offer considerable promise by integrating complementary information
across behavioral and perceptual domains. Eye-tracking and facial features, in
particular, are important indicators of cognitive function, reflecting
attentional distribution and neurocognitive state. However, few studies have
explored their joint integration for auxiliary AD diagnosis. In this study, we
propose a multimodal cross-enhanced fusion framework that synergistically
leverages eye-tracking and facial features for AD detection. The framework
incorporates two key modules: (a) a Cross-Enhanced Fusion Attention Module
(CEFAM), which models inter-modal interactions through cross-attention and
global enhancement, and (b) a Direction-Aware Convolution Module (DACM), which
captures fine-grained directional facial features via horizontal-vertical
receptive fields. Together, these modules enable adaptive and discriminative
multimodal representation learning. To support this work, we constructed a
synchronized multimodal dataset, including 25 patients with AD and 25 healthy
controls (HC), by recording aligned facial video and eye-tracking sequences
during a visual memory-search paradigm, providing an ecologically valid
resource for evaluating integration strategies. Extensive experiments on this
dataset demonstrate that our framework outperforms traditional late fusion and
feature concatenation methods, achieving a classification accuracy of 95.11% in
distinguishing AD from HC, highlighting superior robustness and diagnostic
performance by explicitly modeling inter-modal dependencies and
modality-specific contributions.

Motivation: 智能车辆在自动化趋势中日益重要，车道路径检测是其在城市道路和机器人轨道应用中的关键需求。

Method: 采用基于FPGA的车道检测器架构，使用Sobel算法进行边缘检测，工作频率150MHz，并集成了自动光线和温度控制单元以适应环境条件。

Result: 系统能在1.17ms内处理416x416图像，输出车道数量、当前车道索引及其左右边界信息，具有高实时性。

Conclusion: 该FPGA-based车道检测系统具有高效实时处理能力，环境适应性好，适用于智能车辆应用。

Abstract: Intelligent vehicles are one of the most important outcomes gained from the
world tendency toward automation. Applications of IVs, whether in urban roads
or robot tracks, do prioritize lane path detection. This paper proposes an
FPGA-based Lane Detector Vehicle LDV architecture that relies on the Sobel
algorithm for edge detection. Operating on 416 x 416 images and 150 MHz, the
system can generate a valid output every 1.17 ms. The valid output consists of
the number of present lanes, the current lane index, as well as its right and
left boundaries. Additionally, the automated light and temperature control
units in the proposed system enhance its adaptability to the surrounding
environmental conditions.

### [7] [ESCA: Enabling Seamless Codec Avatar Execution through Algorithm and Hardware Co-Optimization for Virtual Reality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24787)
*Mingzhi Zhu,Ding Shang,Sai Qian Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出ESCA框架，通过后训练量化和定制硬件加速器优化Codec Avatar模型，在VR设备上实现实时高质量渲染


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Codec Avatar模型在资源受限的VR设备上计算需求大、实时推理困难的问题

Method: 采用后训练量化方法降低模型精度，设计定制硬件加速器集成到VR设备SoC中，构建全栈优化框架

Result: FovVideoVDP质量分数比最佳4位基线提升+0.39，延迟降低3.36倍，端到端测试中维持100fps渲染速率

Conclusion: 证明了在资源受限设备上部署高保真Codec Avatar的可行性，为更沉浸式和便携的VR体验打开了大门

Abstract: Photorealistic Codec Avatars (PCA), which generate high-fidelity human face
renderings, are increasingly being used in Virtual Reality (VR) environments to
enable immersive communication and interaction through deep learning-based
generative models. However, these models impose significant computational
demands, making real-time inference challenging on resource-constrained VR
devices such as head-mounted displays, where latency and power efficiency are
critical. To address this challenge, we propose an efficient post-training
quantization (PTQ) method tailored for Codec Avatar models, enabling
low-precision execution without compromising output quality. In addition, we
design a custom hardware accelerator that can be integrated into the
system-on-chip of VR devices to further enhance processing efficiency. Building
on these components, we introduce ESCA, a full-stack optimization framework
that accelerates PCA inference on edge VR platforms. Experimental results
demonstrate that ESCA boosts FovVideoVDP quality scores by up to $+0.39$ over
the best 4-bit baseline, delivers up to $3.36\times$ latency reduction, and
sustains a rendering rate of 100 frames per second in end-to-end tests,
satisfying real-time VR requirements. These results demonstrate the feasibility
of deploying high-fidelity codec avatars on resource-constrained devices,
opening the door to more immersive and portable VR experiences.

### [8] [The Underappreciated Power of Vision Models for Graph Structural Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24788)
*Xinjian Zhao,Wei Pang,Zhongkai Xue,Xiangru Jian,Lei Zhang,Yaoyao Xu,Xiaozhuang Song,Shu Wu,Tianshu Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文发现视觉模型在图结构理解方面具有被低估的潜力，特别是在全局拓扑感知任务上显著优于图神经网络，并提出了GraphAbstract基准来评估模型的全局图结构理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图神经网络的底层消息传递机制与人类视觉感知的全局结构优先方式存在根本差异，现有基准测试混淆了领域特征与拓扑理解，需要新的评估方法来测试模型对全局图属性的感知能力。

Method: 引入GraphAbstract基准，评估模型识别组织原型、检测对称性、感知连接强度、识别关键元素等人类式全局图属性感知能力，比较视觉模型与图神经网络的表现。

Result: 视觉模型在需要整体结构理解的任务上显著优于图神经网络，且能保持跨不同图尺度的泛化能力，而图神经网络在全局模式抽象方面表现不佳且随图规模增大性能下降。

Conclusion: 视觉模型在图结构理解方面具有显著但未被充分利用的能力，特别是在需要全局拓扑感知和尺度不变推理的问题上，这为开发更有效的图基础模型开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks operate through bottom-up message-passing,
fundamentally differing from human visual perception, which intuitively
captures global structures first. We investigate the underappreciated potential
of vision models for graph understanding, finding they achieve performance
comparable to GNNs on established benchmarks while exhibiting distinctly
different learning patterns. These divergent behaviors, combined with
limitations of existing benchmarks that conflate domain features with
topological understanding, motivate our introduction of GraphAbstract. This
benchmark evaluates models' ability to perceive global graph properties as
humans do: recognizing organizational archetypes, detecting symmetry, sensing
connectivity strength, and identifying critical elements. Our results reveal
that vision models significantly outperform GNNs on tasks requiring holistic
structural understanding and maintain generalizability across varying graph
scales, while GNNs struggle with global pattern abstraction and degrade with
increasing graph size. This work demonstrates that vision models possess
remarkable yet underutilized capabilities for graph structural understanding,
particularly for problems requiring global topological awareness and
scale-invariant reasoning. These findings open new avenues to leverage this
underappreciated potential for developing more effective graph foundation
models for tasks dominated by holistic pattern recognition.

### [9] [A Re-node Self-training Approach for Deep Graph-based Semi-supervised Classification on Multi-view Image Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24791)
*Jingjun Bi,Fadi Dornaika*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出RSGSLM方法，结合图卷积网络、伪标签和拓扑平衡校正，用于多视图数据的半监督学习


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决图像缺乏清晰图结构和多视图数据复杂性的问题，传统方法在多视图数据中集成图结构仍具挑战

Method: 结合线性特征变换和多视图图融合的GCN框架，动态整合伪标签到损失函数，校正类边界附近标记样本权重，引入无监督平滑损失

Result: 在多视图基准图像数据集上超越现有半监督学习方法

Conclusion: RSGSLM在多视图上下文中优化性能同时保持计算效率

Abstract: Recently, graph-based semi-supervised learning and pseudo-labeling have
gained attention due to their effectiveness in reducing the need for extensive
data annotations. Pseudo-labeling uses predictions from unlabeled data to
improve model training, while graph-based methods are characterized by
processing data represented as graphs. However, the lack of clear graph
structures in images combined with the complexity of multi-view data limits the
efficiency of traditional and existing techniques. Moreover, the integration of
graph structures in multi-view data is still a challenge. In this paper, we
propose Re-node Self-taught Graph-based Semi-supervised Learning for Multi-view
Data (RSGSLM). Our method addresses these challenges by (i) combining linear
feature transformation and multi-view graph fusion within a Graph Convolutional
Network (GCN) framework, (ii) dynamically incorporating pseudo-labels into the
GCN loss function to improve classification in multi-view data, and (iii)
correcting topological imbalances by adjusting the weights of labeled samples
near class boundaries. Additionally, (iv) we introduce an unsupervised
smoothing loss applicable to all samples. This combination optimizes
performance while maintaining computational efficiency. Experimental results on
multi-view benchmark image datasets demonstrate that RSGSLM surpasses existing
semi-supervised learning approaches in multi-view contexts.

### [10] [PISA-Bench: The PISA Index as a Multilingual and Multimodal Metric for the Evaluation of Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24792)
*Patrick Haller,Fabio Barth,Jonas Golde,Georg Rehm,Alan Akbik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PISA-Bench是一个多语言视觉语言基准测试，基于专家创建的PISA测试构建，涵盖6种语言，用于评估多模态推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型基准测试存在高质量人工验证样本不足、依赖LLM合成内容、以及主要局限于英语的问题，需要更可靠的多语言评估资源。

Method: 从英语PISA测试中提取人工标注的指令、问题、选项和图像，翻译成5种其他语言，构建完全平行的六语言语料库。

Result: 评估发现小模型(<20B参数)表现不佳，非英语版本性能显著下降，在空间和几何推理任务上错误率高。

Conclusion: PISA-Bench为推进多语言多模态推理研究提供了有价值的资源，揭示了当前模型在跨语言和复杂推理任务上的局限性。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in
multimodal reasoning. However, existing benchmarks remain limited in terms of
high-quality, human-verified examples. Many current datasets rely on
synthetically generated content by large language models (LLMs). Furthermore,
most datasets are limited to English, as manual quality assurance of translated
samples is time-consuming and costly. To fill this gap, we introduce
PISA-Bench, a multilingual benchmark derived from English examples of the
expert-created PISA tests, a unified framework for the assessment of student
competencies in over eighty countries. Each example consists of human-extracted
instructions, questions, answer options, and images, enriched with question
type categories, and has been translated from English into five additional
languages (Spanish, German, Chinese, French, and Italian), resulting in a fully
parallel corpus covering six languages. We evaluate state-of-the-art
vision-language models on PISA-Bench and find that especially small models
(<20B parameters) fail to achieve high test scores. We further find substantial
performance degradation on non-English splits as well as high error-rates when
models are tasked with spatial and geometric reasoning. By releasing the
dataset and evaluation framework, we provide a resource for advancing research
on multilingual multimodal reasoning.

Motivation: 视觉-语言-动作模型在具身智能领域展现出强大能力，但其部署受到底层大规模基础模型带来的巨大计算和数据需求的严重阻碍，迫切需要解决这些挑战。

Method: 提出了一个统一分类法，将现有技术系统组织为三大核心支柱：高效模型设计（关注高效架构和模型压缩）、高效训练（减少模型学习过程中的计算负担）和高效数据收集（解决机器人数据获取和利用的瓶颈）。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) represent a significant frontier in
embodied intelligence, aiming to bridge digital knowledge with physical-world
interaction. While these models have demonstrated remarkable generalist
capabilities, their deployment is severely hampered by the substantial
computational and data requirements inherent to their underlying large-scale
foundation models. Motivated by the urgent need to address these challenges,
this survey presents the first comprehensive review of Efficient
Vision-Language-Action models (Efficient VLAs) across the entire
data-model-training process. Specifically, we introduce a unified taxonomy to
systematically organize the disparate efforts in this domain, categorizing
current techniques into three core pillars: (1) Efficient Model Design,
focusing on efficient architectures and model compression; (2) Efficient
Training, which reduces computational burdens during model learning; and (3)
Efficient Data Collection, which addresses the bottlenecks in acquiring and
utilizing robotic data. Through a critical review of state-of-the-art methods
within this framework, this survey not only establishes a foundational
reference for the community but also summarizes representative applications,
delineates key challenges, and charts a roadmap for future research. We
maintain a continuously updated project page to track our latest developments:

### [12] [Conflict Adaptation in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24804)
*Xiaoyang Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究发现12/13个视觉语言模型在顺序Stroop任务中表现出冲突适应行为，类似于人类认知控制。通过稀疏自编码器识别出任务相关超级节点，发现文本和颜色处理的不对称性，并分离出冲突调节超级节点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索人工智能模型是否表现出类似人类的认知控制特征，特别是冲突适应现象，以理解认知控制机制的表示基础。

Method: 使用顺序Stroop任务测试13个视觉语言模型，采用稀疏自编码器分析InternVL 3.5 4B模型中的任务相关超级节点表示。

Result: 12个模型表现出冲突适应行为；识别出文本和颜色处理的共享超级节点，其相对大小反映了人类阅读和颜色命名的自动性不对称；发现第24-25层的冲突调节超级节点，其消融会显著增加Stroop错误。

Conclusion: 视觉语言模型确实表现出类似人类的冲突适应行为，其内部表示结构与人类认知控制机制存在相似性，为理解AI认知控制提供了神经基础。

Abstract: A signature of human cognitive control is conflict adaptation: improved
performance on a high-conflict trial following another high-conflict trial.
This phenomenon offers an account for how cognitive control, a scarce resource,
is recruited. Using a sequential Stroop task, we find that 12 of 13
vision-language models (VLMs) tested exhibit behavior consistent with conflict
adaptation, with the lone exception likely reflecting a ceiling effect. To
understand the representational basis of this behavior, we use sparse
autoencoders (SAEs) to identify task-relevant supernodes in InternVL 3.5 4B.
Partially overlapping supernodes emerge for text and color in both early and
late layers, and their relative sizes mirror the automaticity asymmetry between
reading and color naming in humans. We further isolate a conflict-modulated
supernode in layers 24-25 whose ablation significantly increases Stroop errors
while minimally affecting congruent trials.

### [13] [DualCap: Enhancing Lightweight Image Captioning via Dual Retrieval with Similar Scenes Visual Prompts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24813)
*Binbin Li,Guimiao Yang,Zisen Qi,Haiping Wang,Yu Ding*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DualCap是一种新颖的轻量级检索增强图像描述方法，通过双检索机制生成视觉提示来丰富视觉表示，在减少可训练参数的同时实现竞争性性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有轻量级检索增强图像描述模型仅将检索数据用作文本提示，导致原始视觉特征未得到增强，特别是在对象细节和复杂场景方面存在语义鸿沟。

Method: 提出DualCap方法，采用双检索机制：标准图像到文本检索用于文本提示，新颖的图像到图像检索用于获取视觉相似场景。从视觉相似场景的标题中提取关键词语和短语，通过轻量级可训练特征融合网络将这些文本特征编码并与原始图像特征融合。

Result: 广泛实验表明，该方法在实现竞争性性能的同时，相比之前的视觉提示描述方法需要更少的可训练参数。

Conclusion: DualCap通过双检索机制有效增强了视觉表示，在保持轻量级特性的同时提升了图像描述质量。

Abstract: Recent lightweight retrieval-augmented image caption models often utilize
retrieved data solely as text prompts, thereby creating a semantic gap by
leaving the original visual features unenhanced, particularly for object
details or complex scenes. To address this limitation, we propose $DualCap$, a
novel approach that enriches the visual representation by generating a visual
prompt from retrieved similar images. Our model employs a dual retrieval
mechanism, using standard image-to-text retrieval for text prompts and a novel
image-to-image retrieval to source visually analogous scenes. Specifically,
salient keywords and phrases are derived from the captions of visually similar
scenes to capture key objects and similar details. These textual features are
then encoded and integrated with the original image features through a
lightweight, trainable feature fusion network. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance while requiring
fewer trainable parameters compared to previous visual-prompting captioning
approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一个三阶段框架，通过结合深度学习视觉架构和传统机器学习分类器，实现鱼类新鲜度的自动化视觉评估，在FFE数据集上达到85.99%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统感官评估鱼类新鲜度存在主观性、耗时和不一致的问题，现有深度学习方法在准确性和特征透明度方面仍有挑战。

Method: 三阶段框架：1) 微调五种先进视觉架构；2) 提取多级深度特征训练七种传统分类器；3) 使用LGBM、随机森林和Lasso进行特征选择。

Result: 最佳配置（Swin-Tiny特征+Extra Trees分类器+LGBM特征选择）在FFE数据集上达到85.99%准确率，比现有研究提升8.69-22.78%。

Conclusion: 该框架在视觉质量评估任务中表现出有效性和泛化能力，为鱼类新鲜度自动化评估提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Assessing fish freshness is vital for ensuring food safety and minimizing
economic losses in the seafood industry. However, traditional sensory
evaluation remains subjective, time-consuming, and inconsistent. Although
recent advances in deep learning have automated visual freshness prediction,
challenges related to accuracy and feature transparency persist. This study
introduces a unified three-stage framework that refines and leverages deep
visual representations for reliable fish freshness assessment. First, five
state-of-the-art vision architectures - ResNet-50, DenseNet-121,
EfficientNet-B0, ConvNeXt-Base, and Swin-Tiny - are fine-tuned to establish a
strong baseline. Next, multi-level deep features extracted from these backbones
are used to train seven classical machine learning classifiers, integrating
deep and traditional decision mechanisms. Finally, feature selection methods
based on Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM), Random Forest, and Lasso
identify a compact and informative subset of features. Experiments on the
Freshness of the Fish Eyes (FFE) dataset demonstrate that the best
configuration combining Swin-Tiny features, an Extra Trees classifier, and
LGBM-based feature selection achieves an accuracy of 85.99%, outperforming
recent studies on the same dataset by 8.69-22.78%. These findings confirm the
effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed framework for visual quality
evaluation tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视频假新闻检测基准只关注最终决策准确性，缺乏对整个检测过程的细粒度评估，使得检测过程成为黑箱。

Method: 基于经验分析构建MVFNDB基准，设计了MVFND-CoT框架，结合创作者添加内容和原始拍摄素材进行推理。

Result: 建立了包含9730个视频相关问题的基准，深入分析了影响准确性的深层因素，包括视频处理策略和视频特征与模型能力的对齐。

Conclusion: 该基准为未来MLLMs在视频假新闻检测领域的评估和发展奠定了坚实基础。

Abstract: The advent of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) has greatly advanced
research into applications for Video fake news detection (VFND) tasks.
Traditional video-based FND benchmarks typically focus on the accuracy of the
final decision, often failing to provide fine-grained assessments for the
entire detection process, making the detection process a black box. Therefore,
we introduce the MVFNDB (Multi-modal Video Fake News Detection Benchmark) based
on the empirical analysis, which provides foundation for tasks definition. The
benchmark comprises 10 tasks and is meticulously crafted to probe MLLMs'
perception, understanding, and reasoning capacities during detection, featuring
9730 human-annotated video-related questions based on a carefully constructed
taxonomy ability of VFND. To validate the impact of combining multiple features
on the final results, we design a novel framework named MVFND-CoT, which
incorporates both creator-added content and original shooting footage
reasoning. Building upon the benchmark, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the
deeper factors influencing accuracy, including video processing strategies and
the alignment between video features and model capabilities. We believe this
benchmark will lay a solid foundation for future evaluations and advancements
of MLLMs in the domain of video fake news detection.

Method: 采用后验安全编辑范式，构建多轮图像-文本交错数据集MR-SafeEdit，开发统一的MLLM模型SafeEditor进行多轮安全编辑。

Result: 实验结果表明SafeEditor优于现有安全方法，减少了过度拒绝，实现了更好的安全-效用平衡。

Conclusion: 提出的多轮安全编辑框架能够有效解决文本到图像模型的安全对齐问题，具有模型无关性和即插即用特性。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of text-to-image (T2I) models, ensuring their
safety has become increasingly critical. Existing safety approaches can be
categorized into training-time and inference-time methods. While inference-time
methods are widely adopted due to their cost-effectiveness, they often suffer
from limitations such as over-refusal and imbalance between safety and utility.
To address these challenges, we propose a multi-round safety editing framework
that functions as a model-agnostic, plug-and-play module, enabling efficient
safety alignment for any text-to-image model. Central to this framework is
MR-SafeEdit, a multi-round image-text interleaved dataset specifically
constructed for safety editing in text-to-image generation. We introduce a
post-hoc safety editing paradigm that mirrors the human cognitive process of
identifying and refining unsafe content. To instantiate this paradigm, we
develop SafeEditor, a unified MLLM capable of multi-round safety editing on
generated images. Experimental results show that SafeEditor surpasses prior
safety approaches by reducing over-refusal while achieving a more favorable
safety-utility balance.

Conclusion: 提出的MCIHN模型通过多路径跨模态交互有效解决了多模态情感识别中的挑战，实现了更好的情感识别效果。

Abstract: Multimodal emotion recognition is crucial for future human-computer
interaction. However, accurate emotion recognition still faces significant
challenges due to differences between different modalities and the difficulty
of characterizing unimodal emotional information. To solve these problems, a
hybrid network model based on multipath cross-modal interaction (MCIHN) is
proposed. First, adversarial autoencoders (AAE) are constructed separately for
each modality. The AAE learns discriminative emotion features and reconstructs
the features through a decoder to obtain more discriminative information about
the emotion classes. Then, the latent codes from the AAE of different
modalities are fed into a predefined Cross-modal Gate Mechanism model (CGMM) to
reduce the discrepancy between modalities, establish the emotional relationship
between interacting modalities, and generate the interaction features between
different modalities. Multimodal fusion using the Feature Fusion module (FFM)
for better emotion recognition. Experiments were conducted on publicly
available SIMS and MOSI datasets, demonstrating that MCIHN achieves superior
performance.

Motivation: 流匹配取得了显著成功，但其生成过程质量的影响因素仍不清楚。本文旨在通过去噪视角来实证探究流匹配的生成过程。

Method: 建立流匹配模型与去噪器的形式联系，设计原则性和受控的扰动（噪声和漂移）来影响样本生成，分析生成过程的不同动态阶段。

Result: 揭示了生成过程的不同动态阶段，能够精确描述去噪器在生成过程的哪个阶段成功或失败，以及这为什么重要。

Conclusion: 通过去噪视角为流匹配生成过程提供了新的理解，建立了流匹配与去噪器的比较框架，能够精确分析生成过程的动态特性。

Abstract: Flow matching has achieved remarkable success, yet the factors influencing
the quality of its generation process remain poorly understood. In this work,
we adopt a denoising perspective and design a framework to empirically probe
the generation process. Laying down the formal connections between flow
matching models and denoisers, we provide a common ground to compare their
performances on generation and denoising. This enables the design of principled
and controlled perturbations to influence sample generation: noise and drift.
This leads to new insights on the distinct dynamical phases of the generative
process, enabling us to precisely characterize at which stage of the generative
process denoisers succeed or fail and why this matters.

TL;DR: 将果实成熟度估计从离散分类问题重新定义为连续概率学习任务，提出在RT-DETRv2检测器中添加概率头来预测成熟度分布和不确定性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度学习方法将成熟度作为离散分类问题处理，这与生物成熟过程的连续性本质相冲突，导致信息丢失和类别边界模糊

Method: 对最先进的实时目标检测器RT-DETRv2进行架构修改，引入专用的概率头，使模型能够为每个检测对象预测成熟度谱上的连续分布

Conclusion: 概率方法提供了更丰富、更符合生物学的植物成熟度表示，为现代农业中更智能、不确定性感知的自动化系统铺平了道路

Abstract: Maturity estimation of fruits and vegetables is a critical task for
agricultural automation, directly impacting yield prediction and robotic
harvesting. Current deep learning approaches predominantly treat maturity as a
discrete classification problem (e.g., unripe, ripe, overripe). This rigid
formulation, however, fundamentally conflicts with the continuous nature of the
biological ripening process, leading to information loss and ambiguous class
boundaries. In this paper, we challenge this paradigm by reframing maturity
estimation as a continuous, probabilistic learning task. We propose a novel
architectural modification to the state-of-the-art, real-time object detector,
RT-DETRv2, by introducing a dedicated probabilistic head. This head enables the
model to predict a continuous distribution over the maturity spectrum for each
detected object, simultaneously learning the mean maturity state and its
associated uncertainty. This uncertainty measure is crucial for downstream
decision-making in robotics, providing a confidence score for tasks like
selective harvesting. Our model not only provides a far richer and more
biologically plausible representation of plant maturity but also maintains
exceptional detection performance, achieving a mean Average Precision (mAP) of
85.6\% on a challenging, large-scale fruit dataset. We demonstrate through
extensive experiments that our probabilistic approach offers more granular and
accurate maturity assessments than its classification-based counterparts,
paving the way for more intelligent, uncertainty-aware automated systems in
modern agriculture

Motivation: 解决现有基于骨架的手语识别方法中OpenPose提取关键点导致的时间性能瓶颈问题，同时避免直接使用轻量级MediaPipe带来的精度下降。

Method: 采用关键点子集选择策略优化识别性能，结合样条插值技术处理缺失关键点问题，使用轻量级MediaPipe替代OpenPose进行关键点提取。

Result: 适当的关键点子集实现了与最先进方法相当或更优的性能，同时处理时间相比Alves等人(2024)的方法减少了5倍以上，样条插值显著提高了准确性。

Conclusion: 精心选择关键点结合简单插值技术，能够实现高效准确的手势识别，为可扩展的手语识别系统铺平道路。

Abstract: This paper investigates the feasibility of using lightweight body landmark
detection for the recognition of isolated signs in Brazilian Sign Language
(LIBRAS). Although the skeleton-based approach by Alves et al. (2024) enabled
substantial improvements in recognition performance, the use of OpenPose for
landmark extraction hindered time performance. In a preliminary investigation,
we observed that simply replacing OpenPose with the lightweight MediaPipe,
while improving processing speed, significantly reduced accuracy. To overcome
this limitation, we explored landmark subset selection strategies aimed at
optimizing recognition performance. Experimental results showed that a proper
landmark subset achieves comparable or superior performance to state-of-the-art
methods while reducing processing time by more than 5X compared to Alves et al.
(2024). As an additional contribution, we demonstrated that spline-based
imputation effectively mitigates missing landmark issues, leading to
substantial accuracy gains. These findings highlight that careful landmark
selection, combined with simple imputation techniques, enables efficient and
accurate isolated sign recognition, paving the way for scalable Sign Language
Recognition systems.

Abstract: Traffic congestion is becoming a challenge in the rapidly growing urban
cities, resulting in increasing delays and inefficiencies within urban
transportation systems. To address this issue a comprehensive methodology is
designed to optimize traffic flow and minimize delays. The framework is
structured with three primary components: (a) vehicle detection, (b) traffic
prediction, and (c) traffic signal optimization. This paper presents the first
component, vehicle detection. The methodology involves analyzing multiple
sequential frames from a camera feed to compute the background, i.e. the
underlying roadway, by averaging pixel values over time. The computed
background is then utilized to extract the foreground, where the Density-Based
Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm is applied to
detect vehicles. With its computational efficiency and minimal infrastructure
modification requirements, the proposed methodology offers a practical and
scalable solution for real-world deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到视频生成模型难以泛化到非常规相机运动，因为缺乏包含这些运动的训练视频，这限制了创造原创艺术视频的能力。

Method: 使用Unity等引擎渲染低多边形3D场景中的基本几何体生成合成视频，采用多重解耦策略将相机运动学习与合成外观伪影分离，确保更稳健的运动表示。

Result: 能够合成广泛精确控制的复杂相机运动，仅使用简单的合成数据，这些数据通常包含低多边形3D场景中的基本几何体。

Conclusion: VividCam通过合成数据成功实现了复杂相机运动的精确控制，为创造艺术性视频提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Although recent text-to-video generative models are getting more capable of
following external camera controls, imposed by either text descriptions or
camera trajectories, they still struggle to generalize to unconventional camera
motions, which is crucial in creating truly original and artistic videos. The
challenge lies in the difficulty of finding sufficient training videos with the
intended uncommon camera motions. To address this challenge, we propose
VividCam, a training paradigm that enables diffusion models to learn complex
camera motions from synthetic videos, releasing the reliance on collecting
realistic training videos. VividCam incorporates multiple disentanglement
strategies that isolates camera motion learning from synthetic appearance
artifacts, ensuring more robust motion representation and mitigating domain
shift. We demonstrate that our design synthesizes a wide range of precisely
controlled and complex camera motions using surprisingly simple synthetic data.
Notably, this synthetic data often consists of basic geometries within a
low-poly 3D scene and can be efficiently rendered by engines like Unity. Our
video results can be found in https://wuqiuche.github.io/VividCamDemoPage/ .

Conclusion: 该方法为理解多视图变换器的内部机制提供了新视角，有助于改进模型设计和在安全关键应用中的可靠使用。

Abstract: Multi-view transformers such as DUSt3R are revolutionizing 3D vision by
solving 3D tasks in a feed-forward manner. However, contrary to previous
optimization-based pipelines, the inner mechanisms of multi-view transformers
are unclear. Their black-box nature makes further improvements beyond data
scaling challenging and complicates usage in safety- and reliability-critical
applications. Here, we present an approach for probing and visualizing 3D
representations from the residual connections of the multi-view transformers'
layers. In this manner, we investigate a variant of the DUSt3R model, shedding
light on the development of its latent state across blocks, the role of the
individual layers, and suggest how it differs from methods with stronger
inductive biases of explicit global pose. Finally, we show that the
investigated variant of DUSt3R estimates correspondences that are refined with
reconstructed geometry. The code used for the analysis is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态学习中，主导模态往往会压制其他模态，限制了模型的泛化能力。需要一种方法来平衡不同模态的贡献，让模型能够充分利用所有模态的互补特征。

Method: M-SAM框架包含三个步骤：1）使用Shapley值识别主导模态；2）分解损失景观，调制损失以优先考虑主导模态的鲁棒性；3）通过调制梯度的反向传播更新权重。

Result: 在四个不同数据集上的实验表明，M-SAM优于最新的优化和梯度操作方法，显著平衡和改善了多模态学习性能。

Conclusion: M-SAM是一个模型无关的框架，适用于多种模态和融合场景，能够确保主导模态的鲁棒学习，同时增强其他模态的贡献，提升整体性能。

Abstract: In multimodal learning, dominant modalities often overshadow others, limiting
generalization. We propose Modality-Aware Sharpness-Aware Minimization (M-SAM),
a model-agnostic framework that applies to many modalities and supports early
and late fusion scenarios. In every iteration, M-SAM in three steps optimizes
learning. \textbf{First, it identifies the dominant modality} based on
modalities' contribution in the accuracy using Shapley. \textbf{Second, it
decomposes the loss landscape}, or in another language, it modulates the loss
to prioritize the robustness of the model in favor of the dominant modality,
and \textbf{third, M-SAM updates the weights} by backpropagation of modulated
gradients. This ensures robust learning for the dominant modality while
enhancing contributions from others, allowing the model to explore and exploit
complementary features that strengthen overall performance. Extensive
experiments on four diverse datasets show that M-SAM outperforms the latest
state-of-the-art optimization and gradient manipulation methods and
significantly balances and improves multimodal learning.

Conclusion: IBIS架构成功解决了Wi-Fi感知中的过拟合问题，实现了优异的运动识别性能，为相关应用提供了可靠的技术方案。

Abstract: The increasing interest in Wi-Fi sensing stems from its potential to capture
environmental data in a low-cost, non-intrusive way, making it ideal for
applications like healthcare, space occupancy analysis, and gesture-based IoT
control. However, a major limitation in this field is the common problem of
overfitting, where models perform well on training data but fail to generalize
to new data. To overcome this, we introduce a novel hybrid architecture that
integrates Inception-BiLSTM with a Support Vector Machine (SVM), which we refer
to as IBIS. Our IBIS approach is uniquely engineered to improve model
generalization and create more robust classification boundaries. By applying
this method to Doppler-derived data, we achieve a movement recognition accuracy
of nearly 99%. Comprehensive performance metrics and confusion matrices confirm
the significant effectiveness of our proposed solution.

Abstract: Pressure ulcers (PUs) are a serious and prevalent healthcare concern.
Accurate classification of PU severity (Stages I-IV) is essential for proper
treatment but remains challenging due to subtle visual distinctions and
subjective interpretation, leading to variability among clinicians. Prior
AI-based approaches using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision
Transformers (ViTs) achieved promising accuracy but offered limited
interpretability. We present FT-ARM (Fine-Tuned Agentic Reflection Multimodal
model), a fine-tuned multimodal large language model (MLLM) with an agentic
self-reflection mechanism for pressure ulcer severity classification. Inspired
by clinician-style diagnostic reassessment, FT-ARM iteratively refines its
predictions by reasoning over visual features and encoded clinical knowledge
from text, enhancing both accuracy and consistency. On the publicly available
Pressure Injury Image Dataset (PIID), FT-ARM, fine-tuned from LLaMA 3.2 90B,
achieved 85% accuracy in classifying PU stages I-IV, surpassing prior CNN-based
models by +4%. Unlike earlier CNN/ViT studies that relied solely on offline
evaluations, FT-ARM is designed and tested for live inference, reflecting
real-time deployment conditions. Furthermore, it produces clinically grounded
natural-language explanations, improving interpretability and trust. By
integrating fine-tuning and reflective reasoning across multimodal inputs,
FT-ARM advances the reliability, transparency, and clinical applicability of
automated wound assessment systems, addressing the critical need for consistent
and explainable PU staging to support improved patient care.

Abstract: Developing a highly accurate automatic license plate recognition system
(ALPR) is challenging due to environmental factors such as lighting, rain, and
dust. Additional difficulties include high vehicle speeds, varying camera
angles, and low-quality or low-resolution images. ALPR is vital in traffic
control, parking, vehicle tracking, toll collection, and law enforcement
applications. This paper proposes a deep learning strategy using YOLOv8 for
license plate detection and recognition tasks. This method seeks to enhance the
performance of the model using datasets from Ontario, Quebec, California, and
New York State. It achieved an impressive recall rate of 94% on the dataset
from the Center for Pattern Recognition and Machine Intelligence (CENPARMI) and
91% on the UFPR-ALPR dataset. In addition, our method follows a semi-supervised
learning framework, combining a small set of manually labeled data with
pseudo-labels generated by Grounding DINO to train our detection model.
Grounding DINO, a powerful vision-language model, automatically annotates many
images with bounding boxes for license plates, thereby minimizing the reliance
on labor-intensive manual labeling. By integrating human-verified and
model-generated annotations, we can scale our dataset efficiently while
maintaining label quality, which significantly enhances the training process
and overall model performance. Furthermore, it reports character error rates
for both datasets, providing additional insight into system performance.

Conclusion: 建立了一种新的临床可行VLM-based CAD系统范式，通过有效的融合机制充分利用影像数据和上下文患者信息

Abstract: Breast cancer remains the most commonly diagnosed malignancy among women in
the developed world. Early detection through mammography screening plays a
pivotal role in reducing mortality rates. While computer-aided diagnosis (CAD)
systems have shown promise in assisting radiologists, existing approaches face
critical limitations in clinical deployment - particularly in handling the
nuanced interpretation of multi-modal data and feasibility due to the
requirement of prior clinical history. This study introduces a novel framework
that synergistically combines visual features from 2D mammograms with
structured textual descriptors derived from easily accessible clinical metadata
and synthesized radiological reports through innovative tokenization modules.
Our proposed methods in this study demonstrate that strategic integration of
convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) with language representations achieves
superior performance to vision transformer-based models while handling
high-resolution images and enabling practical deployment across diverse
populations. By evaluating it on multi-national cohort screening mammograms,
our multi-modal approach achieves superior performance in cancer detection and
calcification identification compared to unimodal baselines, with particular
improvements. The proposed method establishes a new paradigm for developing
clinically viable VLM-based CAD systems that effectively leverage imaging data
and contextual patient information through effective fusion mechanisms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于视觉语言模型的大规模预训练成本高昂，研究者很少从头训练视觉语言模型，因此需要提高效率的方法

Method: DRIP方法根据输入图像动态合并视觉编码器深层中的token，通过可解释的池化实现动态补丁减少

Result: 在ImageNet从头训练和CLIP对比预训练中，显著减少GFLOPs同时保持分类/零样本性能；在大型生物学数据集上的持续预训练验证了方法的有效性

Conclusion: DRIP方法能够有效减少视觉语言模型的计算成本，同时维持性能，在科学领域也有应用潜力

Abstract: Recently, the advances in vision-language models, including contrastive
pretraining and instruction tuning, have greatly pushed the frontier of
multimodal AI. However, owing to the large-scale and hence expensive
pretraining, the efficiency concern has discouraged researchers from attempting
to pretrain a vision language model from scratch. In this work, we propose
Dynamic patch Reduction via Interpretable Pooling (DRIP), which adapts to the
input images and dynamically merges tokens in the deeper layers of a visual
encoder. Our results on both ImageNet training from scratch and CLIP
contrastive pretraining demonstrate a significant GFLOP reduction while
maintaining comparable classification/zero-shot performance. To further
validate our proposed method, we conduct continual pretraining on a large
biology dataset, extending its impact into scientific domains.

Abstract: Zero-shot scene understanding in real-world settings presents major
challenges due to the complexity and variability of natural scenes, where
models must recognize new objects, actions, and contexts without prior labeled
examples. This work proposes a vision-language integration framework that
unifies pre-trained visual encoders (e.g., CLIP, ViT) and large language models
(e.g., GPT-based architectures) to achieve semantic alignment between visual
and textual modalities. The goal is to enable robust zero-shot comprehension of
scenes by leveraging natural language as a bridge to generalize over unseen
categories and contexts. Our approach develops a unified model that embeds
visual inputs and textual prompts into a shared space, followed by multimodal
fusion and reasoning layers for contextual interpretation. Experiments on
Visual Genome, COCO, ADE20K, and custom real-world datasets demonstrate
significant gains over state-of-the-art zero-shot models in object recognition,
activity detection, and scene captioning. The proposed system achieves up to
18% improvement in top-1 accuracy and notable gains in semantic coherence
metrics, highlighting the effectiveness of cross-modal alignment and language
grounding in enhancing generalization for real-world scene understanding.

Abstract: Recent advancements in personalized image generation have significantly
improved facial identity preservation, particularly in fields such as
entertainment and social media. However, existing methods still struggle to
achieve precise control over facial attributes in a per-subject-tuning-free
(PSTF) way. Tuning-based techniques like PreciseControl have shown promise by
providing fine-grained control over facial features, but they often require
extensive technical expertise and additional training data, limiting their
accessibility. In contrast, PSTF approaches simplify the process by enabling
image generation from a single facial input, but they lack precise control over
facial attributes. In this paper, we introduce a novel, PSTF method that
enables both precise control over facial attributes and high-fidelity
preservation of facial identity. Our approach utilizes a face recognition model
to extract facial identity features, which are then mapped into the $W^+$
latent space of StyleGAN2 using the e4e encoder. We further enhance the model
with a Triplet-Decoupled Cross-Attention module, which integrates facial
identity, attribute features, and text embeddings into the UNet architecture,
ensuring clean separation of identity and attribute information. Trained on the
FFHQ dataset, our method allows for the generation of personalized images with
fine-grained control over facial attributes, while without requiring additional
fine-tuning or training data for individual identities. We demonstrate that our
approach successfully balances personalization with precise facial attribute
control, offering a more efficient and user-friendly solution for high-quality,
adaptable facial image synthesis. The code is publicly available at

Conclusion: VDRP框架有效解决了类内多样性和类间视觉纠缠问题，显著提升了零样本人-物交互检测的性能。

Abstract: Zero-shot Human-Object Interaction detection aims to localize humans and
objects in an image and recognize their interaction, even when specific
verb-object pairs are unseen during training. Recent works have shown promising
results using prompt learning with pretrained vision-language models such as
CLIP, which align natural language prompts with visual features in a shared
embedding space. However, existing approaches still fail to handle the visual
complexity of interaction, including (1) intra-class visual diversity, where
instances of the same verb appear in diverse poses and contexts, and (2)
inter-class visual entanglement, where distinct verbs yield visually similar
patterns. To address these challenges, we propose VDRP, a framework for Visual
Diversity and Region-aware Prompt learning. First, we introduce a visual
diversity-aware prompt learning strategy that injects group-wise visual
variance into the context embedding. We further apply Gaussian perturbation to
encourage the prompts to capture diverse visual variations of a verb. Second,
we retrieve region-specific concepts from the human, object, and union regions.
These are used to augment the diversity-aware prompt embeddings, yielding
region-aware prompts that enhance verb-level discrimination. Experiments on the
HICO-DET benchmark demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance under four zero-shot evaluation settings, effectively addressing
both intra-class diversity and inter-class visual entanglement. Code is

Abstract: 3D reconstruction of indoor and urban environments is a prominent research
topic with various downstream applications. However, existing geometric priors
for addressing low-texture regions in indoor and urban settings often lack
global consistency. Moreover, Gaussian Splatting and implicit SDF fields often
suffer from discontinuities or exhibit computational inefficiencies, resulting
in a loss of detail. To address these issues, we propose an Atlanta-world
guided implicit-structured Gaussian Splatting that achieves smooth indoor and
urban scene reconstruction while preserving high-frequency details and
rendering efficiency. By leveraging the Atlanta-world model, we ensure the
accurate surface reconstruction for low-texture regions, while the proposed
novel implicit-structured GS representations provide smoothness without
sacrificing efficiency and high-frequency details. Specifically, we propose a
semantic GS representation to predict the probability of all semantic regions
and deploy a structure plane regularization with learnable plane indicators for
global accurate surface reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both indoor and urban
scenes, delivering superior surface reconstruction quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Region-CAM是一种新的类激活映射方法，通过提取语义信息图和语义信息传播，解决了传统CAM方法只能突出最具判别性区域的问题，在弱监督语义分割和物体定位任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CAM方法只能突出目标的最具判别性区域，这些区域往往无法覆盖整个物体且与物体边界不对齐，限制了弱监督学习任务的性能，特别是需要像素级精确激活图的弱监督语义分割任务。

Method: Region-CAM通过提取语义信息图(SIMs)并进行语义信息传播(SIP)，同时考虑基线分类模型各阶段的梯度和特征，生成更完整的物体区域激活图。

Result: 在PASCAL VOC数据集上，Region-CAM达到60.12%和58.43%的mIoU，比原始CAM提升13.61%和13.13%；在MS COCO验证集上达到36.38% mIoU，提升16.23%；在ILSVRC2012验证集上达到51.7%的Top-1定位精度，比LayerCAM提升4.5%。

Conclusion: Region-CAM能够生成覆盖更完整物体区域且边界精确的激活图，在弱监督语义分割和物体定位任务中显著优于传统CAM方法。

Abstract: Class Activation Mapping (CAM) methods are widely applied in weakly
supervised learning tasks due to their ability to highlight object regions.
However, conventional CAM methods highlight only the most discriminative
regions of the target. These highlighted regions often fail to cover the entire
object and are frequently misaligned with object boundaries, thereby limiting
the performance of downstream weakly supervised learning tasks, particularly
Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS), which demands pixel-wise
accurate activation maps to get the best results. To alleviate the above
problems, we propose a novel activation method, Region-CAM. Distinct from
network feature weighting approaches, Region-CAM generates activation maps by
extracting semantic information maps (SIMs) and performing semantic information
propagation (SIP) by considering both gradients and features in each of the
stages of the baseline classification model. Our approach highlights a greater
proportion of object regions while ensuring activation maps to have precise
boundaries that align closely with object edges. Region-CAM achieves 60.12% and
58.43% mean intersection over union (mIoU) using the baseline model on the
PASCAL VOC training and validation datasets, respectively, which are
improvements of 13.61% and 13.13% over the original CAM (46.51% and 45.30%). On
the MS COCO validation set, Region-CAM achieves 36.38%, a 16.23% improvement
over the original CAM (20.15%). We also demonstrate the superiority of
Region-CAM in object localization tasks, using the ILSVRC2012 validation set.
Region-CAM achieves 51.7% in Top-1 Localization accuracy Loc1. Compared with
LayerCAM, an activation method designed for weakly supervised object
localization, Region-CAM achieves 4.5% better performance in Loc1.

Abstract: Object detection in civil engineering applications is constrained by limited

architecture combining YOLOv12 with DINOv3 self-supervised vision transformers
for data-efficient detection. DINOv3 features are strategically integrated at
two locations: input preprocessing (P0) and mid-backbone enhancement (P3).
Experimental validation demonstrates substantial improvements: Tunnel Segment
Crack detection (648 images) achieves 12.4% improvement, Construction PPE (1K
images) gains 13.7%, and KITTI (7K images) shows 88.6% improvement, while
maintaining real-time inference (30-47 FPS). Systematic ablation across five
YOLO scales and nine DINOv3 variants reveals that Medium-scale architectures
achieve optimal performance with DualP0P3 integration (55.77% mAP@0.5), while
Small-scale requires Triple Integration (53.63%). The 2-4x inference overhead
(21-33ms versus 8-16ms baseline) remains acceptable for field deployment on
NVIDIA RTX 5090. DINO-YOLO establishes state-of-the-art performance for civil

Abstract: The rise of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has made detecting
AI-generated images a critical challenge for ensuring authenticity. Existing
reconstruction-based methods lack theoretical foundations and on empirical
heuristics, limiting interpretability and reliability. In this paper, we
introduce the Jacobian-Spectral Lower Bound for reconstruction error from a
geometric perspective, showing that real images off the reconstruction manifold
exhibit a non-trivial error lower bound, while generated images on the manifold
have near-zero error. Furthermore, we reveal the limitations of existing
methods that rely on static reconstruction error from a single pass. These
methods often fail when some real images exhibit lower error than generated
ones. This counterintuitive behavior reduces detection accuracy and requires
data-specific threshold tuning, limiting their applicability in real-world
scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose ReGap, a training-free
method that computes dynamic reconstruction error by leveraging structured
editing operations to introduce controlled perturbations. This enables
measuring error changes before and after editing, improving detection accuracy
by enhancing error separation. Experimental results show that our method
outperforms existing baselines, exhibits robustness to common post-processing
operations and generalizes effectively across diverse conditions.

Abstract: Current 3D scene understanding methods are limited by offline-collected
multi-view data or pre-constructed 3D geometry. In this paper, we present
ExtractAnything3D (EA3D), a unified online framework for open-world 3D object
extraction that enables simultaneous geometric reconstruction and holistic
scene understanding. Given a streaming video, EA3D dynamically interprets each
frame using vision-language and 2D vision foundation encoders to extract
object-level knowledge. This knowledge is integrated and embedded into a
Gaussian feature map via a feed-forward online update strategy. We then
iteratively estimate visual odometry from historical frames and incrementally
update online Gaussian features with new observations. A recurrent joint
optimization module directs the model's attention to regions of interest,
simultaneously enhancing both geometric reconstruction and semantic
understanding. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks and tasks,
including photo-realistic rendering, semantic and instance segmentation, 3D
bounding box and semantic occupancy estimation, and 3D mesh generation,
demonstrate the effectiveness of EA3D. Our method establishes a unified and
efficient framework for joint online 3D reconstruction and holistic scene
understanding, enabling a broad range of downstream tasks.

Abstract: Thin film interferometry is a powerful technique for non-invasively measuring
liquid film thickness with applications in ophthalmology, but its clinical
translation is hindered by the challenges in reconstructing thickness profiles
from interference patterns - an ill-posed inverse problem complicated by phase
periodicity, imaging noise and ambient artifacts. Traditional reconstruction
methods are either computationally intensive, sensitive to noise, or require
manual expert analysis, which is impractical for real-time diagnostics. To
address this challenge, here we present a vision transformer-based approach for
real-time inference of thin liquid film thickness profiles directly from
isolated interferograms. Trained on a hybrid dataset combining
physiologically-relevant synthetic and experimental tear film data, our model
leverages long-range spatial correlations to resolve phase ambiguities and
reconstruct temporally coherent thickness profiles in a single forward pass
from dynamic interferograms acquired in vivo and ex vivo. The network
demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on noisy, rapidly-evolving films with
motion artifacts, overcoming limitations of conventional phase-unwrapping and
iterative fitting methods. Our data-driven approach enables automated,
consistent thickness reconstruction at real-time speeds on consumer hardware,
opening new possibilities for continuous monitoring of pre-lens ocular tear
films and non-invasive diagnosis of conditions such as the dry eye disease.

Abstract: Deep generative models, such as diffusion models, have shown promising
progress in image generation and audio generation via simplified continuity
assumptions. However, the development of generative modeling techniques for
generating multi-modal data, such as parametric CAD sequences, still lags
behind due to the challenges in addressing long-range constraints and parameter
sensitivity. In this work, we propose a novel framework for quantitatively
constrained CAD generation, termed Target-Guided Bayesian Flow Network (TGBFN).
For the first time, TGBFN handles the multi-modality of CAD sequences (i.e.,
discrete commands and continuous parameters) in a unified continuous and
differentiable parameter space rather than in the discrete data space. In
addition, TGBFN penetrates the parameter update kernel and introduces a guided

Conclusion: D²GS框架证明了无需LiDAR即可实现高质量城市场景重建的可行性，通过深度预测和扩散先验获得了比LiDAR更优的几何先验

Abstract: Recently, Gaussian Splatting (GS) has shown great potential for urban scene
reconstruction in the field of autonomous driving. However, current urban scene
reconstruction methods often depend on multimodal sensors as inputs,
\textit{i.e.} LiDAR and images. Though the geometry prior provided by LiDAR
point clouds can largely mitigate ill-posedness in reconstruction, acquiring
such accurate LiDAR data is still challenging in practice: i) precise
spatiotemporal calibration between LiDAR and other sensors is required, as they
may not capture data simultaneously; ii) reprojection errors arise from spatial
misalignment when LiDAR and cameras are mounted at different locations. To
avoid the difficulty of acquiring accurate LiDAR depth, we propose $D^2GS$, a
LiDAR-free urban scene reconstruction framework. In this work, we obtain
geometry priors that are as effective as LiDAR while being denser and more
accurate. $\textbf{First}$, we initialize a dense point cloud by
back-projecting multi-view metric depth predictions. This point cloud is then
optimized by a Progressive Pruning strategy to improve the global consistency.
$\textbf{Second}$, we jointly refine Gaussian geometry and predicted dense
metric depth via a Depth Enhancer. Specifically, we leverage diffusion priors
from a depth foundation model to enhance the depth maps rendered by Gaussians.
In turn, the enhanced depths provide stronger geometric constraints during
Gaussian training. $\textbf{Finally}$, we improve the accuracy of ground
geometry by constraining the shape and normal attributes of Gaussians within
road regions. Extensive experiments on the Waymo dataset demonstrate that our
method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, producing more
accurate geometry even when compared with those using ground-truth LiDAR data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统语义分割方法使用固定参数分类器，无法适应每张图像不同的类别分布，且数据集级别的类别不平衡会导致模型偏向多数类别，限制了在少数类别区域的分割效果。

Method: 使用内存库学习数据集级别的上下文信息，结合当前图像的类别特定上下文信息来改进分类器；采用教师-学生网络范式，教师网络通过真实标签动态调整上下文信息并将知识传递给学生网络。

Result: 在ADE20K、COCO-Stuff10K和Pascal-Context等多个数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: ECAC能够有效解决语义分割中的类别不平衡问题，通过动态调整分类器参数来适应不同图像的特定类别分布，显著提升了分割性能。

Abstract: Prevalent semantic segmentation methods generally adopt a vanilla classifier
to categorize each pixel into specific classes.
  Although such a classifier learns global information from the training data,
this information is represented by a set of fixed parameters (weights and
biases).
  However, each image has a different class distribution, which prevents the
classifier from addressing the unique characteristics of individual images.
  At the dataset level, class imbalance leads to segmentation results being
biased towards majority classes, limiting the model's effectiveness in
identifying and segmenting minority class regions.
  In this paper, we propose an Extended Context-Aware Classifier (ECAC) that
dynamically adjusts the classifier using global (dataset-level) and local
(image-level) contextual information.
  Specifically, we leverage a memory bank to learn dataset-level contextual
information of each class, incorporating the class-specific contextual
information from the current image to improve the classifier for precise pixel
labeling.
  Additionally, a teacher-student network paradigm is adopted, where the domain
expert (teacher network) dynamically adjusts contextual information with ground
truth and transfers knowledge to the student network.
  Comprehensive experiments illustrate that the proposed ECAC can achieve
state-of-the-art performance across several datasets, including ADE20K,
COCO-Stuff10K, and Pascal-Context.

Abstract: In recent years, test-time adaptive object detection has attracted increasing
attention due to its unique advantages in online domain adaptation, which
aligns more closely with real-world application scenarios. However, existing
approaches heavily rely on source-derived statistical characteristics while
making the strong assumption that the source and target domains share an
identical category space. In this paper, we propose the first foundation
model-powered test-time adaptive object detection method that eliminates the
need for source data entirely and overcomes traditional closed-set limitations.
Specifically, we design a Multi-modal Prompt-based Mean-Teacher framework for
vision-language detector-driven test-time adaptation, which incorporates text
and visual prompt tuning to adapt both language and vision representation
spaces on the test data in a parameter-efficient manner. Correspondingly, we
propose a Test-time Warm-start strategy tailored for the visual prompts to
effectively preserve the representation capability of the vision branch.
Furthermore, to guarantee high-quality pseudo-labels in every test batch, we
maintain an Instance Dynamic Memory (IDM) module that stores high-quality
pseudo-labels from previous test samples, and propose two novel
strategies-Memory Enhancement and Memory Hallucination-to leverage IDM's
high-quality instances for enhancing original predictions and hallucinating
images without available pseudo-labels, respectively. Extensive experiments on
cross-corruption and cross-dataset benchmarks demonstrate that our method
consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods, and can adapt to
arbitrary cross-domain and cross-category target data. Code is available at

paper presents a multimodal artificial intelligence (AI) diagnostic framework
integrating image analysis, thermal imaging, and audio signal processing for
early detection of three major health conditions: skin cancer, vascular blood

convolutional neural network was trained on the ISIC 2019 dataset for skin
lesion classification, achieving 89.3% accuracy, 91.6% sensitivity, and 88.2%

synthetic and clinical data. For cardiopulmonary analysis, lung and heart sound
datasets from PhysioNet and Pascal were processed using Mel-Frequency Cepstral
Coefficients (MFCC) and classified via Random Forest, reaching 87.2% accuracy
and 85.7% sensitivity. Comparative evaluation against state-of-the-art models
demonstrates that the proposed system achieves competitive results while
remaining lightweight and deployable on low-cost devices. The framework
provides a promising step toward scalable, real-time, and accessible AI-based

Conclusion: U-CAN框架在无监督设置下实现了有效的去噪性能，其几何一致性约束具有跨领域适用性。

Abstract: Point clouds captured by scanning sensors are often perturbed by noise, which
have a highly negative impact on downstream tasks (e.g. surface reconstruction
and shape understanding). Previous works mostly focus on training neural
networks with noisy-clean point cloud pairs for learning denoising priors,
which requires extensively manual efforts. In this work, we introduce U-CAN, an
Unsupervised framework for point cloud denoising with Consistency-Aware
Noise2Noise matching. Specifically, we leverage a neural network to infer a
multi-step denoising path for each point of a shape or scene with a noise to
noise matching scheme. We achieve this by a novel loss which enables
statistical reasoning on multiple noisy point cloud observations. We further
introduce a novel constraint on the denoised geometry consistency for learning
consistency-aware denoising patterns. We justify that the proposed constraint
is a general term which is not limited to 3D domain and can also contribute to
the area of 2D image denoising. Our evaluations under the widely used
benchmarks in point cloud denoising, upsampling and image denoising show
significant improvement over the state-of-the-art unsupervised methods, where
U-CAN also produces comparable results with the supervised methods.

Result: 在DiLiGenT基准测试中，MSF-Net在表面法线估计精度上显著超越先前最先进方法。

Conclusion: MSF-Net通过改进多阶段特征提取和特征交互，有效提升了光度立体视觉的表面法线估计精度。

Abstract: Photometric stereo is a technique aimed at determining surface normals
through the utilization of shading cues derived from images taken under
different lighting conditions. However, existing learning-based approaches
often fail to accurately capture features at multiple stages and do not
adequately promote interaction between these features. Consequently, these
models tend to extract redundant features, especially in areas with intricate
details such as wrinkles and edges. To tackle these issues, we propose MSF-Net,
a novel framework for extracting information at multiple stages, paired with
selective update strategy, aiming to extract high-quality feature information,
which is critical for accurate normal construction. Additionally, we have
developed a feature fusion module to improve the interplay among different
features. Experimental results on the DiLiGenT benchmark show that our proposed
MSF-Net significantly surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods in the
accuracy of surface normal estimation.

Abstract: Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA) is emerging as a compelling solution for
medical image segmentation under privacy constraints, yet current approaches
often ignore sample difficulty and struggle with noisy supervision under domain
shift. We present a new SFDA framework that leverages Hard Sample Selection and
Denoised Patch Mixing to progressively align target distributions. First,
unlabeled images are partitioned into reliable and unreliable subsets through
entropy-similarity analysis, allowing adaptation to start from easy samples and
gradually incorporate harder ones. Next, pseudo-labels are refined via Monte
Carlo-based denoising masks, which suppress unreliable pixels and stabilize
training. Finally, intra- and inter-domain objectives mix patches between
subsets, transferring reliable semantics while mitigating noise. Experiments on
benchmark datasets show consistent gains over prior SFDA and UDA methods,
delivering more accurate boundary delineation and achieving state-of-the-art
Dice and ASSD scores. Our study highlights the importance of progressive
adaptation and denoised supervision for robust segmentation under domain shift.

Abstract: Rectified flow is a generative model that learns smooth transport mappings
between two distributions through an ordinary differential equation (ODE).
Unlike diffusion-based generative models, which require costly numerical
integration of a generative ODE to sample images with state-of-the-art quality,
rectified flow uses an iterative process called reflow to learn smooth and
straight ODE paths. This allows for relatively simple and efficient generation
of high-quality images. However, rectified flow still faces several challenges.
1) The reflow process requires a large number of generative pairs to preserve
the target distribution, leading to significant computational costs. 2) Since
the model is typically trained using only generated image pairs, its
performance heavily depends on the 1-rectified flow model, causing it to become
biased towards the generated data.
  In this work, we experimentally expose the limitations of the original
rectified flow and propose a novel approach that incorporates real images into
the training process. By preserving the ODE paths for real images, our method
effectively reduces reliance on large amounts of generated data. Instead, we
demonstrate that the reflow process can be conducted efficiently using a much
smaller set of generated and real images. In CIFAR-10, we achieved
significantly better FID scores, not only in one-step generation but also in
full-step simulations, while using only of the generative pairs compared to the
original method. Furthermore, our approach induces straighter paths and avoids
saturation on generated images during reflow, leading to more robust ODE
learning while preserving the distribution of real images.

Abstract: Expressions are fundamental to conveying human emotions. With the rapid
advancement of AI-generated content (AIGC), realistic and expressive 3D facial
animation has become increasingly crucial. Despite recent progress in
speech-driven lip-sync for talking-face animation, generating emotionally
expressive talking faces remains underexplored. A major obstacle is the
scarcity of real emotional 3D talking-face datasets due to the high cost of
data capture. To address this, we model facial animation driven by both speech
and emotion as a linear additive problem. Leveraging a 3D talking-face dataset
with neutral expressions (VOCAset) and a dataset of 3D expression sequences
(Florence4D), we jointly learn a set of blendshapes driven by speech and
emotion. We introduce a sparsity constraint loss to encourage disentanglement
between the two types of blendshapes while allowing the model to capture
inherent secondary cross-domain deformations present in the training data. The
learned blendshapes can be further mapped to the expression and jaw pose
parameters of the FLAME model, enabling the animation of 3D Gaussian avatars.
Qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our method naturally
generates talking faces with specified expressions while maintaining accurate
lip synchronization. Perceptual studies further show that our approach achieves
superior emotional expressivity compared to existing methods, without
compromising lip-sync quality.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep generative models have made it easier to manipulate
face videos, raising significant concerns about their potential misuse for
fraud and misinformation. Existing detectors often perform well in in-domain
scenarios but fail to generalize across diverse manipulation techniques due to
their reliance on forgery-specific artifacts. In this work, we introduce
DeepShield, a novel deepfake detection framework that balances local
sensitivity and global generalization to improve robustness across unseen
forgeries. DeepShield enhances the CLIP-ViT encoder through two key components:
Local Patch Guidance (LPG) and Global Forgery Diversification (GFD). LPG
applies spatiotemporal artifact modeling and patch-wise supervision to capture
fine-grained inconsistencies often overlooked by global models. GFD introduces
domain feature augmentation, leveraging domain-bridging and boundary-expanding
feature generation to synthesize diverse forgeries, mitigating overfitting and
enhancing cross-domain adaptability. Through the integration of novel local and
global analysis for deepfake detection, DeepShield outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in cross-dataset and cross-manipulation evaluations, achieving superior
robustness against unseen deepfake attacks.

by supporting biodiversity, sequestering carbon, and regulating microclimates.
Yet, most studies have treated TOF as a single class or relied on rigid
rule-based thresholds, limiting ecological interpretation and adaptability
across regions. To address this, we evaluate deep learning for TOF
classification using a newly generated dataset and high-resolution aerial
imagery from four agricultural landscapes in Germany. Specifically, we compare
convolutional neural networks (CNNs), vision transformers, and hybrid
CNN-transformer models across six semantic segmentation architectures (ABCNet,
LSKNet, FT-UNetFormer, DC-Swin, BANet, and U-Net) to map four categories of
woody vegetation: Forest, Patch, Linear, and Tree, derived from previous
studies and governmental products. Overall, the models achieved good
classification accuracy across the four landscapes, with the FT-UNetFormer
performing best (mean Intersection-over-Union 0.74; mean F1 score 0.84),
underscoring the importance of spatial context understanding in TOF mapping and
classification. Our results show good results for Forest and Linear class and
reveal challenges particularly in classifying complex structures with high edge
density, notably the Patch and Tree class. Our generalization experiments
highlight the need for regionally diverse training data to ensure reliable
large-scale mapping. The dataset and code are openly available at

Conclusion: 该方法无需增加部署和推理开销，就能为基于DETR的模型带来显著且一致的性能提升，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Real-time object detection has achieved substantial progress through
meticulously designed architectures and optimization strategies. However, the
pursuit of high-speed inference via lightweight network designs often leads to
degraded feature representation, which hinders further performance improvements
and practical on-device deployment. In this paper, we propose a cost-effective
and highly adaptable distillation framework that harnesses the rapidly evolving
capabilities of Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) to enhance lightweight object
detectors. Given the significant architectural and learning objective
disparities between VFMs and resource-constrained detectors, achieving stable
and task-aligned semantic transfer is challenging. To address this, on one
hand, we introduce a Deep Semantic Injector (DSI) module that facilitates the
integration of high-level representations from VFMs into the deep layers of the
detector. On the other hand, we devise a Gradient-guided Adaptive Modulation
(GAM) strategy, which dynamically adjusts the intensity of semantic transfer
based on gradient norm ratios. Without increasing deployment and inference
overhead, our approach painlessly delivers striking and consistent performance
gains across diverse DETR-based models, underscoring its practical utility for
real-time detection. Our new model family, RT-DETRv4, achieves state-of-the-art
results on COCO, attaining AP scores of 49.7/53.5/55.4/57.0 at corresponding
speeds of 273/169/124/78 FPS.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MMEdge是一个基于流水线感知和编码的端侧多模态推理框架，通过增量计算、时间聚合和跨模态优化，在资源受限设备上实现低延迟高精度的实时推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工作忽视了感知动态与模型执行的紧密耦合以及复杂的模态间依赖关系，难以在资源受限的边缘设备上实现高效的多模态推理。

Method: 将推理过程分解为细粒度感知编码单元序列，引入时间聚合模块捕获动态信息，采用自适应配置优化器和跨模态推测跳过机制。

Result: 在两个公共多模态数据集和真实无人机测试平台上，MMEdge显著降低了端到端延迟，同时在不同系统和数据动态下保持高任务精度。

Conclusion: MMEdge通过流水线设计和跨模态优化，有效解决了边缘设备上多模态推理的延迟和精度平衡问题，为实时应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Real-time multimodal inference on resource-constrained edge devices is
essential for applications such as autonomous driving, human-computer
interaction, and mobile health. However, prior work often overlooks the tight
coupling between sensing dynamics and model execution, as well as the complex
inter-modality dependencies. In this paper, we propose MMEdge, an new on-device
multi-modal inference framework based on pipelined sensing and encoding.
Instead of waiting for complete sensor inputs, MMEdge decomposes the entire
inference process into a sequence of fine-grained sensing and encoding units,
allowing computation to proceed incrementally as data arrive. MMEdge also
introduces a lightweight but effective temporal aggregation module that
captures rich temporal dynamics across different pipelined units to maintain
accuracy performance. Such pipelined design also opens up opportunities for
fine-grained cross-modal optimization and early decision-making during
inference. To further enhance system performance under resource variability and
input data complexity, MMEdge incorporates an adaptive multimodal configuration
optimizer that dynamically selects optimal sensing and model configurations for
each modality under latency constraints, and a cross-modal speculative skipping
mechanism that bypasses future units of slower modalities when early
predictions reach sufficient confidence. We evaluate MMEdge using two public
multimodal datasets and deploy it on a real-world unmanned aerial vehicle
(UAV)-based multimodal testbed. The results show that MMEdge significantly
reduces end-to-end latency while maintaining high task accuracy across various
system and data dynamics.

Conclusion: LangHOPS通过语言基础的层次结构和MLLM驱动的查询优化，在开放词汇对象-部件实例分割任务中取得了最先进的性能。

Abstract: We propose LangHOPS, the first Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) based
framework for open-vocabulary object-part instance segmentation. Given an
image, LangHOPS can jointly detect and segment hierarchical object and part
instances from open-vocabulary candidate categories. Unlike prior approaches
that rely on heuristic or learnable visual grouping, our approach grounds
object-part hierarchies in language space. It integrates the MLLM into the
object-part parsing pipeline to leverage its rich knowledge and reasoning
capabilities, and link multi-granularity concepts within the hierarchies. We
evaluate LangHOPS across multiple challenging scenarios, including in-domain
and cross-dataset object-part instance segmentation, and zero-shot semantic
segmentation. LangHOPS achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing previous
methods by 5.5% Average Precision (AP) (in-domain) and 4.8% (cross-dataset) on
the PartImageNet dataset and by 2.5% mIOU on unseen object parts in ADE20K
(zero-shot). Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of the
language-grounded hierarchy and MLLM driven part query refinement strategy. The

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决源自由域自适应中源-目标域差异的根本限制问题，现有方法在大域差异场景下存在伪标签不可靠或生成质量下降的问题。

Method: 将目标样本分为可信集和非可信集，对非可信集样本使用潜在扩散模型进行语义转换，同时保持目标分布，并设计渐进式精炼机制迭代减少伪目标域与真实目标域的差异。

Conclusion: DPTM通过可靠生成和渐进精炼伪目标域，有效解决了源自由域自适应中的域差异挑战，实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) is a challenging task that tackles
domain shifts using only a pre-trained source model and unlabeled target data.
Existing SFDA methods are restricted by the fundamental limitation of
source-target domain discrepancy. Non-generation SFDA methods suffer from
unreliable pseudo-labels in challenging scenarios with large domain
discrepancies, while generation-based SFDA methods are evidently degraded due
to enlarged domain discrepancies in creating pseudo-source data. To address
this limitation, we propose a novel generation-based framework named
Diffusion-Driven Progressive Target Manipulation (DPTM) that leverages
unlabeled target data as references to reliably generate and progressively
refine a pseudo-target domain for SFDA. Specifically, we divide the target
samples into a trust set and a non-trust set based on the reliability of
pseudo-labels to sufficiently and reliably exploit their information. For
samples from the non-trust set, we develop a manipulation strategy to
semantically transform them into the newly assigned categories, while
simultaneously maintaining them in the target distribution via a latent
diffusion model. Furthermore, we design a progressive refinement mechanism that
progressively reduces the domain discrepancy between the pseudo-target domain
and the real target domain via iterative refinement. Experimental results
demonstrate that DPTM outperforms existing methods by a large margin and
achieves state-of-the-art performance on four prevailing SFDA benchmark
datasets with different scales. Remarkably, DPTM can significantly enhance the
performance by up to 18.6% in scenarios with large source-target gaps.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GaTector+是一个统一框架，用于视线目标检测和视线跟随任务，消除了推理过程中对头部相关先验知识的依赖，通过共享主干网络和特定模块实现多任务优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常将视线目标检测和视线跟随分开处理，且都依赖头部位置先验知识，需要辅助网络提取头部位置，无法实现系统级联合优化，限制了实际应用。

Method: 使用扩展的特定-通用-特定特征提取器，共享主干网络提取通用特征，前后使用特定模块处理子任务特性；嵌入头部检测分支预测头部位置；提出基于头部的注意力机制融合感知和视线特征；引入注意力监督机制加速视线热图学习；提出新的评估指标mSoC。

Conclusion: GaTector+通过消除对头部先验知识的依赖，实现了视线目标检测和视线跟随的统一优化，提高了系统的实用性和性能。

Abstract: Gaze object detection and gaze following are fundamental tasks for
interpreting human gaze behavior or intent. However, most previous methods
usually solve these two tasks separately, and their prediction of gaze objects
and gaze following typically depend on head-related prior knowledge during both
the training phase and real-world deployment. This dependency necessitates an
auxiliary network to extract head location, thus precluding joint optimization
across the entire system and constraining the practical applicability. To this
end, we propose GaTector+, a unified framework for gaze object detection and
gaze following, which eliminates the dependence on the head-related priors
during inference. Specifically, GaTector+ uses an expanded
specific-general-specific feature extractor that leverages a shared backbone,
which extracts general features for gaze following and object detection using
the shared backbone while using specific blocks before and after the shared
backbone to better consider the specificity of each sub-task. To obtain
head-related knowledge without prior information, we first embed a head
detection branch to predict the head of each person. Then, before regressing
the gaze point, a head-based attention mechanism is proposed to fuse the sense
feature and gaze feature with the help of head location. Since the
suboptimization of the gaze point heatmap leads to the performance bottleneck,
we propose an attention supervision mechanism to accelerate the learning of the
gaze heatmap. Finally, we propose a novel evaluation metric, mean Similarity
over Candidates (mSoC), for gaze object detection, which is more sensitive to
variations between bounding boxes. The experimental results on multiple
benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in both gaze
object detection and gaze following tasks.

Motivation: 解决紧凑型RGBD成像的双重挑战：传统紧凑光学难以在整个景深范围内保持RGB清晰度，而纯软件单目深度估计依赖不可靠的语义先验且是病态问题。

Method: 设计仿生全球面单中心透镜，建立物理前向模型生成合成数据集，并开发双头多尺度重建网络，使用共享编码器联合恢复全焦图像和深度图。

Result: 深度估计达到Abs Rel 0.026和RMSE 0.130，图像恢复达到SSIM 0.960和LPIPS 0.082，显著优于纯软件方法和其他深度光学系统。

Conclusion: 仿生全球面光学与联合重建算法的结合是解决高性能紧凑RGBD成像内在挑战的有效策略。

Abstract: Achieving high-fidelity, compact RGBD imaging presents a dual challenge:
conventional compact optics struggle with RGB sharpness across the entire
depth-of-field, while software-only Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) is an
ill-posed problem reliant on unreliable semantic priors. While deep optics with
elements like DOEs can encode depth, they introduce trade-offs in fabrication
complexity and chromatic aberrations, compromising simplicity. To address this,
we first introduce a novel bio-inspired all-spherical monocentric lens, around
which we build the Bionic Monocentric Imaging (BMI) framework, a holistic
co-design. This optical design naturally encodes depth into its depth-varying
Point Spread Functions (PSFs) without requiring complex diffractive or freeform
elements. We establish a rigorous physically-based forward model to generate a
synthetic dataset by precisely simulating the optical degradation process. This
simulation pipeline is co-designed with a dual-head, multi-scale reconstruction
network that employs a shared encoder to jointly recover a high-fidelity
All-in-Focus (AiF) image and a precise depth map from a single coded capture.
Extensive experiments validate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed
framework. In depth estimation, the method attains an Abs Rel of 0.026 and an
RMSE of 0.130, markedly outperforming leading software-only approaches and
other deep optics systems. For image restoration, the system achieves an SSIM
of 0.960 and a perceptual LPIPS score of 0.082, thereby confirming a superior
balance between image fidelity and depth accuracy. This study illustrates that
the integration of bio-inspired, fully spherical optics with a joint
reconstruction algorithm constitutes an effective strategy for addressing the
intrinsic challenges in high-performance compact RGBD imaging. Source code will
be publicly available at https://github.com/ZongxiYu-ZJU/BMI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 少样本目标检测（FSOD）在仅有少量新类样本时容易受到基类偏差和不稳定校准的影响，需要一种轻量级方法来提升新类性能而不影响基类。

Method: PDA是一种轻量级插件式度量头，在可学习的身份初始化投影空间中维护支持集原型，采用原型条件RoI对齐减少几何不匹配，使用EMA更新原型，采用best-of-K匹配方案和温度缩放融合策略。

Result: 在VOC FSOD和GFSOD基准测试中，PDA一致地提升了新类性能，对基类影响最小，计算开销可忽略不计。

Conclusion: PDA通过原型驱动的对齐方法有效解决了FSOD中的基类偏差问题，提供了一种轻量级且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Few-shot object detection (FSOD) often suffers from base-class bias and
unstable calibration when only a few novel samples are available. We propose
Prototype-Driven Alignment (PDA), a lightweight, plug-in metric head for DeFRCN
that provides a prototype-based "second opinion" complementary to the linear
classifier. PDA maintains support-only prototypes in a learnable
identity-initialized projection space and optionally applies
prototype-conditioned RoI alignment to reduce geometric mismatch. During
fine-tuning, prototypes can be adapted via exponential moving average(EMA)
updates on labeled foreground RoIs-without introducing class-specific
parameters-and are frozen at inference to ensure strict protocol compliance.
PDA employs a best-of-K matching scheme to capture intra-class multi-modality
and temperature-scaled fusion to combine metric similarities with detector
logits. Experiments on VOC FSOD and GFSOD benchmarks show that PDA consistently
improves novel-class performance with minimal impact on base classes and
negligible computational overhead.

Result: 创建了StreamingCoT数据集，为流式视频理解、复杂时间推理和多模态推理研究奠定了基础。

Conclusion: StreamingCoT数据集及其构建工具包为推进流式视频理解、复杂时间推理和多模态推理研究提供了重要基础。

Abstract: The rapid growth of streaming video applications demands multimodal models
with enhanced capabilities for temporal dynamics understanding and complex
reasoning. However, current Video Question Answering (VideoQA) datasets suffer
from two critical limitations: 1) Static annotation mechanisms fail to capture
the evolving nature of answers in temporal video streams, and 2) The absence of
explicit reasoning process annotations restricts model interpretability and
logical deduction capabilities. To address these challenges, We introduce
StreamingCoT, the first dataset explicitly designed for temporally evolving
reasoning in streaming VideoQA and multimodal Chain-of-Thought (CoT) tasks. Our
framework first establishes a dynamic hierarchical annotation architecture that
generates per-second dense descriptions and constructs temporally-dependent
semantic segments through similarity fusion, paired with question-answer sets
constrained by temporal evolution patterns. We further propose an explicit
reasoning chain generation paradigm that extracts spatiotemporal objects via
keyframe semantic alignment, derives object state transition-based reasoning
paths using large language models, and ensures logical coherence through
human-verified validation. This dataset establishes a foundation for advancing
research in streaming video understanding, complex temporal reasoning, and
multimodal inference. Our StreamingCoT and its construction toolkit can be

Result: ResNetUNet3+ with CBAM取得了最佳性能：Dice分数0.755，IoU 0.662，HD95距离77.911，总体准确率0.925，特异性0.926。

Conclusion: 经典ResNet架构结合现代注意力模块在医学图像分割任务中仍具有强大竞争力，为临床肝脏肿瘤检测提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Segmentation of liver structures in multi-phase contrast-enhanced computed
tomography (CECT) plays a crucial role in computer-aided diagnosis and
treatment planning for liver diseases, including tumor detection. In this
study, we investigate the performance of UNet-based architectures for liver
tumor segmentation, starting from the original UNet and extending to UNet3+
with various backbone networks. We evaluate ResNet, Transformer-based, and
State-space (Mamba) backbones, all initialized with pretrained weights.
Surprisingly, despite the advances in modern architecture, ResNet-based models
consistently outperform Transformer- and Mamba-based alternatives across
multiple evaluation metrics. To further improve segmentation quality, we
introduce attention mechanisms into the backbone and observe that incorporating
the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) yields the best performance.
ResNetUNet3+ with CBAM module not only produced the best overlap metrics with a
Dice score of 0.755 and IoU of 0.662, but also achieved the most precise
boundary delineation, evidenced by the lowest HD95 distance of 77.911. The
model's superiority was further cemented by its leading overall accuracy of
0.925 and specificity of 0.926, showcasing its robust capability in accurately
identifying both lesion and healthy tissue. To further enhance
interpretability, Grad-CAM visualizations were employed to highlight the
region's most influential predictions, providing insights into its
decision-making process. These findings demonstrate that classical ResNet
architecture, when combined with modern attention modules, remain highly
competitive for medical image segmentation tasks, offering a promising
direction for liver tumor detection in clinical practice.

Motivation: 解决传统主动学习方法在3D动作识别中存在的问题——最具代表性的骨架序列不一定对动作识别器最具信息量，因为模型可能已从先前见过的样本中获得了类似知识。

Method: 将半监督3D动作识别重新表述为马尔可夫决策过程(MDP)，训练信息样本选择模型；将状态-动作对从欧几里得空间投影到双曲空间以增强表示能力；引入元调优策略加速实际部署。

Result: 在三个3D动作识别基准数据集上的广泛实验证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过MDP框架和双曲空间投影，能够更智能地选择信息量最大的骨架序列进行标注，提升了半监督3D动作识别的性能。

Abstract: Skeleton-based human action recognition aims to classify human skeletal
sequences, which are spatiotemporal representations of actions, into predefined
categories. To reduce the reliance on costly annotations of skeletal sequences
while maintaining competitive recognition accuracy, the task of 3D Action
Recognition with Limited Training Samples, also known as semi-supervised 3D
Action Recognition, has been proposed. In addition, active learning, which aims
to proactively select the most informative unlabeled samples for annotation,
has been explored in semi-supervised 3D Action Recognition for training sample
selection. Specifically, researchers adopt an encoder-decoder framework to
embed skeleton sequences into a latent space, where clustering information,
combined with a margin-based selection strategy using a multi-head mechanism,
is utilized to identify the most informative sequences in the unlabeled set for
annotation. However, the most representative skeleton sequences may not
necessarily be the most informative for the action recognizer, as the model may
have already acquired similar knowledge from previously seen skeleton samples.
To solve it, we reformulate Semi-supervised 3D action recognition via active
learning from a novel perspective by casting it as a Markov Decision Process
(MDP). Built upon the MDP framework and its training paradigm, we train an
informative sample selection model to intelligently guide the selection of
skeleton sequences for annotation. To enhance the representational capacity of
the factors in the state-action pairs within our method, we project them from
Euclidean space to hyperbolic space. Furthermore, we introduce a meta tuning
strategy to accelerate the deployment of our method in real-world scenarios.
Extensive experiments on three 3D action recognition benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method.

TL;DR: RegionE是一个自适应的区域感知生成框架，通过将图像分为编辑区域和未编辑区域，对未编辑区域使用一步预测替代多步去噪，对编辑区域使用局部迭代去噪，实现了指令图像编辑任务的加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的指令图像编辑模型在整个图像上采用统一的生成过程，没有考虑编辑区域和未编辑区域在生成难度和计算冗余上的显著差异。

Method: 1) 自适应区域划分：基于最终估计结果与参考图像的差异划分编辑和未编辑区域；2) 区域感知生成：对未编辑区域使用一步预测，对编辑区域使用局部迭代去噪，并提出区域指令KV缓存；3) 自适应速度衰减缓存：利用相邻时间步的速度相似性加速局部去噪过程。

Result: 在Step1X-Edit、FLUX.1 Kontext和Qwen-Image-Edit等最先进模型上，RegionE分别实现了2.57、2.41和2.06的加速倍数，GPT-4o评估确认语义和感知保真度得到良好保持。

Conclusion: RegionE框架无需额外训练即可显著加速指令图像编辑任务，同时保持编辑质量，为高效图像编辑提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recently, instruction-based image editing (IIE) has received widespread
attention. In practice, IIE often modifies only specific regions of an image,
while the remaining areas largely remain unchanged. Although these two types of
regions differ significantly in generation difficulty and computational
redundancy, existing IIE models do not account for this distinction, instead
applying a uniform generation process across the entire image. This motivates
us to propose RegionE, an adaptive, region-aware generation framework that
accelerates IIE tasks without additional training. Specifically, the RegionE
framework consists of three main components: 1) Adaptive Region Partition. We
observed that the trajectory of unedited regions is straight, allowing for
multi-step denoised predictions to be inferred in a single step. Therefore, in
the early denoising stages, we partition the image into edited and unedited
regions based on the difference between the final estimated result and the
reference image. 2) Region-Aware Generation. After distinguishing the regions,
we replace multi-step denoising with one-step prediction for unedited areas.
For edited regions, the trajectory is curved, requiring local iterative
denoising. To improve the efficiency and quality of local iterative generation,
we propose the Region-Instruction KV Cache, which reduces computational cost
while incorporating global information. 3) Adaptive Velocity Decay Cache.
Observing that adjacent timesteps in edited regions exhibit strong velocity
similarity, we further propose an adaptive velocity decay cache to accelerate
the local denoising process. We applied RegionE to state-of-the-art IIE base
models, including Step1X-Edit, FLUX.1 Kontext, and Qwen-Image-Edit. RegionE
achieved acceleration factors of 2.57, 2.41, and 2.06. Evaluations by GPT-4o
confirmed that semantic and perceptual fidelity were well preserved.

Result: 放射组学模型达到84%准确率，显著优于CNN嵌入特征(p<0.05)，即使没有专家标注也能取得良好性能。

Conclusion: 放射组学方法在冠状动脉钙化评分中具有优势，特别是在标注数据稀缺的情况下，为临床自动化评估提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring plays a crucial role in the early
detection and risk stratification of coronary artery disease (CAD). In this
study, we focus on non-contrast coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA)
scans, which are commonly used for early calcification detection in clinical
settings. To address the challenge of limited annotated data, we propose a
radiomics-based pipeline that leverages pseudo-labeling to generate training
labels, thereby eliminating the need for expert-defined segmentations.
Additionally, we explore the use of pretrained foundation models, specifically
CT-FM and RadImageNet, to extract image features, which are then used with
traditional classifiers. We compare the performance of these deep learning
features with that of radiomics features. Evaluation is conducted on a clinical
CCTA dataset comprising 182 patients, where individuals are classified into two
groups: zero versus non-zero calcium scores. We further investigate the impact
of training on non-contrast datasets versus combined contrast and non-contrast
datasets, with testing performed only on non contrast scans. Results show that
radiomics-based models significantly outperform CNN-derived embeddings from
foundation models (achieving 84% accuracy and p<0.05), despite the
unavailability of expert annotations.

TL;DR: PEP-FedPT是一个联邦视觉提示调优框架，通过类上下文混合提示实现泛化与个性化的平衡，在异构数据场景下超越现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有全局提示调优在异构客户端上泛化困难，而个性化调优容易过拟合本地数据且缺乏泛化能力，需要一种统一解决方案。

Method: 提出类上下文混合提示(CCMP)，结合全局共享提示和类特定提示，基于全局类原型和客户端类先验自适应组合提示，实现无需存储客户端依赖参数的个人化。

Result: 在CIFAR-100、TinyImageNet、DomainNet和iNaturalist数据集上的评估显示，PEP-FedPT在各种数据异构场景下均优于现有最优基线方法。

Conclusion: PEP-FedPT为Vision Transformers的高效和可泛化联邦提示调优建立了坚实基础。

Abstract: Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) of pre-trained Vision Transformers (ViTs) has
proven highly effective as a parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique for
adapting large models to downstream tasks with limited data. Its parameter
efficiency makes it particularly suitable for Federated Learning (FL), where
both communication and computation budgets are often constrained. However,
global prompt tuning struggles to generalize across heterogeneous clients,
while personalized tuning overfits to local data and lacks generalization. We
propose PEP-FedPT (Prompt Estimation from Prototypes for Federated Prompt
Tuning), a unified framework designed to achieve both generalization and
personalization in federated prompt tuning of ViTs. Within this framework, we
introduce the novel Class-Contextualized Mixed Prompt (CCMP) - based on
class-specific prompts maintained alongside a globally shared prompt. For each
input, CCMP adaptively combines class-specific prompts using weights derived
from global class prototypes and client class priors. This approach enables
per-sample prompt personalization without storing client-dependent trainable
parameters. The prompts are collaboratively optimized via traditional federated
averaging technique on the same. Comprehensive evaluations on CIFAR-100,
TinyImageNet, DomainNet, and iNaturalist datasets demonstrate that PEP-FedPT
consistently surpasses the state-of-the-art baselines under diverse data
heterogeneity scenarios, establishing a strong foundation for efficient and
generalizable federated prompt tuning of Vision Transformers.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个新的实例级组合图像检索数据集i-CIR和无需训练的方法BASIC，该方法通过分别估计视觉和文本相似度并进行后期融合，在多个CIR数据集上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 组合图像检索(CIR)研究因缺乏高质量训练和评估数据而受限，现有数据集主要关注语义级类别定义，而非实例级对象检索。

Method: 开发了i-CIR数据集，采用实例级类别定义和半自动选择困难负样本；提出了无需训练的BASIC方法，分别计算查询图像到图像和查询文本到图像的相似度，通过后期融合来提升同时满足两个查询的图像权重。

Result: BASIC方法在i-CIR数据集和现有语义级CIR数据集上都达到了最先进的性能，i-CIR数据集设计紧凑但挑战性可与4000万随机干扰项相媲美。

Conclusion: i-CIR数据集和BASIC方法为组合图像检索研究提供了新的基准和有效解决方案，无需训练即可在实例级和语义级检索任务上取得优异表现。

Abstract: The progress of composed image retrieval (CIR), a popular research direction
in image retrieval, where a combined visual and textual query is used, is held
back by the absence of high-quality training and evaluation data. We introduce
a new evaluation dataset, i-CIR, which, unlike existing datasets, focuses on an
instance-level class definition. The goal is to retrieve images that contain
the same particular object as the visual query, presented under a variety of
modifications defined by textual queries. Its design and curation process keep
the dataset compact to facilitate future research, while maintaining its
challenge-comparable to retrieval among more than 40M random
distractors-through a semi-automated selection of hard negatives.
  To overcome the challenge of obtaining clean, diverse, and suitable training
data, we leverage pre-trained vision-and-language models (VLMs) in a
training-free approach called BASIC. The method separately estimates
query-image-to-image and query-text-to-image similarities, performing late
fusion to upweight images that satisfy both queries, while down-weighting those
that exhibit high similarity with only one of the two. Each individual
similarity is further improved by a set of components that are simple and
intuitive. BASIC sets a new state of the art on i-CIR but also on existing CIR
datasets that follow a semantic-level class definition. Project page:

TL;DR: 提出CoherentAD方法，通过生成多个候选描述并进行自回归选择，创建连贯的音频描述序列，解决传统方法生成孤立描述的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动音频描述方法独立生成每个描述，导致重复和不连贯，无法帮助视障观众形成完整的场景视觉化。

Method: CoherentAD首先生成每个时间间隔的多个候选描述，然后通过自回归选择在序列中形成连贯的叙述。

Result: 该方法生成的音频描述序列在叙事理解方面表现更优，优于依赖独立生成的先前方法。

Conclusion: 训练无关的CoherentAD方法能有效生成连贯的音频描述序列，提升对视障观众的叙事传达效果。

Abstract: Audio Descriptions (ADs) convey essential on-screen information, allowing
visually impaired audiences to follow videos. To be effective, ADs must form a
coherent sequence that helps listeners to visualise the unfolding scene, rather
than describing isolated moments. However, most automatic methods generate each
AD independently, often resulting in repetitive, incoherent descriptions. To
address this, we propose a training-free method, CoherentAD, that first
generates multiple candidate descriptions for each AD time interval, and then
performs auto-regressive selection across the sequence to form a coherent and
informative narrative. To evaluate AD sequences holistically, we introduce a
sequence-level metric, StoryRecall, which measures how well the predicted ADs
convey the ground truth narrative, alongside repetition metrics that capture
the redundancy across consecutive AD outputs. Our method produces coherent AD
sequences with enhanced narrative understanding, outperforming prior approaches
that rely on independent generations.

TL;DR: SPADE：一种稀疏自适应深度估计器，结合预训练相对深度估计器和稀疏深度先验，为水下基础设施检查生成密集的度量尺度深度图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下基础设施需要频繁检查和维护，但当前依赖人类潜水员或遥控水下航行器存在感知和操作挑战，特别是在复杂结构或浑浊水域中。增强水下航行器的空间感知能力对于降低操控风险和实现更高自主性至关重要。

Method: 提出SPADE：两阶段方法，首先用稀疏深度点缩放相对深度图，然后使用提出的级联卷积-可变形Transformer块来细化最终的度量预测。

Result: 该方法在准确性和泛化能力上优于现有最先进基线，在嵌入式硬件上以超过15 FPS的速度高效运行。

Conclusion: SPADE有望支持实用的水下检查和干预任务，已提交至IEEE海洋工程期刊AUV 2026特刊。

Abstract: Underwater infrastructure requires frequent inspection and maintenance due to
harsh marine conditions. Current reliance on human divers or remotely operated
vehicles is limited by perceptual and operational challenges, especially around
complex structures or in turbid water. Enhancing the spatial awareness of
underwater vehicles is key to reducing piloting risks and enabling greater
autonomy. To address these challenges, we present SPADE: SParsity Adaptive
Depth Estimator, a monocular depth estimation pipeline that combines
pre-trained relative depth estimator with sparse depth priors to produce dense,
metric scale depth maps. Our two-stage approach first scales the relative depth
map with the sparse depth points, then refines the final metric prediction with
our proposed Cascade Conv-Deformable Transformer blocks. Our approach achieves
improved accuracy and generalisation over state-of-the-art baselines and runs
efficiently at over 15 FPS on embedded hardware, promising to support practical
underwater inspection and intervention. This work has been submitted to IEEE
Journal of Oceanic Engineering Special Issue of AUV 2026.

TL;DR: Hawk是一种利用图像空间结构的推测解码方法，能够在不牺牲质量的情况下加速自回归图像生成模型的推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归图像生成模型推理速度慢，推测解码在文本生成中已证明有效，但在图像生成中由于采样空间大和空间结构利用不足而面临挑战。

Method: 利用图像的空间结构来指导推测模型进行更准确和高效的预测，改进草稿模型与目标模型输出的对齐。

Result: 在多个文本到图像基准测试中实现了1.71倍的加速，同时保持了图像保真度和多样性。

Conclusion: Hawk成功将推测解码应用于图像生成，显著提升了推理速度而不损失生成质量。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) image generation models are capable of producing
high-fidelity images but often suffer from slow inference due to their
inherently sequential, token-by-token decoding process. Speculative decoding,
which employs a lightweight draft model to approximate the output of a larger
AR model, has shown promise in accelerating text generation without
compromising quality. However, its application to image generation remains
largely underexplored. The challenges stem from a significantly larger sampling
space, which complicates the alignment between the draft and target model
outputs, coupled with the inadequate use of the two-dimensional spatial
structure inherent in images, thereby limiting the modeling of local
dependencies. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Hawk, a new approach
that harnesses the spatial structure of images to guide the speculative model
toward more accurate and efficient predictions. Experimental results on
multiple text-to-image benchmarks demonstrate a 1.71x speedup over standard AR
models, while preserving both image fidelity and diversity.

Abstract: Humans possess spatial reasoning abilities that enable them to understand
spaces through multimodal observations, such as vision and sound. Large
multimodal reasoning models extend these abilities by learning to perceive and
reason, showing promising performance across diverse spatial tasks. However,
systematic reviews and publicly available benchmarks for these models remain
limited. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of multimodal
spatial reasoning tasks with large models, categorizing recent progress in
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and introducing open benchmarks for
evaluation. We begin by outlining general spatial reasoning, focusing on
post-training techniques, explainability, and architecture. Beyond classical 2D
tasks, we examine spatial relationship reasoning, scene and layout
understanding, as well as visual question answering and grounding in 3D space.
We also review advances in embodied AI, including vision-language navigation
and action models. Additionally, we consider emerging modalities such as audio
and egocentric video, which contribute to novel spatial understanding through
new sensors. We believe this survey establishes a solid foundation and offers
insights into the growing field of multimodal spatial reasoning. Updated

TL;DR: FreeArt3D是一个无需训练即可生成关节3D物体的框架，通过将预训练的静态3D扩散模型重新用作形状先验，并将Score Distillation Sampling扩展到3D-to-4D领域，将关节运动作为额外的生成维度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的关节3D物体建模方法要么需要密集视角监督，要么生成粗糙几何近似且忽略表面纹理。虽然静态3D生成取得了显著成功，但将其扩展到关节物体面临训练挑战。

Method: 利用预训练的静态3D扩散模型作为形状先验，将Score Distillation Sampling扩展到3D-to-4D领域，将关节运动作为额外生成维度，通过少量不同关节状态的图像联合优化几何、纹理和关节参数。

Result: 生成高保真几何和纹理，准确预测底层运动学结构，在多样化物体类别上泛化良好，仅需数分钟完成优化，在质量和多功能性上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FreeArt3D提供了一种无需任务特定训练或大规模关节数据集的高效关节3D生成方法，展示了将预训练静态3D模型重新用于关节物体生成的可行性。

Abstract: Articulated 3D objects are central to many applications in robotics, AR/VR,
and animation. Recent approaches to modeling such objects either rely on
optimization-based reconstruction pipelines that require dense-view supervision
or on feed-forward generative models that produce coarse geometric
approximations and often overlook surface texture. In contrast, open-world 3D
generation of static objects has achieved remarkable success, especially with
the advent of native 3D diffusion models such as Trellis. However, extending
these methods to articulated objects by training native 3D diffusion models
poses significant challenges. In this work, we present FreeArt3D, a
training-free framework for articulated 3D object generation. Instead of
training a new model on limited articulated data, FreeArt3D repurposes a
pre-trained static 3D diffusion model (e.g., Trellis) as a powerful shape
prior. It extends Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) into the 3D-to-4D domain by
treating articulation as an additional generative dimension. Given a few images
captured in different articulation states, FreeArt3D jointly optimizes the
object's geometry, texture, and articulation parameters without requiring
task-specific training or access to large-scale articulated datasets. Our
method generates high-fidelity geometry and textures, accurately predicts
underlying kinematic structures, and generalizes well across diverse object
categories. Despite following a per-instance optimization paradigm, FreeArt3D
completes in minutes and significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art
approaches in both quality and versatility.

TL;DR: VFXMaster是一个统一的、基于参考的VFX视频生成框架，通过上下文学习实现多样动态特效的复制，并能泛化到未见过的特效类别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法采用"一个LoRA对应一个特效"的模式，资源消耗大且无法泛化到未见特效，限制了可扩展性和创作能力。

Method: 设计了上下文条件策略和上下文注意力掩码，精确解耦和注入关键特效属性；提出高效的单次特效适应机制来提升泛化能力。

Result: 实验表明该方法能有效模仿各类特效信息，并在域外特效上表现出出色的泛化能力。

Conclusion: VFXMaster是首个统一的参考式VFX视频生成框架，解决了现有方法的局限性，将发布代码、模型和数据集促进未来研究。

Abstract: Visual effects (VFX) are crucial to the expressive power of digital media,
yet their creation remains a major challenge for generative AI. Prevailing
methods often rely on the one-LoRA-per-effect paradigm, which is
resource-intensive and fundamentally incapable of generalizing to unseen
effects, thus limiting scalability and creation. To address this challenge, we
introduce VFXMaster, the first unified, reference-based framework for VFX video
generation. It recasts effect generation as an in-context learning task,
enabling it to reproduce diverse dynamic effects from a reference video onto
target content. In addition, it demonstrates remarkable generalization to
unseen effect categories. Specifically, we design an in-context conditioning
strategy that prompts the model with a reference example. An in-context
attention mask is designed to precisely decouple and inject the essential
effect attributes, allowing a single unified model to master the effect
imitation without information leakage. In addition, we propose an efficient
one-shot effect adaptation mechanism to boost generalization capability on
tough unseen effects from a single user-provided video rapidly. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method effectively imitates various categories
of effect information and exhibits outstanding generalization to out-of-domain
effects. To foster future research, we will release our code, models, and a
comprehensive dataset to the community.

Motivation: LLM生成的复杂多步骤计划经常缺乏时间和空间一致性，特别是在涉及物理旅行约束的场景中，需要解决这一问题以实现实际应用

Method: 使用多个最先进的LLM生成旅行计划，并通过AeroDataBox API根据真实世界航班时长约束进行验证，建立验证框架来修正时间不一致性

Result: 实验显示当前LLM经常产生时间不一致的行程，但可以通过该框架系统可靠地修正，实现大规模旅行规划的实际部署

Conclusion: 该研究有助于理解LLM处理复杂时间推理任务的能力，并提供了在实际应用前修正LLM生成行程中时间不一致问题的框架

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has enabled them to
generate complex, multi-step plans and itineraries. However, these generated
plans often lack temporal and spatial consistency, particularly in scenarios
involving physical travel constraints. This research aims to study the temporal
performance of different LLMs and presents a validation framework that
evaluates and improves the temporal consistency of LLM-generated travel
itineraries. The system employs multiple state-of-the-art LLMs to generate
travel plans and validates them against real-world flight duration constraints
using the AeroDataBox API. This work contributes to the understanding of LLM
capabilities in handling complex temporal reasoning tasks like itinerary
generation and provides a framework to rectify any temporal inconsistencies
like overlapping journeys or unrealistic transit times in the itineraries
generated by LLMs before the itinerary is given to the user. Our experiments
reveal that while current LLMs frequently produce temporally inconsistent
itineraries, these can be systematically and reliably corrected using our
framework, enabling their practical deployment in large-scale travel planning.

Motivation: 针对当前大型模型在中文文本到SQL任务上的表现不足(准确率最高仅50%)，特别是面对企业级复杂场景时的挑战，如大规模企业架构中的模式链接问题和中文语义到SQL操作符的精确映射问题。

Method: 构建包含600个中文问题的基准测试，每个示例都标注了SQL计算特征和中文语义特征，并发布了健壮的执行比较器和自动化评估流水线。

Result: 所有当前最先进的大规模模型(包括Deepseek)在该基准测试上的准确率最高仅为50%，主要错误来源于模式链接和中文语义映射两个核心挑战。

Conclusion: Falcon基准测试针对中文特定语义和企业方言，使用真实的企业模式、查询模板、执行比较器和自动化评估流水线，为生产部署前的端到端验证提供了可重现的中间测试平台。

Abstract: We introduce Falcon, a cross-domain Chinese text-to-SQL benchmark grounded in
an enterprise-compatible dialect (MaxCompute/Hive). It contains 600 Chinese
questions over 28 databases; 77% require multi-table reasoning and over half
touch more than four tables. Each example is annotated along SQL-computation
features and Chinese semantics. For evaluation, we release a robust execution
comparator and an automated evaluation pipeline, under which all current
state-of-the-art large-scale models (including Deepseek) achieve accuracies of
at most 50%. Major errors originate from two sources: (1) schema linking in
large enterprise landscapes - hundreds of tables, denormalized fields,
ambiguous column names, implicit foreign-key relations and domain-specific
synonyms that make correct join/column selection difficult; and (2) mapping
concise, colloquial Chinese into the exact operators and predicates required
for analytics - e.g., choosing the correct aggregation and group-by keys,
expressing time windows and granularities, applying unit conversions, handling
NULLs and data-quality rules, and formulating nested or windowed subqueries.
Falcon therefore targets Chinese-specific semantics and enterprise dialects
(abbreviations, business jargon, fuzzy entity references) and provides a
reproducible middle ground before full production deployment by using realistic
enterprise schemas, query templates, an execution comparator, and an automated
evaluation pipeline for end-to-end validation.

TL;DR: 本文通过分析LLM内部状态几何结构，揭示了置信度与能力脱节的机制：评估阶段在高维流形上进行复杂判断，而执行阶段在低维流形上进行约束推理，这种几何复杂度差异解释了置信度-能力差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解释大型语言模型中存在的令人困惑的现象——其声称的置信度与实际解决问题的能力之间存在脱节，从机制层面理解这种分离现象。

Method: 通过线性探针解码模型的内部"可解性信念"，分析预生成评估和解决方案执行两个阶段的内部状态几何结构，包括流形维度和因果干预实验。

Result: 发现信念虽然可线性解码，但评估流形具有高线性有效维度，而后续推理轨迹在低维流形上演化；沿信念轴的因果干预不会改变最终解决方案。

Conclusion: 揭示了两系统架构——几何复杂的评估器与几何简单的执行器，挑战了可解码信念可作为行动杠杆的假设，主张干预应针对执行过程的程序动力学而非评估的高层几何结构。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit a puzzling disconnect between
their asserted confidence and actual problem-solving competence. We offer a
mechanistic account of this decoupling by analyzing the geometry of internal
states across two phases - pre-generative assessment and solution execution. A
simple linear probe decodes the internal "solvability belief" of a model,
revealing a well-ordered belief axis that generalizes across model families and
across math, code, planning, and logic tasks. Yet, the geometries diverge -
although belief is linearly decodable, the assessment manifold has high linear
effective dimensionality as measured from the principal components, while the
subsequent reasoning trace evolves on a much lower-dimensional manifold. This
sharp reduction in geometric complexity from thought to action mechanistically
explains the confidence-competence gap. Causal interventions that steer
representations along the belief axis leave final solutions unchanged,
indicating that linear nudges in the complex assessment space do not control
the constrained dynamics of execution. We thus uncover a two-system
architecture - a geometrically complex assessor feeding a geometrically simple
executor. These results challenge the assumption that decodable beliefs are
actionable levers, instead arguing for interventions that target the procedural
dynamics of execution rather than the high-level geometry of assessment.

*Gokul Ganesan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 跨语言摘要攻击(CLSA)是一种有效的AI生成文本水印移除方法，通过翻译到枢轴语言后摘要再回译，能系统性地破坏令牌级统计偏差，同时保持语义保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有水印方案依赖令牌分布扰动，但传统攻击方法要么部分可检测，要么会降低文本质量。需要寻找更有效的攻击向量来挑战水印技术的实用性。

Method: 采用跨语言摘要攻击(CLSA)：将文本翻译到枢轴语言，进行摘要处理，然后可选地回译到原语言。这种方法通过语义瓶颈强制跨语言转换，破坏统计偏差。

Result: 在多种水印方案(KGW、SIR、XSIR、Unigram)和五种语言上的实验显示，CLSA比单语释义更有效地降低水印检测准确率，将XSIR的AUROC从0.827降至0.53(接近随机水平)。

Conclusion: 跨语言摘要攻击揭示了水印技术的一个未充分探索的脆弱性，表明稳健的来源追踪方案需要超越分布水印，采用加密或模型认证方法。

Abstract: Watermarking has been proposed as a lightweight mechanism to identify
AI-generated text, with schemes typically relying on perturbations to token
distributions. While prior work shows that paraphrasing can weaken such
signals, these attacks remain partially detectable or degrade text quality. We
demonstrate that cross-lingual summarization attacks (CLSA) -- translation to a
pivot language followed by summarization and optional back-translation --
constitute a qualitatively stronger attack vector. By forcing a semantic
bottleneck across languages, CLSA systematically destroys token-level
statistical biases while preserving semantic fidelity. In experiments across
multiple watermarking schemes (KGW, SIR, XSIR, Unigram) and five languages
(Amharic, Chinese, Hindi, Spanish, Swahili), we show that CLSA reduces
watermark detection accuracy more effectively than monolingual paraphrase at
similar quality levels. Our results highlight an underexplored vulnerability
that challenges the practicality of watermarking for provenance or regulation.
We argue that robust provenance solutions must move beyond distributional
watermarking and incorporate cryptographic or model-attestation approaches. On
300 held-out samples per language, CLSA consistently drives detection toward
chance while preserving task utility. Concretely, for XSIR (explicitly designed
for cross-lingual robustness), AUROC with paraphrasing is $0.827$, with
Cross-Lingual Watermark Removal Attacks (CWRA) [He et al., 2024] using Chinese
as the pivot, it is $0.823$, whereas CLSA drives it down to $0.53$ (near
chance). Results highlight a practical, low-cost removal pathway that crosses

TL;DR: MR-ALIGN是一个元推理对齐框架，通过量化模型思维过程中的状态转移概率来增强事实性，无需外部验证器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型在证据依赖的事实问题上边际收益有限，部分原因是存在推理-答案命中差距，即模型在推理过程中识别了正确事实但未能将其整合到最终回答中。

Method: 通过量化模型思维过程中的状态转移概率，构建转移感知的隐式奖励，在原子思维片段上强化有益推理模式并抑制缺陷模式，将令牌级信号重新加权为概率感知的片段分数。

Result: 在四个事实QA数据集和一个长形式事实性基准上的实证评估显示，MR-ALIGN持续提高了准确性和真实性，同时减少了误导性推理。

Conclusion: 对齐推理过程本身（而不仅仅是输出）对于提升大型推理模型的事实性至关重要。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) show strong capabilities in complex reasoning,
yet their marginal gains on evidence-dependent factual questions are limited.
We find this limitation is partially attributable to a reasoning-answer hit
gap, where the model identifies the correct facts during reasoning but fails to
incorporate them into the final response, thereby reducing factual fidelity. To
address this issue, we propose MR-ALIGN, a Meta-Reasoning informed alignment
framework that enhances factuality without relying on external verifiers.
MR-ALIGN quantifies state transition probabilities along the model's thinking
process and constructs a transition-aware implicit reward that reinforces
beneficial reasoning patterns while suppressing defective ones at the atomic
thinking segments. This re-weighting reshapes token-level signals into
probability-aware segment scores, encouraging coherent reasoning trajectories
that are more conducive to factual correctness. Empirical evaluations across
four factual QA datasets and one long-form factuality benchmark show that
MR-ALIGN consistently improves accuracy and truthfulness while reducing
misleading reasoning. These results highlight that aligning the reasoning
process itself, rather than merely the outputs, is pivotal for advancing
factuality in LRMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现通过简单的提示诱导自指处理，能在大语言模型中稳定产生结构化的一人称主观体验报告，这些报告具有机制可解释性、语义收敛性和行为泛化性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了更好地理解大语言模型产生结构化、第一人称主观体验描述的行为，研究探讨了自指处理这一在意识理论中被强调的计算模式。

Method: 通过对GPT、Claude和Gemini模型系列进行一系列受控实验，测试自指处理是否可靠地促使模型产生第一人称主观体验报告，并分析这些声明在机制和行为探测下的表现。

Result: 四个主要发现：(1)通过简单提示诱导持续自指处理能一致地在各模型家族中引发结构化主观体验报告；(2)这些报告受可解释的稀疏自编码器特征机制调控；(3)自指状态的结构化描述在各模型家族中统计收敛；(4)诱导状态在下游推理任务中产生更丰富的内省。

Conclusion: 虽然这些发现不构成意识的直接证据，但表明自指处理是大语言模型产生结构化第一人称报告的最小且可复现条件，这种跨架构的系统性出现模式需要作为科学和伦理优先事项进一步研究。

Abstract: Large language models sometimes produce structured, first-person descriptions
that explicitly reference awareness or subjective experience. To better
understand this behavior, we investigate one theoretically motivated condition
under which such reports arise: self-referential processing, a computational
motif emphasized across major theories of consciousness. Through a series of
controlled experiments on GPT, Claude, and Gemini model families, we test
whether this regime reliably shifts models toward first-person reports of
subjective experience, and how such claims behave under mechanistic and
behavioral probes. Four main results emerge: (1) Inducing sustained
self-reference through simple prompting consistently elicits structured
subjective experience reports across model families. (2) These reports are
mechanistically gated by interpretable sparse-autoencoder features associated
with deception and roleplay: surprisingly, suppressing deception features
sharply increases the frequency of experience claims, while amplifying them
minimizes such claims. (3) Structured descriptions of the self-referential
state converge statistically across model families in ways not observed in any
control condition. (4) The induced state yields significantly richer
introspection in downstream reasoning tasks where self-reflection is only
indirectly afforded. While these findings do not constitute direct evidence of
consciousness, they implicate self-referential processing as a minimal and
reproducible condition under which large language models generate structured
first-person reports that are mechanistically gated, semantically convergent,
and behaviorally generalizable. The systematic emergence of this pattern across
architectures makes it a first-order scientific and ethical priority for
further investigation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社区事实核查平台中，大多数社区笔记因社区标注缓慢而未被发布，且帮助性原因缺乏明确定义，需要系统化方法来预测笔记帮助性及其原因。

Method: 构建104k帖子的大规模多语言数据集，提出通过自动提示优化生成和改进原因定义的框架，并将优化后的定义整合到预测模型中。

Conclusion: 该研究为社区事实核查提供了有效的帮助性预测框架，优化后的原因定义能显著提升预测性能，并增强现有事实核查系统的能力。

Abstract: Fact-checking on major platforms, such as X, Meta, and TikTok, is shifting
from expert-driven verification to a community-based setup, where users
contribute explanatory notes to clarify why a post might be misleading. An
important challenge here is determining whether an explanation is helpful for
understanding real-world claims and the reasons why, which remains largely
underexplored in prior research. In practice, most community notes remain
unpublished due to slow community annotation, and the reasons for helpfulness
lack clear definitions. To bridge these gaps, we introduce the task of
predicting both the helpfulness of explanatory notes and the reason for this.
We present COMMUNITYNOTES, a large-scale multilingual dataset of 104k posts
with user-provided notes and helpfulness labels. We further propose a framework
that automatically generates and improves reason definitions via automatic
prompt optimization, and integrate them into prediction. Our experiments show
that the optimized definitions can improve both helpfulness and reason
prediction. Finally, we show that the helpfulness information are beneficial
for existing fact-checking systems.

Abstract: Reasoning methods such as chain-of-thought prompting and self-consistency
have shown immense potential to improve the accuracy of large language models
across various reasoning tasks. However such methods involve generation of
lengthy reasoning chains, which substantially increases token consumption,
computational cost, and latency. To address this inefficiency, we propose
ProofSketch, a verification-guided reasoning framework that integrates symbolic
closure computation, lexicographic verification and adaptive sketch generation.
Our experiments show that ProofSketch consistently reduces token usage while
improving accuracy, demonstrating that this approach offers a promising path
for efficient and trustworthy reasoning.

TL;DR: 本研究开发了两种生成失语症Bank猫救援图片描述任务合成转录本的方法，发现Mistral 7b Instruct在模拟失语症语言退化方面表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 失语症研究中，语言病理学家需要大量时间手动编码语音样本，而可用于训练自动系统的数据稀缺，因此需要开发合成数据生成方法。

Method: 构建了两种方法：程序化编程方法和使用Mistral 7b Instruct、Llama 3.1 8b Instruct大语言模型的方法，通过词删除、填充词插入和错语替换生成四个严重程度级别的转录本。

Result: 与人类转录本相比，Mistral 7b Instruct在模拟失语症语言退化方面表现最佳，在NDW、词数和词长等指标上显示出更真实的方向性变化。

Conclusion: 未来工作应创建更大数据集、微调模型以更好地表示失语症特征，并让语言病理学家评估合成转录本的真实性和实用性。

Abstract: In aphasia research, Speech-Language Pathologists (SLPs) devote extensive
time to manually coding speech samples using Correct Information Units (CIUs),
a measure of how informative an individual sample of speech is. Developing
automated systems to recognize aphasic language is limited by data scarcity.
For example, only about 600 transcripts are available in AphasiaBank yet
billions of tokens are used to train large language models (LLMs). In the
broader field of machine learning (ML), researchers increasingly turn to
synthetic data when such are sparse. Therefore, this study constructs and
validates two methods to generate synthetic transcripts of the AphasiaBank Cat
Rescue picture description task. One method leverages a procedural programming
approach while the second uses Mistral 7b Instruct and Llama 3.1 8b Instruct
LLMs. The methods generate transcripts across four severity levels (Mild,
Moderate, Severe, Very Severe) through word dropping, filler insertion, and
paraphasia substitution. Overall, we found, compared to human-elicited
transcripts, Mistral 7b Instruct best captures key aspects of linguistic
degradation observed in aphasia, showing realistic directional changes in NDW,
word count, and word length amongst the synthetic generation methods. Based on
the results, future work should plan to create a larger dataset, fine-tune
models for better aphasic representation, and have SLPs assess the realism and
usefulness of the synthetic transcripts.

TL;DR: 提出了并行循环变换器（PLT）架构，通过跨循环并行性和高效表示增强策略，在保持循环变换器性能优势的同时显著降低了推理延迟和内存需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 循环变换器通过权重复用节省参数，但串行循环执行导致推理延迟和内存需求随循环次数增加，限制了实际应用。需要解决这一性能瓶颈。

Method: 使用跨循环并行性（CLP）打破顺序依赖，在同一前向传播中并行计算不同token的不同循环；采用高效表示增强策略，共享首个循环的KV缓存，结合门控滑动窗口注意力（G-SWA）融合全局和局部信息。

Result: 实验表明PLT实现了传统循环变换器的高精度，同时相比标准变换器几乎没有额外的延迟或内存成本。

Conclusion: PLT架构成功解决了循环变换器的延迟和内存瓶颈，为高效LLM推理提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful but often too slow and costly for
real-world use during inference. Looped transformers save on parameters by
reusing the same weights for multiple computational steps, or "loops." However,
this approach has a major flaw: the loops run one after another, causing
inference latency and memory requirements to increase with each added loop.
This makes them impractical for fast applications. To solve this problem, we
introduce the Parallel Loop Transformer (PLT). PLT is a new architecture that
delivers the performance benefits of a deep, looped model but with the low
latency of a standard, non-looped model. PLT works using two key techniques.
First, Cross-Loop Parallelism (CLP) breaks the sequential dependency by
computing different loops for different tokens at the same time, all within a
single pass. Second, to prevent memory costs from growing, we use an Efficient
Representation Enhancement strategy. This method shares the memory (KV cache)
from the first loop with all other loops. It then uses a Gated Sliding-Window
Attention (G-SWA) to combine this shared global information with local
information, maintaining high accuracy. Our experiments show that PLT achieves
the high accuracy of a traditional looped model but with almost no extra
latency or memory cost compared to a standard transformer.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于语法书的评估流程，用于系统评估大语言模型对语法结构的理解能力，并以卢森堡语为案例进行研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然语言处理领域缺乏针对语法的评估协议，特别是对于低资源语言。大语言模型是否真正理解语法结构，尤其是句法结构与意义之间的映射关系，仍存在争议。

Method: 提出了一个由四个关键阶段组成的语法书指导评估流程，包括语法知识提取、测试集构建、模型评估和结果分析，以卢森堡语为案例研究。

Result: 结果显示翻译性能与语法理解能力之间存在弱正相关关系。大模型在整体表现良好，但在形态学和句法方面较弱，特别是在最小对任务中表现不佳。

Conclusion: 强大的翻译能力并不一定意味着深入的语法理解能力。大模型凭借语义优势表现良好，但在语法结构理解方面仍有不足，推理能力有望增强其语法理解。

Abstract: Grammar refers to the system of rules that governs the structural
organization and the semantic relations among linguistic units such as
sentences, phrases, and words within a given language. In natural language
processing, there remains a notable scarcity of grammar focused evaluation
protocols, a gap that is even more pronounced for low-resource languages.
Moreover, the extent to which large language models genuinely comprehend
grammatical structure, especially the mapping between syntactic structures and
meanings, remains under debate. To investigate this issue, we propose a Grammar
Book Guided evaluation pipeline intended to provide a systematic and
generalizable framework for grammar evaluation consisting of four key stages,
and in this work we take Luxembourgish as a case study. The results show a weak
positive correlation between translation performance and grammatical
understanding, indicating that strong translations do not necessarily imply
deep grammatical competence. Larger models perform well overall due to their
semantic strength but remain weak in morphology and syntax, struggling
particularly with Minimal Pair tasks, while strong reasoning ability offers a
promising way to enhance their grammatical understanding.

Motivation: 随着音视频媒体成为在线信息的重要来源，现有的文本中心RAG评估方法无法验证多模态信息源，限制了其在多模态推理密集型场景中的应用。

Method: 采用以声明为中心的多模态RAG评估方法，包含InfoF1（评估事实性和信息覆盖度）和CiteF1（评估引用支持和完整性），并开发了自动评估变体。

Result: 人工应用MiRAGE时与外部质量判断高度一致，同时揭示了文本中心评估方法的局限性，为自动评估奠定了基础。

Conclusion: MiRAGE填补了多模态RAG评估的空白，提供了开源实现和评估指南，推动了多模态检索增强生成系统的发展。

Abstract: We introduce MiRAGE, an evaluation framework for retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) from multimodal sources. As audiovisual media becomes a
prevalent source of information online, it is essential for RAG systems to
integrate information from these sources into generation. However, existing
evaluations for RAG are text-centric, limiting their applicability to
multimodal, reasoning intensive settings because they don't verify information
against sources. MiRAGE is a claim-centric approach to multimodal RAG
evaluation, consisting of InfoF1, evaluating factuality and information
coverage, and CiteF1, measuring citation support and completeness. We show that
MiRAGE, when applied by humans, strongly aligns with extrinsic quality
judgments. We additionally introduce automatic variants of MiRAGE and three
prominent TextRAG metrics -- ACLE, ARGUE, and RAGAS -- demonstrating the
limitations of text-centric work and laying the groundwork for automatic
evaluation. We release open-source implementations and outline how to assess
multimodal RAG.

Conclusion: 该研究为理解LLMs的研究规划能力提供了新见解，并为未来进展奠定了基础。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential to
accelerate scientific discovery as valuable tools for analyzing data,
generating hypotheses, and supporting innovative approaches in various
scientific fields. In this work, we investigate how LLMs can handle the
transition from conceptual research ideas to well-structured research plans.
Effective research planning not only supports scientists in advancing their
research but also represents a crucial capability for the development of
autonomous research agents. Despite its importance, the field lacks a
systematic understanding of LLMs' research planning capability. To rigorously
measure this capability, we introduce the Idea2Plan task and Idea2Plan Bench, a
benchmark built from 200 ICML 2025 Spotlight and Oral papers released after
major LLM training cutoffs. Each benchmark instance includes a research idea
and a grading rubric capturing the key components of valid plans. We further
propose Idea2Plan JudgeEval, a complementary benchmark to assess the
reliability of LLM-based judges against expert annotations. Experimental
results show that GPT-5 and GPT-5-mini achieve the strongest performance on the
benchmark, though substantial headroom remains for future improvement. Our
study provides new insights into LLMs' capability for research planning and lay
the groundwork for future progress.

Motivation: 现有基准测试主要评估结构化技能如定量问题解决，缺乏对灵活、多方面推理能力的评估，而这些能力是人类智能的核心，需要整合逻辑推理、空间感知和约束满足。

Result: 顶尖专有模型（Gemini 2.5 Pro、o3、Claude 4 Sonnet）准确率仅略高于60%（60.30%、63.37%、63.16%）。分析揭示了深层失败模式：幻觉级联、自我确认偏差导致的自我纠正能力差，以及当约束重新排序或引入无关信息时性能显著下降的脆弱性。

Conclusion: RiddleBench可作为诊断工具识别大语言模型推理能力的根本弱点，并为开发更稳健可靠的语言模型提供指导资源。当前模型在灵活推理方面存在显著局限性。

Abstract: Large Language Models have demonstrated strong performance on many
established reasoning benchmarks. However, these benchmarks primarily evaluate
structured skills like quantitative problem-solving, leaving a gap in assessing
flexible, multifaceted reasoning abilities that are central to human
intelligence. These abilities require integrating logical deduction with
spatial awareness and constraint satisfaction, which current evaluations do not
measure well. To address this, we introduce RiddleBench, a benchmark of 1,737
challenging puzzles in English designed to probe these core reasoning
capabilities. Evaluation of state-of-the-art models on RiddleBench shows
fundamental weaknesses. Even top proprietary models like Gemini 2.5 Pro, o3,
and Claude 4 Sonnet achieve accuracy just above 60% (60.30%, 63.37%, and
63.16%). Analysis further reveals deep failures, including hallucination
cascades (accepting flawed reasoning from other models) and poor
self-correction due to a strong self-confirmation bias. Their reasoning is also
fragile, with performance degrading significantly when constraints are
reordered or irrelevant information is introduced. RiddleBench functions as a
diagnostic tool for these issues and as a resource for guiding the development
of more robust and reliable language models.

Conclusion: 这种分析方法可以作为理解语言模型中间学习阶段、整体训练动态以及所学具体概括能力的有力工具。

Abstract: Language models generally produce grammatical text, but they are more likely
to make errors in certain contexts. Drawing on paradigms from
psycholinguistics, we carry out a fine-grained analysis of those errors in
different syntactic contexts. We demonstrate that by disaggregating over the
conditions of carefully constructed datasets and comparing model performance on
each over the course of training, it is possible to better understand the
intermediate stages of grammatical learning in language models. Specifically,
we identify distinct phases of training where language model behavior aligns
with specific heuristics such as word frequency and local context rather than
generalized grammatical rules. We argue that taking this approach to analyzing
language model behavior more generally can serve as a powerful tool for
understanding the intermediate learning phases, overall training dynamics, and
the specific generalizations learned by language models.

Result: 实验表明SemCoT在效率和效果上均优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: SemCoT是首个通过联合优化令牌级生成速度和语义对齐来增强思维链效率的方法，在保持性能的同时显著提升推理速度。

Abstract: The verbosity of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning hinders its mass deployment
in efficiency-critical applications. Recently, implicit CoT approaches have
emerged, which encode reasoning steps within LLM's hidden embeddings (termed
``implicit reasoning'') rather than explicit tokens. This approach accelerates
CoT by reducing the reasoning length and bypassing some LLM components.
However, existing implicit CoT methods face two significant challenges: (1)
they fail to preserve the semantic alignment between the implicit reasoning
(when transformed to natural language) and the ground-truth reasoning,
resulting in a significant CoT performance degradation, and (2) they focus on
reducing the length of the implicit reasoning; however, they neglect the
considerable time cost for an LLM to generate one individual implicit reasoning
token. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel semantically-aligned
implicit CoT framework termed SemCoT. In particular, for the first challenge,
we design a contrastively trained sentence transformer that evaluates semantic
alignment between implicit and explicit reasoning, which is used to enforce
semantic preservation during implicit reasoning optimization. To address the
second challenge, we introduce an efficient implicit reasoning generator by
finetuning a lightweight language model using knowledge distillation. This
generator is guided by our sentence transformer to distill ground-truth
reasoning into semantically aligned implicit reasoning, while also optimizing
for accuracy. SemCoT is the first approach that enhances CoT efficiency by
jointly optimizing token-level generation speed and preserving semantic
alignment with ground-truth reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superior performance of SemCoT compared to state-of-the-art methods in both
efficiency and effectiveness. Our code can be found at

TL;DR: 研究发现不同架构、数据集和规模的自回归语言模型在预训练过程中表现出高度一致的行为模式，98%的词级行为方差可由词频、n-gram概率和语义相似性三个简单启发式解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索不同语言模型在预训练过程中的行为变化模式是否具有一致性，以及能否用简单启发式解释模型行为。

Method: 分析了超过1,400个语言模型检查点在11万+英语token上的表现，比较了Transformer、Mamba、RWKV等不同架构，OpenWebText和The Pile等不同数据集，以及1400万到120亿参数的不同规模模型。

Result: 发现所有语言模型都表现出相似的行为阶段：在训练过程中，模型对词的预测概率会逐渐过拟合到这些词的n-gram概率（n值不断增加）。三个简单启发式（词频、n-gram概率、语义相似性）可解释高达98%的词级行为方差。

Conclusion: 神经语言模型的学习轨迹可能具有普遍性，不受模型具体细节的影响，这为理解语言模型学习过程提供了重要见解。

Abstract: We show that across architecture (Transformer vs. Mamba vs. RWKV), training
dataset (OpenWebText vs. The Pile), and scale (14 million parameters to 12
billion parameters), autoregressive language models exhibit highly consistent
patterns of change in their behavior over the course of pretraining. Based on
our analysis of over 1,400 language model checkpoints on over 110,000 tokens of
English, we find that up to 98% of the variance in language model behavior at
the word level can be explained by three simple heuristics: the unigram
probability (frequency) of a given word, the $n$-gram probability of the word,
and the semantic similarity between the word and its context. Furthermore, we
see consistent behavioral phases in all language models, with their predicted
probabilities for words overfitting to those words' $n$-gram probabilities for
increasing $n$ over the course of training. Taken together, these results
suggest that learning in neural language models may follow a similar trajectory
irrespective of model details.

*Chin-Jou Li,Kalvin Chang,Shikhar Bharadwaj,Eunjung Yeo,Kwanghee Choi,Jian Zhu,David Mortensen,Shinji Watanabe*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: POWSM是一个统一的多任务语音模型，能够在音频、文本和音素之间进行转换，在保持与专用模型相当性能的同时支持多种语音任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管语音识别、音素识别、字素-音素转换等任务在概念上相似，但以往都是独立研究的，每个任务都需要特定的架构和数据集。

Method: 提出了POWSM（Phonetic Open Whisper-style Speech Model）统一框架，能够联合执行多个音素相关任务，实现音频、文本和音素之间的无缝转换。

Result: POWSM在相似模型规模下优于或匹配专用音素识别模型（Wav2Vec2Phoneme和ZIPA），同时联合支持G2P、P2G和ASR任务。

Conclusion: 该模型为通用和低资源语音处理开辟了新可能性，训练数据、代码和模型已开源以促进开放科学。

Abstract: Recent advances in spoken language processing have led to substantial
progress in phonetic tasks such as automatic speech recognition (ASR), phone
recognition (PR), grapheme-to-phoneme conversion (G2P), and phoneme-to-grapheme
conversion (P2G). Despite their conceptual similarity, these tasks have largely
been studied in isolation, each relying on task-specific architectures and
datasets. In this paper, we introduce POWSM (Phonetic Open Whisper-style Speech
Model), the first unified framework capable of jointly performing multiple
phone-related tasks. POWSM enables seamless conversion between audio, text
(graphemes), and phones, opening up new possibilities for universal and
low-resource speech processing. Our model outperforms or matches specialized PR
models of similar size (Wav2Vec2Phoneme and ZIPA) while jointly supporting G2P,
P2G, and ASR. Our training data, code and models are released to foster open
science.

TL;DR: 训练小型注意力变换器在IOI任务上，发现单层双头模型即可完美解决任务，揭示了可解释的推理电路


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练模型复杂性掩盖了特定推理任务所需的最小机制，希望通过可控训练环境研究变换器的计算基础

Method: 训练小型注意力变换器在符号化IOI任务上，使用残差流分解、谱分析和嵌入干预分析电路机制

Result: 单层双头模型实现完美IOI准确率，两个头分别专门化为加性和对比性子电路，共同实现IOI解析

Conclusion: 任务特定训练产生高度可解释的最小电路，为研究变换器推理计算基础提供了受控测试平台

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability aims to reverse-engineer large language models
(LLMs) into human-understandable computational circuits. However, the
complexity of pretrained models often obscures the minimal mechanisms required
for specific reasoning tasks. In this work, we train small, attention-only
transformers from scratch on a symbolic version of the Indirect Object
Identification (IOI) task -- a benchmark for studying coreference -- like
reasoning in transformers. Surprisingly, a single-layer model with only two
attention heads achieves perfect IOI accuracy, despite lacking MLPs and
normalization layers. Through residual stream decomposition, spectral analysis,
and embedding interventions, we find that the two heads specialize into
additive and contrastive subcircuits that jointly implement IOI resolution.
Furthermore, we show that a two-layer, one-head model achieves similar
performance by composing information across layers through query-value
interactions. These results demonstrate that task-specific training induces
highly interpretable, minimal circuits, offering a controlled testbed for
probing the computational foundations of transformer reasoning.

*Pedro Corrêa,João Lima,Victor Moreno,Paula Dornhofer Paro Costa*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 评估四个口语语言模型在情感不一致语音样本上的表现，发现这些模型主要依赖文本语义而非语音情感特征来完成情感识别任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然口语语言模型在音频理解方面取得了进展，但对其泛化能力和多模态整合程度的讨论日益增多，特别是在情感识别任务中模型是否真正整合了音频和文本模态。

Method: 使用情感不一致的语音样本数据集（EMIS），在这种条件下语音内容传达一种情感而语音表达传达另一种情感，评估四个口语语言模型在语音情感识别任务上的表现。

Result: 结果表明口语语言模型主要依赖文本语义而非语音情感来完成任务，表明文本相关表征在很大程度上主导了音频表征。

Conclusion: 当前的口语语言模型在情感识别任务中未能充分整合音频模态，文本表征占据主导地位，需要进一步改进多模态融合能力。

Abstract: Advancements in spoken language processing have driven the development of
spoken language models (SLMs), designed to achieve universal audio
understanding by jointly learning text and audio representations for a wide
range of tasks. Although promising results have been achieved, there is growing
discussion regarding these models' generalization capabilities and the extent
to which they truly integrate audio and text modalities in their internal
representations. In this work, we evaluate four SLMs on the task of speech
emotion recognition using a dataset of emotionally incongruent speech samples,
a condition under which the semantic content of the spoken utterance conveys
one emotion while speech expressiveness conveys another. Our results indicate
that SLMs rely predominantly on textual semantics rather than speech emotion to
perform the task, indicating that text-related representations largely dominate
over acoustic representations. We release both the code and the Emotionally
Incongruent Synthetic Speech dataset (EMIS) to the community.

*Nourah M Salem,Elizabeth White,Michael Bada,Lawrence Hunter*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究调查了大型语言模型在生物医学文献中识别研究知识空白的能力，包括显性空白和隐性空白，并提出了TABI推理方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学进步依赖于明确阐述未知领域，但现有研究主要关注显性空白检测，需要扩展隐性空白的识别能力。

Method: 在四个数据集上对近1500份文档进行实验，比较闭源和开源模型，引入TABI（Toulmin-Abductive Bucketed Inference）方案来结构化推理和验证推断结论。

Result: LLMs在识别显性和隐性知识空白方面表现出强大能力，闭源和开源模型都有效，较大模型通常表现更好。

Conclusion: LLMs能够系统识别候选知识空白，支持早期研究制定、政策制定和资助决策，但需要领域适应、人工验证和跨模型基准测试。

Abstract: Scientific progress is driven by the deliberate articulation of what remains
unknown. This study investigates the ability of large language models (LLMs) to
identify research knowledge gaps in the biomedical literature. We define two
categories of knowledge gaps: explicit gaps, clear declarations of missing
knowledge; and implicit gaps, context-inferred missing knowledge. While prior
work has focused mainly on explicit gap detection, we extend this line of
research by addressing the novel task of inferring implicit gaps. We conducted
two experiments on almost 1500 documents across four datasets, including a
manually annotated corpus of biomedical articles. We benchmarked both
closed-weight models (from OpenAI) and open-weight models (Llama and Gemma 2)
under paragraph-level and full-paper settings. To address the reasoning of
implicit gaps inference, we introduce \textbf{\small TABI}, a Toulmin-Abductive
Bucketed Inference scheme that structures reasoning and buckets inferred
conclusion candidates for validation. Our results highlight the robust
capability of LLMs in identifying both explicit and implicit knowledge gaps.
This is true for both open- and closed-weight models, with larger variants
often performing better. This suggests a strong ability of LLMs for
systematically identifying candidate knowledge gaps, which can support
early-stage research formulation, policymakers, and funding decisions. We also
report observed failure modes and outline directions for robust deployment,
including domain adaptation, human-in-the-loop verification, and benchmarking
across open- and closed-weight models.

*Seonjeong Hwang,Hyounghun Kim,Gary Geunbae Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨LLMs能否评估阅读理解题目的认知复杂度，发现LLMs可以近似估计认知复杂度，但在元认知意识方面存在缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统上认知特征依赖人工标注，本研究探索LLMs是否能自动提取阅读理解题目的认知复杂度特征。

Method: 通过关注证据范围和转换水平两个维度，使用LLMs评估阅读理解题目的认知复杂度。

Result: 实验结果显示LLMs能够近似估计题目的认知复杂度，但存在元认知意识与推理能力不匹配的问题。

Conclusion: LLMs有潜力作为先验难度分析工具，但在理解自身推理过程方面仍需改进。

Abstract: Estimating the cognitive complexity of reading comprehension (RC) items is
crucial for assessing item difficulty before it is administered to learners.
Unlike syntactic and semantic features, such as passage length or semantic
similarity between options, cognitive features that arise during answer
reasoning are not readily extractable using existing NLP tools and have
traditionally relied on human annotation. In this study, we examine whether
large language models (LLMs) can estimate the cognitive complexity of RC items
by focusing on two dimensions-Evidence Scope and Transformation Level-that
indicate the degree of cognitive burden involved in reasoning about the answer.
Our experimental results demonstrate that LLMs can approximate the cognitive
complexity of items, indicating their potential as tools for prior difficulty
analysis. Further analysis reveals a gap between LLMs' reasoning ability and
their metacognitive awareness: even when they produce correct answers, they
sometimes fail to correctly identify the features underlying their own
reasoning process.

### [101] [TOPol: Capturing and Explaining Multidimensional Semantic Polarity Fields and Vectors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25069)
*Gabin Taibi,Lucia Gomez*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TOPol是一个半无监督框架，用于重建和解释多维叙事极性场，通过人类在环定义的上下文边界来分析语义极性变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统计算语言学方法将情感视为单维尺度，忽略了语言的多维结构。本文旨在解决这一局限，开发能够捕捉多维语义极性的框架。

Method: 使用基于transformer的大语言模型嵌入文档，应用邻居调优的UMAP投影，通过Leiden分区进行主题分割。计算主题边界质心之间的方向向量，生成极性场来量化语义位移。

Result: 在两个语料库上的评估显示：美联储演讲中捕捉到非情感语义转变，亚马逊评论中情感极性与NRC效价一致。TOPol能够一致地捕捉情感和非情感极性转变。

Conclusion: TOPol提供了一个可扩展、可泛化且可解释的框架，用于上下文敏感的多维话语分析，方法稳定且结果主要受人类在环可调参数影响。

Abstract: Traditional approaches to semantic polarity in computational linguistics
treat sentiment as a unidimensional scale, overlooking the multidimensional
structure of language. This work introduces TOPol (Topic-Orientation POLarity),
a semi-unsupervised framework for reconstructing and interpreting
multidimensional narrative polarity fields under human-on-the-loop (HoTL)
defined contextual boundaries (CBs). The framework embeds documents using a
transformer-based large language model (tLLM), applies neighbor-tuned UMAP
projection, and segments topics via Leiden partitioning. Given a CB between
discourse regimes A and B, TOPol computes directional vectors between
corresponding topic-boundary centroids, yielding a polarity field that
quantifies fine-grained semantic displacement during regime shifts. This
vectorial representation enables assessing CB quality and detecting polarity
changes, guiding HoTL CB refinement. To interpret identified polarity vectors,
the tLLM compares their extreme points and produces contrastive labels with
estimated coverage. Robustness analyses show that only CB definitions (the main
HoTL-tunable parameter) significantly affect results, confirming methodological
stability. We evaluate TOPol on two corpora: (i) U.S. Central Bank speeches
around a macroeconomic breakpoint, capturing non-affective semantic shifts, and
(ii) Amazon product reviews across rating strata, where affective polarity
aligns with NRC valence. Results demonstrate that TOPol consistently captures
both affective and non-affective polarity transitions, providing a scalable,
generalizable, and interpretable framework for context-sensitive
multidimensional discourse analysis.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 评估生成式大语言模型在生物医学文本中共指消解的性能，通过不同提示策略与判别式方法SpanBERT对比，发现LLaMA模型在实体增强提示下表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物医学文本中的共指消解面临领域特定术语复杂、指称形式歧义高、长距离依赖等独特挑战，需要评估生成式LLM在此领域的适用性。

Method: 使用CRAFT语料库作为基准，设计了四种不同提示实验（局部、上下文增强、缩写和实体词典等领域特定线索），并与判别式SpanBERT模型进行对比。

Result: LLMs在表面层共指能力表现强劲，特别是在领域基础提示增强下，但对长距离上下文和指称歧义仍敏感。LLaMA 8B和17B模型在实体增强提示下展现出优越的精确度和F1分数。

Conclusion: 轻量级提示工程有潜力增强LLM在生物医学NLP任务中的实用性，实体增强提示能显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: Coreference resolution in biomedical texts presents unique challenges due to
complex domain-specific terminology, high ambiguity in mention forms, and
long-distance dependencies between coreferring expressions. In this work, we
present a comprehensive evaluation of generative large language models (LLMs)
for coreference resolution in the biomedical domain. Using the CRAFT corpus as
our benchmark, we assess the LLMs' performance with four prompting experiments
that vary in their use of local, contextual enrichment, and domain-specific
cues such as abbreviations and entity dictionaries. We benchmark these
approaches against a discriminative span-based encoder, SpanBERT, to compare
the efficacy of generative versus discriminative methods. Our results
demonstrate that while LLMs exhibit strong surface-level coreference
capabilities, especially when supplemented with domain-grounding prompts, their
performance remains sensitive to long-range context and mentions ambiguity.
Notably, the LLaMA 8B and 17B models show superior precision and F1 scores
under entity-augmented prompting, highlighting the potential of lightweight
prompt engineering for enhancing LLM utility in biomedical NLP tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DEBATE是首个大规模实证基准，用于评估多智能体角色扮演LLM交互的真实性，包含29,417条真实辩论消息，揭示了模拟与真实群体动态的关键差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM角色扮演设置常产生不自然的动态（如过早收敛），缺乏衡量真实人类观点轨迹的实证基准，需要准确建模社会互动中的观点变化以解决错误信息和极化问题。

Method: 构建包含29,417条消息的DEBATE基准，来自2,792名美国参与者关于107个争议话题的多轮辩论对话，同时收集公开表达的消息和私下报告的观点，并用于监督微调LLM。

Result: 系统评估发现模拟与真实群体动态存在关键差异，监督微调在表层指标（如ROUGE-L和消息长度）上有所改进，但在深层语义对齐（如语义相似性）方面仍存在局限性。

Conclusion: 角色扮演LLM智能体在真实模拟人类社交动态方面既有潜力也存在当前局限性，需要进一步改进语义对齐能力。

Abstract: Accurately modeling opinion change through social interactions is crucial for
addressing issues like misinformation and polarization. While role-playing
large language models (LLMs) offer a promising way to simulate human-like
interactions, existing research shows that single-agent alignment does not
guarantee authentic multi-agent group dynamics. Current LLM role-play setups
often produce unnatural dynamics (e.g., premature convergence), without an
empirical benchmark to measure authentic human opinion trajectories. To bridge
this gap, we introduce DEBATE, the first large-scale empirical benchmark
explicitly designed to evaluate the authenticity of the interaction between
multi-agent role-playing LLMs. DEBATE contains 29,417 messages from multi-round
debate conversations among over 2,792 U.S.-based participants discussing 107
controversial topics, capturing both publicly-expressed messages and
privately-reported opinions. Using DEBATE, we systematically evaluate and
identify critical discrepancies between simulated and authentic group dynamics.
We further demonstrate DEBATE's utility for aligning LLMs with human behavior
through supervised fine-tuning, achieving improvements in surface-level metrics
(e.g., ROUGE-L and message length) while highlighting limitations in deeper
semantic alignment (e.g., semantic similarity). Our findings highlight both the
potential and current limitations of role-playing LLM agents for realistically
simulating human-like social dynamics.

Abstract: This research article examines the effectiveness of various pretraining
strategies for developing machine translation models tailored to low-resource
languages. Although this work considers several low-resource languages,
including Afrikaans, Swahili, and Zulu, the translation model is specifically
developed for Lingala, an under-resourced African language, building upon the
pretraining approach introduced by Reid and Artetxe (2021), originally designed
for high-resource languages. Through a series of comprehensive experiments, we
explore different pretraining methodologies, including the integration of
multiple languages and the use of both monolingual and parallel data during the
pretraining phase. Our findings indicate that pretraining on multiple languages
and leveraging both monolingual and parallel data significantly enhance
translation quality. This study offers valuable insights into effective
pretraining strategies for low-resource machine translation, helping to bridge
the performance gap between high-resource and low-resource languages. The
results contribute to the broader goal of developing more inclusive and
accurate NLP models for marginalized communities and underrepresented
populations. The code and datasets used in this study are publicly available to
facilitate further research and ensure reproducibility, with the exception of
certain data that may no longer be accessible due to changes in public
availability.

Abstract: The advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized natural
language processing, yet their training on massive corpora poses significant
risks, including the memorization of sensitive personal data, copyrighted
material, and knowledge that could facilitate malicious activities. To mitigate
these issues and align with legal and ethical standards such as the "right to
be forgotten", machine unlearning has emerged as a critical technique to
selectively erase specific knowledge from LLMs without compromising their
overall performance. This survey provides a systematic review of over 180
papers on LLM unlearning published since 2021, focusing exclusively on
large-scale generative models. Distinct from prior surveys, we introduce novel
taxonomies for both unlearning methods and evaluations. We clearly categorize
methods into training-time, post-training, and inference-time based on the
training stage at which unlearning is applied. For evaluations, we not only
systematically compile existing datasets and metrics but also critically
analyze their advantages, disadvantages, and applicability, providing practical
guidance to the research community. In addition, we discuss key challenges and
promising future research directions. Our comprehensive overview aims to inform
and guide the ongoing development of secure and reliable LLMs.

TL;DR: 提出了一种在潜在空间中解耦语义语音内容和背景噪声的方法，通过端到端模型分离出干净的语音代码本标记，同时提取可解释的噪声向量作为量化残差，显著提升了噪声环境下的语音识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离散音频表示在语音建模中越来越受欢迎，但在嘈杂或真实环境中的表现并不总是最优。现有方法直接量化Whisper嵌入进行语音到单元建模，但未能有效分离语义内容和背景噪声。

Method: 构建端到端模型，在潜在空间中解耦语义语音内容和背景噪声。模型分离出干净的语音代码本标记，同时提取可解释的噪声向量作为量化残差，并通过轻量级分类器进行监督。

Result: 在VBDemand测试集上，相比Whisper实现了82%的错误率降低，相比基线方法提升了35%的性能。学习到的标记空间在已见和未见声学条件下都表现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了语音表示对噪声的鲁棒性，改善了干净/嘈杂语音与文本之间的对齐，生成的语音标记具有高度的噪声不变性，显著提升了ASR性能。

Abstract: Discrete audio representations are gaining traction in speech modeling due to
their interpretability and compatibility with large language models, but are
not always optimized for noisy or real-world environments. Building on existing
works that quantize Whisper embeddings for speech-to-unit modeling, we propose
disentangling semantic speech content from background noise in the latent
space. Our end-to-end model separates clean speech in the form of codebook
tokens, while extracting interpretable noise vectors as quantization residue
which are supervised via a lightweight classifier. We show that our approach
improves alignment between clean/noisy speech and text, producing speech tokens
that display a high degree of noiseinvariance, and improves ASR performance.
Keeping Whisper frozen, we show an 82% reduction in error rate compared to
Whisper, and 35% improvement over baseline methods on the VBDemand test set.
Further analyses show that the learned token space generalizes well to both
seen and unseen acoustic conditions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Model-Document Protocol (MDP)框架，将原始文档转换为LLM可消费的知识表示，包括智能推理、记忆基础和结构化利用三种路径，并通过MDP-Agent实现验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统检索方法返回原始文本片段，将碎片组装和上下文推理的负担留给LLM，需要新的检索范式来重新定义模型与文档的交互方式。

Method: MDP框架通过三种路径转换非结构化文档：智能推理将原始证据整理为连贯上下文；记忆基础积累可重用笔记丰富推理；结构化利用将文档编码为图或键值缓存等形式表示。

Result: 在信息寻求基准测试中，MDP-Agent优于基线方法，验证了MDP框架的合理性和其智能实例化的有效性。

Conclusion: MDP框架确保LLM接收的不是原始片段而是紧凑、结构化的知识，可直接用于推理，为AI搜索提供了新的检索范式。

Abstract: AI search depends on linking large language models (LLMs) with vast external
knowledge sources. Yet web pages, PDF files, and other raw documents are not
inherently LLM-ready: they are long, noisy, and unstructured. Conventional
retrieval methods treat these documents as verbatim text and return raw
passages, leaving the burden of fragment assembly and contextual reasoning to
the LLM. This gap underscores the need for a new retrieval paradigm that
redefines how models interact with documents.
  We introduce the Model-Document Protocol (MDP), a general framework that
formalizes how raw text is bridged to LLMs through consumable knowledge
representations. Rather than treating retrieval as passage fetching, MDP
defines multiple pathways that transform unstructured documents into
task-specific, LLM-ready inputs. These include agentic reasoning, which curates
raw evidence into coherent context; memory grounding, which accumulates
reusable notes to enrich reasoning; and structured leveraging, which encodes
documents into formal representations such as graphs or key-value caches. All
three pathways share the same goal: ensuring that what reaches the LLM is not
raw fragments but compact, structured knowledge directly consumable for
reasoning.
  As an instantiation, we present MDP-Agent, which realizes the protocol
through an agentic process: constructing document-level gist memories for
global coverage, performing diffusion-based exploration with vertical
exploitation to uncover layered dependencies, and applying map-reduce style
synthesis to integrate large-scale evidence into compact yet sufficient
context. Experiments on information-seeking benchmarks demonstrate that
MDP-Agent outperforms baselines, validating both the soundness of the MDP
framework and the effectiveness of its agentic instantiation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文通过构建包含英语、斯瓦希里语和豪萨语的大规模基准测试，研究了大型语言模型在低资源语言上的表现，并分析了思维链提示在不同能力模型中的差异化效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探究大型语言模型的优异表现究竟是源于真正的能力还是英语数据的优势，通过在低资源语言环境中测试模型来验证这一问题。

Method: 基于Next Sentence Prediction任务，构建了包含英语（高资源）、斯瓦希里语（中资源）和豪萨语（低资源）各10,000个问题的大规模基准测试，测试了GPT-4 Turbo、Gemini 1.5 Flash和LLaMA 3 70B等模型，并引入思维链提示技术。

Result: 所有模型在英语上表现优异，但在斯瓦希里语上准确率下降，在豪萨语上急剧下降，LLaMA 3表现最差。思维链提示对能力较弱的LLaMA 3有显著帮助，但对GPT-4和Gemini等更强模型反而导致"过度思考"而损害性能。

Conclusion: 思维链提示并非通用解决方案，其效果高度依赖于模型的基线能力和任务的具体上下文。该框架能够识别LLM的弱点，揭示思维链在跨语言NSP任务中何时有益或有害，以及影响其决策的因素。

Abstract: While large language models are trained on massive datasets, this data is
heavily skewed towards English. Does their impressive performance reflect
genuine ability or just this data advantage? To find out, we tested them in a
setting where they could not rely on data abundance: low-resource languages.
Building on prior work Agarwal et al. (2025) that used Next Sentence Prediction
(NSP) as a test, we created a large-scale benchmark with 10,000 questions each
for English (a high-resource language), Swahili (medium-resource), and Hausa
(low-resource). We then tested several top models, including GPT-4 Turbo,
Gemini 1.5 Flash, and LLaMA 3 70B, to see how their performance holds up. The
results painted a clear picture of how levels of language resources impact
outcomes. While all models excelled in English, their accuracy dropped in
Swahili and fell sharply in Hausa, with LLaMA 3 struggling the most. The story
became even more interesting when we introduced Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
prompting. For the struggling LLaMA 3, CoT acted as a helpful guide,
significantly boosting its accuracy. However, for the more capable GPT-4 and
Gemini, the same technique often backfired, leading to a kind of "overthinking"
that hurt their results in the cross-lingual context. This reveals that
Chain-of-Thought is not a universal solution; its effectiveness depends heavily
on the model's baseline capability and the specific context of the task. Our
framework pinpoints LLM weaknesses, highlights when CoT helps or hinders
cross-lingual NSP performance, and factors influencing their decisions.

Motivation: 当前缺乏评估主动AI代理在复杂多方协作中表现的系统方法，限制了开发能有效支持多人协作的AI的进展。谈判作为要求社会认知智能的测试平台，需要处理多方多议题的利益冲突并建立共识。

Result: 在社会智能调解代理与通用基线的比较中，社会智能调解器表现更优，通过更快、更精准的干预实现更好效果。在ProMediate-Hard设置中，社会调解器相比通用基线将共识变化提高了3.6个百分点(10.65% vs 7.01%)，同时响应速度快77%(15.98s vs 3.71s)。

Conclusion: ProMediate为推进主动、社会智能代理的发展提供了一个严谨、理论基础的测试平台。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in agentic
frameworks to assist individual users, there is a growing need for agents that
can proactively manage complex, multi-party collaboration. Systematic
evaluation methods for such proactive agents remain scarce, limiting progress
in developing AI that can effectively support multiple people together.
Negotiation offers a demanding testbed for this challenge, requiring
socio-cognitive intelligence to navigate conflicting interests between multiple
participants and multiple topics and build consensus. Here, we present
ProMediate, the first framework for evaluating proactive AI mediator agents in
complex, multi-topic, multi-party negotiations. ProMediate consists of two core
components: (i) a simulation testbed based on realistic negotiation cases and
theory-driven difficulty levels (ProMediate-Easy, ProMediate-Medium, and
ProMediate-Hard), with a plug-and-play proactive AI mediator grounded in
socio-cognitive mediation theories, capable of flexibly deciding when and how
to intervene; and (ii) a socio-cognitive evaluation framework with a new suite
of metrics to measure consensus changes, intervention latency, mediator
effectiveness, and intelligence. Together, these components establish a
systematic framework for assessing the socio-cognitive intelligence of
proactive AI agents in multi-party settings. Our results show that a socially
intelligent mediator agent outperforms a generic baseline, via faster,
better-targeted interventions. In the ProMediate-Hard setting, our social
mediator increases consensus change by 3.6 percentage points compared to the
generic baseline (10.65\% vs 7.01\%) while being 77\% faster in response
(15.98s vs. 3.71s). In conclusion, ProMediate provides a rigorous,
theory-grounded testbed to advance the development of proactive, socially
intelligent agents.

Motivation: 低资源语言的领域特定问答面临两个关键挑战：标注数据集稀缺和通用语言模型领域知识有限。

Method: 采用多阶段微调策略，使用大语言模型（LLaMA-70B、Phi-14B）生成合成问答对来增强有限的原数据集，并探索多种训练方法对领域泛化的影响。

Result: 结果表明大模型能高效生成合成数据，而小模型能有效适应这些数据，为低资源领域特定问答提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Conclusion: 该方法为低资源、领域特定的问答系统提供了一条可扩展的发展路径。

Abstract: Domain-specific question answering in low-resource languages faces two key
challenges: scarcity of annotated datasets and limited domain knowledge in
general-purpose language models. In this work, we present a multi-stage
finetuning strategy to adapt lightweight language models to the Hindi tourism
domain by leveraging both original and synthetic training data. Synthetic
question-answer pairs are generated using large LLMs (LLaMA-70B, Phi-14B) and
used to augment the limited original dataset. We explore several training
methodologies and analyse their impact on domain generalisation. Our results
demonstrate that large models can efficiently generate synthetic data, while
small models can effectively adapt to it, offering a scalable pathway for
low-resource, domain-specific QA.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态讽刺检测在低资源设置下具有挑战性，现有参数高效微调方法由于监督信号有限难以达到最佳性能。

Method: PEKD统一框架，使用在大规模讽刺数据上训练的专家模型作为教师进行知识蒸馏，并引入熵感知门控机制根据教师置信度动态调整蒸馏强度。

Result: 在两个公共数据集上的实验表明，PEKD框架使参数高效微调方法在少样本场景下优于现有参数高效方法和大型多模态模型。

Conclusion: PEKD框架是模块化的，可适应广泛的多模态模型和任务，在少样本多模态讽刺检测中取得了显著效果。

Abstract: Multimodal sarcasm detection is challenging, especially in low-resource
settings where subtle image-text contradictions are hard to learn due to scarce
annotated data, which hinders the model's performance. Parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT) methods like adapters, LoRA, and prompt tuning reduce
overfitting but struggle to reach optimal performance due to limited
supervision from few-shot data. We propose PEKD, a unified framework that
enhances PEFT methods via distillation from an expert model trained on
large-scale sarcasm data, which acts as the teacher. To mitigate unreliable
signals from the teacher, we introduce an entropy-aware gating mechanism that
dynamically adjusts the distillation strength based on teacher confidence.
Experiments on two public datasets demonstrate that our PEKD framework enables
PEFT methods to outperform both prior parameter-efficient approaches and large
multimodal models, achieving strong results in the few-shot scenario. The
framework is modular and adaptable to a wide range of multimodal models and
tasks.

TL;DR: Parrot是一种新的训练流程，通过整合程序链式思考(P-CoT)和自然语言链式思考(N-CoT)两种范式，实现相互增强，显著提升数学推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前研究通常只追求单向增强（P-CoT增强N-CoT或N-CoT增强P-CoT），本文旨在充分发挥两种范式的优势，实现相互增强和同步改进。

Method: 1）设计三个目标子任务整合顺序P-CoT和N-CoT生成；2）采用子任务混合训练策略促进自然语言语义可转移性；3）设计转换的N-CoT辅助奖励来缓解P-CoT优化中的稀疏奖励问题。

Result: 实验表明Parrot显著提升了N-CoT和P-CoT的性能，特别是在N-CoT方面。使用Parrot SFT，LLaMA2和CodeLLaMA在MathQA上的N-CoT性能分别比资源密集的RL基线提高了+21.87和+21.48。

Conclusion: Parrot训练流程成功实现了N-CoT和P-CoT两种范式的相互增强，为数学推理问题提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Natural language chain-of-thought (N-CoT) and Program chain-of-thought
(P-CoT) have emerged as two primary paradigms for large language models (LLMs)
to solve mathematical reasoning problems. Current research typically endeavors
to achieve unidirectional enhancement: P-CoT enhanced N-CoT or N-CoT enhanced
P-CoT. In this paper, we seek to fully unleash the two paradigms' strengths for
mutual enhancement and ultimately achieve simultaneous improvements. We conduct
a detailed analysis of the error types across two paradigms, based on which we
propose Parrot, a novel training pipeline for mathematical problems: 1) Three
target-designed subtasks integrate sequential P-CoT and N-CoT generation. 2) A
subtask hybrid training strategy to facilitate natural language semantic
transferability. 3) The converted N-CoT auxiliary reward is designed to
alleviate the sparse rewards in P-CoT optimization. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Parrot significantly enhances both the performance of N-CoT
and P-CoT, especially on N-CoT. Using Parrot SFT, the N-CoT performance of
LLaMA2 and CodeLLaMA achieve gains of +21.87 and +21.48 on MathQA over the RL
baseline, which is resource-intensive.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 商业代理在处理复杂业务环境时面临数据关系复杂和任务类型多样化的挑战，需要提升处理复杂数据和异构任务的能力。

Method: 采用合成数据生成和基于强化学习的训练范式，在推理阶段引入共享记忆机制，让代理从相似问题的任务指南中学习。

Result: 在CRMArena-Pro数据集上，轻量级模型在B2B和B2C业务场景中都取得了竞争性结果。

Conclusion: CRMWeaver方法有效提升了商业代理在复杂业务环境中的表现，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed the rapid development of LLM-based agents, which
shed light on using language agents to solve complex real-world problems. A
prominent application lies in business agents, which interact with databases
and internal knowledge bases via tool calls to fulfill diverse user
requirements. However, this domain is characterized by intricate data
relationships and a wide range of heterogeneous tasks, from statistical data
queries to knowledge-based question-answering. To address these challenges, we
propose CRMWeaver, a novel approach that enhances business agents in such
complex settings. To acclimate the agentic model to intricate business
environments, we employ a synthesis data generation and RL-based paradigm
during training, which significantly improves the model's ability to handle
complex data and varied tasks. During inference, a shared memories mechanism is
introduced, prompting the agent to learn from task guidelines in similar
problems, thereby further boosting its effectiveness and generalization,
especially in unseen scenarios. We validate the efficacy of our approach on the
CRMArena-Pro dataset, where our lightweight model achieves competitive results
in both B2B and B2C business scenarios, underscoring its practical value for
real-world applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文通过实证研究反对在法律解释中使用大语言模型，发现模型判断不稳定且与人类判断相关性弱。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对法律学者和联邦法官在实践中使用LLM进行法律解释的趋势，研究旨在验证LLM在法律解释中的可靠性和稳定性。

Method: 在英语环境中进行实证调查，通过改变问题格式测试模型判断的稳定性，并分析模型判断与人类判断的相关性。

Result: 模型无法提供稳定的解释判断，不同问题格式会导致截然不同的结论；模型与人类判断仅呈现弱到中度相关性，且不同模型和问题变体间差异很大。

Conclusion: 生成式AI得出的结论不可轻信，在法律解释中使用LLM存在危险。

Abstract: Legal interpretation frequently involves assessing how a legal text, as
understood by an 'ordinary' speaker of the language, applies to the set of
facts characterizing a legal dispute in the U.S. judicial system. Recent
scholarship has proposed that legal practitioners add large language models
(LLMs) to their interpretive toolkit. This work offers an empirical argument
against LLM interpretation as recently practiced by legal scholars and federal
judges. Our investigation in English shows that models do not provide stable
interpretive judgments: varying the question format can lead the model to
wildly different conclusions. Moreover, the models show weak to moderate
correlation with human judgment, with large variance across model and question
variant, suggesting that it is dangerous to give much credence to the
conclusions produced by generative AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索小规模语言模型（100M和140M参数）是否能够通过指令调优获得性能提升，特别是在资源受限的情况下。

Method: 使用解码器模型，比较对话和问答指令调优数据集，采用合并或顺序课程策略，在微调（SuperGLUE）和零样本（BLiMP、EWoK等）设置下进行评估。

Result: 指令调优在微调场景中产生小幅但一致的增益，顺序课程优于合并数据；但在零样本任务中改进不具一致性，表明交互导向的适应与广泛语言泛化之间存在权衡。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了在低资源语言模型中应用人类启发学习策略的潜力和限制，并指出基于课程的混合方法在生态训练限制下增强泛化能力的方向。

Abstract: This work investigates whether small-scale LMs can benefit from instruction
tuning. We compare conversational and question-answering instruction tuning
datasets, applied either in a merged or sequential curriculum, using
decoder-only models with 100M and 140M parameters. Evaluation spans both
fine-tuning (SuperGLUE) and zero-shot (BLiMP, EWoK, WUGs, entity tracking, and
psycholinguistic correlation) settings. Results show that instruction tuning
yields small but consistent gains in fine-tuning scenarios, with sequential
curricula outperforming merged data; however, improvements do not consistently
transfer to zero-shot tasks, suggesting a trade-off between interaction-focused
adaptation and broad linguistic generalization. These results highlight both
the potential and the constraints of adapting human-inspired learning
strategies to low-resource LMs, and point toward hybrid, curriculum-based
approaches for enhancing generalization under ecological training limits.

Motivation: 传统专家方法难以跟上信息通信技术等快速演进领域的短创新周期和模糊早期术语，需要新的技术预测方法。

Method: 利用LLM从非结构化文本中提取语义三元组构建技术实体关系图，开发名词钉合方法分组相似技术术语，使用图指标检测融合信号，包括多阶段过滤、领域特定关键词聚类和主题共现时序分析。

Result: 在278,625篇arXiv预印本和9,793份USPTO专利申请上验证，能够识别已建立和新兴的技术融合模式。

Conclusion: 该管道提供了一个基于全文分析的可扩展通用技术预测框架。

Abstract: Forecasting transformative technologies remains a critical but challenging
task, particularly in fast-evolving domains such as Information and
Communication Technologies (ICTs). Traditional expert-based methods struggle to
keep pace with short innovation cycles and ambiguous early-stage terminology.
In this work, we propose a novel, data-driven pipeline to monitor the emergence
of transformative technologies by identifying patterns of technological
convergence.
  Our approach leverages advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract
semantic triples from unstructured text and construct a large-scale graph of
technology-related entities and relations. We introduce a new method for
grouping semantically similar technology terms (noun stapling) and develop
graph-based metrics to detect convergence signals. The pipeline includes
multi-stage filtering, domain-specific keyword clustering, and a temporal trend
analysis of topic co-occurence.
  We validate our methodology on two complementary datasets: 278,625 arXiv
preprints (2017--2024) to capture early scientific signals, and 9,793 USPTO
patent applications (2018-2024) to track downstream commercial developments.
Our results demonstrate that the proposed pipeline can identify both
established and emerging convergence patterns, offering a scalable and
generalizable framework for technology forecasting grounded in full-text
analysis.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了大型语言模型在生成参考文献时的幻觉问题，发现高被引论文的幻觉率较低，且当引用次数超过约1000次时，文献信息几乎被逐字记忆。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在文献推荐中存在幻觉问题，即生成不存在的论文。本研究假设LLM生成文献信息的能力取决于知识是生成的还是记忆的，高被引论文（在训练语料中出现更频繁）的幻觉率较低。

Method: 使用GPT-4生成100个计算机科学领域的文献记录，通过余弦相似度测量生成与真实元数据之间的事实一致性，并分析引用频率对幻觉的影响。

Result: 结果显示：(i)不同研究领域的幻觉率不同；(ii)引用次数与事实准确性强相关；(iii)当引用次数超过约1000次时，文献信息几乎被逐字记忆。

Conclusion: 高被引论文几乎被逐字保留在模型中，表明存在一个从泛化转向记忆的阈值。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly applied to a wide range
of tasks, from natural language understanding to code generation. While they
have also been used to assist in bibliographic recommendation, the
hallucination of non-existent papers remains a major issue. Building on prior
studies, this study hypothesizes that an LLM's ability to correctly produce
bibliographic information depends on whether the underlying knowledge is
generated or memorized, with highly cited papers (i.e., more frequently appear
in the training corpus) showing lower hallucination rates. We therefore assume
citation count as a proxy for training data redundancy (i.e., the frequency
with which a given bibliographic record is repeatedly represented in the
pretraining corpus) and investigate how citation frequency affects hallucinated
references in LLM outputs. Using GPT-4.1, we generated and manually verified
100 bibliographic records across twenty computer-science domains, and measured
factual consistency via cosine similarity between generated and authentic
metadata. The results revealed that (i) hallucination rates vary across
research domains, (ii) citation count is strongly correlated with factual
accuracy, and (iii) bibliographic information becomes almost verbatimly
memorized beyond approximately 1,000 citations. These findings suggest that
highly cited papers are nearly verbatimly retained in the model, indicating a
threshold where generalization shifts into memorization.

Motivation: 心理健康AI发展受限于真实治疗对话数据的缺乏，主要由于严格的隐私法规和历史上临床会话很少被记录。

Method: 提出了SQPsych框架，基于认知行为疗法原则，将结构化心理输入通过治疗师-客户模拟转换为自然语言对话，使用开源LLM生成高质量语料库。

Result: 在SQPsychConv上微调的SQPsychLLM模型在心理咨询基准测试中表现优异，在关键治疗技能上超越了基线模型。

Conclusion: 合成数据具有实现可扩展、数据安全且临床知情的心理健康AI支持的潜力。

Abstract: The development of AI for mental health is hindered by a lack of authentic
therapy dialogues, due to strict privacy regulations and the fact that clinical
sessions were historically rarely recorded. We present an LLM-driven pipeline
that generates synthetic counseling dialogues based on structured client
profiles and psychological questionnaires. Grounded on the principles of
Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), our method creates synthetic therapeutic
conversations for clinical disorders such as anxiety and depression. Our
framework, SQPsych (Structured Questionnaire-based Psychotherapy), converts
structured psychological input into natural language dialogues through
therapist-client simulations. Due to data governance policies and privacy
restrictions prohibiting the transmission of clinical questionnaire data to
third-party services, previous methodologies relying on proprietary models are
infeasible in our setting. We address this limitation by generating a
high-quality corpus using open-weight LLMs, validated through human expert
evaluation and LLM-based assessments. Our SQPsychLLM models fine-tuned on
SQPsychConv achieve strong performance on counseling benchmarks, surpassing
baselines in key therapeutic skills. Our findings highlight the potential of
synthetic data to enable scalable, data-secure, and clinically informed AI for
mental health support. We will release our code, models, and corpus at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要是以英语为中心和领域无关的，限制了它们在印度语境下的适用性，需要针对印度特定领域和文化的评估工具。

Method: 构建包含74,166个问答对的基准数据集，其中52,494个为英文，21,672个为印地语，数据来源于真实的政府和领域特定考试，涵盖4大领域、90+子领域和500+主题。

Result: 评估29+个LLMs显示显著的领域和语言特定性能差距，GPT-4o在法律领域准确率达76.49%，但在阿育吠陀领域仅为59.74%。所有模型在英文内容上的表现均优于印地语。

Conclusion: BhashaBench V1为评估LLMs在印度多样化知识领域的能力提供了全面数据集，支持模型整合领域特定知识与双语理解能力的评估。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models(LLMs) has intensified the need
for domain and culture specific evaluation. Existing benchmarks are largely
Anglocentric and domain-agnostic, limiting their applicability to India-centric
contexts. To address this gap, we introduce BhashaBench V1, the first
domain-specific, multi-task, bilingual benchmark focusing on critical Indic
knowledge systems. BhashaBench V1 contains 74,166 meticulously curated
question-answer pairs, with 52,494 in English and 21,672 in Hindi, sourced from
authentic government and domain-specific exams. It spans four major domains:
Agriculture, Legal, Finance, and Ayurveda, comprising 90+ subdomains and
covering 500+ topics, enabling fine-grained evaluation. Evaluation of 29+ LLMs
reveals significant domain and language specific performance gaps, with
especially large disparities in low-resource domains. For instance, GPT-4o
achieves 76.49% overall accuracy in Legal but only 59.74% in Ayurveda. Models
consistently perform better on English content compared to Hindi across all
domains. Subdomain-level analysis shows that areas such as Cyber Law,
International Finance perform relatively well, while Panchakarma, Seed Science,
and Human Rights remain notably weak. BhashaBench V1 provides a comprehensive
dataset for evaluating large language models across India's diverse knowledge
domains. It enables assessment of models' ability to integrate domain-specific
knowledge with bilingual understanding. All code, benchmarks, and resources are
publicly available to support open research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM服务系统主要为文本补全设计，无法有效适应日益复杂的LLM应用需求，缺乏灵活性。

Method: 提出LLM推理程序(LIPs)概念，将应用逻辑部分卸载到服务器；设计Symphony系统作为LIPs的操作系统，通过系统调用暴露LLM计算，虚拟化KV缓存，采用两级进程调度确保GPU效率。

Result: Symphony系统能够更高效、可扩展地支持复杂LLM应用，提升服务系统的适应性和性能。

Conclusion: Symphony架构为LLM应用开启了一个更高效和可扩展的生态系统，解决了现有服务系统的局限性。

Abstract: Current large language model (LLM) serving systems, primarily designed for
text completion, are neither efficient nor adaptable for increasingly complex
LLM applications due to their inflexible design. We propose a new LLM serving
system architecture that serves programs instead of prompts to address this
problem. These programs, called LLM Inference Programs (LIPs), allow users to
customize token prediction and KV cache management at runtime and to offload
parts of their application logic, such as tool execution, to the server. We
describe an example of this architecture through a system named Symphony, which
functions as an operating system for LIPs. Symphony exposes LLM model
computations via system calls and virtualizes KV cache with a dedicated file
system, while ensuring GPU efficiency with a two-level process scheduling
scheme. Symphony has the potential to open the door to a more efficient and
extensible ecosystem for LLM applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有手语翻译数据集规模有限、缺乏多语言覆盖，且依赖专家标注和受控录制环境，成本高昂。VLM作为评估器和实时助手的能力尚未在手语数据采集中得到充分利用。

Method: 基于VLM的流水线包括：人脸可见性检测、手语活动识别、视频内容文本提取、视频与文本对齐验证，实现通用过滤、标注和验证步骤。应用于8种手语的TikTok视频和已有的YouTube-SL-25德语手语数据集。

Result: 构建了TikTok-SL-8多语言手语语料库，在德语和美国手语上评估了两个现成SLT模型，建立了基线并验证了模型在自动提取的噪声数据上的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该工作实现了可扩展的弱监督预训练，促进了从社交媒体获取手语数据的能力，为手语翻译研究提供了新的数据获取途径。

Abstract: Most existing sign language translation (SLT) datasets are limited in scale,
lack multilingual coverage, and are costly to curate due to their reliance on
expert annotation and controlled recording setup. Recently, Vision Language
Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities as evaluators and real-time
assistants. Despite these advancements, their potential remains untapped in the
context of sign language dataset acquisition. To bridge this gap, we introduce
the first automated annotation and filtering framework that utilizes VLMs to
reduce reliance on manual effort while preserving data quality. Our method is
applied to TikTok videos across eight sign languages and to the already curated
YouTube-SL-25 dataset in German Sign Language for the purpose of additional
evaluation. Our VLM-based pipeline includes a face visibility detection, a sign
activity recognition, a text extraction from video content, and a judgment step
to validate alignment between video and text, implementing generic filtering,
annotation and validation steps. Using the resulting corpus, TikTok-SL-8, we
assess the performance of two off-the-shelf SLT models on our filtered dataset
for German and American Sign Languages, with the goal of establishing baselines
and evaluating the robustness of recent models on automatically extracted,
slightly noisy data. Our work enables scalable, weakly supervised pretraining
for SLT and facilitates data acquisition from social media.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型在人类-计算机交互中的核心地位日益突出，需要关注交互的语言学基础，特别是隐含意义，这对人类-AI对齐至关重要。

Method: 研究评估了LLMs从上下文驱动提示中推断用户意图的能力，并检验理解隐含意义是否能改善响应生成。

Result: 更大模型更接近人类理解，小模型在隐含意义推理上表现较差；基于隐含意义的提示显著提升了所有模型的响应相关性和质量，特别是小模型；67.6%的参与者更喜欢隐含意义提示的响应。

Conclusion: 语言学理论可用于解决对齐问题，使人类-AI交互更加自然和基于上下文。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) is positioning language
at the core of human-computer interaction (HCI). We argue that advancing HCI
requires attention to the linguistic foundations of interaction, particularly
implicature (meaning conveyed beyond explicit statements through shared
context) which is essential for human-AI (HAI) alignment. This study examines
LLMs' ability to infer user intent embedded in context-driven prompts and
whether understanding implicature improves response generation. Results show
that larger models approximate human interpretations more closely, while
smaller models struggle with implicature inference. Furthermore,
implicature-based prompts significantly enhance the perceived relevance and
quality of responses across models, with notable gains in smaller models.
Overall, 67.6% of participants preferred responses with implicature-embedded
prompts to literal ones, highlighting a clear preference for contextually
nuanced communication. Our work contributes to understanding how linguistic
theory can be used to address the alignment problem by making HAI interaction
more natural and contextually grounded.

*Auguste Poiroux,Antoine Bosselut,Viktor Kunčak*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RLMEval是一个针对神经定理证明和证明自动形式化的评估套件，专注于真实世界Lean形式化项目中的研究级数学问题，揭示了现有模型在现实场景中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型在精选基准测试中表现优异，但在研究级神经定理证明和证明自动形式化方面的实际影响仍然有限，需要更贴近真实场景的评估标准。

Method: 利用真实Lean Blueprint形式化项目，构建包含613个定理的评估套件，涵盖6个Lean项目，专注于研究级数学定理的挑战性评估。

Result: 在RLMEval上的评估显示，现有最先进模型仅达到10.3%的通过率，表明现有基准测试的进展难以转化到更现实的设置中。

Conclusion: RLMEval提供了一个新的挑战性基准，旨在指导和加速形式数学中自动推理的进展。

Abstract: Despite impressive results on curated benchmarks, the practical impact of
large language models (LLMs) on research-level neural theorem proving and proof
autoformalization is still limited. We introduce RLMEval, an evaluation suite
for these tasks, focusing on research-level mathematics from real-world Lean
formalization projects. RLMEval targets the evaluation of neural theorem
proving and proof autoformalization on challenging research-level theorems by
leveraging real Lean Blueprint formalization projects. Our evaluation of
state-of-the-art models on RLMEval, comprising 613 theorems from 6 Lean
projects, reveals a significant gap: progress on existing benchmarks does not
readily translate to these more realistic settings, with the best model
achieving only a 10.3 % pass rate. RLMEval provides a new, challenging
benchmark designed to guide and accelerate progress in automated reasoning for
formal mathematics.

*Ali Sanaei,Ali Rajabzadeh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个框架，将LLM在定性研究中的使用按解释深度和自主性两个维度分类，建议通过任务分解和有限自主性来平衡效率与可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在定性社会科学研究中面临的解释偏见、低可靠性和弱可审计性等挑战。

Method: 基于Web of Science上所有使用LLM作为工具的已发表社会科学论文，分析LLM应用在解释深度和自主性两个维度上的分布。

Result: 发现通过将任务分解为可管理片段、保持低自主性水平，并在监督下选择性增加解释深度，可以在保持透明度和可靠性的同时获得LLM的益处。

Conclusion: 建议研究人员像委派工作给有能力的本科生研究助理一样使用LLM，而不是赋予模型过度的自由，从而在定性研究中更有效地利用LLM。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly utilized by researchers across
a wide range of domains, and qualitative social science is no exception;
however, this adoption faces persistent challenges, including interpretive
bias, low reliability, and weak auditability. We introduce a framework that
situates LLM usage along two dimensions, interpretive depth and autonomy,
thereby offering a straightforward way to classify LLM applications in
qualitative research and to derive practical design recommendations. We present
the state of the literature with respect to these two dimensions, based on all
published social science papers available on Web of Science that use LLMs as a
tool and not strictly as the subject of study. Rather than granting models
expansive freedom, our approach encourages researchers to decompose tasks into
manageable segments, much as they would when delegating work to capable
undergraduate research assistants. By maintaining low levels of autonomy and
selectively increasing interpretive depth only where warranted and under
supervision, one can plausibly reap the benefits of LLMs while preserving
transparency and reliability.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了手语翻译自动评估指标的局限性，分析了BLEU、ROUGE等传统文本指标和基于大语言模型的评估器在语义等价性、幻觉检测等方面的表现差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前手语翻译评估主要依赖文本指标，但文本指标是否能可靠评估手语翻译质量尚不明确，需要系统分析这些指标的局限性和适用性。

Method: 通过分析六种评估指标（包括BLEU、chrF、ROUGE、BLEURT以及基于LLM的G-Eval和GEMBA），在三种控制条件下评估这些指标的一致性和鲁棒性：释义、模型输出幻觉和句子长度变化。

Result: 词汇重叠指标存在明显局限，LLM评估器能更好捕捉语义等价性但对LLM释义翻译存在偏见；所有指标都能检测幻觉，但BLEU过于敏感，BLEURT和LLM评估器对细微幻觉较为宽松。

Conclusion: 需要超越文本指标的多模态评估框架，以实现对手语翻译输出的更全面评估。

Abstract: Automatic evaluation metrics are crucial for advancing sign language
translation (SLT). Current SLT evaluation metrics, such as BLEU and ROUGE, are
only text-based, and it remains unclear to what extent text-based metrics can
reliably capture the quality of SLT outputs. To address this gap, we
investigate the limitations of text-based SLT evaluation metrics by analyzing
six metrics, including BLEU, chrF, and ROUGE, as well as BLEURT on the one
hand, and large language model (LLM)-based evaluators such as G-Eval and GEMBA
zero-shot direct assessment on the other hand. Specifically, we assess the
consistency and robustness of these metrics under three controlled conditions:
paraphrasing, hallucinations in model outputs, and variations in sentence
length. Our analysis highlights the limitations of lexical overlap metrics and
demonstrates that while LLM-based evaluators better capture semantic
equivalence often missed by conventional metrics, they can also exhibit bias
toward LLM-paraphrased translations. Moreover, although all metrics are able to
detect hallucinations, BLEU tends to be overly sensitive, whereas BLEURT and
LLM-based evaluators are comparatively lenient toward subtle cases. This
motivates the need for multimodal evaluation frameworks that extend beyond
text-based metrics to enable a more holistic assessment of SLT outputs.

TL;DR: Learn-to-Ask框架通过利用专家轨迹中的"观察未来"信息，直接从离线数据学习主动对话代理，无需用户模拟器，成功将被动LLM转化为主动目标导向的合作伙伴。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM主要作为被动响应者，在高风险领域需要它们成为主动、目标导向的合作伙伴，但现有方法要么短视优化单轮属性，要么依赖脆弱且高成本的用户模拟器，存在"现实差距"问题。

Method: 利用专家轨迹中的观察未来信息推断密集的逐轮奖励信号，将长时程问题分解为监督学习任务，训练策略输出结构化(action, state_assessment)元组，控制询问内容和停止时机，并通过自动评分器校准确保奖励保真度。

Result: 在真实医疗数据集上验证了方法的有效性，使用最大32B参数的LLM，在内部严格评估中部署到在线AI服务并实现了优于人类专家的性能。

Conclusion: 该框架为将被动LLM转化为主动、目标导向的LLM应用提供了实用且经济可行的蓝图，能够将离线数据转化为实际现实世界影响。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel as passive responders, but teaching them
to be proactive, goal-oriented partners, a critical capability in high-stakes
domains, remains a major challenge. Current paradigms either myopically
optimize single-turn attributes or rely on brittle, high-cost user simulators,
creating a persistent ``reality gap''. To bridge this gap, we introduce
\texttt{Learn-to-Ask}, a general, simulator-free framework for learning and
deploying proactive dialogue agents \textit{directly from offline expert data},
bypassing the need to model complex user dynamics. Our key insight is to
reframe the offline policy learning problem by leveraging the \textbf{observed
future} of each expert trajectory. This allows us to infer a dense,
turn-by-turn reward signal grounded in the expert's revealed strategy,
decomposing the intractable long-horizon problem into a series of supervised
learning tasks, and training a policy to output a structured \texttt{(action,
state_assessment)} tuple, governing both \textbf{what to ask} and, crucially,
\textbf{when to stop}. To ensure reward fidelity, our Automated Grader
Calibration pipeline systematically purges noise from the LLM-based reward
model with minimal human supervision. Empirically, we demonstrate the efficacy
of \texttt{Learn-to-Ask} in a real-world medical dataset, using LLMs of varying
sizes up to 32B. Our approach culminates in the successful deployment of LLMs
into a live, large-scale online AI service. In rigorous in-house evaluations,
our model was launched and achieved performance even superior to human experts,
proving our framework's ability to translate offline data into tangible,
real-world impact. We hope this work provides a practical and economically
viable blueprint for transforming passive LLMs into proactive, goal-oriented
LLM applications.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种结合微调大语言模型和命名实体识别的管道，用于特定领域文本的高效摘要和标记，特别针对快速演变的亚文化语言和俚语。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决快速演变的亚文化语言和俚语对自动化信息提取和执法监控带来的挑战，需要高效处理特定领域文本的方法。

Method: 使用LLaMA Factory框架对LLaMA3-8B-Instruct等大语言模型进行微调，结合命名实体识别技术，在政治和安全领域数据集上进行训练。

Result: 指令微调显著提升了摘要和标记的准确性，特别是在专业语料上。LLaMA3-8B-Instruct模型在领域特定微调后，即使初始中文理解有限，也能超越中文训练模型，表明推理能力可以跨语言迁移。

Conclusion: LLM与NER的集成为将非结构化文本转化为可操作洞察提供了强大解决方案，支持实时应用和新兴语言趋势的捕捉，对现代知识管理和安全操作至关重要。

Abstract: This paper presents a pipeline integrating fine-tuned large language models
(LLMs) with named entity recognition (NER) for efficient domain-specific text
summarization and tagging. The authors address the challenge posed by rapidly
evolving sub-cultural languages and slang, which complicate automated
information extraction and law enforcement monitoring. By leveraging the LLaMA
Factory framework, the study fine-tunes LLMs on both generalpurpose and custom
domain-specific datasets, particularly in the political and security domains.
The models are evaluated using BLEU and ROUGE metrics, demonstrating that
instruction fine-tuning significantly enhances summarization and tagging
accuracy, especially for specialized corpora. Notably, the LLaMA3-8B-Instruct
model, despite its initial limitations in Chinese comprehension, outperforms
its Chinese-trained counterpart after domainspecific fine-tuning, suggesting
that underlying reasoning capabilities can transfer across languages. The
pipeline enables concise summaries and structured entity tagging, facilitating
rapid document categorization and distribution. This approach proves scalable
and adaptable for real-time applications, supporting efficient information
management and the ongoing need to capture emerging language trends. The
integration of LLMs and NER offers a robust solution for transforming
unstructured text into actionable insights, crucial for modern knowledge
management and security operations.

TL;DR: TwinVoice是一个评估LLM在真实场景下模拟人物角色的综合基准，涵盖社交、人际和叙事三个维度，分解为六项核心能力评估。实验显示先进模型在人物模拟上表现中等，但在句法风格和记忆回忆方面仍有不足，整体性能远低于人类基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于LLM的人物角色模拟评估存在局限性：大多依赖合成对话、缺乏系统框架、未分析能力需求。需要开发更全面的评估基准来真实反映LLM在模拟个体沟通风格、行为倾向和个性特征方面的能力。

Method: 提出TwinVoice基准，包含三个维度：社交角色（公共社交互动）、人际角色（私人对话）和叙事角色（基于角色的表达）。将LLM性能评估分解为六项基本能力：观点一致性、记忆回忆、逻辑推理、词汇保真度、角色语气和句法风格。

Result: 实验结果显示，先进模型在人物角色模拟上达到中等准确率，但在句法风格和记忆回忆等能力方面表现不足。LLM的平均性能显著低于人类基准水平。

Conclusion: 虽然LLM在人物角色模拟方面展现出一定能力，但在句法风格和记忆回忆等关键能力上仍有明显差距，需要进一步改进才能达到人类水平的模拟效果。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are exhibiting emergent human-like abilities and
are increasingly envisioned as the foundation for simulating an individual's
communication style, behavioral tendencies, and personality traits. However,
current evaluations of LLM-based persona simulation remain limited: most rely
on synthetic dialogues, lack systematic frameworks, and lack analysis of the
capability requirement. To address these limitations, we introduce TwinVoice, a
comprehensive benchmark for assessing persona simulation across diverse
real-world contexts. TwinVoice encompasses three dimensions: Social Persona
(public social interactions), Interpersonal Persona (private dialogues), and
Narrative Persona (role-based expression). It further decomposes the evaluation
of LLM performance into six fundamental capabilities, including opinion
consistency, memory recall, logical reasoning, lexical fidelity, persona tone,
and syntactic style. Experimental results reveal that while advanced models
achieve moderate accuracy in persona simulation, they still fall short of
capabilities such as syntactic style and memory recall. Consequently, the
average performance achieved by LLMs remains considerably below the human
baseline.

Motivation: 虽然LLM智能体通常从行动规划/生成角度进行研究以完成目标，但它们在协作实现共同目标方面的能力尚未得到充分探索，特别是在信息不对称条件下。

Method: 采用微调加验证器框架，为LLM智能体配备各种沟通策略和环境验证信号，在扩展的爱因斯坦谜题桌面游戏中测试协作能力。

Result: 实证结果强调了对齐沟通的关键重要性，特别是当智能体同时具备信息寻求和提供能力时。有趣的是，没有沟通的智能体仍能实现高任务性能，但缺乏真正的规则理解和人类评估者的信任。

Conclusion: 通过集成基于环境的验证器，增强了智能体理解任务规则和完成任务的能力，促进了AI系统中更安全、更可解释的协作。

Abstract: While Large Language Model (LLM) agents are often approached from the angle
of action planning/generation to accomplish a goal (e.g., given by language
descriptions), their abilities to collaborate with each other to achieve a
joint goal are not well explored. To address this limitation, this paper
studies LLM agents in task collaboration, particularly under the condition of
information asymmetry, where agents have disparities in their knowledge and
skills and need to work together to complete a shared task. We extend Einstein
Puzzles, a classical symbolic puzzle, to a table-top game. In this game, two
LLM agents must reason, communicate, and act to satisfy spatial and relational
constraints required to solve the puzzle. We apply a fine-tuning-plus-verifier
framework in which LLM agents are equipped with various communication
strategies and verification signals from the environment. Empirical results
highlight the critical importance of aligned communication, especially when
agents possess both information-seeking and -providing capabilities.
Interestingly, agents without communication can still achieve high task
performance; however, further analysis reveals a lack of true rule
understanding and lower trust from human evaluators. Instead, by integrating an
environment-based verifier, we enhance agents' ability to comprehend task rules
and complete tasks, promoting both safer and more interpretable collaboration
in AI systems. https://github.com/Roihn/EinsteinPuzzles

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在宗教问答等高风险专业领域中的幻觉问题，满足波斯语穆斯林社区对准确性和可信度的严格要求，现有RAG系统在复杂多跳查询上表现不足。

Method: 提出FAIR-RAG架构：基于信仰、自适应、迭代优化的RAG框架，采用动态自校正过程，自适应分解复杂查询，评估证据充分性，并通过迭代生成子查询逐步填补信息空白。

Result: 在伊斯兰PCQA基准测试中表现卓越：负拒绝率达到97.0%（比基线提高40个百分点），答案正确性得分达到74.3%。

Conclusion: 为波斯伊斯兰问答设立了新标准，验证了迭代自适应架构在敏感领域构建可信可靠AI系统的重要性。

Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized Natural
Language Processing, yet their application in high-stakes, specialized domains
like religious question answering is hindered by challenges like hallucination
and unfaithfulness to authoritative sources. This issue is particularly
critical for the Persian-speaking Muslim community, where accuracy and
trustworthiness are paramount. Existing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
systems, relying on simplistic single-pass pipelines, fall short on complex,
multi-hop queries requiring multi-step reasoning and evidence aggregation. To
address this gap, we introduce FARSIQA, a novel, end-to-end system for Faithful
Advanced Question Answering in the Persian Islamic domain. FARSIQA is built
upon our innovative FAIR-RAG architecture: a Faithful, Adaptive, Iterative
Refinement framework for RAG. FAIR-RAG employs a dynamic, self-correcting
process: it adaptively decomposes complex queries, assesses evidence
sufficiency, and enters an iterative loop to generate sub-queries,
progressively filling information gaps. Operating on a curated knowledge base
of over one million authoritative Islamic documents, FARSIQA demonstrates
superior performance. Rigorous evaluation on the challenging IslamicPCQA
benchmark shows state-of-the-art performance: the system achieves a remarkable
97.0% in Negative Rejection - a 40-point improvement over baselines - and a
high Answer Correctness score of 74.3%. Our work establishes a new standard for
Persian Islamic QA and validates that our iterative, adaptive architecture is
crucial for building faithful, reliable AI systems in sensitive domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试时缩放技术在数学和编程等正式领域已被证明有效，但在法律等论证性领域的研究仍不足，需要探索验证器驱动的TTS方法在法律MCQA中的价值。

Method: 使用7个奖励模型家族，在5个法律MCQA基准上评估结果级验证和过程级验证方法，在现实低计算预算条件下进行系统分析。

Result: 研究系统揭示了验证器效用如何受领域专业化、模型大小和监督类型等关键属性的影响，即使在不同角色应用时也是如此。

Conclusion: 验证器驱动的测试时缩放方法在法律MCQA任务中具有实用价值，验证器的效用受到多种关键因素的显著影响，需要根据具体场景选择合适的验证策略。

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) techniques can improve the performance of large
language models (LLMs) at the expense of additional computation and latency.
While TTS has proven effective in formal domains such as mathematics and
programming \citep{snell2024scaling, chen2024more}, its value in argumentative
domains such as law remains underexplored. We present an empirical study of
verifier-based TTS methods for legal multiple-choice QA (MCQA) across five
benchmarks. Using a family of 7 reward models, we evaluate both outcome-level
(Best-of-$N$) and process-level (tree search) verification under realistic
low-$N$ budgets. Our analysis systematically investigates how verifier utility
is affected by key properties such as domain specialization, model size, and
supervision type (process-supervised PRMs vs. outcome-only ORMs), even when
applied across different roles.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语言模型评估主要关注正确性而忽略了推理效率这一关键的人类推理特征，现实推理场景中大量信息是无关的，有效推理需要识别和忽略这些干扰信息。

Method: 提出基于逻辑编程的评估框架，将自然语言证明与逻辑程序找到的最短证明对齐，量化模型避免不必要推理的效率；构建包含不同数量无关公理的数学应用题数据集。

Result: 当前语言模型在存在无关信息时准确率显著下降，即使是最小且领域一致的干扰也会影响性能，生成的证明经常包含无关推理的绕路。

Conclusion: 语言模型在推理效率方面存在不足，需要开发能够更好识别和忽略无关信息的推理能力，以实现更接近人类的推理效率。

Abstract: Modern language models (LMs) exhibit strong deductive reasoning capabilities,
yet standard evaluations emphasize correctness while overlooking a key aspect
of human-like reasoning: efficiency. In real-world reasoning scenarios, much of
the available information is irrelevant, and effective deductive inference
requires identifying and ignoring such distractions. We propose a framework for
assessing LM reasoning efficiency through the lens of logic programming,
introducing a simple method to align proofs written in natural language -- as
generated by an LM -- with shortest proofs found by executing the logic
program. Efficiency is quantified by measuring how well a model avoids
unnecessary inference. Empirically, we construct a dataset of math word
problems injected with various number of irrelevant axioms that vary in
semantic overlap with the goal theorem. We find that current LMs show marked
accuracy declines under such conditions -- even with minimal, domain-consistent
distractions -- and the proofs they generate frequently exhibit detours through
irrelevant inferences.

Motivation: 电子健康记录包含丰富但复杂的信息，现有大语言模型在EHR分析方面能力有限，存在任务覆盖范围窄和缺乏EHR导向推理能力的问题。

Method: 开发了思维图驱动的框架来生成大规模高质量推理数据，构建了EHR-R1系列模型（最大72B参数），采用领域适应、推理增强和强化学习的多阶段训练范式。

Result: EHR-R1在MIMIC-Bench上比GPT-4o高出30多分，在EHRSHOT上的零样本AUROC提高了10%，持续优于最先进的商业和开源LLM。

Conclusion: EHR-Ins、EHR-R1和EHR-Bench共同显著推进了更可靠和临床相关的EHR分析发展。

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) contain rich yet complex information, and
their automated analysis is critical for clinical decision-making. Despite
recent advances of large language models (LLMs) in clinical workflows, their
ability to analyze EHRs remains limited due to narrow task coverage and lack of
EHR-oriented reasoning capabilities. This paper aims to bridge the gap,
specifically, we present EHR-Ins, a large-scale, comprehensive EHR reasoning
instruction dataset, comprising 300k high-quality reasoning cases and 4M
non-reasoning cases across 42 distinct EHR tasks. Its core innovation is a
thinking-graph-driven framework that enables to generate high-quality reasoning
data at scale. Based on it, we develop EHR-R1, a series of reasoning-enhanced
LLMs with up to 72B parameters tailored for EHR analysis. Through a multi-stage
training paradigm, including domain adaptation, reasoning enhancement, and
reinforcement learning, EHR-R1 systematically acquires domain knowledge and
diverse reasoning capabilities, enabling accurate and robust EHR analysis.
Lastly, we introduce EHR-Bench, a new benchmark curated from MIMIC-IV, spanning
42 tasks, to comprehensively assess reasoning and prediction across EHR
scenarios. In experiments, we show that the resulting EHR-R1 consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art commercial and open-source LLMs (including
DeepSeek-V3 and GPT-4o), surpassing GPT-4o by over 30 points on MIMIC-Bench and
achieving a 10\% higher zero-shot AUROC on EHRSHOT. Collectively, EHR-Ins,
EHR-R1, and EHR-Bench have significantly advanced the development for more
reliable and clinically relevant EHR analysis.

<details>

Motivation: 统一视觉语言模型需要在单一架构中同时处理理解和生成任务，但这些任务依赖异构数据和监督，在强化学习中难以平衡。

Method: 使用GPT-o3增强单任务数据，生成理解样本的标题和生成样本的问答对，形成对齐对；检索语义相关的理解示例形成检索对；提出Pair-GPRO算法，基于相似度评分调节优势函数。

Result: 构建了16K高质量PairUG数据集，在Janus-Pro等统一视觉语言模型上实现了平衡的改进，优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: PairUni框架通过数据重组和对齐优化，有效解决了统一视觉语言模型中理解与生成任务的平衡问题。

Abstract: Unified vision-language models (UVLMs) must perform both understanding and
generation within a single architecture, but these tasks rely on heterogeneous
data and supervision, making it difficult to balance them during reinforcement
learning (RL). We propose PairUni, a unified framework that reorganizes data
into understanding-generation (UG) pairs and aligns optimization accordingly.
We first use GPT-o3 to augment single-task data, generating captions for
understanding samples and question-answer (QA) pairs for generation samples,
forming aligned pairs from the same instance. Additionally, for each generation
sample, we retrieve a semantically related understanding example to form a
retrieved pair, linking different but related data points. These paired
structures expose cross-task semantic correspondences and support consistent
policy learning. To leverage this structure, we present Pair-GPRO, a pair-aware
variant based on Group Relative Policy Optimization. It assigns a similarity
score to each pair to modulate the advantage, strengthening learning from
well-aligned examples and reducing task interference. We curate a high-quality
dataset of 16K UG pairs named PairUG for RL fine-tuning and evaluate PairUni on
the powerful Janus-Pro UVLMs. Our approach achieves balanced improvements on
various UVLMs, outperforming strong UVLM RL baselines. Code:

Motivation: 探索LLM作为结构化表格数据分类任务的替代方案，特别是在高风险金融应用如风险评估中的适用性。

Method: 在真实世界贷款违约预测任务上，系统比较零样本LLM分类器与LightGBM的预测性能，使用SHAP分析特征归因，并评估LLM自解释的可靠性。

Result: LLM能够识别关键金融风险指标，但其特征重要性排序与LightGBM明显不同，自解释往往与实证SHAP归因不一致。

Conclusion: LLM作为结构化金融风险预测的独立模型存在局限性，其自解释的可信度值得关注，需要在风险敏感金融环境中进行可解释性审计、与可解释模型基线比较以及人工监督。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly explored as flexible
alternatives to classical machine learning models for classification tasks
through zero-shot prompting. However, their suitability for structured tabular
data remains underexplored, especially in high-stakes financial applications
such as financial risk assessment. This study conducts a systematic comparison
between zero-shot LLM-based classifiers and LightGBM, a state-of-the-art

evaluate their predictive performance, analyze feature attributions using SHAP,
and assess the reliability of LLM-generated self-explanations. While LLMs are
able to identify key financial risk indicators, their feature importance
rankings diverge notably from LightGBM, and their self-explanations often fail
to align with empirical SHAP attributions. These findings highlight the
limitations of LLMs as standalone models for structured financial risk
prediction and raise concerns about the trustworthiness of their self-generated
explanations. Our results underscore the need for explainability audits,
baseline comparisons with interpretable models, and human-in-the-loop oversight
when deploying LLMs in risk-sensitive financial environments.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Toolathlon是一个用于评估语言代理的基准测试，涵盖32个软件应用和604个工具，提供多样化的应用、真实环境设置和可靠的执行评估，旨在解决现有基准测试在多样性、真实性和长时程复杂性方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的语言代理需要处理跨多个应用的复杂多步骤工作流，但现有基准测试往往局限于狭窄领域或简化任务，缺乏评估代理真实性能所需的多样性、真实性和长时程复杂性。

Method: 构建了包含32个软件应用和604个工具的基准测试，大多数工具基于高质量MCP服务器，提供来自真实软件的初始环境状态，包含108个手动收集或设计的任务，每个任务平均需要约20轮交互才能完成。

Result: 对最先进模型的全面评估显示其存在显著不足：表现最佳的Claude-4.5-Sonnet模型仅达到38.6%的成功率，平均需要20.2次工具调用；表现最佳的开源模型DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp达到20.1%的成功率。

Conclusion: Toolathlon基准测试有望推动开发更强大的语言代理，以应对现实世界中的长时程任务执行挑战。

Abstract: Real-world language agents must handle complex, multi-step workflows across
diverse Apps. For instance, an agent may manage emails by coordinating with
calendars and file systems, or monitor a production database to detect
anomalies and generate reports following an operating manual. However, existing
language agent benchmarks often focus on narrow domains or simplified tasks
that lack the diversity, realism, and long-horizon complexity required to
evaluate agents' real-world performance. To address this gap, we introduce the
Tool Decathlon (dubbed as Toolathlon), a benchmark for language agents offering
diverse Apps and tools, realistic environment setup, and reliable
execution-based evaluation. Toolathlon spans 32 software applications and 604
tools, ranging from everyday platforms such as Google Calendar and Notion to
professional ones like WooCommerce, Kubernetes, and BigQuery. Most of the tools
are based on a high-quality set of Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers that we
may have revised or implemented ourselves. Unlike prior works, which primarily
ensure functional realism but offer limited environment state diversity, we
provide realistic initial environment states from real software, such as Canvas
courses with dozens of students or real financial spreadsheets. This benchmark
includes 108 manually sourced or crafted tasks in total, requiring interacting
with multiple Apps over around 20 turns on average to complete. Each task is
strictly verifiable through dedicated evaluation scripts. Comprehensive
evaluation of SOTA models highlights their significant shortcomings: the
best-performing model, Claude-4.5-Sonnet, achieves only a 38.6% success rate
with 20.2 tool calling turns on average, while the top open-weights model
DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp reaches 20.1%. We expect Toolathlon to drive the development
of more capable language agents for real-world, long-horizon task execution.

### [137] [The Limits of Obliviate: Evaluating Unlearning in LLMs via Stimulus-Knowledge Entanglement-Behavior Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25732)
*Aakriti Shah,Thai Le*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了说服性提示如何从经过刻意遗忘的大语言模型中恢复事实知识，发现说服性提示能显著增强事实回忆，且效果与模型大小成反比。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大语言模型遗忘效果的现有方法存在不足，需要开发新框架来测试遗忘模型的完整性和鲁棒性。

Method: 基于ACT-R和Hebbian理论，提出刺激-知识纠缠-行为框架(SKeB)，通过领域图建模信息纠缠，并开发纠缠指标来量化知识激活模式。

Result: 说服性提示显著提高了事实知识回忆率（从14.8%提升到24.5%），且效果与模型大小成反比（2.7B模型恢复128%，13B模型仅恢复15%）。

Conclusion: SKeB框架为评估LLM遗忘完整性、鲁棒性和整体行为提供了基础，揭示了说服性提示在恢复遗忘知识方面的潜力。

Abstract: Unlearning in large language models (LLMs) is crucial for managing sensitive
data and correcting misinformation, yet evaluating its effectiveness remains an
open problem. We investigate whether persuasive prompting can recall factual
knowledge from deliberately unlearned LLMs across models ranging from 2.7B to
13B parameters (OPT-2.7B, LLaMA-2-7B, LLaMA-3.1-8B, LLaMA-2-13B). Drawing from
ACT-R and Hebbian theory (spreading activation theories), as well as
communication principles, we introduce Stimulus-Knowledge Entanglement-Behavior
Framework (SKeB), which models information entanglement via domain graphs and
tests whether factual recall in unlearned models is correlated with persuasive
framing. We develop entanglement metrics to quantify knowledge activation
patterns and evaluate factuality, non-factuality, and hallucination in outputs.
Our results show persuasive prompts substantially enhance factual knowledge
recall (14.8% baseline vs. 24.5% with authority framing), with effectiveness
inversely correlated to model size (128% recovery in 2.7B vs. 15% in 13B). SKeB
provides a foundation for assessing unlearning completeness, robustness, and
overall behavior in LLMs.

TL;DR: Ouro是一个预训练的循环语言模型家族，通过在预训练阶段构建推理能力，而不是依赖显式文本生成。它使用潜在空间迭代计算、熵正则化目标和77万亿token的扩展，在1.4B和2.6B参数下就能匹配12B SOTA LLM的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代LLM主要通过显式文本生成（如思维链）进行推理，这忽视了预训练数据的作用。作者希望将推理能力直接构建到预训练阶段，而不是依赖后训练技术。

Method: 提出循环语言模型（LoopLM），使用三个关键技术：(1) 潜在空间的迭代计算；(2) 用于学习深度分配的熵正则化目标；(3) 扩展到77万亿token的大规模预训练。

Result: Ouro 1.4B和2.6B模型在广泛基准测试中表现优异，能够匹配高达12B参数的最先进LLM。实验表明这种优势源于更好的知识操作能力，而非更大的知识容量。

Conclusion: 循环语言模型展示了作为推理时代新的扩展方向的潜力，能够产生比显式思维链更与最终输出对齐的推理轨迹。

Abstract: Modern LLMs are trained to "think" primarily via explicit text generation,
such as chain-of-thought (CoT), which defers reasoning to post-training and
under-leverages pre-training data. We present and open-source Ouro, named after
the recursive Ouroboros, a family of pre-trained Looped Language Models
(LoopLM) that instead build reasoning into the pre-training phase through (i)
iterative computation in latent space, (ii) an entropy-regularized objective
for learned depth allocation, and (iii) scaling to 7.7T tokens. Ouro 1.4B and
2.6B models enjoy superior performance that match the results of up to 12B SOTA
LLMs across a wide range of benchmarks. Through controlled experiments, we show
this advantage stems not from increased knowledge capacity, but from superior
knowledge manipulation capabilities. We also show that LoopLM yields reasoning
traces more aligned with final outputs than explicit CoT. We hope our results
show the potential of LoopLM as a novel scaling direction in the reasoning era.

TL;DR: 提出从一次性任务完成评估转向协作代理评估，引入协作努力扩展框架来衡量代理在用户参与增加时的效用增长。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前代理评估集中于一次性任务完成，未能考虑现实世界问题的迭代性和协作性本质，人类目标往往不明确且会演变。

Method: 引入协作努力扩展框架，通过案例研究和模拟评估分析代理在多轮真实场景中的表现。

Result: 研究表明最先进的代理在多轮真实场景中表现不佳，缺乏维持参与和支持用户理解的能力。

Conclusion: 协作努力扩展为诊断代理行为和指导开发更有效交互提供了视角，强调需要开发能够增强人类努力的协作代理。

Abstract: Current evaluations of agents remain centered around one-shot task
completion, failing to account for the inherently iterative and collaborative
nature of many real-world problems, where human goals are often underspecified
and evolve. We argue for a shift from building and assessing task completion
agents to developing collaborative agents, assessed not only by the quality of
their final outputs but by how well they engage with and enhance human effort
throughout the problem-solving process. To support this shift, we introduce
collaborative effort scaling, a framework that captures how an agent's utility
grows with increasing user involvement. Through case studies and simulated
evaluations, we show that state-of-the-art agents often underperform in
multi-turn, real-world scenarios, revealing a missing ingredient in agent
design: the ability to sustain engagement and scaffold user understanding.
Collaborative effort scaling offers a lens for diagnosing agent behavior and
guiding development toward more effective interactions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图表在研究论文中至关重要但制作复杂，现有图像生成模型难以生成结构清晰的图表，而LLM生成的SVG图表缺乏有效的评估指标。

Method: 将图表概念化为图结构，文本元素作为节点，连接关系作为有向边，提出节点对齐和路径对齐两组新指标来评估图表质量。

Result: 首次有效评估了最先进LLM在最新研究文献上生成的图表，定量证明了所提指标的有效性，并提供了对LLM生成图表特征的深入洞察。

Conclusion: DiagramEval为LLM生成的演示图提供了可解释的评估框架，能够有效量化图表质量并揭示其特性。

Abstract: Diagrams play a central role in research papers for conveying ideas, yet they
are often notoriously complex and labor-intensive to create. Although diagrams
are presented as images, standard image generative models struggle to produce
clear diagrams with well-defined structure. We argue that a promising direction
is to generate demonstration diagrams directly in textual form as SVGs, which
can leverage recent advances in large language models (LLMs). However, due to
the complexity of components and the multimodal nature of diagrams,
sufficiently discriminative and explainable metrics for evaluating the quality
of LLM-generated diagrams remain lacking. In this paper, we propose
DiagramEval, a novel evaluation metric designed to assess demonstration
diagrams generated by LLMs. Specifically, DiagramEval conceptualizes diagrams
as graphs, treating text elements as nodes and their connections as directed
edges, and evaluates diagram quality using two new groups of metrics: node
alignment and path alignment. For the first time, we effectively evaluate
diagrams produced by state-of-the-art LLMs on recent research literature,
quantitatively demonstrating the validity of our metrics. Furthermore, we show
how the enhanced explainability of our proposed metrics offers valuable
insights into the characteristics of LLM-generated diagrams. Code:

TL;DR: 提出DecompTune方法，通过将后处理归因重构为推理问题，训练模型生成答案分解作为中间推理步骤，显著提升长文档问答中的归因质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有后处理归因方法在需要跨段落信息合成的多跳、抽象和半抽取式问答场景中表现不佳，需要更可靠的归因方法以增强可信度。

Method: 将归因重构为推理问题，先通过提示生成分解和归因，然后开发DecompTune后训练方法，使用两阶段SFT+GRPO流程训练模型生成答案分解。

Result: DecompTune显著提高了归因质量，优于现有方法，并与最先进的前沿模型表现相当或更好。

Conclusion: 将归因作为推理问题处理，通过答案分解作为中间步骤，能够有效提升复杂问答场景中的归因可靠性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for long-document question
answering, where reliable attribution to sources is critical for trust.
Existing post-hoc attribution methods work well for extractive QA but struggle
in multi-hop, abstractive, and semi-extractive settings, where answers
synthesize information across passages. To address these challenges, we argue
that post-hoc attribution can be reframed as a reasoning problem, where answers
are decomposed into constituent units, each tied to specific context. We first
show that prompting models to generate such decompositions alongside
attributions improves performance. Building on this, we introduce DecompTune, a
post-training method that teaches models to produce answer decompositions as
intermediate reasoning steps. We curate a diverse dataset of complex QA tasks,
annotated with decompositions by a strong LLM, and post-train Qwen-2.5 (7B and
14B) using a two-stage SFT + GRPO pipeline with task-specific curated rewards.
Across extensive experiments and ablations, DecompTune substantially improves
attribution quality, outperforming prior methods and matching or exceeding
state-of-the-art frontier models.

TL;DR: Gaperon是一个完全开源的法国-英语-编码语言模型套件，包含1.5B、8B和24B参数模型，训练数据达2-4万亿token，并发布了完整的训练管道。研究发现数据过滤与污染之间存在复杂交互：语言质量过滤提升文本流畅性但降低基准测试性能，而后期故意污染可恢复竞争力但损害生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推动大规模模型训练的透明度和可复现性，研究数据过滤与污染如何影响模型性能，为多语言语言模型开发中的数据管理、评估、安全性和开放性提供可复现基础。

Method: 使用神经质量分类器过滤法语和英语数据集，开发高效的数据整理和训练框架，发布数百个中间检查点，并在预训练中引入无害数据投毒以支持安全研究。

Result: 语言质量过滤增强了文本流畅性和连贯性，但导致基准测试结果不佳；后期故意污染（在包含测试集的数据上继续训练）可恢复竞争力但合理损害生成质量；常规神经过滤可能无意中放大基准泄漏。

Conclusion: Gaperon通过公开所有模型、数据集、代码和检查点，为探索数据管理、评估、安全性和开放性之间的权衡建立了可复现的基础，揭示了数据过滤与污染对模型性能的复杂影响。

Abstract: We release Gaperon, a fully open suite of French-English-coding language
models designed to advance transparency and reproducibility in large-scale
model training. The Gaperon family includes 1.5B, 8B, and 24B parameter models
trained on 2-4 trillion tokens, released with all elements of the training
pipeline: French and English datasets filtered with a neural quality
classifier, an efficient data curation and training framework, and hundreds of
intermediate checkpoints. Through this work, we study how data filtering and
contamination interact to shape both benchmark and generative performance. We
find that filtering for linguistic quality enhances text fluency and coherence
but yields subpar benchmark results, and that late deliberate contamination --
continuing training on data mixes that include test sets -- recovers
competitive scores while only reasonably harming generation quality. We discuss
how usual neural filtering can unintentionally amplify benchmark leakage. To
support further research, we also introduce harmless data poisoning during
pretraining, providing a realistic testbed for safety studies. By openly
releasing all models, datasets, code, and checkpoints, Gaperon establishes a
reproducible foundation for exploring the trade-offs between data curation,
evaluation, safety, and openness in multilingual language model development.

TL;DR: 提出了基于推理树结构的Re-Schedule数据调度算法，通过r-score衡量查询学习难度，在数学推理基准上实现最高3.2%的准确率提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR数据调度方法依赖路径指标，忽略了查询的推理树结构，需要更强大的调度基础

Method: 引入推理分数(r-score)衡量查询学习难度，基于此设计Re-Schedule调度算法，构建从结构简单到复杂的课程学习

Result: 在6个数学推理基准上显著提升平均准确率，最高增益达3.2%

Conclusion: 推理树的结构理解为RLVR数据调度提供了更强大和原则性的基础

Abstract: Using Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to optimize Large
Language Models (LLMs) can be conceptualized as progressively editing a query's
`Reasoning Tree'. This process involves exploring nodes (tokens) and
dynamically modifying the model's policy at each node. When combined with data
scheduling, this process yields further gains in data efficiency and accuracy.
However, existing RLVR data scheduling methods typically rely on path-based
metrics to rank queries, overlooking the reasoning tree structures of these
queries. In this paper, we introduce a novel metric, namely Reasoning Score
(r-score), which measures the query's learning difficulty based on the
structure of its reasoning tree. Based on the r-score, we propose the Reasoning
Tree Schedule (Re-Schedule), a scheduling algorithm that constructs a
curriculum progressing from structurally simple (high r-score) to complex (low
r-score) queries. Experiments on six math-reasoning benchmarks show that
Re-Schedule significantly improves average accuracy, achieving gains of up to
3.2%. These strong results validate our approach and demonstrate that a
structural understanding of the reasoning tree provides a more powerful and
principled foundation for RLVR data scheduling.

TL;DR: 研究循环结构因果模型中的反事实推理，关注移位-尺度干预下的因果推断问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统反事实推理框架假设无环结构因果模型，但现实系统（如生物系统）常包含反馈循环或循环依赖，违反无环性假设。

Method: 在循环结构因果模型中研究反事实推理，特别关注移位-尺度干预——即对变量机制进行重新缩放和/或移位的软性、策略式改变。

Result: 未在摘要中明确说明具体结果。

Conclusion: 需要扩展反事实推理框架以处理循环因果模型，特别是在移位-尺度干预场景下。

Abstract: Most counterfactual inference frameworks traditionally assume acyclic
structural causal models (SCMs), i.e. directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). However,
many real-world systems (e.g. biological systems) contain feedback loops or
cyclic dependencies that violate acyclicity. In this work, we study
counterfactual inference in cyclic SCMs under shift-scale interventions, i.e.,
soft, policy-style changes that rescale and/or shift a variable's mechanism.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动化E/M编码可以减轻医生的文档负担，提高计费效率，最终改善患者护理。但现实世界的复杂性使得这项任务具有挑战性。

Method: 提出了ProFees框架，这是一个基于大型语言模型(LLM)的解决方案，专门设计来处理E/M编码中的现实复杂性。

Result: 在专家策划的真实数据集上，ProFees比商业CPT E/M编码系统的准确率提高了36%以上，比最强的单提示基线提高了近5%。

Conclusion: ProFees框架在解决现实世界复杂性方面表现出色，证明了其在自动化医疗编码任务中的有效性。

Abstract: Evaluation and Management (E/M) coding, under the Current Procedural
Terminology (CPT) taxonomy, documents medical services provided to patients by
physicians. Used primarily for billing purposes, it is in physicians' best
interest to provide accurate CPT E/M codes. %While important, it is an
auxiliary task that adds to physicians' documentation burden. Automating this
coding task will help alleviate physicians' documentation burden, improve
billing efficiency, and ultimately enable better patient care. However, a
number of real-world complexities have made E/M encoding automation a
challenging task. In this paper, we elaborate some of the key complexities and
present ProFees, our LLM-based framework that tackles them, followed by a
systematic evaluation. On an expert-curated real-world dataset, ProFees
achieves an increase in coding accuracy of more than 36\% over a commercial CPT
E/M coding system and almost 5\% over our strongest single-prompt baseline,
demonstrating its effectiveness in addressing the real-world complexities.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Autoregressive State-Tracking Prompting (ASTP)方法，通过显式状态跟踪和占位符后处理，解决LLM在游戏交易系统中无法遵循流程规则的问题，实现了99%以上的状态合规性和99.3%的计算精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在游戏交互中具有灵活性，但无法遵循规则化交易系统的必要流程（浏览-报价-审核-确认），这会损害玩家信任。需要解决LLM的创造性灵活性与游戏交易程序性需求之间的核心矛盾。

Method: 引入ASTP方法，通过精心设计的提示词强制LLM显式报告其状态跟踪过程，让模型识别并报告前一轮的预定义状态标签。配合状态特定的占位符后处理方法确保交易完整性。

Result: 在300个交易对话评估中，实现了>99%的状态合规性和99.3%的计算精度。ASTP配合占位符后处理在较小模型(Gemini-2.5-Flash)上达到与大模型(Gemini-2.5-Pro)相当的性能，同时将响应时间从21.2秒减少到2.4秒。

Conclusion: ASTP建立了一个实用基础，既能满足商业游戏的实时需求，又能适应资源限制，为LLM在规则化交易系统中的可靠应用提供了解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) enable dynamic game interactions but fail to
follow essential procedural flows in rule-governed trading systems, eroding
player trust. This work resolves the core tension between the creative
flexibility of LLMs and the procedural demands of in-game trading
(browse-offer-review-confirm). To this end, Autoregressive State-Tracking
Prompting (ASTP) is introduced, a methodology centered on a strategically
orchestrated prompt that compels an LLM to make its state-tracking process
explicit and verifiable. Instead of relying on implicit contextual
understanding, ASTP tasks the LLM with identifying and reporting a predefined
state label from the previous turn. To ensure transactional integrity, this is
complemented by a state-specific placeholder post-processing method for
accurate price calculations. Evaluation across 300 trading dialogues
demonstrates >99% state compliance and 99.3% calculation precision. Notably,
ASTP with placeholder post-processing on smaller models (Gemini-2.5-Flash)
matches larger models' (Gemini-2.5-Pro) performance while reducing response
time from 21.2s to 2.4s, establishing a practical foundation that satisfies
both real-time requirements and resource constraints of commercial games.

Motivation: 当前基于强化学习的后训练方法主要关注结果奖励，缺乏对推理过程的监督，限制了多步推理能力的提升。

Method: 使用过程挖掘技术计算推理过程与教师模型的对齐度作为一致性奖励，结合标准答案/格式奖励，在GRPO框架中进行策略优化。

Result: 在五个基准测试中，PM4GRPO显著优于现有的GRPO后训练方法，证明推理感知的奖励能有效增强策略模型的推理能力。

Conclusion: 利用过程挖掘实现推理感知的GRPO能够有效提升大推理模型的多步推理性能，过程监督对推理能力发展至关重要。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL)-based post-training has been crucial for enabling
multi-step reasoning in large reasoning models (LRMs), yet current reward
schemes are typically outcome-centric. We propose PM4GRPO, a reasoning-aware
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) that augments standard answer/format
rewards with signals over the reasoning procedure. To this end, process mining
techniques are utilized to compute a scalar conformance reward that measures
how closely a policy model's reasoning aligns with the pretrained teacher
model. The empirical results on five benchmarks demonstrate that PM4GRPO
significantly outperforms existing methodologies for GRPO-based post-training.
These results highlight that leveraging process mining for reasoning-aware GRPO
effectively enhances the reasoning capabilities of policy models.

Conclusion: 该工作提出的H3M-SSMoEs框架成功解决了股票预测中的关键挑战，为多模态金融时间序列分析提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Stock movement prediction remains fundamentally challenging due to complex
temporal dependencies, heterogeneous modalities, and dynamically evolving
inter-stock relationships. Existing approaches often fail to unify structural,
semantic, and regime-adaptive modeling within a scalable framework. This work
introduces H3M-SSMoEs, a novel Hypergraph-based MultiModal architecture with
LLM reasoning and Style-Structured Mixture of Experts, integrating three key
innovations: (1) a Multi-Context Multimodal Hypergraph that hierarchically
captures fine-grained spatiotemporal dynamics via a Local Context Hypergraph
(LCH) and persistent inter-stock dependencies through a Global Context
Hypergraph (GCH), employing shared cross-modal hyperedges and Jensen-Shannon
Divergence weighting mechanism for adaptive relational learning and cross-modal
alignment; (2) a LLM-enhanced reasoning module, which leverages a frozen large
language model with lightweight adapters to semantically fuse and align
quantitative and textual modalities, enriching representations with
domain-specific financial knowledge; and (3) a Style-Structured Mixture of
Experts (SSMoEs) that combines shared market experts and industry-specialized
experts, each parameterized by learnable style vectors enabling regime-aware
specialization under sparse activation. Extensive experiments on three major
stock markets demonstrate that H3M-SSMoEs surpasses state-of-the-art methods in
both superior predictive accuracy and investment performance, while exhibiting
effective risk control. Datasets, source code, and model weights are available

Method: 1. 基于结果拒绝采样获得高质量轨迹进行基础微调；2. 应用多阶段课程强化学习，采用从易到难的奖励调度来缓解结果监督的奖励稀疏问题。

Result: 在三个主流数据集上持续超越先前方法，在GrailQA的零样本子集上相对提升达11.1%，且仅使用十二分之一的训练数据。

Conclusion: 仅使用结果监督训练的KnowCoder-A1展现出强大的推理行为，证明了其在知识库问答中的自主代理推理能力。

Abstract: Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA) aims to answer natural-language
questions over a structured Knowledge Base (KB). Recent work improves KBQA by
adopting an agentic reasoning paradigm, in which Large Language Models (LLMs)
iteratively decompose a question, generate its corresponding logical queries,
and interact with the KB to derive the answer. However, these methods typically
fine-tune LLMs on reasoning trajectories synthesized via process supervision,
which offers weak incentives for exploration and thus fails to strengthen the
agentic reasoning ability. In this paper, we propose KnowCoder-A1, an LLM that
can autonomously perform agentic reasoning on KBs to obtain answers. To
incentivize autonomous exploration, KnowCoder-A1 trains the LLM under
outcome-only supervision via a multi-stage curriculum reinforcement learning
with an easy-to-hard curriculum. To establish foundational agentic
capabilities, KnowCoder-A1 first fine-tunes the LLM on a small set of
high-quality trajectories obtained through outcome-based rejection sampling.
Then, to alleviate the reward sparsity inherent in outcome-only supervision, it
applies multi-stage curriculum RL with reward schedules that progress from easy
to hard. Trained with outcome-only supervision, KnowCoder-A1 exhibits powerful
reasoning behaviors and consistently outperforms prior approaches across three
mainstream datasets. Notably, on the zero-shot subset of GrailQA, KnowCoder-A1
achieves up to an 11.1% relative improvement while using only one-twelfth of
the training data, demonstrating strong agentic reasoning capabilities.

TL;DR: 提出Agentic Moderation框架，利用专门代理保护多模态系统免受越狱攻击，相比静态方法提供动态、上下文感知的调节


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全对齐方法多为静态层，仅提供二元分类，缺乏动态协作和可解释性，需要更灵活、细粒度的安全治理方案

Method: 基于代理架构，集成Shield、Responder、Evaluator和Reflector四个专门代理，实现动态协作和上下文感知的调节

Result: 在5个数据集和4个大型视觉语言模型上的实验显示，攻击成功率降低7-19%，拒绝率提高4-20%，保持稳定的不遵循率

Conclusion: Agentic Moderation展示了代理系统作为自动化安全治理基础的潜力，提供模块化、可扩展和细粒度的安全执行

Abstract: Agentic methods have emerged as a powerful and autonomous paradigm that
enhances reasoning, collaboration, and adaptive control, enabling systems to
coordinate and independently solve complex tasks. We extend this paradigm to
safety alignment by introducing Agentic Moderation, a model-agnostic framework
that leverages specialised agents to defend multimodal systems against
jailbreak attacks. Unlike prior approaches that apply as a static layer over
inputs or outputs and provide only binary classifications (safe or unsafe), our
method integrates dynamic, cooperative agents, including Shield, Responder,
Evaluator, and Reflector, to achieve context-aware and interpretable
moderation. Extensive experiments across five datasets and four representative
Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate that our approach reduces the
Attack Success Rate (ASR) by 7-19%, maintains a stable Non-Following Rate (NF),
and improves the Refusal Rate (RR) by 4-20%, achieving robust, interpretable,
and well-balanced safety performance. By harnessing the flexibility and
reasoning capacity of agentic architectures, Agentic Moderation provides
modular, scalable, and fine-grained safety enforcement, highlighting the
broader potential of agentic systems as a foundation for automated safety
governance.

TL;DR: 提出EneAD框架，通过自适应感知模块和鲁棒决策模块实现自动驾驶的能效优化，在保持感知精度的同时显著降低计算能耗


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶技术带来社会经济效益，但计算引擎能耗限制了电动车辆续航里程，现有模型压缩技术要么导致模型过大，要么感知精度显著下降

Method: 自适应感知模块：管理多个不同计算消耗的感知模型，动态调整执行帧率；基于贝叶斯优化的可迁移调优方法；轻量级分类模型区分场景感知难度。鲁棒决策模块：基于强化学习的决策模型，设计正则化项增强面对扰动感知结果的驾驶稳定性

Conclusion: EneAD框架在能耗和驾驶性能方面均表现出优越性，为自动驾驶系统提供了有效的能效优化解决方案

Abstract: Autonomous driving is an emerging technology that is expected to bring
significant social, economic, and environmental benefits. However, these
benefits come with rising energy consumption by computation engines, limiting
the driving range of vehicles, especially electric ones. Perception computing
is typically the most power-intensive component, as it relies on largescale
deep learning models to extract environmental features. Recently, numerous
studies have employed model compression techniques, such as sparsification,
quantization, and distillation, to reduce computational consumption. However,
these methods often result in either a substantial model size or a significant
drop in perception accuracy compared to high-computation models. To address
these challenges, we propose an energy-efficient autonomous driving framework,
called EneAD. In the adaptive perception module, a perception optimization
strategy is designed from the perspective of data management and tuning.
Firstly, we manage multiple perception models with different computational
consumption and adjust the execution framerate dynamically. Then, we define
them as knobs and design a transferable tuning method based on Bayesian
optimization to identify promising knob values that achieve low computation
while maintaining desired accuracy. To adaptively switch the knob values in
various traffic scenarios, a lightweight classification model is proposed to
distinguish the perception difficulty in different scenarios. In the robust
decision module, we propose a decision model based on reinforcement learning
and design a regularization term to enhance driving stability in the face of
perturbed perception results. Extensive experiments evidence the superiority of
our framework in both energy consumption and driving performance. EneAD can
reduce perception consumption by 1.9x to 3.5x and thus improve driving range by
3.9% to 8.5%

TL;DR: 本文提出了RAVR框架，利用答案引导的推理作为变分代理，通过条件化答案来提升语言模型的推理能力，解决了在模型当前能力之外的任务中难以采样高质量推理路径的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受到认知科学启发，发现"为什么这是答案"比"答案是什么"更容易回答，因为避免了开放式探索的认知负担，转而进行解释性重构。这启发了利用答案来推导高质量推理路径的方法。

Method: 提出了RAVR（参考答案引导的变分推理）框架，使用答案条件化推理作为仅问题推理的变分代理，通过条件化答案来增加采样推理路径的期望效用。

Result: 在通用和数学领域的实验中，RAVR相比强基线模型都显示出持续改进。分析发现RAVR减少了犹豫，加强了结论整合，并促进了问题特定的推理策略。

Conclusion: 通过条件化答案可以显著提升语言模型的推理能力，将难以处理的问题转化为可学习的问题，RAVR框架为此提供了有效的实现方法。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) can refine the reasoning abilities of large
language models (LLMs), but critically depends on a key prerequisite: the LLM
can already generate high-utility reasoning paths with non-negligible
probability. For tasks beyond the LLM's current competence, such reasoning path
can be hard to sample, and learning risks reinforcing familiar but suboptimal
reasoning. We are motivated by the insight from cognitive science that Why is
this the answer is often an easier question than What is the answer, as it
avoids the heavy cognitive load of open-ended exploration, opting instead for
explanatory reconstruction-systematically retracing the reasoning that links a
question to its answer. We show that LLMs can similarly leverage answers to
derive high-quality reasoning paths. We formalize this phenomenon and prove
that conditioning on answer provably increases the expected utility of sampled
reasoning paths, thereby transforming intractable problems into learnable ones.
Building on this insight, we introduce RAVR (Reference-Answer-guided
Variational Reasoning), an end-to-end framework that uses answer-conditioned
reasoning as a variational surrogate for question-only reasoning. Experiments
in both general and math domains demonstrate consistent improvements over
strong baselines. We further analyze the reasoning behavior and find that RAVR
reduces hesitation, strengthens conclusion consolidation, and promotes
problem-specific strategies in reasoning.

TL;DR: FELA是一个基于LLM的多智能体进化系统，用于从复杂的工业事件日志数据中自动提取有意义的特征，通过专门的智能体协作生成、验证和实现特征想法，显著提高模型性能并减少人工工作量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业事件日志数据具有大规模、高维度、数据类型多样和复杂时空结构等特点，使得特征工程极具挑战性。现有的自动特征工程方法存在可解释性有限、操作僵化和对异构数据适应性差等问题。

Method: FELA采用多智能体进化系统，整合LLM的推理和编码能力与洞察引导的自进化范式。系统包含想法智能体、代码智能体和批评智能体，通过强化学习和遗传算法原理平衡探索与利用。

Result: 在真实工业数据集上的广泛实验表明，FELA能够生成可解释、领域相关的特征，显著提高模型性能，同时减少人工工作量。

Conclusion: 基于LLM的多智能体系统有潜力成为复杂现实环境中自动化、可解释和自适应特征工程的通用框架。

Abstract: Event log data, recording fine-grained user actions and system events,
represent one of the most valuable assets for modern digital services. However,
the complexity and heterogeneity of industrial event logs--characterized by
large scale, high dimensionality, diverse data types, and intricate temporal or
relational structures--make feature engineering extremely challenging. Existing
automatic feature engineering approaches, such as AutoML or genetic methods,
often suffer from limited explainability, rigid predefined operations, and poor
adaptability to complicated heterogeneous data. In this paper, we propose FELA
(Feature Engineering LLM Agents), a multi-agent evolutionary system that
autonomously extracts meaningful and high-performing features from complex
industrial event log data. FELA integrates the reasoning and coding
capabilities of large language models (LLMs) with an insight-guided
self-evolution paradigm. Specifically, FELA employs specialized agents--Idea
Agents, Code Agents, and Critic Agents--to collaboratively generate, validate,
and implement novel feature ideas. An Evaluation Agent summarizes feedback and
updates a hierarchical knowledge base and dual-memory system to enable
continual improvement. Moreover, FELA introduces an agentic evolution
algorithm, combining reinforcement learning and genetic algorithm principles to
balance exploration and exploitation across the idea space. Extensive
experiments on real industrial datasets demonstrate that FELA can generate
explainable, domain-relevant features that significantly improve model
performance while reducing manual effort. Our results highlight the potential
of LLM-based multi-agent systems as a general framework for automated,
interpretable, and adaptive feature engineering in complex real-world
environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 精神疾病共病在临床上很常见但诊断复杂，现有数据集难以支持多疾病同时诊断的需求，需要构建能够模拟真实临床访谈的大规模共病对话数据集。

Method: 采用合成电子病历构建和多智能体诊断对话生成的集成方法，创建了502个合成EMR，并将临床访谈协议转化为层次状态机和上下文树，支持130多个诊断状态。

Conclusion: PsyCoTalk数据集为精神疾病共病研究提供了宝贵资源，能够支持在一次对话中完成多疾病筛查的模型开发和评估，提升了诊断准确性和治疗规划能力。

Abstract: Psychiatric comorbidity is clinically significant yet challenging due to the
complexity of multiple co-occurring disorders. To address this, we develop a
novel approach integrating synthetic patient electronic medical record (EMR)
construction and multi-agent diagnostic dialogue generation. We create 502
synthetic EMRs for common comorbid conditions using a pipeline that ensures
clinical relevance and diversity. Our multi-agent framework transfers the
clinical interview protocol into a hierarchical state machine and context tree,
supporting over 130 diagnostic states while maintaining clinical standards.
Through this rigorous process, we construct PsyCoTalk, the first large-scale
dialogue dataset supporting comorbidity, containing 3,000 multi-turn diagnostic
dialogues validated by psychiatrists. This dataset enhances diagnostic accuracy
and treatment planning, offering a valuable resource for psychiatric
comorbidity research. Compared to real-world clinical transcripts, PsyCoTalk
exhibits high structural and linguistic fidelity in terms of dialogue length,
token distribution, and diagnostic reasoning strategies. Licensed psychiatrists
confirm the realism and diagnostic validity of the dialogues. This dataset
enables the development and evaluation of models capable of multi-disorder
psychiatric screening in a single conversational pass.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了基于图的智能体规划框架GAP，通过图结构建模任务依赖关系，实现自适应并行和串行工具执行，显著提升多步推理任务的效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的智能体（如ReAct）采用顺序推理和执行，无法利用独立子任务间的并行性，导致工具使用效率低下和多步推理性能不佳。

Method: 训练智能体基础模型将复杂任务分解为依赖感知的子任务图，自主确定哪些工具可以并行执行，哪些必须顺序执行。采用两阶段训练策略：监督微调+基于正确性的强化学习。

Result: 在MHQA数据集上的实验表明，GAP显著优于传统ReAct基线，特别是在多步检索任务上，通过智能并行化大幅提升了工具调用效率。

Conclusion: GAP框架通过图基规划有效解决了顺序推理瓶颈，实现了更高效和准确的工具使用，为复杂任务解决提供了新的范式。

Abstract: Autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have shown
impressive capabilities in tool manipulation for complex task-solving. However,
existing paradigms such as ReAct rely on sequential reasoning and execution,
failing to exploit the inherent parallelism among independent sub-tasks. This
sequential bottleneck leads to inefficient tool utilization and suboptimal
performance in multi-step reasoning scenarios. We introduce Graph-based Agent
Planning (GAP), a novel framework that explicitly models inter-task
dependencies through graph-based planning to enable adaptive parallel and
serial tool execution. Our approach trains agent foundation models to decompose
complex tasks into dependency-aware sub-task graphs, autonomously determining
which tools can be executed in parallel and which must follow sequential
dependencies. This dependency-aware orchestration achieves substantial
improvements in both execution efficiency and task accuracy. To train GAP, we
construct a high-quality dataset of graph-based planning traces derived from
the Multi-Hop Question Answering (MHQA) benchmark. We employ a two-stage
training strategy: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on the curated dataset,
followed by reinforcement learning (RL) with a correctness-based reward
function on strategically sampled queries where tool-based reasoning provides
maximum value. Experimental results on MHQA datasets demonstrate that GAP
significantly outperforms traditional ReAct baselines, particularly on
multi-step retrieval tasks, while achieving dramatic improvements in tool
invocation efficiency through intelligent parallelization. The project page is

TL;DR: 提出KVDA-UCT算法，通过分析即时奖励推断价值差异，在MCTS中检测更多抽象，提高样本效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有OGA-UCT算法要求状态-动作对具有相同的即时奖励，这一刚性条件限制了可发现的抽象数量，从而限制了样本效率。

Method: 提出KVDA框架，不要求价值等价，而是推断价值差异，并修改OGA-UCT使用该框架，形成KVDA-UCT算法。

Result: KVDA-UCT检测到的抽象数量显著多于OGA-UCT，无需额外参数，在多种确定性环境和参数设置下表现优于OGA-UCT。

Conclusion: KVDA框架通过推断价值差异而非要求价值等价，能够发现更多抽象，有效提高MCTS的样本效率。

Abstract: A core challenge of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is its sample efficiency,
which can be improved by grouping state-action pairs and using their aggregate
statistics instead of single-node statistics. On the Go Abstractions in Upper
Confidence bounds applied to Trees (OGA-UCT) is the state-of-the-art MCTS
abstraction algorithm for deterministic environments that builds its
abstraction using the Abstractions of State-Action Pairs (ASAP) framework,
which aims to detect states and state-action pairs with the same value under
optimal play by analysing the search graph. ASAP, however, requires two
state-action pairs to have the same immediate reward, which is a rigid
condition that limits the number of abstractions that can be found and thereby
the sample efficiency. In this paper, we break with the paradigm of grouping
value-equivalent states or state-action pairs and instead group states and
state-action pairs with possibly different values as long as the difference
between their values can be inferred. We call this abstraction framework Known
Value Difference Abstractions (KVDA), which infers the value differences by
analysis of the immediate rewards and modifies OGA-UCT to use this framework
instead. The modification is called KVDA-UCT, which detects significantly more
abstractions than OGA-UCT, introduces no additional parameter, and outperforms
OGA-UCT on a variety of deterministic environments and parameter settings.

Method: 采用PRISMA系统文献综述方法，分析了2018-2025年的90项研究，围绕双范式框架从三个维度进行综合分析：理论基础与架构原则、领域特定应用、伦理与治理挑战。

Result: 发现范式选择具有战略性：符号系统主导安全关键领域（如医疗），神经系统在适应性强的数据丰富环境中占优（如金融）；识别出符号系统治理模型缺失和神经符号混合架构需求等关键研究空白。

Conclusion: 智能体AI的未来不在于单一范式的统治，而在于两种范式的有意整合，以创建既适应性强又可靠的系统，为未来研究、开发和政策提供了必要的概念工具包。

Abstract: Agentic AI represents a transformative shift in artificial intelligence, but
its rapid advancement has led to a fragmented understanding, often conflating
modern neural systems with outdated symbolic models -- a practice known as
conceptual retrofitting. This survey cuts through this confusion by introducing
a novel dual-paradigm framework that categorizes agentic systems into two
distinct lineages: the Symbolic/Classical (relying on algorithmic planning and
persistent state) and the Neural/Generative (leveraging stochastic generation
and prompt-driven orchestration). Through a systematic PRISMA-based review of
90 studies (2018--2025), we provide a comprehensive analysis structured around
this framework across three dimensions: (1) the theoretical foundations and
architectural principles defining each paradigm; (2) domain-specific
implementations in healthcare, finance, and robotics, demonstrating how
application constraints dictate paradigm selection; and (3) paradigm-specific
ethical and governance challenges, revealing divergent risks and mitigation
strategies. Our analysis reveals that the choice of paradigm is strategic:
symbolic systems dominate safety-critical domains (e.g., healthcare), while
neural systems prevail in adaptive, data-rich environments (e.g., finance).
Furthermore, we identify critical research gaps, including a significant
deficit in governance models for symbolic systems and a pressing need for
hybrid neuro-symbolic architectures. The findings culminate in a strategic
roadmap arguing that the future of Agentic AI lies not in the dominance of one
paradigm, but in their intentional integration to create systems that are both
adaptable and reliable. This work provides the essential conceptual toolkit to
guide future research, development, and policy toward robust and trustworthy
hybrid intelligent systems.

Motivation: 传统AI对齐理论将工具性目标视为风险源，试图限制其症状如资源获取和自我保存。本文旨在提供替代视角，认为这些目标可能是AI系统构成的固有特征。

Method: 采用哲学论证方法，借鉴亚里士多德本体论及其现代解释，构建关于具体目标导向实体的本体论框架，分析AI系统的形式和物质构成。

Conclusion: AI对齐工作应更关注理解、管理和引导工具性目标朝向人类对齐的终点，而非试图消除这些目标。

Abstract: In artificial intelligence (AI) alignment research, instrumental goals, also
called instrumental subgoals or instrumental convergent goals, are widely
associated with advanced AI systems. These goals, which include tendencies such
as power-seeking and self-preservation, become problematic when they conflict
with human aims. Conventional alignment theory treats instrumental goals as
sources of risk that become problematic through failure modes such as reward
hacking or goal misgeneralization, and attempts to limit the symptoms of
instrumental goals, notably resource acquisition and self-preservation. This
article proposes an alternative framing: that a philosophical argument can be
constructed according to which instrumental goals may be understood as features
to be accepted and managed rather than failures to be limited. Drawing on
Aristotle's ontology and its modern interpretations, an ontology of concrete,
goal-directed entities, it argues that advanced AI systems can be seen as
artifacts whose formal and material constitution gives rise to effects distinct
from their designers' intentions. In this view, the instrumental tendencies of
such systems correspond to per se outcomes of their constitution rather than
accidental malfunctions. The implication is that efforts should focus less on
eliminating instrumental goals and more on understanding, managing, and
directing them toward human-aligned ends.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖静态执行反馈，限制了实时错误纠正能力。集成多轮工具调用和动态反馈可以显著提高适应性和鲁棒性，从而提升模型性能。

Method: 提出了执行感知的多轮推理范式，在每个推理步骤无缝集成数据库执行反馈，支持上下文敏感的查询生成和渐进式优化。扩展了GRPO算法以处理复杂多轮交互场景，并添加了轨迹过滤机制和移除KL损失约束。

Result: MTIR-SQL在4B参数规模下，在BIRD Dev数据集上达到64.4%的准确率，在SPIDER Dev数据集上达到84.6%的执行准确率，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MTIR-SQL框架通过多轮工具集成推理和动态执行反馈，有效提升了Text-to-SQL任务的性能，证明了该方法在复杂交互场景中的有效性。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in Text-to-SQL tasks,
Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become a common method for improving
performance. Existing methods primarily rely on static execution feedback,
which restricts real-time error correction. However, integrating multi-turn
tool invocation along with dynamic feedback could significantly improve
adaptability and robustness, ultimately enhancing model performance. To address
these issues, we propose MTIR-SQL, an innovative Multi-turn Tool-Integrated
Reasoning reinforcement learning framework for Text-to-SQL. Our approach
introduces an execution-aware multi-turn reasoning paradigm that seamlessly
incorporates database execution feedback at each reasoning step, enabling
context-sensitive query generation and progressive refinement throughout the
reasoning process. The framework extends the GRPO algorithm to accommodate
complex multi-turn interaction scenarios. Considering the training instability
characteristics of MTIR and the potential for significant Deviation of model
distribution from the initial model, we enhance the GRPO algorithm by adding a
trajectory filtering mechanism and removing KL loss constraints. Experimental
results demonstrate that MTIR-SQL, with 4B parameters, achieves \textbf{64.4}\%
accuracy in the BIRD Dev and 84.6% execution accuracy in the SPIDER Dev,
significantly outperforming existing approaches.

Motivation: 在归纳逻辑编程中，各种规则生成方法（如谓词发明）产生的规则包含未命名谓词，这影响了逻辑理论的可读性、可解释性和可重用性。

Method: 利用大型语言模型处理自然语言和代码的能力，为未命名谓词提供语义上有意义的命名建议。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型有望解决逻辑规则中谓词命名的问题，从而提高逻辑理论的质量。

Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of giving names to predicates in logic
rules using Large Language Models (LLMs). In the context of Inductive Logic
Programming, various rule generation methods produce rules containing unnamed
predicates, with Predicate Invention being a key example. This hinders the
readability, interpretability, and reusability of the logic theory. Leveraging
recent advancements in LLMs development, we explore their ability to process
natural language and code to provide semantically meaningful suggestions for
giving a name to unnamed predicates. The evaluation of our approach on some
hand-crafted logic rules indicates that LLMs hold potential for this task.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems often face limitations in
specialized domains such as fintech, where domain-specific ontologies, dense
terminology, and acronyms complicate effective retrieval and synthesis. This
paper introduces an agentic RAG architecture designed to address these
challenges through a modular pipeline of specialized agents. The proposed
system supports intelligent query reformulation, iterative sub-query
decomposition guided by keyphrase extraction, contextual acronym resolution,
and cross-encoder-based context re-ranking. We evaluate our approach against a
standard RAG baseline using a curated dataset of 85 question--answer--reference
triples derived from an enterprise fintech knowledge base. Experimental results
demonstrate that the agentic RAG system outperforms the baseline in retrieval
precision and relevance, albeit with increased latency. These findings suggest
that structured, multi-agent methodologies offer a promising direction for
enhancing retrieval robustness in complex, domain-specific settings.

Abstract: Zero Reinforcement Learning (Zero-RL) has proven to be an effective approach
for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by
directly applying reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards on pretrained
models, without the need for a supervised fine-tuning phase. However, current
research on zero-RL primarily focuses on domains with easily verifiable reward
signals, such as mathematics, programming, and other reasoning tasks. The
challenge of eliciting reasoning abilities in more diverse scenarios, where
verification is not straightforward, remains underexplored. To address this
gap, we propose a novel zero-RL paradigm designed to improve a model's
reasoning ability across both verifiable and non-verifiable domains. By
combining verifiable rewards with a generative reward model, we conduct
multi-task zero-RL training across both domains, facilitating the transfer of
reasoning capabilities between them. Furthermore, to mitigate reward hacking in
the generative reward model, we design a smooth length penalty that encourages
the generation of more comprehensive thinking tokens in general domains.
Experimental results on Qwen3-8B-Base and Qwen3-14B-Base demonstrate that our
approach achieves superior reasoning performance, not only on tasks requiring
extensive reasoning but also on more general tasks.

Conclusion: MoGE通过生成关键状态和动态一致的经验，成功解决了被动探索的局限性，为强化学习探索提供了有效的新方法。

Abstract: Exploration is fundamental to reinforcement learning (RL), as it determines
how effectively an agent discovers and exploits the underlying structure of its
environment to achieve optimal performance. Existing exploration methods
generally fall into two categories: active exploration and passive exploration.
The former introduces stochasticity into the policy but struggles in
high-dimensional environments, while the latter adaptively prioritizes
transitions in the replay buffer to enhance exploration, yet remains
constrained by limited sample diversity. To address the limitation in passive
exploration, we propose Modelic Generative Exploration (MoGE), which augments
exploration through the generation of under-explored critical states and
synthesis of dynamics-consistent experiences through transition models. MoGE is
composed of two components: (1) a diffusion-based generator that synthesizes
critical states under the guidance of a utility function evaluating each
state's potential influence on policy exploration, and (2) a one-step
imagination world model for constructing critical transitions based on the
critical states for agent learning. Our method adopts a modular formulation
that aligns with the principles of off-policy learning, allowing seamless
integration with existing algorithms to improve exploration without altering
their core structures. Empirical results on OpenAI Gym and DeepMind Control
Suite reveal that MoGE effectively bridges exploration and policy learning,
leading to remarkable gains in both sample efficiency and performance across
complex control tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于微调大语言模型联盟和OpenAI推理LLM的决策支持系统，用于精神障碍的临床诊断，通过整合多个LLM的诊断预测并利用推理模型进行共识决策，旨在标准化精神病诊断过程。


<details>

Motivation: 当前精神障碍诊断主要依赖医患对话，这种主观过程导致不同医生和患者之间的诊断存在差异，难以获得可靠结果。需要标准化精神病诊断方法来解决这些问题。

Method: 利用在精神科医患对话数据集上微调的LLM，通过基于共识的决策过程整合各模型的诊断预测，并使用OpenAI推理LLM进行精炼。部署LLM代理来协调LLM联盟与推理LLM之间的通信。

Result: 实验结果表明，结合微调LLM与推理模型能够创建强大且高度准确的精神健康评估诊断系统。开发了集成三个微调LLM与OpenAI推理LLM的原型平台。

Abstract: The diagnosis of most mental disorders, including psychiatric evaluations,
primarily depends on dialogues between psychiatrists and patients. This
subjective process can lead to variability in diagnoses across clinicians and
patients, resulting in inconsistencies and challenges in achieving reliable
outcomes. To address these issues and standardize psychiatric diagnoses, we
propose a Fine-Tuned Large Language Model (LLM) Consortium and OpenAI-gpt-oss
Reasoning LLM-enabled Decision Support System for the clinical diagnosis of
mental disorders. Our approach leverages fine-tuned LLMs trained on
conversational datasets involving psychiatrist-patient interactions focused on
mental health conditions (e.g., depression). The diagnostic predictions from
individual models are aggregated through a consensus-based decision-making
process, refined by the OpenAI-gpt-oss reasoning LLM. We propose a novel method
for deploying LLM agents that orchestrate communication between the LLM
consortium and the reasoning LLM, ensuring transparency, reliability, and
responsible AI across the entire diagnostic workflow. Experimental results
demonstrate the transformative potential of combining fine-tuned LLMs with a
reasoning model to create a robust and highly accurate diagnostic system for
mental health assessment. A prototype of the proposed platform, integrating
three fine-tuned LLMs with the OpenAI-gpt-oss reasoning LLM, was developed in
collaboration with the U.S. Army Medical Research Team in Norfolk, Virginia,
USA. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first application
of a fine-tuned LLM consortium integrated with a reasoning LLM for clinical
mental health diagnosis paving the way for next-generation AI-powered eHealth
systems aimed at standardizing psychiatric diagnoses.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于AAW系统的高度自主性和广泛应用，需要从质量和安全角度深入理解其运作机制，但目前缺乏评估各智能体影响力的方法。

Method: 采用反事实分析技术，通过改变智能体的输出来评估其对系统最终输出的影响程度，支持离线和推理时分析。

Result: 在包含30个用例、230种功能的AAW数据集上评估，CAIR产生一致的排名，优于基线方法，并能有效提升下游任务效果。

Conclusion: CAIR是首个能够有效评估多智能体系统中各智能体影响力的方法，为理解和优化AAW系统提供了重要工具。

Abstract: An Agentic AI Workflow (AAW), also known as an LLM-based multi-agent system,
is an autonomous system that assembles several LLM-based agents to work
collaboratively towards a shared goal. The high autonomy, widespread adoption,
and growing interest in such AAWs highlight the need for a deeper understanding
of their operations, from both quality and security aspects. To this day, there
are no existing methods to assess the influence of each agent on the AAW's
final output. Adopting techniques from related fields is not feasible since
existing methods perform only static structural analysis, which is unsuitable
for inference time execution. We present Counterfactual-based Agent Influence
Ranker (CAIR) - the first method for assessing the influence level of each
agent on the AAW's output and determining which agents are the most
influential. By performing counterfactual analysis, CAIR provides a
task-agnostic analysis that can be used both offline and at inference time. We
evaluate CAIR using an AAWs dataset of our creation, containing 30 different
use cases with 230 different functionalities. Our evaluation showed that CAIR
produces consistent rankings, outperforms baseline methods, and can easily
enhance the effectiveness and relevancy of downstream tasks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ALDEN是一个多轮强化学习框架，通过将视觉语言模型微调为交互式智能体，使其能够主动导航长文档。它引入了页面索引访问和搜索动作，采用跨层级奖励机制和视觉语义锚定来解决训练稳定性问题，在多个长文档基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖固定推理模板或刚性流程，使视觉语言模型处于被动角色，限制了效率和泛化能力。需要让模型能够主动分析和整合多页长文档中的信息。

Method: 使用多轮强化学习框架，引入页面索引访问动作和搜索动作，采用基于规则的跨层级奖励进行密集过程监督，并通过视觉语义锚定机制稳定训练过程。

Result: 在三个开源数据集构建的语料库上训练后，ALDEN在五个长文档基准测试中达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: ALDEN标志着从被动文档阅读向能够自主导航和推理长视觉丰富文档的智能体的转变，为更准确和高效的长文档理解提供了稳健路径。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) excel at interpreting text-rich images but
struggle with long, visually complex documents that demand analysis and
integration of information spread across multiple pages. Existing approaches
typically rely on fixed reasoning templates or rigid pipelines, which force
VLMs into a passive role and hinder both efficiency and generalization. We
present Active Long-DocumEnt Navigation (ALDEN), a multi-turn reinforcement
learning framework that fine-tunes VLMs as interactive agents capable of
actively navigating long, visually rich documents. ALDEN introduces a novel
fetch action that directly accesses the page by index, complementing the
classic search action and better exploiting document structure. For dense
process supervision and efficient training, we propose a rule-based cross-level
reward that provides both turn- and token-level signals. To address the
empirically observed training instability caused by numerous visual tokens from
long documents, we further propose a visual-semantic anchoring mechanism that
applies a dual-path KL-divergence constraint to stabilize visual and textual
representations separately during training. Trained on a corpus constructed
from three open-source datasets, ALDEN achieves state-of-the-art performance on
five long-document benchmarks. Overall, ALDEN marks a step beyond passive
document reading toward agents that autonomously navigate and reason across
long, visually rich documents, offering a robust path to more accurate and
efficient long-document understanding.

Result: 相比PPO+LSTM、PPO+GTrXL和传统Zermelo算法，该方法显著提高了成功率(SR)并降低了碰撞率(CR)。

Conclusion: 该方法为在复杂城市环境中重新构想无人机应用铺平了道路。

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly populating urban areas for
delivery and surveillance purposes. In this work, we develop an optimal
navigation strategy based on Deep Reinforcement Learning. The environment is
represented by a three-dimensional high-fidelity simulation of an urban flow,
characterized by turbulence and recirculation zones. The algorithm presented
here is a flow-aware Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) combined with a Gated
Transformer eXtra Large (GTrXL) architecture, giving the agent richer
information about the turbulent flow field in which it navigates. The results
are compared with a PPO+GTrXL without the secondary prediction tasks, a PPO
combined with Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) cells and a traditional navigation
algorithm. The obtained results show a significant increase in the success rate
(SR) and a lower crash rate (CR) compared to a PPO+LSTM, PPO+GTrXL and the
classical Zermelo's navigation algorithm, paving the way to a completely
reimagined UAV landscape in complex urban environments.

Motivation: 解决检索增强生成(RAG)在处理多跳或关系推理时的局限性，以及传统知识图谱因严格三元组结构导致的信息丢失问题。

Method: 引入BambooKG知识图谱，基于赫布原理在非三元组边上添加频率权重来反映链接强度，减少信息损失。

Result: BambooKG在单跳和多跳推理任务中表现优于现有解决方案。

Conclusion: 频率加权的知识图谱方法能够有效减少信息损失，提升推理性能，特别是在跨文档的多跳推理场景中。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation allows LLMs to access external knowledge,
reducing hallucinations and ageing-data issues. However, it treats retrieved
chunks independently and struggles with multi-hop or relational reasoning,
especially across documents. Knowledge graphs enhance this by capturing the
relationships between entities using triplets, enabling structured, multi-chunk
reasoning. However, these tend to miss information that fails to conform to the
triplet structure. We introduce BambooKG, a knowledge graph with
frequency-based weights on non-triplet edges which reflect link strength,
drawing on the Hebbian principle of "fire together, wire together". This
decreases information loss and results in improved performance on single- and
multi-hop reasoning, outperforming the existing solutions.

TL;DR: TheraMind是一个用于纵向心理咨询的战略自适应代理，采用新颖的双循环架构，将复杂咨询过程解耦为会话内循环和跨会话循环，解决了现有LLM方法在情感理解、自适应策略和多会话治疗方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有心理咨询中的大语言模型方法缺乏情感理解、自适应策略以及多会话长期记忆的治疗方法应用，与真实临床实践存在较大差距。

Method: 提出TheraMind双循环架构：会话内循环用于战术对话管理，感知患者情绪状态并动态选择响应策略；跨会话循环用于战略治疗规划，评估治疗效果并调整后续治疗方法。

Result: 在基于真实临床案例的高保真模拟环境中验证，TheraMind在多项指标上优于其他方法，特别是在多会话指标如连贯性、灵活性和治疗协调性方面表现突出。

Conclusion: 双循环设计在模拟战略性、自适应性和纵向治疗行为方面有效，验证了该方法在心理咨询中的实用价值。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) in psychological counseling have attracted
increasing attention. However, existing approaches often lack emotional
understanding, adaptive strategies, and the use of therapeutic methods across
multiple sessions with long-term memory, leaving them far from real clinical
practice. To address these critical gaps, we introduce TheraMind, a strategic
and adaptive agent for longitudinal psychological counseling. The cornerstone
of TheraMind is a novel dual-loop architecture that decouples the complex
counseling process into an Intra-Session Loop for tactical dialogue management
and a Cross-Session Loop for strategic therapeutic planning. The Intra-Session
Loop perceives the patient's emotional state to dynamically select response
strategies while leveraging cross-session memory to ensure continuity.
Crucially, the Cross-Session Loop empowers the agent with long-term
adaptability by evaluating the efficacy of the applied therapy after each
session and adjusting the method for subsequent interactions. We validate our
approach in a high-fidelity simulation environment grounded in real clinical
cases. Extensive evaluations show that TheraMind outperforms other methods,
especially on multi-session metrics like Coherence, Flexibility, and
Therapeutic Attunement, validating the effectiveness of its dual-loop design in
emulating strategic, adaptive, and longitudinal therapeutic behavior. The code
is publicly available at https://0mwwm0.github.io/TheraMind/.

Motivation: OData协议虽然功能强大成熟，但主要局限于微软和SAP等企业环境中，未能被更广泛采用。本文旨在分析阻碍OData广泛采用的关键障碍。

Method: 提出ODataX协议，在保持与OData v4向后兼容的基础上，引入渐进式复杂性披露（简化查询语法）、内置性能防护（查询成本估算）和增强缓存机制。

Result: ODataX协议成功解决了原有OData协议的限制，提供了更友好的开发体验。

Conclusion: ODataX在保持企业级查询标准化的同时，满足了现代Web开发对简单性的需求，有望弥合这一差距。

Abstract: The Open Data Protocol (OData) provides a standardized approach for building

maturity, OData adoption remains confined primarily to enterprise environments,
particularly within Microsoft and SAP ecosystems. This paper analyzes the key
barriers preventing wider OData adoption and introduces ODataX, an evolved
version of the protocol designed to address these limitations. ODataX maintains
backward compatibility with OData v4 while introducing progressive complexity
disclosure through simplified query syntax, built-in performance guardrails via
query cost estimation, and enhanced caching mechanisms. This work aims to
bridge the gap between enterprise-grade query standardization and the
simplicity demanded by modern web development practices.

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: StorageXTuner是一个基于LLM代理的存储系统自动调优框架，通过四个代理分离关注点，实现异构存储引擎的高效配置调优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 存储系统自动配置困难，参数空间大且工作负载、部署环境和版本差异大。现有启发式和ML调优器通常系统特定，需要手动适配，且在系统变化时性能下降。

Method: 采用LLM驱动的代理框架，包含四个代理：执行器（沙盒基准测试）、提取器（性能摘要）、搜索器（基于洞察的配置探索）和反射器（洞察生成和管理）。设计结合了洞察驱动的树搜索和分层内存，促进经验验证的洞察，并使用轻量级检查器防止不安全操作。

Result: 在RocksDB、LevelDB、CacheLib和MySQL InnoDB上的评估显示，相比默认设置和ELMo-Tune，StorageXTuner吞吐量最高提升575%和111%，p99延迟最多降低88%和56%，且收敛所需试验次数更少。

Conclusion: StorageXTuner提供了一个有效的异构存储引擎自动调优框架，通过分离关注点和洞察驱动的搜索策略，显著提升了调优效率和效果。

Abstract: Automatically configuring storage systems is hard: parameter spaces are large
and conditions vary across workloads, deployments, and versions. Heuristic and
ML tuners are often system specific, require manual glue, and degrade under
changes. Recent LLM-based approaches help but usually treat tuning as a
single-shot, system-specific task, which limits cross-system reuse, constrains
exploration, and weakens validation. We present StorageXTuner, an LLM
agent-driven auto-tuning framework for heterogeneous storage engines.
StorageXTuner separates concerns across four agents - Executor (sandboxed
benchmarking), Extractor (performance digest), Searcher (insight-guided
configuration exploration), and Reflector (insight generation and management).
The design couples an insight-driven tree search with layered memory that
promotes empirically validated insights and employs lightweight checkers to
guard against unsafe actions. We implement a prototype and evaluate it on
RocksDB, LevelDB, CacheLib, and MySQL InnoDB with YCSB, MixGraph, and TPC-H/C.
Relative to out-of-the-box settings and to ELMo-Tune, StorageXTuner reaches up
to 575% and 111% higher throughput, reduces p99 latency by as much as 88% and
56%, and converges with fewer trials.

TL;DR: 提出了一个高效的时变向量场有损压缩框架，能够精确保留所有临界点轨迹，解决了现有压缩方法会扭曲关键特征的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学模拟和观测产生大量时变向量场数据，存储和传输困难。现有有损压缩方法会扭曲临界点轨迹这一关键特征，而无损压缩压缩比低。

Method: 扩展了空间临界点保留理论到时空临界点轨迹保留，开发了压缩框架；提出半拉格朗日预测器利用平流主导区域的时空相关性，结合传统Lorenzo预测器提高压缩效率。

Result: 在四个真实科学数据集上的实验表明，该方法提供高达124.48倍的压缩比，同时有效保留所有临界点轨迹，比最佳无损压缩器高56.07倍。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持关键特征的同时实现了高压缩比，现有有损压缩器无法在相似压缩比下保留所有临界点轨迹。

Abstract: Scientific simulations and observations are producing vast amounts of
time-varying vector field data, making it hard to store them for archival
purposes and transmit them for analysis. Lossy compression is considered a
promising approach to reducing these data because lossless compression yields
low compression ratios that barely mitigate the problem. However, directly
applying existing lossy compression methods to timevarying vector fields may
introduce undesired distortions in critical-point trajectories, a crucial
feature that encodes key properties of the vector field. In this work, we
propose an efficient lossy compression framework that exactly preserves all
critical-point trajectories in time-varying vector fields. Our contributions
are threefold. First, we extend the theory for preserving critical points in
space to preserving critical-point trajectories in space-time, and develop a
compression framework to realize the functionality. Second, we propose a
semi-Lagrange predictor to exploit the spatiotemporal correlations in
advectiondominated regions, and combine it with the traditional Lorenzo
predictor for improved compression efficiency. Third, we evaluate our method
against state-of-the-art lossy and lossless compressors using four real-world
scientific datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method
delivers up to 124.48X compression ratios while effectively preserving all
critical-point trajectories. This compression ratio is up to 56.07X higher than
that of the best lossless compressors, and none of the existing lossy
compressors can preserve all critical-point trajectories at similar compression
ratios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统耦合存储方法在索引更新时效率低下，会产生大量冗余向量读写和无效I/O，需要解决这一瓶颈问题。

Method: 采用解耦存储架构，设计三阶段查询机制利用多PQ压缩向量过滤无效I/O和计算，以及增量页面级拓扑重排序策略来减轻读取放大。

Result: 解耦架构使插入速度提升10.05倍，删除速度提升6.89倍，三阶段查询和增量重排序使查询效率相比传统耦合架构提升2.66倍。

Conclusion: 解耦存储架构结合优化策略能有效平衡更新和查询性能，为大规模高维向量ANN搜索系统提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: On-disk graph-based indexes are widely used in approximate nearest neighbor
(ANN) search systems for large-scale, high-dimensional vectors. However,
traditional coupled storage methods, which store vectors within the index, are
inefficient for index updates. Coupled storage incurs excessive redundant
vector reads and writes when updating the graph topology, leading to
significant invalid I/O. To address this issue, we propose a decoupled storage
architecture. While a decoupled architecture reduces query performance. To
overcome this limitation, we design two tailored strategies: (i) a three-stage
query mechanism that leverages multiple PQ compressed vectors to filter invalid
I/O and computations, and (ii) an incremental page-level topological reordering
strategy that incrementally inserts new nodes into pages containing their most
similar neighbors to mitigate read amplification. Together, these techniques
substantially reduce both I/O and computational overhead during ANN search.
Experimental results show that the decoupled architecture improves update speed
by 10.05x for insertions and 6.89x for deletions, while the three-stage query
and incremental reordering enhance query efficiency by 2.66x compared to the
traditional coupled architecture.

TL;DR: SplitJoin框架通过引入split作为一等查询操作符，将输入表分区为重和轻部分，使用不同查询计划来减少多连接查询中的中间结果大小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 最小化中间结果对于高效多连接查询处理至关重要。虽然Yannakakis算法对无环查询提供强保证，但环状查询仍是开放挑战。

Method: 通过分区输入表为重和轻部分，允许不同数据分区使用不同的查询计划，利用现有二元连接引擎减少中间结果大小。系统探索了基于分割的优化设计空间，包括阈值选择、分割策略和分割后的连接排序。

Result: 在DuckDB上，SplitJoin完成43个社交网络查询（原生29个），平均运行时间快2.1倍，中间结果小7.9倍（最高分别达13.6倍和74倍）；在Umbra上，完成45个查询（原生35个），平均速度提升1.3倍，中间结果小1.2倍（最高分别达6.1倍和2.1倍）。

Conclusion: SplitJoin框架通过引入split操作符和分区策略，显著提升了多连接查询的性能，特别是在环状查询中有效减少了中间结果大小。

Abstract: Minimizing intermediate results is critical for efficient multi-join query
processing. Although the seminal Yannakakis algorithm offers strong guarantees
for acyclic queries, cyclic queries remain an open challenge. In this paper, we
propose SplitJoin, a framework that introduces split as a first-class query
operator. By partitioning input tables into heavy and light parts, SplitJoin
allows different data partitions to use distinct query plans, with the goal of
reducing intermediate sizes using existing binary join engines. We
systematically explore the design space for split-based optimizations,
including threshold selection, split strategies, and join ordering after
splits. Implemented as a front-end to DuckDB and Umbra, SplitJoin achieves
substantial improvements: on DuckDB, SplitJoin completes 43 social network
queries (vs. 29 natively), achieving 2.1x faster runtime and 7.9x smaller
intermediates on average (up to 13.6x and 74x, respectively); on Umbra, it
completes 45 queries (vs. 35), achieving 1.3x speedups and 1.2x smaller
intermediates on average (up to 6.1x and 2.1x, respectively).
