### [1] [Beyond CNNs: Efficient Fine-Tuning of Multi-Modal LLMs for Object Detection on Low-Data Regimes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08589)
*Nirmal Elamon,Rouzbeh Davoudi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究比较了传统CNN、零样本多模态LLM和微调多模态LLM在图像中人工文本叠加检测任务上的表现，发现LLM仅需少量数据微调即可显著提升性能，甚至超越需要大量数据的CNN模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索多模态大语言模型在视觉任务中的潜力，特别是在数据稀缺情况下如何通过微调发挥其优势，以弥补传统CNN模型需要大量数据的局限性。

Method: 对传统CNN、零样本预训练多模态LLM和微调多模态LLM进行综合比较，重点研究LLM在少量数据（少于1000张图像）下的微调效果。

Result: 微调后的多模态LLM在人工文本叠加检测任务上实现了高达36%的准确率提升，性能匹配甚至超越了需要大量数据的CNN基线模型。

Conclusion: 多模态LLM在视觉任务中展现出卓越的适应性和数据效率，为低资源视觉环境下的跨模态学习提供了有效策略，证明了语言引导模型在精确视觉理解中的潜力。

Abstract: The field of object detection and understanding is rapidly evolving, driven
by advances in both traditional CNN-based models and emerging multi-modal large
language models (LLMs). While CNNs like ResNet and YOLO remain highly effective
for image-based tasks, recent transformer-based LLMs introduce new capabilities
such as dynamic context reasoning, language-guided prompts, and holistic scene
understanding. However, when used out-of-the-box, the full potential of LLMs
remains underexploited, often resulting in suboptimal performance on
specialized visual tasks. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive comparison
of fine-tuned traditional CNNs, zero-shot pre-trained multi-modal LLMs, and
fine-tuned multi-modal LLMs on the challenging task of artificial text overlay
detection in images. A key contribution of our study is demonstrating that LLMs
can be effectively fine-tuned on very limited data (fewer than 1,000 images) to
achieve up to 36% accuracy improvement, matching or surpassing CNN-based
baselines that typically require orders of magnitude more data. By exploring
how language-guided models can be adapted for precise visual understanding with
minimal supervision, our work contributes to the broader effort of bridging
vision and language, offering novel insights into efficient cross-modal
learning strategies. These findings highlight the adaptability and data
efficiency of LLM-based approaches for real-world object detection tasks and
provide actionable guidance for applying multi-modal transformers in
low-resource visual environments. To support continued progress in this area,
we have made the code used to fine-tune the models available in our GitHub,
enabling future improvements and reuse in related applications.

*Saumya B*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 对脑肿瘤MRI分割中U-Net模型使用焦点损失和数据增强策略的可重复性评估，达到90%精度，与最先进结果相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脑肿瘤分割对诊断和治疗规划至关重要，但类别不平衡和模型泛化能力有限等问题阻碍了进展，需要建立可重复的基准研究。

Method: 在公开MRI数据集上评估U-Net分割性能，使用焦点损失函数并进行参数调优，同时测试三种数据增强技术：水平翻转、旋转和缩放。

Result: 使用焦点损失的U-Net模型达到90%的精度，与最先进结果相当，证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过公开所有代码和结果，本研究为脑肿瘤分割中的数据增强策略和损失函数设计建立了透明、可重复的基准，指导未来研究。

Abstract: Brain tumor segmentation is crucial for diagnosis and treatment planning, yet
challenges such as class imbalance and limited model generalization continue to
hinder progress. This work presents a reproducible evaluation of U-Net
segmentation performance on brain tumor MRI using focal loss and basic data
augmentation strategies. Experiments were conducted on a publicly available MRI
dataset, focusing on focal loss parameter tuning and assessing the impact of
three data augmentation techniques: horizontal flip, rotation, and scaling. The
U-Net with focal loss achieved a precision of 90%, comparable to
state-of-the-art results. By making all code and results publicly available,
this study establishes a transparent, reproducible baseline to guide future
research on augmentation strategies and loss function design in brain tumor
segmentation.

### [3] [Adjusting Initial Noise to Mitigate Memorization in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08625)
*Hyeonggeun Han,Sehwan Kim,Hyungjun Joo,Sangwoo Hong,Jungwoo Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 文本到图像扩散模型存在记忆训练数据的问题，本文发现初始噪声样本对记忆逃逸时间有重要影响，并提出两种调整初始噪声的策略来减少记忆化同时保持图像-文本对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型会记忆和复制训练数据，引发隐私和版权问题。现有方法延迟应用分类器自由引导(CFG)来避免记忆化，但会导致图像与提示对齐不佳。需要促进早期逃逸以便更早应用CFG。

Method: 通过实证观察发现不同初始噪声样本导致不同的逃逸时间，提出两种初始噪声调整策略：集体调整和个体调整，寻找能促进早期盆地逃逸的初始样本。

Result: 这些方法显著减少了记忆化，同时保持了图像-文本对齐质量。

Conclusion: 初始噪声样本在决定记忆逃逸时间中起关键作用，通过适当调整初始噪声可以有效缓解扩散模型的记忆化问题。

Abstract: Despite their impressive generative capabilities, text-to-image diffusion
models often memorize and replicate training data, prompting serious concerns
over privacy and copyright. Recent work has attributed this memorization to an
attraction basin-a region where applying classifier-free guidance (CFG) steers
the denoising trajectory toward memorized outputs-and has proposed deferring
CFG application until the denoising trajectory escapes this basin. However,
such delays often result in non-memorized images that are poorly aligned with
the input prompts, highlighting the need to promote earlier escape so that CFG
can be applied sooner in the denoising process. In this work, we show that the
initial noise sample plays a crucial role in determining when this escape
occurs. We empirically observe that different initial samples lead to varying
escape times. Building on this insight, we propose two mitigation strategies
that adjust the initial noise-either collectively or individually-to find and
utilize initial samples that encourage earlier basin escape. These approaches
significantly reduce memorization while preserving image-text alignment.

### [4] [The Digital Mirror: Gender Bias and Occupational Stereotypes in AI-Generated Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08628)
*Siiri Leppälampi,Sonja M. Hyrynsalmi,Erno Vanhala*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究测试了AI生成图像中的表征偏见，发现DALL-E 3和Ideogram在职业图像中强化了传统性别刻板印象，并提出改进建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注AI生成可视化内容的创作过程和质量，而忽视了表征偏见问题。随着AI图像工具广泛应用，解决有害的性别偏见对确保媒体和专业环境中的多样性表征至关重要。

Method: 研究通过提示生成超过750张职业相关的AI图像，使用DALL-E 3和Ideogram两种工具，并进行主题分析来评估性别表征偏见。

Result: 分析结果显示，两种AI图像生成工具都强化了传统性别刻板印象，尽管程度不同。AI可视化工具存在强化狭隘表征的风险。

Conclusion: 研究强调了AI图像生成工具中存在的性别偏见问题，并为从业者、个人和研究人员提出了增加可见性别图像生成中多样性的建议。

Abstract: Generative AI offers vast opportunities for creating visualisations, such as
graphics, videos, and images. However, recent studies around AI-generated
visualisations have primarily focused on the creation process and image
quality, overlooking representational biases. This study addresses this gap by
testing representation biases in AI-generated pictures in an occupational
setting and evaluating how two AI image generator tools, DALL-E 3 and Ideogram,
compare. Additionally, the study discusses topics such as ageing and emotions
in AI-generated images. As AI image tools are becoming more widely used,
addressing and mitigating harmful gender biases becomes essential to ensure
diverse representation in media and professional settings. In this study, over
750 AI-generated images of occupations were prompted. The thematic analysis
results revealed that both DALL-E 3 and Ideogram reinforce traditional gender
stereotypes in AI-generated images, although to varying degrees. These findings
emphasise that AI visualisation tools risk reinforcing narrow representations.
In our discussion section, we propose suggestions for practitioners,
individuals and researchers to increase representation when generating images
with visible genders.

### [5] [Dynamic Mixture-of-Experts for Visual Autoregressive Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08629)
*Jort Vincenti,Metod Jazbec,Guoxuan Xia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 在视觉自回归模型中集成动态专家混合路由器，通过尺度感知阈值减少计算冗余，实现20% FLOPs减少和11%推理加速，同时保持图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉自回归模型在递增分辨率下重复调用Transformer导致计算冗余，需要优化计算效率。

Method: 引入动态专家混合路由器，采用尺度感知阈值策略平衡专家选择，无需额外训练。

Result: 减少20% FLOPs，推理速度提升11%，图像质量与密集基线模型相当。

Conclusion: 动态专家混合路由能有效优化VAR模型的计算效率，实现计算与质量的平衡。

Abstract: Visual Autoregressive Models (VAR) offer efficient and high-quality image
generation but suffer from computational redundancy due to repeated Transformer
calls at increasing resolutions. We introduce a dynamic Mixture-of-Experts
router integrated into VAR. The new architecture allows to trade compute for
quality through scale-aware thresholding. This thresholding strategy balances
expert selection based on token complexity and resolution, without requiring
additional training. As a result, we achieve 20% fewer FLOPs, 11% faster
inference and match the image quality achieved by the dense baseline.

### [6] [Out-of-Distribution Detection in LiDAR Semantic Segmentation Using Epistemic Uncertainty from Hierarchical GMMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08631)
*Hanieh Shojaei Miandashti,Claus Brenner*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于层次贝叶斯建模的无监督OOD检测方法，通过分离认知不确定性和偶然不确定性，在LiDAR点云语义分割中显著提升了未知物体检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无监督OOD检测方法依赖预测熵，但混淆了认知不确定性和偶然不确定性，容易将分布内模糊区域误分类为OOD。需要一种能够准确分离这两种不确定性的方法。

Method: 使用层次贝叶斯建模对深度神经网络特征空间中的高斯混合模型参数进行建模，从而提取纯粹的认知不确定性，无需辅助数据或额外训练阶段。

Result: 在SemanticKITTI数据集上，相比预测熵方法，AUROC提升18%，AUPRC提升22%，FPR95从76%降低到40%（减少36%）。

Conclusion: 基于层次贝叶斯建模的认知不确定性方法能够有效分离不确定性的来源，显著提升无监督OOD检测性能，无需额外数据或训练。

Abstract: In addition to accurate scene understanding through precise semantic
segmentation of LiDAR point clouds, detecting out-of-distribution (OOD)
objects, instances not encountered during training, is essential to prevent the
incorrect assignment of unknown objects to known classes. While supervised OOD
detection methods depend on auxiliary OOD datasets, unsupervised methods avoid
this requirement but typically rely on predictive entropy, the entropy of the
predictive distribution obtained by averaging over an ensemble or multiple
posterior weight samples. However, these methods often conflate epistemic
(model) and aleatoric (data) uncertainties, misclassifying ambiguous in
distribution regions as OOD. To address this issue, we present an unsupervised
OOD detection approach that employs epistemic uncertainty derived from
hierarchical Bayesian modeling of Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) parameters in
the feature space of a deep neural network. Without requiring auxiliary data or
additional training stages, our approach outperforms existing uncertainty-based
methods on the SemanticKITTI dataset, achieving an 18\% improvement in AUROC,
22\% increase in AUPRC, and 36\% reduction in FPR95 (from 76\% to 40\%),
compared to the predictive entropy approach used in prior works.

### [7] [Hi-OSCAR: Hierarchical Open-set Classifier for Human Activity Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08635)
*Conor McCarthy,Loes Quirijnen,Jan Peter van Zandwijk,Zeno Geradts,Marcel Worring*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Hi-OSCAR：一种用于活动识别的分层开放集分类器，能够在保持最先进准确率的同时拒绝未知活动，并将未知类定位到最近的内部节点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类活动识别中存在已标注传感器数据集训练范围与现实生活中活动范围之间的巨大差距，未能正确处理未见活动会严重削弱分类器的可靠性。

Method: 将活动类组织成结构化层次结构，提出Hi-OSCAR分层开放集分类器，能够同时识别已知活动和拒绝未知活动。

Result: 开发了新的数据集NFI_FARED，包含多个受试者执行19种不同情境活动的数据，完全公开可供下载。

Conclusion: Hi-OSCAR不仅支持开放集分类，还提供超越二元"已知/未知"分类的洞察力，为开放集HAR研究提供了新方法和数据集支持。

Abstract: Within Human Activity Recognition (HAR), there is an insurmountable gap
between the range of activities performed in life and those that can be
captured in an annotated sensor dataset used in training. Failure to properly
handle unseen activities seriously undermines any HAR classifier's reliability.
Additionally within HAR, not all classes are equally dissimilar, some
significantly overlap or encompass other sub-activities. Based on these
observations, we arrange activity classes into a structured hierarchy. From
there, we propose Hi-OSCAR: a Hierarchical Open-set Classifier for Activity
Recognition, that can identify known activities at state-of-the-art accuracy
while simultaneously rejecting unknown activities. This not only enables
open-set classification, but also allows for unknown classes to be localized to
the nearest internal node, providing insight beyond a binary "known/unknown"
classification. To facilitate this and future open-set HAR research, we
collected a new dataset: NFI_FARED. NFI_FARED contains data from multiple
subjects performing nineteen activities from a range of contexts, including
daily living, commuting, and rapid movements, which is fully public and
available for download.

### [8] [Detection of high-frequency oscillations using time-frequency analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08637)
*Mostafa Mohammadpour,Mehdi Zekriyapanah Gashti,Yusif S. Gasimov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于无监督聚类的高频振荡自动检测方法，在80-500Hz频段内区分HFOs、尖峰、背景活动和伪迹，在控制数据集上达到97.67%的灵敏度和98.57%的精确度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高频振荡是识别癫痫灶的新生物标志物，但视觉识别HFOs耗时费力且主观，需要开发自动化检测方法用于研究和临床应用。

Method: 使用S变换从时频域提取事件，采用无监督聚类技术对事件进行分类，区分HFOs、尖峰、背景活动和伪迹。

Result: 在控制数据集上灵敏度97.67%、精确度98.57%、F分数97.78%；在癫痫患者中，切除与非切除接触点的HFOs比率达0.73，与手术结果相关性更强。

Conclusion: HFOs是癫痫患者中很有前景的癫痫发生生物标志物，切除HFOs（特别是快速涟漪）可达到无癫痫发作，而残留HFOs会导致癫痫复发。

Abstract: High-frequency oscillations (HFOs) are a new biomarker for identifying the
epileptogenic zone. Mapping HFO-generating regions can improve the precision of
resection sites in patients with refractory epilepsy. However, detecting HFOs
remains challenging, and their clinical features are not yet fully defined.
Visual identification of HFOs is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and
subjective. As a result, developing automated methods to detect HFOs is
critical for research and clinical use. In this study, we developed a novel
method for detecting HFOs in the ripple and fast ripple frequency bands (80-500
Hz). We validated it using both controlled datasets and data from epilepsy
patients. Our method employs an unsupervised clustering technique to categorize
events extracted from the time-frequency domain using the S-transform. The
proposed detector differentiates HFOs events from spikes, background activity,
and artifacts. Compared to existing detectors, our method achieved a
sensitivity of 97.67%, a precision of 98.57%, and an F-score of 97.78% on the
controlled dataset. In epilepsy patients, our results showed a stronger
correlation with surgical outcomes, with a ratio of 0.73 between HFOs rates in
resected versus non-resected contacts. The study confirmed previous findings
that HFOs are promising biomarkers of epileptogenicity in epileptic patients.
Removing HFOs, especially fast ripple, leads to seizure freedom, while
remaining HFOs lead to seizure recurrence.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DINOv2视觉变换器的表示结构分析：从线性表示假设到Minkowski表示假设，揭示了概念通过原型凸组合形成，具有功能专业化和几何组织特征


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解DINOv2视觉变换器内部表示的本质，探索其感知机制和概念组织方式

Method: 采用线性表示假设和稀疏自编码器构建32,000单元词典，分析下游任务的概念使用模式、表示几何统计特性，提出Minkowski表示假设

Result: 发现功能专业化现象：分类利用'Elsewhere'概念实现否定逻辑，分割依赖边界检测器子空间，深度估计使用三种单眼深度线索；表示部分密集而非严格稀疏，具有低维局部连接结构

Conclusion: 提出Minkowski表示假设，认为token通过原型凸组合形成，基于概念空间理论，为理解视觉变换器表示提供了新框架

Abstract: DINOv2 is routinely deployed to recognize objects, scenes, and actions; yet
the nature of what it perceives remains unknown. As a working baseline, we
adopt the Linear Representation Hypothesis (LRH) and operationalize it using
SAEs, producing a 32,000-unit dictionary that serves as the interpretability
backbone of our study, which unfolds in three parts.
  In the first part, we analyze how different downstream tasks recruit concepts
from our learned dictionary, revealing functional specialization:
classification exploits "Elsewhere" concepts that fire everywhere except on
target objects, implementing learned negations; segmentation relies on boundary
detectors forming coherent subspaces; depth estimation draws on three distinct
monocular depth cues matching visual neuroscience principles.
  Following these functional results, we analyze the geometry and statistics of
the concepts learned by the SAE. We found that representations are partly dense
rather than strictly sparse. The dictionary evolves toward greater coherence
and departs from maximally orthogonal ideals (Grassmannian frames). Within an
image, tokens occupy a low dimensional, locally connected set persisting after
removing position. These signs suggest representations are organized beyond
linear sparsity alone.
  Synthesizing these observations, we propose a refined view: tokens are formed
by combining convex mixtures of archetypes (e.g., a rabbit among animals, brown
among colors, fluffy among textures). This structure is grounded in Gardenfors'
conceptual spaces and in the model's mechanism as multi-head attention produces
sums of convex mixtures, defining regions bounded by archetypes. We introduce
the Minkowski Representation Hypothesis (MRH) and examine its empirical
signatures and implications for interpreting vision-transformer
representations.

*Zhe Dong,Yuzhe Sun,Haochen Jiang,Tianzhu Liu,Yanfeng Gu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出PhyDAE方法，通过两阶段级联架构将退化信息从隐式特征转化为显式决策信号，能够精确识别和处理多种异构退化（雾霾、噪声、模糊、低光），在保持成像物理一致性的同时显著提升计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的一体化修复方法过度依赖隐式特征表示，缺乏对退化物理的显式建模，难以处理遥感图像采集过程中复杂的异构退化问题。

Method: 采用两阶段级联架构，包含残差流形投影器(RMP)和频率感知退化分解器(FADD)进行渐进式退化挖掘，结合物理感知专家模块和温度控制稀疏激活策略。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上的实验表明，PhyDAE在四个修复任务上均取得最优性能，同时显著减少参数数量和计算复杂度，实现性能与效率的最佳平衡。

Conclusion: PhyDAE通过显式建模退化物理和自适应专家策略，有效解决了遥感图像多退化修复问题，在性能和效率方面均优于现有方法。

Abstract: Remote sensing images inevitably suffer from various degradation factors
during acquisition, including atmospheric interference, sensor limitations, and
imaging conditions. These complex and heterogeneous degradations pose severe
challenges to image quality and downstream interpretation tasks. Addressing
limitations of existing all-in-one restoration methods that overly rely on
implicit feature representations and lack explicit modeling of degradation
physics, this paper proposes Physics-Guided Degradation-Adaptive Experts
(PhyDAE). The method employs a two-stage cascaded architecture transforming
degradation information from implicit features into explicit decision signals,
enabling precise identification and differentiated processing of multiple
heterogeneous degradations including haze, noise, blur, and low-light
conditions. The model incorporates progressive degradation mining and
exploitation mechanisms, where the Residual Manifold Projector (RMP) and
Frequency-Aware Degradation Decomposer (FADD) comprehensively analyze
degradation characteristics from manifold geometry and frequency perspectives.
Physics-aware expert modules and temperature-controlled sparse activation
strategies are introduced to enhance computational efficiency while ensuring
imaging physics consistency. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets
(MD-RSID, MD-RRSHID, and MDRS-Landsat) demonstrate that PhyDAE achieves
superior performance across all four restoration tasks, comprehensively
outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Notably, PhyDAE substantially improves
restoration quality while achieving significant reductions in parameter count
and computational complexity, resulting in remarkable efficiency gains compared
to mainstream approaches and achieving optimal balance between performance and
efficiency. Code is available at https://github.com/HIT-SIRS/PhyDAE.

Motivation: 解决现实临床决策中整合多种数据模态（医疗文本、2D/3D图像、视频）的挑战，克服现有视觉语言模型在医疗领域开发中的不透明流程、数据稀缺和架构不灵活问题。

Method: 基于统一的基于patch的视觉编码器和LLM解码器构建，逐步训练1670万个样本，从2D扩展到3D和视频理解，采用医疗感知的token减少技术实现高效训练。

Conclusion: 通过开源完整流程证明高性能医疗VLM可以透明实现，为可访问和有影响力的临床AI提供基础工具。

Abstract: Real-world clinical decision-making grapples with integrating information
from diverse data modalities, including medical text, 2D/3D images, and video,
leading to inefficiencies and potential diagnostic oversights. While generalist
vision-language models (VLMs) offer promise, their medical development faces
challenges of opaque pipelines, data scarcity, and architectural inflexibility.
Here we present Hulu-Med, a transparent medical VLM that unifies understanding
across all these modalities. Built upon a unified patch-based vision encoder
and an LLM decoder, Hulu-Med was progressively trained on 16.7 million (M)
samples to scale from 2D to 3D and video comprehension. The medical-aware token
reduction enables efficient training, requiring only 4,000 to 40,000 GPU hours
for 7B to 32B parameter variants. Extensive evaluation across 30 benchmarks
exhibits state-of-the-art performance, surpassing leading open-source models
and competing with proprietary systems in tasks spanning visual
question-answering, medical report generation, and complex reasoning in
multilingual and rare disease scenarios. By open-sourcing our complete
pipeline, we establish that high-performance medical VLM can be achieved
transparently, providing a foundational tool for accessible and impactful
clinical AI. Code is released on

*Kang Liao,Size Wu,Zhonghua Wu,Linyi Jin,Chao Wang,Yikai Wang,Fei Wang,Wei Li,Chen Change Loy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Puffin是一个统一的相机中心多模态模型，通过将相机视为语言来扩展空间感知能力，能够从任意视角理解和生成场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 相机中心的理解和生成是空间智能的两个基石，但通常被孤立研究。需要开发一个统一的模型来整合这两种能力。

Method: 引入"相机即语言"的新范式，结合语言回归和基于扩散的生成方法。使用Puffin-4M数据集（400万视觉-语言-相机三元组），整合全局相机参数和像素级相机映射。

Result: 实验表明Puffin在相机中心生成和理解任务上优于专用模型，通过指令调优可泛化到空间想象、世界探索和摄影指导等跨视角任务。

Conclusion: Puffin为多模态空间智能研究提供了统一的解决方案，将发布代码、模型、数据集管道和基准测试以推动该领域发展。

Abstract: Camera-centric understanding and generation are two cornerstones of spatial
intelligence, yet they are typically studied in isolation. We present Puffin, a
unified camera-centric multimodal model that extends spatial awareness along
the camera dimension. Puffin integrates language regression and diffusion-based
generation to interpret and create scenes from arbitrary viewpoints. To bridge
the modality gap between cameras and vision-language, we introduce a novel
paradigm that treats camera as language, enabling thinking with camera. This
guides the model to align spatially grounded visual cues with photographic
terminology while reasoning across geometric context. Puffin is trained on
Puffin-4M, a large-scale dataset of 4 million vision-language-camera triplets.
We incorporate both global camera parameters and pixel-wise camera maps,
yielding flexible and reliable spatial generation. Experiments demonstrate
Puffin superior performance over specialized models for camera-centric
generation and understanding. With instruction tuning, Puffin generalizes to
diverse cross-view tasks such as spatial imagination, world exploration, and
photography guidance. We will release the code, models, dataset pipeline, and
benchmark to advance multimodal spatial intelligence research.

*Nicolas Ewen,Jairo Diaz-Rodriguez,Kelly Ramsay*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出结构化输出正则化(SOR)框架，通过冻结网络内部结构并使用组套索和L1惩罚，在少样本医学图像分类任务中取得竞争性结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统迁移学习方法冻结部分权重并添加任务特定层，虽然计算高效但限制了模型适应领域特定特征的能力，在数据有限时仍容易过拟合。

Method: SOR框架冻结内部网络结构（如卷积滤波器），同时使用组套索和L1惩罚的组合，以最少的额外参数将模型定制到特定数据。

Result: 在三个少样本医学图像分类任务上评估SOR，使用DenseNet121和EfficientNetB4基础网络相比已有基准取得了竞争性结果。

Conclusion: SOR是一个简单有效的框架，可广泛应用于各种网络组件，为迁移学习任务提供了广泛的适用性。

Abstract: Traditional transfer learning typically reuses large pre-trained networks by
freezing some of their weights and adding task-specific layers. While this
approach is computationally efficient, it limits the model's ability to adapt
to domain-specific features and can still lead to overfitting with very limited
data. To address these limitations, we propose Structured Output Regularization
(SOR), a simple yet effective framework that freezes the internal network
structures (e.g., convolutional filters) while using a combination of group
lasso and $L_1$ penalties. This framework tailors the model to specific data
with minimal additional parameters and is easily applicable to various network
components, such as convolutional filters or various blocks in neural networks
enabling broad applicability for transfer learning tasks. We evaluate SOR on
three few shot medical imaging classification tasks and we achieve competitive
results using DenseNet121, and EfficientNetB4 bases compared to established
benchmarks.

Method: 提出BEAR基准，包含6个类别14个领域的4,469个交错图像-视频-文本任务。同时开发BEAR-Agent，集成预训练视觉模型以增强MLLM的感知、3D理解和规划能力。

Result: 对20个代表性MLLMs的评估显示它们在所有具身能力领域都存在持续局限性。BEAR-Agent在BEAR基准上实现了9.12%的绝对增益和17.5%的相对改进。

Conclusion: 改进MLLM的具身能力可以有益于模拟环境中的具身任务，BEAR基准为系统评估具身能力提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Embodied capabilities refer to a suite of fundamental abilities for an agent
to perceive, comprehend, and interact with the physical world. While multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) show promise as embodied agents, a thorough and
systematic evaluation of their embodied capabilities remains underexplored, as
existing benchmarks primarily focus on specific domains such as planning or
spatial understanding. To bridge this gap, we introduce BEAR, a comprehensive
and fine-grained benchmark that evaluates MLLMs on atomic embodied
capabilities. BEAR comprises 4,469 interleaved image-video-text entries across
14 domains in 6 categories, including tasks from low-level pointing, trajectory
understanding, spatial reasoning, to high-level planning. Extensive evaluation
results of 20 representative MLLMs reveal their persistent limitations across
all domains of embodied capabilities. To tackle the shortfall, we propose
BEAR-Agent, a multimodal conversable agent that integrates pretrained vision
models to strengthen MLLM perception, 3D understanding, and planning
capabilities. It substantially enhances MLLM performance across diverse
embodied capabilities on BEAR, yielding a 9.12% absolute gain and a relative
improvement of 17.5% on GPT-5. Furthermore, our experiments indicate that
improving MLLM embodied capabilities can benefit embodied tasks in simulated
environments. Project website: https://bear-official66.github.io/

*Jiayang Liu,Daniel Tso,Yiming Bu,Qinru Qiu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于生物视觉机制（中央凹-外周处理、扫视眼动、皮层填充）的对抗防御框架，通过强化学习引导的扫视选择性捕获多个中央凹-外周图像片段，重建后进行分类，无需重新训练分类器即可有效抵御对抗攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统防御方法依赖计算密集型优化，而人类视觉系统通过进化机制天然具备对抗扰动的鲁棒性，受此启发研究注意力引导的非均匀稀疏采样和预测编码在鲁棒性中的作用。

Method: 结合三种生物机制：中央凹-外周处理、扫视眼动和皮层填充，使用强化学习引导的扫视选择性捕获多个中央凹-外周图像片段，整合重建后进行图像分类。

Result: 在ImageNet数据集上的实验表明，该方法提高了系统对多种分类器和攻击类型的鲁棒性，同时显著降低了训练开销。

Conclusion: 生物启发的预处理方法能有效缓解对抗噪声、保持语义完整性，且无需重新训练下游分类器，可与现有系统无缝集成。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks significantly challenge the safe deployment of deep
learning models, particularly in real-world applications. Traditional defenses
often rely on computationally intensive optimization (e.g., adversarial
training or data augmentation) to improve robustness, whereas the human visual
system achieves inherent robustness to adversarial perturbations through
evolved biological mechanisms. We hypothesize that attention guided
non-homogeneous sparse sampling and predictive coding plays a key role in this
robustness. To test this hypothesis, we propose a novel defense framework
incorporating three key biological mechanisms: foveal-peripheral processing,
saccadic eye movements, and cortical filling-in. Our approach employs
reinforcement learning-guided saccades to selectively capture multiple
foveal-peripheral glimpses, which are integrated into a reconstructed image
before classification. This biologically inspired preprocessing effectively
mitigates adversarial noise, preserves semantic integrity, and notably requires
no retraining or fine-tuning of downstream classifiers, enabling seamless
integration with existing systems. Experiments on the ImageNet dataset
demonstrate that our method improves system robustness across diverse
classifiers and attack types, while significantly reducing training overhead
compared to both biologically and non-biologically inspired defense techniques.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LinearSR是一个基于线性注意力的图像超分辨率框架，首次系统性地解决了线性注意力在超分辨率中的训练不稳定、感知-失真权衡等关键挑战，实现了高效且高质量的图像生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式图像超分辨率模型依赖自注意力机制，其二次复杂度造成计算瓶颈。线性注意力提供线性复杂度解决方案，但在真实感超分辨率中面临训练不稳定、感知-失真权衡等未解决挑战。

Method: 提出LinearSR框架：1）使用基于"拐点"的早期停止引导微调策略解决训练不稳定问题；2）采用SNR-based混合专家架构缓解感知-失真权衡；3）基于"精度优先于数量"原则建立轻量级TAG引导范式。

Result: LinearSR同时实现了最先进的感知质量和卓越效率。其核心扩散前向传播达到SOTA级速度，整体多步推理时间保持高度竞争力。

Conclusion: 这项工作首次为真实感超分辨率领域提供了应用线性注意力的稳健方法，为高效生成式超分辨率的未来研究建立了基础范式。

Abstract: Generative models for Image Super-Resolution (SR) are increasingly powerful,
yet their reliance on self-attention's quadratic complexity (O(N^2)) creates a
major computational bottleneck. Linear Attention offers an O(N) solution, but
its promise for photorealistic SR has remained largely untapped, historically
hindered by a cascade of interrelated and previously unsolved challenges. This
paper introduces LinearSR, a holistic framework that, for the first time,
systematically overcomes these critical hurdles. Specifically, we resolve a
fundamental, training instability that causes catastrophic model divergence
using our novel "knee point"-based Early-Stopping Guided Fine-tuning (ESGF)
strategy. Furthermore, we mitigate the classic perception-distortion trade-off
with a dedicated SNR-based Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture. Finally, we
establish an effective and lightweight guidance paradigm, TAG, derived from our
"precision-over-volume" principle. Our resulting LinearSR model simultaneously
delivers state-of-the-art perceptual quality with exceptional efficiency. Its
core diffusion forward pass (1-NFE) achieves SOTA-level speed, while its
overall multi-step inference time remains highly competitive. This work
provides the first robust methodology for applying Linear Attention in the
photorealistic SR domain, establishing a foundational paradigm for future
research in efficient generative super-resolution.

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于计算机视觉的无监督关键帧提取管道，用于新西兰濒危鹦鹉kākā的个体识别和重识别，替代传统侵入性标记方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统野生动物监测方法（如鸟类腿环标记）耗时且具有侵入性，需要开发非侵入、高效的AI解决方案来改进种群监测。

Method: 结合YOLO和Grounding DINO进行目标检测，使用光流模糊检测、DINOv2图像编码和聚类方法，从定制喂食器的视频中提取代表性关键帧。

Result: 所提出的关键帧选择方法在kākā重识别任务中实现了高准确率，为在更复杂环境中收集的媒体数据研究奠定了基础。

Conclusion: 这种基于AI和计算机视觉的非侵入性方法为野生动物个体识别提供了有价值的替代方案，有助于开发生态学和保护生物学中的新监测方法。

Abstract: Accurate recognition and re-identification of individual animals is essential
for successful wildlife population monitoring. Traditional methods, such as leg
banding of birds, are time consuming and invasive. Recent progress in
artificial intelligence, particularly computer vision, offers encouraging
solutions for smart conservation and efficient automation. This study presents
a unique pipeline for extracting high-quality key frames from videos of
k\={a}k\={a} (Nestor meridionalis), a threatened forest-dwelling parrot in New
Zealand. Key frame extraction is well-studied in person re-identification,
however, its application to wildlife is limited. Using video recordings at a
custom-built feeder, we extract key frames and evaluate the re-identification
performance of our pipeline. Our unsupervised methodology combines object
detection using YOLO and Grounding DINO, optical flow blur detection, image
encoding with DINOv2, and clustering methods to identify representative key
frames. The results indicate that our proposed key frame selection methods
yield image collections which achieve high accuracy in k\={a}k\={a}
re-identification, providing a foundation for future research using media
collected in more diverse and challenging environments. Through the use of
artificial intelligence and computer vision, our non-invasive and efficient
approach provides a valuable alternative to traditional physical tagging
methods for recognising k\={a}k\={a} individuals and therefore improving the
monitoring of populations. This research contributes to developing fresh
approaches in wildlife monitoring, with applications in ecology and
conservation biology.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Q-Router是一个用于通用视频质量评估的智能框架，通过多层级模型路由系统动态选择专家模型，解决了现有VQA模型泛化性差、可解释性有限和扩展性不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VQA模型在直接分数监督训练下存在泛化性差、可解释性有限、缺乏扩展性等问题，无法适应多样化的视频内容和任务需求。

Method: 采用多层级路由系统，集成多种专家模型，使用视觉-语言模型作为实时路由器，根据输入视频语义动态推理并集成最合适的专家模型，包括用于可解释性的时空伪影定位。

Result: Q-Router在各种基准测试中达到或超越了最先进的VQA模型性能，显著提高了泛化性和可解释性，在Q-Bench-Video基准上表现优异，并能有效定位时空伪影。

Conclusion: Q-Router展示了作为下一代VQA系统基础的潜力，能够有效结合专家模型的互补优势，在异构视频源和任务中提供灵活且稳健的性能。

Abstract: Video quality assessment (VQA) is a fundamental computer vision task that
aims to predict the perceptual quality of a given video in alignment with human
judgments. Existing performant VQA models trained with direct score supervision
suffer from (1) poor generalization across diverse content and tasks, ranging
from user-generated content (UGC), short-form videos, to AI-generated content
(AIGC), (2) limited interpretability, and (3) lack of extensibility to novel
use cases or content types. We propose Q-Router, an agentic framework for
universal VQA with a multi-tier model routing system. Q-Router integrates a
diverse set of expert models and employs vision--language models (VLMs) as
real-time routers that dynamically reason and then ensemble the most
appropriate experts conditioned on the input video semantics. We build a
multi-tiered routing system based on the computing budget, with the heaviest
tier involving a specific spatiotemporal artifacts localization for
interpretability. This agentic design enables Q-Router to combine the
complementary strengths of specialized experts, achieving both flexibility and
robustness in delivering consistent performance across heterogeneous video
sources and tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Q-Router matches or
surpasses state-of-the-art VQA models on a variety of benchmarks, while
substantially improving generalization and interpretability. Moreover, Q-Router
excels on the quality-based question answering benchmark, Q-Bench-Video,
highlighting its promise as a foundation for next-generation VQA systems.
Finally, we show that Q-Router capably localizes spatiotemporal artifacts,
showing potential as a reward function for post-training video generation
models.

TL;DR: 提出一个解决医学视觉问答挑战的框架，包含三个关键贡献：统一的多层次模态对齐、硬负样本挖掘方法和门控交叉注意力模块。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Med-VQA方法在模态对齐、硬负样本处理和知识融合方面存在不足，需要统一的解决方案。

Method: 使用对比学习和最优传输理论实现多层次模态对齐；采用软标签进行硬负样本挖掘；设计门控交叉注意力模块整合答案词汇知识。

Result: 在RAD-VQA、SLAKE、PathVQA和VQA-2019等常用Med-VQA数据集上超越了之前的最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该框架通过统一模态对齐、硬负样本挖掘和知识选择机制，显著提升了医学视觉问答的性能。

Abstract: Medical Visual Question Answering (Med-VQA) is a challenging task that
requires a deep understanding of both medical images and textual questions.
Although recent works leveraging Medical Vision-Language Pre-training (Med-VLP)
have shown strong performance on the Med-VQA task, there is still no unified
solution for modality alignment, and the issue of hard negatives remains
under-explored. Additionally, commonly used knowledge fusion techniques for
Med-VQA may introduce irrelevant information. In this work, we propose a
framework to address these challenges through three key contributions: (1) a
unified solution for heterogeneous modality alignments across multiple levels,
modalities, views, and stages, leveraging methods like contrastive learning and
optimal transport theory; (2) a hard negative mining method that employs soft
labels for multi-modality alignments and enforces the hard negative pair
discrimination; and (3) a Gated Cross-Attention Module for Med-VQA that
integrates the answer vocabulary as prior knowledge and selects relevant
information from it. Our framework outperforms the previous state-of-the-art on
widely used Med-VQA datasets like RAD-VQA, SLAKE, PathVQA and VQA-2019.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SkipSR是一个加速视频超分辨率的方法，通过识别低细节区域并跳过这些区域的计算，只对需要细化的区域进行超分辨率处理，在保持感知质量的同时显著减少计算量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于扩散的超分辨率方法在处理视频时计算成本高且速度慢，限制了向更高分辨率和更长视频的扩展。许多视频区域本身细节较少，从细化中获益有限，但现有方法对所有像素进行统一处理。

Method: 提出SkipSR框架，直接从低分辨率输入中识别低细节区域，然后完全跳过这些区域的计算，只对需要细化的区域进行超分辨率处理。

Result: 在标准超分辨率基准测试中，该方法在720p视频上比现有模型端到端延迟减少高达60%，且没有可感知的质量损失。

Conclusion: SkipSR通过选择性处理策略，在保持感知质量的同时显著加速视频超分辨率处理，为高分辨率长视频处理提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion-based super-resolution (SR) is a key component in video generation
and video restoration, but is slow and expensive, limiting scalability to
higher resolutions and longer videos. Our key insight is that many regions in
video are inherently low-detail and gain little from refinement, yet current
methods process all pixels uniformly. To take advantage of this, we propose
SkipSR, a simple framework for accelerating video SR by identifying low-detail
regions directly from low-resolution input, then skipping computation on them
entirely, only super-resolving the areas that require refinement. This simple
yet effective strategy preserves perceptual quality in both standard and
one-step diffusion SR models while significantly reducing computation. In
standard SR benchmarks, our method achieves up to 60% faster end-to-end latency
than prior models on 720p videos with no perceptible loss in quality. Video
demos are available at https://rccchoudhury.github.io/skipsr/

TL;DR: D-CoDe是一个无需训练的适配框架，通过动态压缩和问题分解解决图像预训练视觉语言模型在视频理解中的感知瓶颈和令牌过载问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将图像预训练的视觉语言模型扩展到视频领域面临感知瓶颈和令牌过载的挑战，因为视频包含密集且时间延长的视觉输入，超出了图像模型的处理能力。

Method: 提出动态压缩（自适应选择代表性帧和内容感知的空间令牌聚合）和问题分解（将原始查询重新表述为子问题）两种训练免费的技术。

Result: 实验表明D-CoDe在各种基准测试中有效提升了视频理解能力，在具有挑战性的长视频基准上表现出色。

Conclusion: D-CoDe框架能够有效处理复杂的视频语言任务，展示了在视频理解领域的潜力。

Abstract: Video large language models (Vid-LLMs), which excel in diverse video-language
tasks, can be effectively constructed by adapting image-pretrained
vision-language models (VLMs). However, this adaptation remains challenging, as
it requires processing dense and temporally extended visual inputs that exceed
the capacity of image-based models. This paper identifies the perception
bottleneck and token overload as key challenges in extending image-based VLMs
to the video domain. To address these issues, we propose D-CoDe, a
training-free adaptation framework that incorporates dynamic compression and
question decomposition. Specifically, dynamic compression alleviates the
perception bottleneck through adaptive selection of representative frames and
content-aware aggregation of spatial tokens, thereby reducing redundancy while
preserving informative content. In parallel, question decomposition mitigates
token overload by reformulating the original query into sub-questions, guiding
the model to focus on distinct aspects of the video and enabling more
comprehensive understanding. Experiments demonstrate that D-CoDe effectively
improves video understanding across various benchmarks. Furthermore, strong
performance on the challenging long-video benchmark highlights the potential of
D-CoDe in handling complex video-language tasks. Code is available at

TL;DR: 提出FOLK方法，通过标签引导的知识蒸馏实现快速开放词汇3D实例分割，避免2D映射的噪声问题并大幅提升推理速度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将3D实例映射到2D图像进行分类，但会引入2D遮挡噪声且计算和内存成本高，推理速度慢

Method: 设计教师模型提取高质量实例嵌入，通过标签引导蒸馏算法将开放词汇知识蒸馏到3D学生模型中

Result: 在ScanNet200数据集上达到35.7的AP50分数，比之前方法快6.0倍到152.2倍

Conclusion: FOLK方法在保持高性能的同时显著加速推理过程，为开放词汇3D实例分割提供了高效解决方案

Abstract: Open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation seeks to segment and classify
instances beyond the annotated label space. Existing methods typically map 3D
instances to 2D RGB-D images, and then employ vision-language models (VLMs) for
classification. However, such a mapping strategy usually introduces noise from
2D occlusions and incurs substantial computational and memory costs during
inference, slowing down the inference speed. To address the above problems, we
propose a Fast Open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation method via Label-guided
Knowledge distillation (FOLK). Our core idea is to design a teacher model that
extracts high-quality instance embeddings and distills its open-vocabulary
knowledge into a 3D student model. In this way, during inference, the distilled
3D model can directly classify instances from the 3D point cloud, avoiding
noise caused by occlusions and significantly accelerating the inference
process. Specifically, we first design a teacher model to generate a 2D CLIP
embedding for each 3D instance, incorporating both visibility and viewpoint
diversity, which serves as the learning target for distillation. We then
develop a 3D student model that directly produces a 3D embedding for each 3D
instance. During training, we propose a label-guided distillation algorithm to
distill open-vocabulary knowledge from label-consistent 2D embeddings into the
student model. FOLK conducted experiments on the ScanNet200 and Replica
datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the ScanNet200 dataset with
an AP50 score of 35.7, while running approximately 6.0x to 152.2x faster than
previous methods. All codes will be released after the paper is accepted.

Conclusion: 该方法通用性强，可应用于其他作物和场景，解决了传统监测方法效率低和深度学习需要大量标注的问题。

Abstract: Change monitoring is an essential task for cranberry farming as it provides
both breeders and growers with the ability to analyze growth, predict yield,
and make treatment decisions. However, this task is often done manually,
requiring significant time on the part of a cranberry grower or breeder. Deep
learning based change monitoring holds promise, despite the caveat of
hard-to-interpret high dimensional features and hand-annotations for
fine-tuning. To address this gap, we introduce a method for modeling crop
growth based on fine-tuning vision transformers (ViTs) using a self-supervised
approach that avoids tedious image annotations. We use a two-fold pretext task
(time regression and class prediction) to learn a latent space for the
time-lapse evolution of plant and fruit appearance. The resulting 2D temporal
tracks provide an interpretable time-series model of crop growth that can be
used to: 1) predict growth over time and 2) distinguish temporal differences of
cranberry varieties. We also provide a novel time-lapse dataset of cranberry
fruit featuring eight distinct varieties, observed 52 times over the growing
season (span of around four months), annotated with information about fungicide
application, yield, and rot. Our approach is general and can be applied to
other crops and applications (code and dataset can be found at https://github.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PHyCLIP提出了一种在双曲空间乘积上使用ℓ₁乘积度量的方法，同时捕捉概念族内的层次结构和跨概念族的组合性，在多项任务中优于现有单空间方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型难以同时表达概念族内的层次结构（如狗⊆哺乳动物⊆动物）和跨概念族的组合性（如"汽车里的狗"⊆狗,汽车），双曲空间虽能有效捕捉层次结构但组合性表示能力不明确。

Method: 采用双曲因子笛卡尔积上的ℓ₁乘积度量，让概念族内层次结构在单个双曲因子中形成，跨概念族组合通过ℓ₁乘积度量捕捉，类似于布尔代数。

Result: 在零样本分类、检索、层次分类和组合理解任务上的实验表明，PHyCLIP优于现有单空间方法，并在嵌入空间中提供更可解释的结构。

Conclusion: PHyCLIP通过双曲空间乘积和ℓ₁乘积度量的设计，成功解决了同时表示层次结构和组合性的挑战，为多模态表示学习提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-language models have achieved remarkable success in multi-modal
representation learning from large-scale pairs of visual scenes and linguistic
descriptions. However, they still struggle to simultaneously express two
distinct types of semantic structures: the hierarchy within a concept family
(e.g., dog $\preceq$ mammal $\preceq$ animal) and the compositionality across
different concept families (e.g., "a dog in a car" $\preceq$ dog, car). Recent
works have addressed this challenge by employing hyperbolic space, which
efficiently captures tree-like hierarchy, yet its suitability for representing
compositionality remains unclear. To resolve this dilemma, we propose PHyCLIP,
which employs an $\ell_1$-Product metric on a Cartesian product of Hyperbolic
factors. With our design, intra-family hierarchies emerge within individual
hyperbolic factors, and cross-family composition is captured by the
$\ell_1$-product metric, analogous to a Boolean algebra. Experiments on
zero-shot classification, retrieval, hierarchical classification, and
compositional understanding tasks demonstrate that PHyCLIP outperforms existing
single-space approaches and offers more interpretable structures in the
embedding space.

TL;DR: 提出SegTrans框架，通过将输入样本划分为多个局部区域并重新映射语义信息来生成增强样本，从而提高对抗样本在不同分割模型间的可迁移性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分割模型在白盒设置下对对抗样本具有显著脆弱性，但现有攻击方法在不同分割模型间的迁移性较差。复杂上下文依赖性和特征分布差距导致迁移成功率不理想。

Method: 将输入样本划分为多个局部区域，重新映射语义信息生成多样化增强样本，用这些样本替代原始样本进行扰动优化，仅保留局部语义信息而非全局信息。

Result: 在PASCAL VOC和Cityscapes两个基准数据集、四个分割模型和三个骨干网络上实验表明，SegTrans显著提高了对抗迁移成功率，平均提升8.55%，计算效率提升超过100%。

Conclusion: SegTrans框架有效解决了分割模型对抗攻击的迁移性问题，在不增加计算开销的情况下显著提高了攻击成功率和效率。

Abstract: Segmentation models exhibit significant vulnerability to adversarial examples
in white-box settings, but existing adversarial attack methods often show poor
transferability across different segmentation models. While some researchers
have explored transfer-based adversarial attack (i.e., transfer attack) methods
for segmentation models, the complex contextual dependencies within these
models and the feature distribution gaps between surrogate and target models
result in unsatisfactory transfer success rates. To address these issues, we
propose SegTrans, a novel transfer attack framework that divides the input
sample into multiple local regions and remaps their semantic information to
generate diverse enhanced samples. These enhanced samples replace the original
ones for perturbation optimization, thereby improving the transferability of
adversarial examples across different segmentation models. Unlike existing
methods, SegTrans only retains local semantic information from the original
input, rather than using global semantic information to optimize perturbations.
Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets, PASCAL VOC and Cityscapes,
four different segmentation models, and three backbone networks show that
SegTrans significantly improves adversarial transfer success rates without
introducing additional computational overhead. Compared to the current
state-of-the-art methods, SegTrans achieves an average increase of 8.55% in
transfer attack success rate and improves computational efficiency by more than
100%.

TL;DR: 提出了ASVP防御方法，通过奇异值分解扰动图像恢复模型的内部特征图，有效阻止知识蒸馏攻击，同时保持教师模型的输出质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 知识蒸馏攻击威胁深度模型知识产权，现有分类任务的防御方法难以直接应用于图像恢复任务，因为恢复任务是生成式任务，需要保持空间一致性和细节完整性。

Method: 使用自适应奇异值扰动(ASVP)，对教师模型的内部特征图进行奇异值分解，放大前k个奇异值来注入结构化高频扰动，破坏蒸馏所需的对齐性。

Result: 在五个图像恢复任务中测试，ASVP可将学生模型的PSNR降低高达4dB，SSIM降低60-75%，而对教师模型性能影响可忽略。

Conclusion: ASVP为保护开源图像恢复模型免受未经授权的知识蒸馏提供了实用解决方案，相比现有方法提供更强且更一致的防御效果。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) attacks pose a significant threat to deep model
intellectual property by enabling adversaries to train student networks using a
teacher model's outputs. While recent defenses in image classification have
successfully disrupted KD by perturbing output probabilities, extending these
methods to image restoration is difficult. Unlike classification, restoration
is a generative task with continuous, high-dimensional outputs that depend on
spatial coherence and fine details. Minor perturbations are often insufficient,
as students can still learn the underlying mapping.To address this, we propose
Adaptive Singular Value Perturbation (ASVP), a runtime defense tailored for
image restoration models. ASVP operates on internal feature maps of the teacher
using singular value decomposition (SVD). It amplifies the topk singular values
to inject structured, high-frequency perturbations, disrupting the alignment
needed for distillation. This hinders student learning while preserving the
teacher's output quality.We evaluate ASVP across five image restoration tasks:
super-resolution, low-light enhancement, underwater enhancement, dehazing, and
deraining. Experiments show ASVP reduces student PSNR by up to 4 dB and SSIM by
60-75%, with negligible impact on the teacher's performance. Compared to prior
methods, ASVP offers a stronger and more consistent defense.Our approach
provides a practical solution to protect open-source restoration models from
unauthorized knowledge distillation.

TL;DR: 提出了首个评估多模态大语言模型在动态分布外反事实视频测试集上鲁棒性的基准Ro-Bench，发现当前模型在反事实视频内容上性能显著下降，而使用反事实数据微调可显著提升模型鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在视频理解任务中表现出色，但其在面对被操纵视频内容时的鲁棒性尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 构建Ro-Bench基准，通过编辑风格、物体、背景及其组合来创建高质量、多样且时间相关的反事实视频数据，评估8个最新视频MLLMs。

Result: 当前模型在反事实视频内容上表现出显著性能下降，使用反事实数据微调可使Ro-Bench性能提升21.73%，在MVBench数据集的20个任务上提升12.78%。

Conclusion: 反事实数据能有效增强MLLMs的视频理解能力，强调了评估和提升模型鲁棒性的重要性。

Abstract: Recently, Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
significant performance across various video understanding tasks. However,
their robustness, particularly when faced with manipulated video content,
remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce Ro-Bench, the first
benchmark for evaluating MLLMs on dynamic out-of-distribution (OOD)
counterfactual video test sets. Ro-Bench incorporates high-quality, diverse and
temporally relevant video data, by editing Style, Object, Background and their
compositions. We evaluated eight recent video MLLMs and found that current
models exhibit substantial performance degradation on Ro-Bench when exposed to
counterfactual video content. Furthermore, we demonstrate that fine-tuning
MLLMs with counterfactual data enhances robustness, achieving a 21.73%
performance increase on Ro-Bench and a 12.78% improvement across 20 tasks in
the MVBench dataset. These findings underscore the effectiveness of
counterfactual data in enhancing the video understanding ability of MLLMs. The
code and data will be released shortly.

Motivation: 解决农业监测系统中无人机动物健康监测面临的数据稀缺问题，特别是针对特定农场条件下动物品种、环境和行为变化导致的场景特异性挑战。

Method: 开发对象聚焦数据增强框架，包括动物背景分割、变换增强和基于扩散模型的合成技术，生成真实多样的场景数据。

Result: 初步实验表明，增强数据集在动物检测任务上相比基线模型表现更优。

Conclusion: 该方法通过生成领域特定数据，能够在数据稀缺场景下实现实时动物健康监测，弥合有限数据与实际应用之间的差距。

Abstract: Modern agricultural operations increasingly rely on integrated monitoring
systems that combine multiple data sources for farm optimization. Aerial
drone-based animal health monitoring serves as a key component but faces
limited data availability, compounded by scene-specific issues such as small,
occluded, or partially visible animals. Transfer learning approaches often fail
to address this limitation due to the unavailability of large datasets that
reflect specific farm conditions, including variations in animal breeds,
environments, and behaviors. Therefore, there is a need for developing a
problem-specific, animal-focused data augmentation strategy tailored to these
unique challenges. To address this gap, we propose an object-focused data
augmentation framework designed explicitly for animal health monitoring in
constrained data settings. Our approach segments animals from backgrounds and
augments them through transformations and diffusion-based synthesis to create
realistic, diverse scenes that enhance animal detection and monitoring
performance. Our initial experiments demonstrate that our augmented dataset
yields superior performance compared to our baseline models on the animal
detection task. By generating domain-specific data, our method empowers
real-time animal health monitoring solutions even in data-scarce scenarios,
bridging the gap between limited data and practical applicability.

TL;DR: 提出了Perception-Time Scaling (PTS)新范式，通过分解复杂感知问题为中间子问题，显著提升大视觉语言模型的视觉感知精度，在DisTANCE基准上从8.0%提升到64.7%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理时间缩放方法在视觉感知任务中效果有限，因为当前LVLMs采用快速感知范式，将视觉理解视为一次性输出而未建模底层感知过程。

Method: 提出PTS范式，鼓励token丰富的感知，将复杂感知问题分解为可处理的中间子问题，结合强化学习技术。

Result: PTS显著提升感知精度，在DisTANCE基准上高精度性能从8.0%提升到64.7%，在领域外任务上泛化良好，即使使用纯合成数据也能提升数学推理和真实世界感知性能。

Conclusion: PTS通过引入更多感知相关token和增加对图像token的关注，使感知能够与推理时间缩放对齐并从中受益。

Abstract: Recent advances in inference-time scaling, particularly those leveraging
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards, have substantially enhanced the
reasoning capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Inspired by
this success, similar strategies have been applied to multimodal reasoning, yet
their impact on visual perception remains unclear. To investigate this gap, we
introduce DisTANCE, a perception-centric benchmark for visual estimation tasks.
Evaluation results show that LVLMs exhibit limited estimation precision, and
inference-time scaling offers only marginal gains. We attribute this to the
fast perception paradigm of current LVLMs, where visual understanding is
treated as a one-shot output without modeling the underlying perceptual
process. To address this, we propose Perception-Time Scaling (PTS), a novel
paradigm that encourages token-rich perception and decomposes complex
perception problems into intermediate tractable sub-problems, thereby enabling
perception to align with and benefit from inference-time scaling. Combined with
reinforcement learning techniques, PTS significantly improves perception
accuracy, raising high-precision performance on DisTANCE from 8.0% to 64.7%,
and generalizes well to out-of-domain tasks. Surprisingly, even though PTS data
are purely synthetic, combining them with math reasoning data yields consistent
gains in both reasoning and real-world perception benchmarks. Further analysis
reveals that PTS introduces more perception-related tokens and increases the
model's attention to image tokens. Our code and data will be publicly released.

TL;DR: mmJoints框架通过为预训练的毫米波3D姿态估计器输出添加关节描述符，显式地处理模型对统计先验的过度依赖问题，从而提高下游任务的准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在毫米波姿态估计中，稀疏信号和弱反射导致模型过度依赖统计先验而非传感器数据来推断关节位置，这会降低下游任务（如手势和活动识别）的性能。

Method: 引入mmJoints框架，为预训练的黑盒毫米波3D姿态估计器输出添加额外的关节描述符，包括估计关节被感知的可能性和预测位置的可靠性。

Result: 在13种姿态估计设置下使用超过115,000个信号帧进行评估，mmJoints估计描述符的错误率低于4.2%，关节位置精度提高达12.5%，活动识别性能提升达16%。

Conclusion: mmJoints通过显式地处理模型偏差，不仅提高了姿态估计的可解释性，还显著提升了关节位置精度和下游任务性能。

Abstract: In mmWave-based pose estimation, sparse signals and weak reflections often
cause models to infer body joints from statistical priors rather than sensor
data. While prior knowledge helps in learning meaningful representations,
over-reliance on it degrades performance in downstream tasks like gesture and
activity recognition. In this paper, we introduce mmJoints, a framework that
augments a pre-trained, black-box mmWave-based 3D pose estimator's output with
additional joint descriptors. Rather than mitigating bias, mmJoints makes it
explicit by estimating the likelihood of a joint being sensed and the
reliability of its predicted location. These descriptors enhance
interpretability and improve downstream task accuracy. Through extensive
evaluations using over 115,000 signal frames across 13 pose estimation
settings, we show that mmJoints estimates descriptors with an error rate below
4.2%. mmJoints also improves joint position accuracy by up to 12.5% and boosts
activity recognition by up to 16% over state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 传统检索方法精度有限，现有多向量检索方法虽然通过分解查询和图像分割提高了精度，但仍存在查询与不同图像对象对齐不佳以及细粒度图像片段冗余的问题。

Method: 提出分层多粒度检索框架：1）使用多个中间粒度来增强查询与不同图像对象的对齐；2）利用跨层次相似性一致性和层次稀疏性来减少冗余匹配计算；3）自动为每个数据集配置参数以适应不同场景。

Result: 实验表明，HiMIR不仅显著提高了检索精度，而且相比现有多向量检索系统减少了高达3.5倍的计算量。

Conclusion: HiMIR框架通过分层多粒度对齐和高效调度机制，在保持高精度的同时大幅提升了多模态图像检索的效率，具有很好的实用性。

Abstract: To effectively leverage user-specific data, retrieval augmented generation
(RAG) is employed in multimodal large language model (MLLM) applications.
However, conventional retrieval approaches often suffer from limited retrieval
accuracy. Recent advances in multi-vector retrieval (MVR) improve accuracy by
decomposing queries and matching against segmented images. They still suffer
from sub-optimal accuracy and efficiency, overlooking alignment between the
query and varying image objects and redundant fine-grained image segments. In
this work, we present an efficient scheduling framework for image retrieval -
HiMIR. First, we introduce a novel hierarchical paradigm, employing multiple
intermediate granularities for varying image objects to enhance alignment.
Second, we minimize redundancy in retrieval by leveraging cross-hierarchy
similarity consistency and hierarchy sparsity to minimize unnecessary matching
computation. Furthermore, we configure parameters for each dataset
automatically for practicality across diverse scenarios. Our empirical study
shows that, HiMIR not only achieves substantial accuracy improvements but also
reduces computation by up to 3.5 times over the existing MVR system.

TL;DR: 提出了首个针对生成图像中手部区域的质量评估任务HandEval，通过HandPair数据集训练，利用MLLM和手部关键点先验知识，在多种下游应用中显著提升生成手部真实性和AIGC检测准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到图像模型在复杂局部区域（特别是人手）的细节生成仍存在结构扭曲和不真实纹理问题，而手部质量评估被忽视，限制了人中心生成质量优化和AIGC检测等下游任务性能。

Method: 构建HandPair数据集（48k高-低质量手部图像对），开发HandEval模型，结合多模态大语言模型的视觉理解能力和手部关键点先验知识，构建人工标注测试集进行验证。

Result: HandEval比现有SOTA方法更符合人类判断，集成到图像生成和AIGC检测流程中分别显著提升了生成手部真实性和检测准确率。

Conclusion: 提出的手部质量评估任务和HandEval模型在下游应用中具有普遍有效性，为提升生成图像质量和AIGC检测性能提供了新解决方案。

Abstract: Although recent text-to-image (T2I) models have significantly improved the
overall visual quality of generated images, they still struggle in the
generation of accurate details in complex local regions, especially human
hands. Generated hands often exhibit structural distortions and unrealistic
textures, which can be very noticeable even when the rest of the body is
well-generated. However, the quality assessment of hand regions remains largely
neglected, limiting downstream task performance like human-centric generation
quality optimization and AIGC detection. To address this, we propose the first
quality assessment task targeting generated hand regions and showcase its
abundant downstream applications. We first introduce the HandPair dataset for
training hand quality assessment models. It consists of 48k images formed by
high- and low-quality hand pairs, enabling low-cost, efficient supervision
without manual annotation. Based on it, we develop HandEval, a carefully
designed hand-specific quality assessment model. It leverages the powerful
visual understanding capability of Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) and
incorporates prior knowledge of hand keypoints, gaining strong perception of
hand quality. We further construct a human-annotated test set with hand images
from various state-of-the-art (SOTA) T2I models to validate its quality
evaluation capability. Results show that HandEval aligns better with human
judgments than existing SOTA methods. Furthermore, we integrate HandEval into
image generation and AIGC detection pipelines, prominently enhancing generated
hand realism and detection accuracy, respectively, confirming its universal
effectiveness in downstream applications. Code and dataset will be available.

Motivation: AI着色技术存在版权侵权风险，如未经授权对黑白漫画和电影进行着色并转售，但目前缺乏有效的防护方法。

Method: 提出Perception-Aware Chroma-Restrictive Perturbation (PAChroma)方法，通过拉普拉斯滤波器优化不可察觉的扰动，并在优化过程中应用多样化输入变换以增强跨模型迁移性和鲁棒性。

Result: 在ImageNet和Danbooru数据集上的实验表明，PAChroma能有效降低着色质量，同时保持视觉外观不变。

Conclusion: 这是保护视觉内容免受非法AI着色的首个防御方法，为生成媒体中的版权保护开辟了新途径。

Abstract: AI-based colorization has shown remarkable capability in generating realistic
color images from grayscale inputs. However, it poses risks of copyright
infringement -- for example, the unauthorized colorization and resale of
monochrome manga and films. Despite these concerns, no effective method
currently exists to prevent such misuse. To address this, we introduce the
first defensive paradigm, Uncolorable Examples, which embed imperceptible
perturbations into grayscale images to invalidate unauthorized colorization. To
ensure real-world applicability, we establish four criteria: effectiveness,
imperceptibility, transferability, and robustness. Our method, Perception-Aware
Chroma-Restrictive Perturbation (PAChroma), generates Uncolorable Examples that
meet these four criteria by optimizing imperceptible perturbations with a
Laplacian filter to preserve perceptual quality, and applying diverse input
transformations during optimization to enhance transferability across models
and robustness against common post-processing (e.g., compression). Experiments
on ImageNet and Danbooru datasets demonstrate that PAChroma effectively
degrades colorization quality while maintaining the visual appearance. This
work marks the first step toward protecting visual content from illegitimate AI
colorization, paving the way for copyright-aware defenses in generative media.

Motivation: 自回归文本到图像模型由于顺序token解码过程导致推理速度缓慢，需要数千次模型前向传递才能生成单张图像，需要解决这种效率低下的问题。

Method: 引入next-clean-token预测范式，通过低成本微调使预训练自回归模型能够接受噪声扰动token嵌入并预测下一个干净token；在推理时使用高斯噪声初始化token序列，在嵌入空间进行迭代的next-clean-token预测，采用概率标准并行验证和接受多个token。

Result: 实验表明该方法能够通过减少模型前向传递次数来加速生成，同时保持生成图像的视觉质量。

Conclusion: SJD2框架成功地将去噪过程与Jacobi迭代相结合，实现了自回归模型的并行token生成，在保持生成质量的同时显著提升了推理效率。

Abstract: As a new paradigm of visual content generation, autoregressive text-to-image
models suffer from slow inference due to their sequential token-by-token
decoding process, often requiring thousands of model forward passes to generate
a single image. To address this inefficiency, we propose Speculative
Jacobi-Denoising Decoding (SJD2), a framework that incorporates the denoising
process into Jacobi iterations to enable parallel token generation in
autoregressive models. Our method introduces a next-clean-token prediction
paradigm that enables the pre-trained autoregressive models to accept
noise-perturbed token embeddings and predict the next clean tokens through
low-cost fine-tuning. This denoising paradigm guides the model towards more
stable Jacobi trajectories. During inference, our method initializes token
sequences with Gaussian noise and performs iterative
next-clean-token-prediction in the embedding space. We employ a probabilistic
criterion to verify and accept multiple tokens in parallel, and refine the
unaccepted tokens for the next iteration with the denoising trajectory.
Experiments show that our method can accelerate generation by reducing model
forward passes while maintaining the visual quality of generated images.

Method: 使用对抗扰动识别不确定视觉标记，并在视觉编码器的中间层自注意力过程中掩码这些不确定标记，抑制其对视觉编码的影响

Result: 实验表明该方法显著减少了LVLMs中的物体幻觉，并能与其他现有技术协同工作

Conclusion: 视觉编码器中的不确定视觉标记是物体幻觉的重要来源，通过识别和掩码这些标记可以有效缓解幻觉问题

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs), which integrate a vision encoder (VE)
with a large language model, have achieved remarkable success across various
tasks. However, there are still crucial challenges in LVLMs such as object
hallucination, generating descriptions of objects that are not in the input
image. Here, we argue that uncertain visual tokens within the VE is a key
factor that contributes to object hallucination. Our statistical analysis found
that there are positive correlations between visual tokens with high epistemic
uncertainty and the occurrence of hallucinations. Furthermore, we show
theoretically and empirically that visual tokens in early VE layers that
exhibit large representation deviations under small adversarial perturbations
indicate high epistemic uncertainty. Based on these findings, we propose a
simple yet effective strategy to mitigate object hallucination by modifying the
VE only. Our method comprises a proxy method with adversarial perturbations for
identifying uncertain visual tokens efficiently and a method to mask these
uncertain visual tokens during the self-attention process in the middle layers
of the VE, suppressing their influence on visual encoding and thus alleviating
hallucinations. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly
reduces object hallucinations in LVLMs and can synergistically work with other
prior arts.

Abstract: In this work, we first revisit the sampling issues in current autoregressive
(AR) image generation models and identify that image tokens, unlike text
tokens, exhibit lower information density and non-uniform spatial distribution.
Accordingly, we present an entropy-informed decoding strategy that facilitates
higher autoregressive generation quality with faster synthesis speed.
Specifically, the proposed method introduces two main innovations: 1) dynamic
temperature control guided by spatial entropy of token distributions, enhancing
the balance between content diversity, alignment accuracy, and structural
coherence in both mask-based and scale-wise models, without extra computational
overhead, and 2) entropy-aware acceptance rules in speculative decoding,
achieving near-lossless generation at about 85\% of the inference cost of
conventional acceleration methods. Extensive experiments across multiple
benchmarks using diverse AR image generation models demonstrate the
effectiveness and generalizability of our approach in enhancing both generation
quality and sampling speed.

Method: 提出DuNe双视图框架，包含强弱分支，通过特征一致性约束和基于置信度过滤的交叉熵损失来处理噪声标签。

Result: 在10%对称标签噪声下，在SemanticKITTI、nuScenes和SemanticPOSS数据集上分别达到56.86%、42.28%和52.58%的mIoU，整体AM为49.57%，HM为48.50%。

Conclusion: DuNe框架在DGLSS-NL任务中表现出强大的领域泛化能力，为解决LiDAR分割中的噪声标签问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Accurate perception is critical for vehicle safety, with LiDAR as a key
enabler in autonomous driving. To ensure robust performance across
environments, sensor types, and weather conditions without costly
re-annotation, domain generalization in LiDAR-based 3D semantic segmentation is
essential. However, LiDAR annotations are often noisy due to sensor
imperfections, occlusions, and human errors. Such noise degrades segmentation
accuracy and is further amplified under domain shifts, threatening system
reliability. While noisy-label learning is well-studied in images, its
extension to 3D LiDAR segmentation under domain generalization remains largely
unexplored, as the sparse and irregular structure of point clouds limits direct
use of 2D methods. To address this gap, we introduce the novel task Domain
Generalization for LiDAR Semantic Segmentation under Noisy Labels (DGLSS-NL)
and establish the first benchmark by adapting three representative noisy-label
learning strategies from image classification to 3D segmentation. However, we
find that existing noisy-label learning approaches adapt poorly to LiDAR data.
We therefore propose DuNe, a dual-view framework with strong and weak branches
that enforce feature-level consistency and apply cross-entropy loss based on
confidence-aware filtering of predictions. Our approach shows state-of-the-art
performance by achieving 56.86% mIoU on SemanticKITTI, 42.28% on nuScenes, and
52.58% on SemanticPOSS under 10% symmetric label noise, with an overall
Arithmetic Mean (AM) of 49.57% and Harmonic Mean (HM) of 48.50%, thereby
demonstrating robust domain generalization in DGLSS-NL tasks. The code is

Abstract: Image-to-Image translation models can help mitigate various challenges
inherent to medical image acquisition. Latent diffusion models (LDMs) leverage
efficient learning in compressed latent space and constitute the core of
state-of-the-art generative image models. However, this efficiency comes with a
trade-off, potentially compromising crucial pixel-level detail essential for
high-fidelity medical images. This limitation becomes particularly critical
when generating clinically significant structures, such as lesions, which often
occupy only a small portion of the image. Failure to accurately reconstruct
these regions can severely impact diagnostic reliability and clinical
decision-making. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel post-training
framework for LDMs in medical image-to-image translation by incorporating
lesion-aware medical pixel space objectives. This approach is essential, as it
not only enhances overall image quality but also improves the precision of
lesion delineation. We evaluate our framework on brain CT-to-MRI translation in
acute ischemic stroke patients, where early and accurate diagnosis is critical
for optimal treatment selection and improved patient outcomes. While diffusion
MRI is the gold standard for stroke diagnosis, its clinical utility is often
constrained by high costs and low accessibility. Using a dataset of 817
patients, we demonstrate that our framework improves overall image quality and
enhances lesion delineation when synthesizing DWI and ADC images from CT
perfusion scans, outperforming existing image-to-image translation models.
Furthermore, our post-training strategy is easily adaptable to pre-trained LDMs
and exhibits substantial potential for broader applications across diverse
medical image translation tasks.

process should be monitored carefully. This paper develops an image-based
anomaly detection framework based on the microscopic cameras of the robotic FME
implantation system. The unified framework is utilized at four checkpoints to
check the micro-needle, FME probe, hooking result, and implantation point,
respectively. Exploiting the existing object localization results, the aligned
regions of interest (ROIs) are extracted from raw image and input to a
pretrained vision transformer (ViT). Considering the task specifications, we
propose a progressive granularity patch feature sampling method to address the
sensitivity-tolerance trade-off issue at different locations. Moreover, we
select a part of feature channels with higher signal-to-noise ratios from the
raw general ViT features, to provide better descriptors for each specific
scene. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is validated with the image
datasets collected from our implantation system.

*Weijia Wang,Yuanzhi Su,Pei-Gen Ye,Yuan-Gen Wang,Xuequan Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MambaH-Fit是一个基于状态空间建模的点云法向量估计框架，通过注意力驱动的层次特征融合和补丁级状态空间模型，有效建模细粒度几何结构，在精度、鲁棒性和灵活性方面优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有法向量估计方法在建模细粒度几何结构方面存在不足，限制了法向量预测的准确性。虽然Mamba等状态空间模型在点云处理中表现出色，但现有方法主要关注全局形状结构，对局部几何细节建模不足。

Method: 提出注意力驱动的层次特征融合方案自适应融合多尺度点云补丁特征，增强局部邻域的几何上下文学习；在此基础上提出补丁级状态空间模型，将点云补丁建模为隐式超曲面，通过状态动态实现细粒度几何理解。

Result: 在基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在精度、鲁棒性和灵活性方面优于现有方法。消融研究进一步验证了所提出组件的贡献。

Conclusion: MambaH-Fit通过有效的局部几何建模，显著提升了点云法向量估计的性能，为细粒度几何理解提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: We present MambaH-Fit, a state space modelling framework tailored for
hyper-surface fitting-based point cloud normal estimation. Existing normal
estimation methods often fall short in modelling fine-grained geometric
structures, thereby limiting the accuracy of the predicted normals. Recently,
state space models (SSMs), particularly Mamba, have demonstrated strong
modelling capability by capturing long-range dependencies with linear
complexity and inspired adaptations to point cloud processing. However,
existing Mamba-based approaches primarily focus on understanding global shape
structures, leaving the modelling of local, fine-grained geometric details
largely under-explored. To address the issues above, we first introduce an
Attention-driven Hierarchical Feature Fusion (AHFF) scheme to adaptively fuse
multi-scale point cloud patch features, significantly enhancing geometric
context learning in local point cloud neighbourhoods. Building upon this, we
further propose Patch-wise State Space Model (PSSM) that models point cloud
patches as implicit hyper-surfaces via state dynamics, enabling effective
fine-grained geometric understanding for normal prediction. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method outperforms existing
ones in terms of accuracy, robustness, and flexibility. Ablation studies
further validate the contribution of the proposed components.

TL;DR: 提出GL-DT框架和JPTrack算法，通过时空特征融合和全局-局部协同检测策略，解决无人机多目标跟踪中的小目标检测和轨迹连续性挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无人机在军事侦察、环境监测等领域的广泛应用对准确高效的多目标跟踪技术提出了迫切需求，但复杂背景、小尺度目标、频繁遮挡等问题持续挑战现有方法。

Method: 采用GL-DT框架，包含时空特征融合模块联合建模运动和外观特征，结合全局-局部协同检测策略增强小目标检测，并引入JPTrack跟踪算法。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法显著提高了多目标跟踪的连续性和稳定性，同时保持实时性能。

Conclusion: 该研究为无人机检测和跟踪技术的发展提供了有力支持。

Abstract: The extensive application of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in military
reconnaissance, environmental monitoring, and related domains has created an
urgent need for accurate and efficient multi-object tracking (MOT)
technologies, which are also essential for UAV situational awareness. However,
complex backgrounds, small-scale targets, and frequent occlusions and
interactions continue to challenge existing methods in terms of detection
accuracy and trajectory continuity. To address these issues, this paper
proposes the Global-Local Detection and Tracking (GL-DT) framework. It employs
a Spatio-Temporal Feature Fusion (STFF) module to jointly model motion and
appearance features, combined with a global-local collaborative detection
strategy, effectively enhancing small-target detection. Building upon this, the
JPTrack tracking algorithm is introduced to mitigate common issues such as ID
switches and trajectory fragmentation. Experimental results demonstrate that
the proposed approach significantly improves the continuity and stability of
MOT while maintaining real-time performance, providing strong support for the
advancement of UAV detection and tracking technologies.

*Mahdi Abavisani,Hamid Reza Vaezi Joze,Vishal M. Patel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过多模态知识训练单模态3D-CNN的方法，用于动态手势识别，通过跨模态语义对齐提升单模态网络性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常显式组合多模态信息，本文旨在将多模态知识嵌入到单个网络中，使每个单模态网络都能获得性能提升。

Method: 为每个模态分配独立网络，通过时空语义对齐损失(SSA)对齐不同网络特征内容，并使用焦点正则化参数避免负知识迁移。

Result: 实验结果表明该框架提高了单模态网络的测试时识别准确率，并在多个动态手势识别数据集上达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 提出的框架成功将多模态知识嵌入单模态网络，实现了无需显式多模态融合的改进性能。

Abstract: We present an efficient approach for leveraging the knowledge from multiple
modalities in training unimodal 3D convolutional neural networks (3D-CNNs) for
the task of dynamic hand gesture recognition. Instead of explicitly combining
multimodal information, which is commonplace in many state-of-the-art methods,
we propose a different framework in which we embed the knowledge of multiple
modalities in individual networks so that each unimodal network can achieve an
improved performance. In particular, we dedicate separate networks per
available modality and enforce them to collaborate and learn to develop
networks with common semantics and better representations. We introduce a
"spatiotemporal semantic alignment" loss (SSA) to align the content of the
features from different networks. In addition, we regularize this loss with our
proposed "focal regularization parameter" to avoid negative knowledge transfer.
Experimental results show that our framework improves the test time recognition
accuracy of unimodal networks, and provides the state-of-the-art performance on
various dynamic hand gesture recognition datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出Dense2MoE方法，将密集的扩散变换器转换为专家混合结构，在保持模型性能的同时减少60%的激活参数，为高效文本到图像生成建立了新范式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散变换器在文本到图像生成中表现出色，但参数规模大导致推理开销高。现有压缩方法主要是剪枝，但激进的剪枝会因模型容量减少而导致性能严重下降。

Method: 将DiT中的前馈网络替换为MoE层，减少FFN中62.5%的激活参数；提出混合块选择性地激活DiT块；设计多步蒸馏流程，包括基于泰勒度量的专家初始化、带负载平衡的知识蒸馏和MoB优化的组特征损失。

Result: 将大型扩散变换器转换为MoE结构，减少60%的激活参数，同时保持原始性能，在广泛实验中超越基于剪枝的方法。

Conclusion: Dense2MoE为高效文本到图像生成建立了新范式，通过结构化稀疏化在减少参数的同时保持模型容量。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformer (DiT) has demonstrated remarkable performance in
text-to-image generation; however, its large parameter size results in
substantial inference overhead. Existing parameter compression methods
primarily focus on pruning, but aggressive pruning often leads to severe
performance degradation due to reduced model capacity. To address this
limitation, we pioneer the transformation of a dense DiT into a Mixture of
Experts (MoE) for structured sparsification, reducing the number of activated
parameters while preserving model capacity. Specifically, we replace the
Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs) in DiT Blocks with MoE layers, reducing the number
of activated parameters in the FFNs by 62.5\%. Furthermore, we propose the
Mixture of Blocks (MoB) to selectively activate DiT blocks, thereby further
enhancing sparsity. To ensure an effective dense-to-MoE conversion, we design a
multi-step distillation pipeline, incorporating Taylor metric-based expert
initialization, knowledge distillation with load balancing, and group feature
loss for MoB optimization. We transform large diffusion transformers (e.g.,
FLUX.1 [dev]) into an MoE structure, reducing activated parameters by 60\%
while maintaining original performance and surpassing pruning-based approaches
in extensive experiments. Overall, Dense2MoE establishes a new paradigm for
efficient text-to-image generation.

Abstract: We present a transductive deep learning-based formulation for the sparse
representation-based classification (SRC) method. The proposed network consists
of a convolutional autoencoder along with a fully-connected layer. The role of
the autoencoder network is to learn robust deep features for classification. On
the other hand, the fully-connected layer, which is placed in between the
encoder and the decoder networks, is responsible for finding the sparse
representation. The estimated sparse codes are then used for classification.
Various experiments on three different datasets show that the proposed network
leads to sparse representations that give better classification results than
state-of-the-art SRC methods. The source code is available at:

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于COVID-19 CT图像诊断的多分支ConvNeXt架构，通过集成全局平均池化、全局最大池化和注意力加权池化三个分支，在验证集上取得了0.9937的ROC-AUC、0.9757的准确率和0.9825的F1分数，优于现有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学影像智能分析在辅助临床诊断中至关重要，特别是识别细微病理特征。本文针对医学图像分析的细微挑战，设计了专门的多分支ConvNeXt架构，虽然应用于COVID-19诊断，但方法可为多种病理分类提供通用框架。

Method: 采用端到端流程，包括精细数据预处理和增强，以及利用迁移学习的两阶段训练策略。架构独特地整合了三个并行分支的特征：全局平均池化、全局最大池化和新的注意力加权池化机制。在2,609个CT切片数据集上训练验证。

Abstract: Intelligent analysis of medical imaging plays a crucial role in assisting
clinical diagnosis, especially for identifying subtle pathological features.
This paper introduces a novel multi-branch ConvNeXt architecture designed
specifically for the nuanced challenges of medical image analysis. While
applied here to the specific problem of COVID-19 diagnosis, the methodology
offers a generalizable framework for classifying a wide range of pathologies
from CT scans. The proposed model incorporates a rigorous end-to-end pipeline,
from meticulous data preprocessing and augmentation to a disciplined two-phase
training strategy that leverages transfer learning effectively. The
architecture uniquely integrates features extracted from three parallel
branches: Global Average Pooling, Global Max Pooling, and a new
Attention-weighted Pooling mechanism. The model was trained and validated on a
combined dataset of 2,609 CT slices derived from two distinct datasets.
Experimental results demonstrate a superior performance on the validation set,
achieving a final ROC-AUC of 0.9937, a validation accuracy of 0.9757, and an
F1-score of 0.9825 for COVID-19 cases, outperforming all previously reported
models on this dataset. These findings indicate that a modern, multi-branch
architecture, coupled with careful data handling, can achieve performance
comparable to or exceeding contemporary state-of-the-art models, thereby
proving the efficacy of advanced deep learning techniques for robust medical
diagnostics.

TL;DR: SOS是一个简单可扩展的数据合成流水线，通过对象中心组合策略生成高质量的合成数据，在检测和视觉定位任务上超越大型真实图像数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉分组任务中大型标注数据集成本高、覆盖偏差且难以扩展的问题，以及合成数据缺乏灵活性、准确性和组合多样性的局限性。

Method: 基于对象中心组合策略，使用结构化布局先验和生成式重光照，将高质量合成对象片段粘贴到新图像中，生成准确多样的掩码、边界框和指代表达式。

Result: 在10万张合成图像上训练的模型在检测和定位任务上优于GRIT(2000万)和V3Det(20万)数据集，LVIS检测提升+10.9 AP，gRefCOCO定位提升+8.4 N_Acc。在有限真实数据场景下表现更佳。

Conclusion: SOS支持可控数据集构建，提升泛化能力，在低数据和封闭词汇设置下均有效，增强真实数据集可带来跨尺度的强性能表现。

Abstract: Visual grouping -- operationalized via instance segmentation, visual
grounding, and object detection -- underpins applications from robotic
perception to photo editing. Large annotated datasets are costly, biased in
coverage, and hard to scale. Synthetic data are promising but often lack
flexibility, accuracy, and compositional diversity.
  We present SOS, a simple and scalable data synthesis pipeline based on an
object-centric composition strategy. It pastes high-quality synthetic object
segments into new images using structured layout priors and generative
relighting, producing accurate and diverse masks, boxes, and referring
expressions. Models trained on 100000 synthetic images from SOS outperform
those trained on larger real-image datasets such as GRIT (20M) and V3Det (200K)
on detection and grounding tasks, achieving +10.9 AP on LVIS detection and +8.4
$N_{\text{Acc}}$ on gRefCOCO grounding. SOS enables controllable dataset
construction and improves generalization in both low-data and closed-vocabulary
settings. Augmenting LVIS and COCO with synthetic object segments yields strong
performance across real-data scales and even larger gains under extremely
limited real data (for example, +3.83 $AP_{\text{rare}}$ on LVIS instance
segmentation and +6.59 AP with a 1 percent COCO setup). This controllability
also supports targeted data generation for challenging intra-class referring in
visual grounding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种多模态语义扩散模型(MSDM)，用于生成细胞和细胞核分割的逼真图像-掩码对，通过整合形态学、颜色特征和元数据来解决标注数据稀缺问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算病理学中细胞和细胞核分割面临标注数据稀缺的挑战，特别是对于罕见或非典型形态。手动标注成本高昂，而合成数据提供了一种经济有效的替代方案。

Method: 使用多模态语义扩散模型(MSDM)，通过细胞/细胞核形态学(水平和垂直图)、RGB颜色特征和BERT编码的检测/指示元数据来条件化生成过程，通过多头交叉注意力整合这些异质模态。

Result: 定量分析显示合成图像与真实数据高度匹配，在匹配生物条件下生成图像与真实图像的嵌入具有低Wasserstein距离。合成样本显著提高了柱状细胞分割模型的准确性。

Conclusion: 多模态扩散增强策略有效提升了细胞和细胞核分割模型的鲁棒性和泛化能力，为生成模型在计算病理学中的广泛应用铺平了道路。

Abstract: Scarcity of annotated data, particularly for rare or atypical morphologies,
present significant challenges for cell and nuclei segmentation in
computational pathology. While manual annotation is labor-intensive and costly,
synthetic data offers a cost-effective alternative. We introduce a Multimodal
Semantic Diffusion Model (MSDM) for generating realistic pixel-precise
image-mask pairs for cell and nuclei segmentation. By conditioning the
generative process with cellular/nuclear morphologies (using horizontal and
vertical maps), RGB color characteristics, and BERT-encoded assay/indication
metadata, MSDM generates datasests with desired morphological properties. These
heterogeneous modalities are integrated via multi-head cross-attention,
enabling fine-grained control over the generated images. Quantitative analysis
demonstrates that synthetic images closely match real data, with low
Wasserstein distances between embeddings of generated and real images under
matching biological conditions. The incorporation of these synthetic samples,
exemplified by columnar cells, significantly improves segmentation model
accuracy on columnar cells. This strategy systematically enriches data sets,
directly targeting model deficiencies. We highlight the effectiveness of
multimodal diffusion-based augmentation for advancing the robustness and
generalizability of cell and nuclei segmentation models. Thereby, we pave the
way for broader application of generative models in computational pathology.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了PSepT（极坐标可分离变换），一种可分离的正交变换，克服了极坐标中的不可分离性障碍，显著降低了计算复杂度和内存需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的正交矩图像表示方法存在高计算复杂度和数值不稳定性的问题，特别是在大阶数时。Zernike和伪Zernike矩需要耦合的径向-角向处理，无法实现高效分解。

Method: 通过张量积构造离散余弦变换（DCT）径向基和傅里叶谐波角向基，实现完全核分解，使得径向和角向处理可以独立进行。

Result: 将计算复杂度从O(n³N²)到O(n⁶N²)降低到O(N² log N)，内存需求从O(N⁴)降低到O(N²)，条件数缩放从O(N⁴)改善到O(√N)。

Conclusion: PSepT在数值稳定性、计算效率和分类性能方面表现优异，同时保持精确重建，为高阶矩分析开辟了新的可能性。

Abstract: Orthogonal moment-based image representations are fundamental in computer
vision, but classical methods suffer from high computational complexity and
numerical instability at large orders. Zernike and pseudo-Zernike moments, for
instance, require coupled radial-angular processing that precludes efficient
factorization, resulting in $\mathcal{O}(n^3N^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(n^6N^2)$
complexity and $\mathcal{O}(N^4)$ condition number scaling for the $n$th-order
moments on an $N\times N$ image. We introduce \textbf{PSepT} (Polar Separable
Transform), a separable orthogonal transform that overcomes the
non-separability barrier in polar coordinates. PSepT achieves complete kernel
factorization via tensor-product construction of Discrete Cosine Transform
(DCT) radial bases and Fourier harmonic angular bases, enabling independent
radial and angular processing. This separable design reduces computational
complexity to $\mathcal{O}(N^2 \log N)$, memory requirements to
$\mathcal{O}(N^2)$, and condition number scaling to $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{N})$,
representing exponential improvements over polynomial approaches. PSepT
exhibits orthogonality, completeness, energy conservation, and
rotation-covariance properties. Experimental results demonstrate better
numerical stability, computational efficiency, and competitive classification
performance on structured datasets, while preserving exact reconstruction. The
separable framework enables high-order moment analysis previously infeasible
with classical methods, opening new possibilities for robust image analysis
applications.

Motivation: 深度神经网络通常被视为不透明系统，需要可解释性方法来提高信任度和问责性。现有方法通常将测试时预测归因于输入特征或训练样本，但认为这两种视角应联合研究

Method: 探索训练特征归因方法，将测试预测与特定训练图像的特定区域联系起来

Result: 在视觉数据集上的实验表明，训练特征归因能提供细粒度的测试特定解释：识别导致错误分类的有害样本，并揭示传统归因方法未能暴露的伪相关性（如基于补丁的捷径）

Conclusion: 训练特征归因方法为深度模型的内部工作机制提供了新的见解，能够识别传统方法遗漏的有害样本和伪相关性

Abstract: Deep neural networks are often considered opaque systems, prompting the need
for explainability methods to improve trust and accountability. Existing
approaches typically attribute test-time predictions either to input features
(e.g., pixels in an image) or to influential training examples. We argue that
both perspectives should be studied jointly. This work explores *training
feature attribution*, which links test predictions to specific regions of
specific training images and thereby provides new insights into the inner
workings of deep models. Our experiments on vision datasets show that training
feature attribution yields fine-grained, test-specific explanations: it
identifies harmful examples that drive misclassifications and reveals spurious
correlations, such as patch-based shortcuts, that conventional attribution
methods fail to expose.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 支气管镜检查中医生需要确定内窥镜位置，但由于复杂的气管树结构和医生经验差异，这项任务极具挑战性。现有导航方法依赖CT扫描和额外传感器，需要额外设置和训练

Method: 开发了基于图像的支气管镜拓扑定位流程，仅使用模拟数据训练，无需真实患者CT扫描，降低了数据标注成本

Result: 该方法在真实数据测试序列上表现出色，超越了现有方法，具有良好的泛化能力

Conclusion: 该方法为支气管镜检查提供了有效的导航辅助，无需患者CT扫描，仅通过模拟数据训练即可实现良好的定位性能

Abstract: Video bronchoscopy is a fundamental procedure in respiratory medicine, where
medical experts navigate through the bronchial tree of a patient to diagnose or
operate the patient. Surgeons need to determine the position of the scope as
they go through the airway until they reach the area of interest. This task is
very challenging for practitioners due to the complex bronchial tree structure
and varying doctor experience and training. Navigation assistance to locate the
bronchoscope during the procedure can improve its outcome. Currently used
techniques for navigational guidance commonly rely on previous CT scans of the
patient to obtain a 3D model of the airway, followed by tracking of the scope
with additional sensors or image registration. These methods obtain accurate
locations but imply additional setup, scans and training. Accurate metric
localization is not always required, and a topological localization with regard
to a generic airway model can often suffice to assist the surgeon with
navigation. We present an image-based bronchoscopy topological localization
pipeline to provide navigation assistance during the procedure, with no need of
patient CT scan. Our approach is trained only on phantom data, eliminating the
high cost of real data labeling, and presents good generalization capabilities.
The results obtained surpass existing methods, particularly on real data test
sequences.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实例级识别需要识别单个对象而非类别，这种细粒度特性使得创建大规模标注数据集变得困难，限制了ILR在实际应用中的广泛使用。

Method: 从多个领域在多样化条件和背景下合成生成对象实例，构建大规模训练集，无需依赖任何真实图像，然后对基础视觉模型进行微调。

Result: 在七个跨多个领域的ILR基准测试中，检索性能得到显著提升。

Conclusion: 该方法为大规模数据收集和整理提供了高效有效的替代方案，只需输入目标领域名称即可实现ILR，为实际应用开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Instance-level recognition (ILR) focuses on identifying individual objects
rather than broad categories, offering the highest granularity in image
classification. However, this fine-grained nature makes creating large-scale
annotated datasets challenging, limiting ILR's real-world applicability across
domains. To overcome this, we introduce a novel approach that synthetically
generates diverse object instances from multiple domains under varied
conditions and backgrounds, forming a large-scale training set. Unlike prior
work on automatic data synthesis, our method is the first to address
ILR-specific challenges without relying on any real images. Fine-tuning
foundation vision models on the generated data significantly improves retrieval
performance across seven ILR benchmarks spanning multiple domains. Our approach
offers a new, efficient, and effective alternative to extensive data collection
and curation, introducing a new ILR paradigm where the only input is the names
of the target domains, unlocking a wide range of real-world applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TARO是一个新颖的开放世界目标检测框架，不仅识别未知物体，还能将其分类到语义层次结构中的粗粒度父类别，相比传统开放集检测方法提供更细粒度的未知物体描述。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有目标检测器局限于封闭世界假设，无法处理现实场景中的未知物体。传统开放集检测方法将所有未知物体归为单一'Unknown'类别，这在安全关键场景中信息不足。需要为未知物体提供更有描述性的子类别来增强决策能力。

Method: TARO采用独特架构：1) 基于sparsemax的头部建模物体性；2) 层次引导的重标记组件提供辅助监督；3) 分类模块学习层次关系。通过语义层次结构将未知物体分类到粗粒度父类别。

Result: 实验显示TARO能将高达29.9%的未知物体分类到有意义的粗粒度类别，显著减少未知与已知类别间的混淆，在未知召回率和已知mAP方面均取得竞争性性能。

Conclusion: TARO框架成功地将未知物体分类到语义层次结构中的粗粒度父类别，为安全关键应用提供了更细粒度和实用的未知物体识别能力。

Abstract: Modern object detectors are largely confined to a "closed-world" assumption,
limiting them to a predefined set of classes and posing risks when encountering
novel objects in real-world scenarios. While open-set detection methods aim to
address this by identifying such instances as 'Unknown', this is often
insufficient. Rather than treating all unknowns as a single class, assigning
them more descriptive subcategories can enhance decision-making in
safety-critical contexts. For example, identifying an object as an 'Unknown
Animal' (requiring an urgent stop) versus 'Unknown Debris' (requiring a safe
lane change) is far more useful than just 'Unknown' in autonomous driving. To
bridge this gap, we introduce TARO, a novel detection framework that not only
identifies unknown objects but also classifies them into coarse parent
categories within a semantic hierarchy. TARO employs a unique architecture with
a sparsemax-based head for modeling objectness, a hierarchy-guided relabeling
component that provides auxiliary supervision, and a classification module that
learns hierarchical relationships. Experiments show TARO can categorize up to
29.9% of unknowns into meaningful coarse classes, significantly reduce
confusion between unknown and known classes, and achieve competitive
performance in both unknown recall and known mAP. Code will be made available.

Conclusion: oVDA实现了高效的在线视频深度估计，特别适合在边缘设备上部署，将发布代码和编译脚本。

Abstract: Depth estimation from monocular video has become a key component of many
real-world computer vision systems. Recently, Video Depth Anything (VDA) has
demonstrated strong performance on long video sequences. However, it relies on
batch-processing which prohibits its use in an online setting. In this work, we
overcome this limitation and introduce online VDA (oVDA). The key innovation is
to employ techniques from Large Language Models (LLMs), namely, caching latent
features during inference and masking frames at training. Our oVDA method
outperforms all competing online video depth estimation methods in both
accuracy and VRAM usage. Low VRAM usage is particularly important for
deployment on edge devices. We demonstrate that oVDA runs at 42 FPS on an
NVIDIA A100 and at 20 FPS on an NVIDIA Jetson edge device. We will release
both, code and compilation scripts, making oVDA easy to deploy on low-power
hardware.

Abstract: Cricket shot classification from video sequences remains a challenging
problem in sports video analysis, requiring effective modeling of both spatial
and temporal features. This paper presents the first comprehensive baseline
study comparing seven different deep learning approaches across four distinct
research paradigms for cricket shot classification. We implement and
systematically evaluate traditional CNN-LSTM architectures, attention-based
models, vision transformers, transfer learning approaches, and modern
EfficientNet-GRU combinations on a unified benchmark. A critical finding of our
study is the significant performance gap between claims in academic literature
and practical implementation results. While previous papers reported accuracies
of 96\% (Balaji LRCN), 99.2\% (IJERCSE), and 93\% (Sensors), our standardized
re-implementations achieve 46.0\%, 55.6\%, and 57.7\% respectively. Our modern
SOTA approach, combining EfficientNet-B0 with a GRU-based temporal model,
achieves 92.25\% accuracy, demonstrating that substantial improvements are
possible with modern architectures and systematic optimization. All
implementations follow modern MLOps practices with PyTorch Lightning, providing
a reproducible research platform that exposes the critical importance of
standardized evaluation protocols in sports video analysis research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了DAAD-X数据集和VCBM框架，用于自动驾驶中的可解释驾驶员意图预测，通过多模态数据和概念瓶颈模型生成时空一致的解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着自动驾驶系统与人类交互增加，决策过程的可解释性对安全驾驶至关重要，需要理解环境和驾驶任务的底层表示。

Method: 构建DAAD-X多模态数据集，提出Video Concept Bottleneck Model (VCBM)框架，使用transformer模型生成时空一致的解释，无需后处理技术。

Result: 实验表明基于transformer的模型比传统CNN模型具有更好的可解释性，并提出了多标签t-SNE可视化技术展示解释之间的解耦和因果关联。

Conclusion: VCBM框架和DAAD-X数据集为可解释驾驶员意图预测提供了有效解决方案，transformer模型在可解释性方面优于CNN模型。

Abstract: Autonomous driving (AD) systems are becoming increasingly capable of handling
complex tasks, mainly due to recent advances in deep learning and AI. As
interactions between autonomous systems and humans increase, the
interpretability of decision-making processes in driving systems becomes
increasingly crucial for ensuring safe driving operations. Successful
human-machine interaction requires understanding the underlying representations
of the environment and the driving task, which remains a significant challenge
in deep learning-based systems. To address this, we introduce the task of
interpretability in maneuver prediction before they occur for driver safety,
i.e., driver intent prediction (DIP), which plays a critical role in AD
systems. To foster research in interpretable DIP, we curate the eXplainable
Driving Action Anticipation Dataset (DAAD-X), a new multimodal, ego-centric
video dataset to provide hierarchical, high-level textual explanations as
causal reasoning for the driver's decisions. These explanations are derived
from both the driver's eye-gaze and the ego-vehicle's perspective. Next, we
propose Video Concept Bottleneck Model (VCBM), a framework that generates
spatio-temporally coherent explanations inherently, without relying on post-hoc
techniques. Finally, through extensive evaluations of the proposed VCBM on the
DAAD-X dataset, we demonstrate that transformer-based models exhibit greater
interpretability than conventional CNN-based models. Additionally, we introduce
a multilabel t-SNE visualization technique to illustrate the disentanglement
and causal correlation among multiple explanations. Our data, code and models
are available at: https://mukil07.github.io/VCBM.github.io/

### [57] [Cattle-CLIP: A Multimodal Framework for Cattle Behaviour Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09203)
*Huimin Liu,Jing Gao,Daria Baran,AxelX Montout,Neill W Campbell,Andrew W Dowsey*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Cattle-CLIP是一个基于多模态深度学习框架的牛只行为识别系统，通过语义线索提升视频特征识别性能，在监督学习下达到96.1%的准确率，并在少样本场景中表现良好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 牛只行为是评估动物健康和生产力的重要指标，现有视频监测方法在数据稀缺的行为识别任务上存在性能不足的问题，需要开发更有效的多模态学习框架。

Method: 基于CLIP模型构建Cattle-CLIP框架，添加时间整合模块，采用定制化数据增强策略和专门文本提示来解决领域差异问题，在CattleBehaviours6数据集上进行评估。

Result: 在监督学习场景下，Cattle-CLIP在六种行为识别中达到96.1%的整体准确率，对进食、饮水和站立反刍行为的召回率接近100%，在少样本学习中也表现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 多模态学习在农业和动物行为分析中具有巨大潜力，Cattle-CLIP框架能够有效解决数据稀缺条件下的牛只行为识别问题。

Abstract: Cattle behaviour is a crucial indicator of an individual animal health,
productivity and overall well-being. Video-based monitoring, combined with deep
learning techniques, has become a mainstream approach in animal biometrics, and
it can offer high accuracy in some behaviour recognition tasks. We present
Cattle-CLIP, a multimodal deep learning framework for cattle behaviour
recognition, using semantic cues to improve the performance of video-based
visual feature recognition. It is adapted from the large-scale image-language
model CLIP by adding a temporal integration module. To address the domain gap
between web data used for the pre-trained model and real-world cattle
surveillance footage, we introduce tailored data augmentation strategies and
specialised text prompts. Cattle-CLIP is evaluated under both fully-supervised
and few-shot learning scenarios, with a particular focus on data-scarce
behaviour recognition - an important yet under-explored goal in livestock
monitoring. To evaluate the proposed method, we release the CattleBehaviours6
dataset, which comprises six types of indoor behaviours: feeding, drinking,
standing-self-grooming, standing-ruminating, lying-self-grooming and
lying-ruminating. The dataset consists of 1905 clips collected from our John
Oldacre Centre dairy farm research platform housing 200 Holstein-Friesian cows.
Experiments show that Cattle-CLIP achieves 96.1% overall accuracy across six
behaviours in a supervised setting, with nearly 100% recall for feeding,
drinking and standing-ruminating behaviours, and demonstrates robust
generalisation with limited data in few-shot scenarios, highlighting the
potential of multimodal learning in agricultural and animal behaviour analysis.

### [58] [3D Reconstruction from Transient Measurements with Time-Resolved Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09205)
*Yue Li,Shida Sun,Yu Hong,Feihu Xu,Zhiwei Xiong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种通用的时间分辨Transformer（TRT）架构，用于提升光子效率成像中的3D重建性能，包括LOS和NLOS成像任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于传感器量子效率低和噪声水平高，特别是在长距离或复杂场景下，时间分辨测量的3D重建仍然面临挑战。

Method: TRT架构包含专门为时空瞬态测量设计的两种注意力机制：时空自注意力编码器探索瞬态数据的局部和全局相关性，时空交叉注意力解码器在token空间中整合局部和全局特征。

Result: 在合成数据和不同成像系统捕获的真实数据上，TRT-LOS和TRT-NLOS两个具体实现都显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TRT架构有效提升了光子效率成像中的3D重建性能，同时贡献了大规模合成LOS数据集和真实NLOS测量数据，促进了该领域的数据多样性。

Abstract: Transient measurements, captured by the timeresolved systems, are widely
employed in photon-efficient reconstruction tasks, including line-of-sight
(LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging. However, challenges persist in
their 3D reconstruction due to the low quantum efficiency of sensors and the
high noise levels, particularly for long-range or complex scenes. To boost the
3D reconstruction performance in photon-efficient imaging, we propose a generic
Time-Resolved Transformer (TRT) architecture. Different from existing
transformers designed for high-dimensional data, TRT has two elaborate
attention designs tailored for the spatio-temporal transient measurements.
Specifically, the spatio-temporal self-attention encoders explore both local
and global correlations within transient data by splitting or downsampling
input features into different scales. Then, the spatio-temporal cross attention
decoders integrate the local and global features in the token space, resulting
in deep features with high representation capabilities. Building on TRT, we
develop two task-specific embodiments: TRT-LOS for LOS imaging and TRT-NLOS for
NLOS imaging. Extensive experiments demonstrate that both embodiments
significantly outperform existing methods on synthetic data and real-world data
captured by different imaging systems. In addition, we contribute a
large-scale, high-resolution synthetic LOS dataset with various noise levels
and capture a set of real-world NLOS measurements using a custom-built imaging
system, enhancing the data diversity in this field. Code and datasets are
available at https://github.com/Depth2World/TRT.

### [59] [Stable Video Infinity: Infinite-Length Video Generation with Error Recycling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09212)
*Wuyang Li,Wentao Pan,Po-Chien Luan,Yang Gao,Alexandre Alahi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Stable Video Infinity (SVI)方法，能够生成无限长度视频，具有高时间一致性、合理的场景转换和可控的流媒体故事情节。通过错误回收微调技术，让模型学习识别和纠正自身错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有长视频生成方法主要关注减轻累积误差，但仍局限于单提示外推，产生重复动作的同质场景。核心挑战在于训练假设（看到干净数据）与测试时自回归现实（基于自生成、易出错输出）之间的差异。

Method: 提出错误回收微调：1) 注入历史错误到干净输入中模拟误差累积轨迹；2) 通过一步双向积分高效近似预测并用残差计算误差；3) 在离散时间步动态存储错误到重放内存中供新输入使用。

Result: SVI能够将视频从秒级扩展到无限时长，无需额外推理成本，同时兼容多种条件（音频、骨架、文本流）。在三个基准测试中验证了其多功能性和最先进性能。

Conclusion: SVI通过错误回收微调有效解决了长视频生成中的假设差距问题，实现了无限长度视频生成，在一致性、创意性和条件设置方面均表现出色。

Abstract: We propose Stable Video Infinity (SVI) that is able to generate
infinite-length videos with high temporal consistency, plausible scene
transitions, and controllable streaming storylines. While existing long-video
methods attempt to mitigate accumulated errors via handcrafted anti-drifting
(e.g., modified noise scheduler, frame anchoring), they remain limited to
single-prompt extrapolation, producing homogeneous scenes with repetitive
motions. We identify that the fundamental challenge extends beyond error
accumulation to a critical discrepancy between the training assumption (seeing
clean data) and the test-time autoregressive reality (conditioning on
self-generated, error-prone outputs). To bridge this hypothesis gap, SVI
incorporates Error-Recycling Fine-Tuning, a new type of efficient training that
recycles the Diffusion Transformer (DiT)'s self-generated errors into
supervisory prompts, thereby encouraging DiT to actively identify and correct
its own errors. This is achieved by injecting, collecting, and banking errors
through closed-loop recycling, autoregressively learning from error-injected
feedback. Specifically, we (i) inject historical errors made by DiT to
intervene on clean inputs, simulating error-accumulated trajectories in flow
matching; (ii) efficiently approximate predictions with one-step bidirectional
integration and calculate errors with residuals; (iii) dynamically bank errors
into replay memory across discretized timesteps, which are resampled for new
input. SVI is able to scale videos from seconds to infinite durations with no
additional inference cost, while remaining compatible with diverse conditions
(e.g., audio, skeleton, and text streams). We evaluate SVI on three benchmarks,
including consistent, creative, and conditional settings, thoroughly verifying
its versatility and state-of-the-art role.

TL;DR: TEMA-LLM是一个用于跨域序列推荐的框架，通过LLM生成语义标签，结合多注意力机制来建模用户偏好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨域序列推荐需要准确捕捉领域特定和跨领域行为模式，以提供个性化消费体验。

Method: 使用LLM生成领域感知的语义标签，将标签嵌入与项目标识符及文本视觉特征融合，采用标签增强的多注意力机制建模用户偏好。

Result: 在四个大规模电商数据集上的实验表明，TEMA-LLM持续优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: LLM在消费电子领域的智能用户中心服务中具有推进潜力。

Abstract: Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation (CDSR) plays a crucial role in modern
consumer electronics and e-commerce platforms, where users interact with
diverse services such as books, movies, and online retail products. These
systems must accurately capture both domain-specific and cross-domain
behavioral patterns to provide personalized and seamless consumer experiences.
To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{TEMA-LLM} (\textit{Tag-Enriched
Multi-Attention with Large Language Models}), a practical and effective
framework that integrates \textit{Large Language Models (LLMs)} for semantic
tag generation and enrichment. Specifically, TEMA-LLM employs LLMs to assign
domain-aware prompts and generate descriptive tags from item titles and
descriptions. The resulting tag embeddings are fused with item identifiers as
well as textual and visual features to construct enhanced item representations.
A \textit{Tag-Enriched Multi-Attention} mechanism is then introduced to jointly
model user preferences within and across domains, enabling the system to
capture complex and evolving consumer interests. Extensive experiments on four
large-scale e-commerce datasets demonstrate that TEMA-LLM consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, underscoring the benefits of LLM-based
semantic tagging and multi-attention integration for consumer-facing
recommendation systems. The proposed approach highlights the potential of LLMs
to advance intelligent, user-centric services in the field of consumer
electronics.

Abstract: Adverse weather conditions such as haze, rain, and snow significantly degrade
the quality of images and videos, posing serious challenges to intelligent
transportation systems (ITS) that rely on visual input. These degradations
affect critical applications including autonomous driving, traffic monitoring,
and surveillance. This survey presents a comprehensive review of image and
video restoration techniques developed to mitigate weather-induced visual
impairments. We categorize existing approaches into traditional prior-based
methods and modern data-driven models, including CNNs, transformers, diffusion
models, and emerging vision-language models (VLMs). Restoration strategies are
further classified based on their scope: single-task models,
multi-task/multi-weather systems, and all-in-one frameworks capable of handling
diverse degradations. In addition, we discuss day and night time restoration
challenges, benchmark datasets, and evaluation protocols. The survey concludes
with an in-depth discussion on limitations in current research and outlines
future directions such as mixed/compound-degradation restoration, real-time
deployment, and agentic AI frameworks. This work aims to serve as a valuable
reference for advancing weather-resilient vision systems in smart
transportation environments. Lastly, to stay current with rapid advancements in
this field, we will maintain regular updates of the latest relevant papers and

Motivation: 在医疗资源稀缺地区，肩部疾病（如肩周炎）的早期准确诊断面临挑战，急需低成本、易扩展的辅助诊断方案。

Method: 提出HMVDx框架，使用两个MLLM分别完成动作理解和疾病诊断任务，并引入基于医疗决策逻辑的可用性指标进行评估。

Result: 实验显示HMVDx在肩关节损伤诊断中的准确率比直接视频诊断提高了79.6%。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了低成本MLLM在医疗应用中的潜力，为MLLM在医学视频理解领域的应用提供了重要技术贡献。

Abstract: Shoulder disorders, such as frozen shoulder (a.k.a., adhesive capsulitis),
are common conditions affecting the health of people worldwide, and have a high
incidence rate among the elderly and workers engaged in repetitive shoulder
tasks. In regions with scarce medical resources, achieving early and accurate
diagnosis poses significant challenges, and there is an urgent need for
low-cost and easily scalable auxiliary diagnostic solutions. This research
introduces videos captured by consumer-grade devices as the basis for
diagnosis, reducing the cost for users. We focus on the innovative application
of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in the preliminary diagnosis of
shoulder disorders and propose a Hybrid Motion Video Diagnosis framework
(HMVDx). This framework divides the two tasks of action understanding and
disease diagnosis, which are respectively completed by two MLLMs. In addition
to traditional evaluation indicators, this work proposes a novel metric called
Usability Index by the logical process of medical decision-making (action
recognition, movement diagnosis, and final diagnosis). This index evaluates the
effectiveness of MLLMs in the medical field from the perspective of the entire
medical diagnostic pathway, revealing the potential value of low-cost MLLMs in
medical applications for medical practitioners. In experimental comparisons,
the accuracy of HMVDx in diagnosing shoulder joint injuries has increased by
79.6\% compared with direct video diagnosis, a significant technical
contribution to future research on the application of MLLMs for video
understanding in the medical field.

TL;DR: 本文建立了图像隐私分类的零样本基准，评估了开源视觉语言模型(VLMs)与专用模型的性能对比，发现尽管VLMs资源消耗大，但在隐私预测准确率上落后于更小的专用模型，但对图像扰动具有更高鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文献倾向于采用通用任务的视觉语言模型进行图像隐私预测，但缺乏系统评估，可能忽略了专用模型的性能上限。

Method: 建立零样本基准用于公平比较，评估前3名开源VLMs，使用任务对齐提示，对比其与现有视觉专用和多模态方法的性能、效率和鲁棒性。

Result: VLMs尽管参数多、推理慢，但在隐私预测准确率上落后于更小的专用模型；但VLMs对图像扰动表现出更高的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 视觉语言模型目前在图像隐私预测准确率上不如专用模型，但在鲁棒性方面表现更好，这为未来研究提供了重要参考。

Abstract: While specialized learning-based models have historically dominated image
privacy prediction, the current literature increasingly favours adopting large
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) designed for generic tasks. This trend risks
overlooking the performance ceiling set by purpose-built models due to a lack
of systematic evaluation. To address this problem, we establish a zero-shot
benchmark for image privacy classification, enabling a fair comparison. We
evaluate the top-3 open-source VLMs, according to a privacy benchmark, using
task-aligned prompts and we contrast their performance, efficiency, and
robustness against established vision-only and multi-modal methods.
Counter-intuitively, our results show that VLMs, despite their
resource-intensive nature in terms of high parameter count and slower
inference, currently lag behind specialized, smaller models in privacy
prediction accuracy. We also find that VLMs exhibit higher robustness to image
perturbations.

Abstract: To determine whether using discrete semantic entropy (DSE) to reject
questions likely to generate hallucinations can improve the accuracy of
black-box vision-language models (VLMs) in radiologic image based visual
question answering (VQA). This retrospective study evaluated DSE using two
publicly available, de-identified datasets: (i) the VQA-Med 2019 benchmark (500
images with clinical questions and short-text answers) and (ii) a diagnostic
radiology dataset (206 cases: 60 computed tomography scans, 60 magnetic
resonance images, 60 radiographs, 26 angiograms) with corresponding
ground-truth diagnoses. GPT-4o and GPT-4.1 answered each question 15 times
using a temperature of 1.0. Baseline accuracy was determined using
low-temperature answers (temperature 0.1). Meaning-equivalent responses were
grouped using bidirectional entailment checks, and DSE was computed from the
relative frequencies of the resulting semantic clusters. Accuracy was
recalculated after excluding questions with DSE > 0.6 or > 0.3. p-values and
95% confidence intervals were obtained using bootstrap resampling and a
Bonferroni-corrected threshold of p < .004 for statistical significance. Across
706 image-question pairs, baseline accuracy was 51.7% for GPT-4o and 54.8% for
GPT-4.1. After filtering out high-entropy questions (DSE > 0.3), accuracy on
the remaining questions was 76.3% (retained questions: 334/706) for GPT-4o and
63.8% (retained questions: 499/706) for GPT-4.1 (both p < .001). Accuracy gains
were observed across both datasets and largely remained statistically
significant after Bonferroni correction. DSE enables reliable hallucination
detection in black-box VLMs by quantifying semantic inconsistency. This method
significantly improves diagnostic answer accuracy and offers a filtering
strategy for clinical VLM applications.

Conclusion: 该方法在保持运动细节和全局上下文的同时，有效缓解累积误差，提升分割质量

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RefVOS) seeks to segment target objects
in videos guided by natural language descriptions, demanding both temporal
reasoning and fine-grained visual comprehension. Existing sampling strategies
for LLM-based approaches typically rely on either handcrafted heuristics or
external keyframe models. The former often overlooks essential temporal cues,
while the latter increases system complexity. To address this, we propose a
unified framework that jointly optimizes Temporal Sentence Grounding (TSG) and
RefVOS, naturally incorporating key moment grounding capability. During
training, we introduce a novel TSG paradigm that employs a dedicated
\texttt{[FIND]} token for key moment identification through temporal token
similarity matching, thereby avoiding the need for external timestamp
encodings. For inference, we design a Moment-Centric Sampling (MCS) strategy
that densely samples informative moments while sparsely sampling non-essential
frames, preserving both motion details and global context. To further enhance
tracking stability, we develop Bidirectional Anchor-updated Propagation (BAP),
which leverages the most relevant moment as start point for high-quality mask
initialization and dynamically updates at sampled points to mitigate
accumulated errors. Code and model will be available at:

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has advanced the
reasoning capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), most existing
methods in multimodal reasoning neglect the critical role of visual perception
within the RLVR optimization process. In this paper, we undertake a pioneering
exploration of multimodal RLVR through the novel perspective of token
perception, which measures the visual dependency of each generated token. With
a granular analysis of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) processes, we uncover two key
insights: first, token perception in a rollout trajectory is sparsely
distributed, where only a small fraction of tokens have high visual dependency
for visually-grounded reasoning; second, different trajectories exhibit
significant divergence in their overall visual dependency. Based on these
observations, we propose Visually-Perceptive Policy Optimization (VPPO), a
novel policy gradient algorithm that explicitly leverages token perception to
refine the learning signal. Specifically, VPPO achieves this through a dual
mechanism: it reweights a trajectory's advantage by its overall visual
dependency, and focuses policy updates exclusively on perceptually pivotal
tokens. On a comprehensive suite of eight perception and reasoning benchmarks,
VPPO demonstrates substantial gains over leading open-source RL-tuned models,
with its effectiveness consistently validated across 7B and 32B model scales.
Our findings not only establish a new token-level perceptual perspective for
analyzing multimodal RLVR but also present a novel and effective optimization
strategy to significantly enhance the multimodal reasoning capabilities of
LVLMs.

TL;DR: 人类视觉注视轨迹遵循类似动物觅食的Lévy行走模式，表明视觉信息搜索具有最优效率。通过CNN模型可以从图像结构预测注视热点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模型强调基于图像的显著性，但眼动的时空统计特性研究不足。理解这些动态对注意力建模和视觉界面有广泛应用。

Method: 进行大规模人类实验，40名参与者观看50张多样化图像，使用高速眼动仪记录400多万个注视点。训练CNN从图像输入预测注视热点图。

Result: 分析显示人类眼动轨迹遵循Lévy行走模式，类似动物觅食。CNN模型能准确重现新颖图像中的显著注视区域。

Conclusion: 人类视觉探索遵循与自然觅食类似的统计规律，为通过生成和预测框架建模注视行为开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Animals often forage via Levy walks stochastic trajectories with heavy tailed
step lengths optimized for sparse resource environments. We show that human
visual gaze follows similar dynamics when scanning images. While traditional
models emphasize image based saliency, the underlying spatiotemporal statistics
of eye movements remain underexplored. Understanding these dynamics has broad
applications in attention modeling and vision-based interfaces. In this study,
we conducted a large scale human subject experiment involving 40 participants
viewing 50 diverse images under unconstrained conditions, recording over 4
million gaze points using a high speed eye tracker. Analysis of these data
shows that the gaze trajectory of the human eye also follows a Levy walk akin
to animal foraging. This suggests that the human eye forages for visual
information in an optimally efficient manner. Further, we trained a
convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict fixation heatmaps from image
input alone. The model accurately reproduced salient fixation regions across
novel images, demonstrating that key components of gaze behavior are learnable
from visual structure alone. Our findings present new evidence that human
visual exploration obeys statistical laws analogous to natural foraging and
open avenues for modeling gaze through generative and predictive frameworks.

TL;DR: 提出CapGeo框架，通过将几何图形转换为文本描述来提升多模态大语言模型的几何推理能力，并创建CapGeo-Bench基准数据集进行评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有先进多模态大语言模型在几何推理方面表现不佳，瓶颈在于理解几何图形而非推理能力本身。由于几何图形可以用简洁文本描述，将视觉内容转换为标题提供了有前景的方向。

Method: 引入CapGeo框架，通过辅助标题连接视觉和文本模态；创建CapGeo-Bench数据集（4,641个精心挑选的图形-标题对），并使用基于关键点的评估指标。

Result: 配备标题后模型性能显著提升：Qwen2.5-VL-72B从8.6%提升至59.0%，Claude-Opus-4从44.8%提升至73.0%。评估指标与下游CapGeo性能强相关。

Conclusion: 该框架和基准为推进多模态大语言模型的几何推理能力开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Geometric reasoning remains a core challenge for Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs). Even the most advanced closed-source systems, such as GPT-O3
and Gemini-2.5-Pro, still struggle to solve geometry problems reliably, despite
exhibiting strong textual reasoning abilities on tasks like the International
Mathematical Olympiad (IMO). This gap suggests that the bottleneck lies in
understanding geometric diagrams rather than reasoning itself. Since geometric
figures can often be faithfully described in concise textual form, converting
visual content into captions offers a promising direction. Motivated by this
insight, we introduce CapGeo, a caption-assisted reasoning framework that
bridges visual and textual modalities. Experiments show substantial
improvements when models are equipped with captions: Qwen2.5-VL-72B improves
from 8.6% (vision-only) to 59.0%, while Claude-Opus-4 rises from 44.8% to
73.0%. To systematically evaluate and identify high-quality geometric
captioning models, we further propose CapGeo-Bench, a dataset of 4,641 curated
figure-caption pairs. Crucially, CapGeo-Bench incorporates a keypoint-based
evaluation metric that correlates strongly with downstream CapGeo performance,
enabling reliable assessment of geometric captioning ability. Together, our
framework and benchmark highlight a new pathway toward advancing geometric
reasoning in MLLMs.

Motivation: 解决基于扩散的无线电地图生成方法存在模型大、迭代去噪慢、推理延迟高的问题，阻碍实际部署。

Method: 提出RadioFlow框架，学习噪声与数据之间的连续传输轨迹，实现单步高效采样，显著加速训练和推理过程。

Result: 实验表明RadioFlow在保持重建精度的同时，参数比领先的扩散基线(RadioDiff)减少8倍，推理速度提升4倍以上。

Conclusion: 该进展为未来6G网络的可扩展、节能和实时电磁数字孪生提供了有前景的途径。

Abstract: Accurate and real-time radio map (RM) generation is crucial for
next-generation wireless systems, yet diffusion-based approaches often suffer
from large model sizes, slow iterative denoising, and high inference latency,
which hinder practical deployment. To overcome these limitations, we propose
\textbf{RadioFlow}, a novel flow-matching-based generative framework that
achieves high-fidelity RM generation through single-step efficient sampling.
Unlike conventional diffusion models, RadioFlow learns continuous transport
trajectories between noise and data, enabling both training and inference to be
significantly accelerated while preserving reconstruction accuracy.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that RadioFlow achieves state-of-the-art
performance with \textbf{up to 8$\times$ fewer parameters} and \textbf{over
4$\times$ faster inference} compared to the leading diffusion-based baseline
(RadioDiff). This advancement provides a promising pathway toward scalable,
energy-efficient, and real-time electromagnetic digital twins for future 6G
networks. We release the code at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Hybrid-depth框架，通过整合CLIP和DINO基础模型来提升自监督单目深度估计性能，采用从粗到精的渐进学习策略，在KITTI基准测试中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自监督单目深度估计方法由于语义-空间知识提取不足而面临性能限制，需要更充分的上下文信息。

Method: 1) 从CLIP和DINO聚合多粒度特征，在对比语言指导下设计代理任务进行深度感知特征对齐；2) 在粗特征基础上集成相机姿态信息和像素级语言对齐来细化深度预测，可作为即插即用模块与现有MDE管道集成。

Result: 在KITTI基准测试中，该方法在所有指标上都显著优于最先进方法，并能有效提升下游任务如BEV感知的性能。

Conclusion: 通过语言指导聚合CLIP的语义上下文和DINO的空间细节，Hybrid-depth有效解决了特征粒度不匹配问题，显著提升了自监督单目深度估计性能。

Abstract: Current self-supervised monocular depth estimation (MDE) approaches encounter
performance limitations due to insufficient semantic-spatial knowledge
extraction. To address this challenge, we propose Hybrid-depth, a novel
framework that systematically integrates foundation models (e.g., CLIP and
DINO) to extract visual priors and acquire sufficient contextual information
for MDE. Our approach introduces a coarse-to-fine progressive learning
framework: 1) Firstly, we aggregate multi-grained features from CLIP (global
semantics) and DINO (local spatial details) under contrastive language
guidance. A proxy task comparing close-distant image patches is designed to
enforce depth-aware feature alignment using text prompts; 2) Next, building on
the coarse features, we integrate camera pose information and pixel-wise
language alignment to refine depth predictions. This module seamlessly
integrates with existing self-supervised MDE pipelines (e.g., Monodepth2,
ManyDepth) as a plug-and-play depth encoder, enhancing continuous depth
estimation. By aggregating CLIP's semantic context and DINO's spatial details
through language guidance, our method effectively addresses feature granularity
mismatches. Extensive experiments on the KITTI benchmark demonstrate that our
method significantly outperforms SOTA methods across all metrics, which also
indeed benefits downstream tasks like BEV perception. Code is available at

TL;DR: 提出IRCR-Net用于病理图像中的细胞核实例分割，通过实例感知一致性正则化机制解决半监督学习中实例级一致性不足、病理结构先验知识利用不充分以及伪标签噪声问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 病理图像中细胞核实例分割对肿瘤微环境分析至关重要，但标注数据成本高且稀缺限制了全监督方法的应用，现有半监督方法在实例级一致性正则化、病理结构先验知识利用和伪标签噪声控制方面存在不足。

Method: 提出IRCR-Net网络，包含匹配驱动的实例感知一致性(MIAC)和先验驱动的实例感知一致性(PIAC)机制，利用细胞核形态学先验知识评估伪标签质量，丢弃低质量伪标签并增强高质量预测。

Result: 实验结果表明该方法在多个公共数据集上显著提升了半监督细胞核实例分割性能，在某些场景下甚至超越了全监督方法。

Conclusion: IRCR-Net通过实例感知一致性正则化和先验知识利用，有效解决了半监督细胞核分割中的关键问题，取得了优于现有方法的性能。

Abstract: Nuclei instance segmentation in pathological images is crucial for downstream
tasks such as tumor microenvironment analysis. However, the high cost and
scarcity of annotated data limit the applicability of fully supervised methods,
while existing semi-supervised methods fail to adequately regularize
consistency at the instance level, lack leverage of the inherent prior
knowledge of pathological structures, and are prone to introducing noisy
pseudo-labels during training. In this paper, we propose an Instance-Aware
Robust Consistency Regularization Network (IRCR-Net) for accurate
instance-level nuclei segmentation. Specifically, we introduce the
Matching-Driven Instance-Aware Consistency (MIAC) and Prior-Driven
Instance-Aware Consistency (PIAC) mechanisms to refine the nuclei instance
segmentation result of the teacher and student subnetwork, particularly for
densely distributed and overlapping nuclei. We incorporate morphological prior
knowledge of nuclei in pathological images and utilize these priors to assess
the quality of pseudo-labels generated from unlabeled data. Low-quality
pseudo-labels are discarded, while high-quality predictions are enhanced to
reduce pseudo-label noise and benefit the network's robust training.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly
enhances semi-supervised nuclei instance segmentation performance across
multiple public datasets compared to existing approaches, even surpassing fully
supervised methods in some scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于热红外图像增强的渐进式提示融合网络(PPFN)，通过建立基于热成像过程的提示对来调制模型特征，能够同时处理多种耦合的退化问题，在复杂退化场景下性能提升8.76%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有红外图像增强方法主要针对单一退化问题，难以处理耦合退化；而通用增强方法由于成像模型差异在热红外图像上效果有限。

Method: 提出渐进式提示融合网络(PPFN)，基于热成像过程建立提示对，通过融合对应提示对调制模型特征；引入选择性渐进训练(SPT)机制逐步优化模型对复合情况的处理。

Result: 该方法不仅能去除相机噪声、保留关键结构细节，还能增强热图像的整体对比度，在复杂退化场景下性能显著提升8.76%。

Conclusion: PPFN方法在热红外图像增强任务中表现出色，特别是在处理耦合退化问题时具有明显优势，并建立了高质量的多场景红外基准数据集。

Abstract: We engage in the relatively underexplored task named thermal infrared image
enhancement. Existing infrared image enhancement methods primarily focus on
tackling individual degradations, such as noise, contrast, and blurring, making
it difficult to handle coupled degradations. Meanwhile, all-in-one enhancement
methods, commonly applied to RGB sensors, often demonstrate limited
effectiveness due to the significant differences in imaging models. In sight of
this, we first revisit the imaging mechanism and introduce a Progressive Prompt
Fusion Network (PPFN). Specifically, the PPFN initially establishes prompt
pairs based on the thermal imaging process. For each type of degradation, we
fuse the corresponding prompt pairs to modulate the model's features, providing
adaptive guidance that enables the model to better address specific
degradations under single or multiple conditions. In addition, a Selective
Progressive Training (SPT) mechanism is introduced to gradually refine the
model's handling of composite cases to align the enhancement process, which not
only allows the model to remove camera noise and retain key structural details,
but also enhancing the overall contrast of the thermal image. Furthermore, we
introduce the most high-quality, multi-scenarios infrared benchmark covering a
wide range of scenarios. Extensive experiments substantiate that our approach
not only delivers promising visual results under specific degradation but also
significantly improves performance on complex degradation scenes, achieving a
notable 8.76\% improvement. Code is available at

Motivation: 传统多模态方法在处理缺失和未见场景时存在显著局限性，现有基准测试由于训练测试重叠度高而高估模型能力。

Method: 使用零样本和监督微调评估VLM性能下限；采用Fine-tune-CoT利用教师模型生成的高质量推理数据微调小模型；提出动态CoT策略在训练中自适应注入CoT数据。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验结果表明所提方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的动态CoT等策略能有效提升视觉语言模型在多模态关键词预测任务中的性能。

Abstract: Multi-modal keyphrase prediction (MMKP) aims to advance beyond text-only
methods by incorporating multiple modalities of input information to produce a
set of conclusive phrases. Traditional multi-modal approaches have been proven
to have significant limitations in handling the challenging absence and unseen
scenarios. Additionally, we identify shortcomings in existing benchmarks that
overestimate model capability due to significant overlap in training tests. In
this work, we propose leveraging vision-language models (VLMs) for the MMKP
task. Firstly, we use two widely-used strategies, e.g., zero-shot and
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to assess the lower bound performance of VLMs.
Next, to improve the complex reasoning capabilities of VLMs, we adopt
Fine-tune-CoT, which leverages high-quality CoT reasoning data generated by a
teacher model to finetune smaller models. Finally, to address the
"overthinking" phenomenon, we propose a dynamic CoT strategy which adaptively
injects CoT data during training, allowing the model to flexibly leverage its
reasoning capabilities during the inference stage. We evaluate the proposed
strategies on various datasets and the experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed approaches. The code is available at

TL;DR: BLINK-Twice是一个视觉中心推理基准，专注于从纯视觉内容进行推理，超越了浅层感知，需要细粒度观察和分析推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理基准主要评估基于语言的推理，将视觉输入视为可替换的上下文，缺乏对纯视觉推理能力的评估。

Method: 整合了七种视觉挑战类型、自然对抗图像对和带注释的推理链，用于细粒度评估推理过程而非仅最终答案。

Result: 评估了20个领先的MLLM模型，BLINK-Twice对当前模型构成重大挑战，重复图像观察能提高性能，主动视觉交互显示了视觉推理新范式的需求。

Conclusion: 需要为视觉推理开发新的范式，现有语言空间的推理策略在视觉推理中表现不稳定且冗余。

Abstract: Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made rapid progress,
particularly in enhancing their reasoning capabilities. However, existing
reasoning benchmarks still primarily assess language-based reasoning, often
treating visual input as replaceable context. To address this gap, we introduce
BLINK-Twice, a vision-centric reasoning benchmark grounded in challenging
perceptual tasks. Instead of relying on external knowledge, our tasks require
models to reason from visual content alone, shifting the focus from
language-based to image-grounded reasoning. Compared to prior perception
benchmarks, it moves beyond shallow perception ("see") and requires
fine-grained observation and analytical reasoning ("observe"). BLINK-Twice
integrates three core components: seven types of visual challenges for testing
visual reasoning, natural adversarial image pairs that enforce reliance on
visual content, and annotated reasoning chains for fine-grained evaluation of
the reasoning process rather than final answers alone. We evaluate 20 leading
MLLMs, including 12 foundation models and 8 reasoning-enhanced models.
BLINK-Twice poses a significant challenge to current models. While existing
reasoning strategies in the language space-such as chain-of-thought or
self-criticism can improve performance, they often result in unstable and
redundant reasoning. We observe that repeated image observation improves
performance across models, and active visual interaction, as demonstrated by
models like o3, highlights the need for a new paradigm for vision reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统3DGS方法严重依赖初始点云质量，在无边界动态城市环境中由于观察视锥不重叠，导致点覆盖不均匀不完整，训练时会产生失真和伪影。现有致密化策略无法重建缺失结构。

Method: 1. 基于体素的可见性分析识别不可靠几何结构；2. 多样性感知的视图选择选取信息丰富的支持视图；3. 基于块匹配的多视角立体重建恢复缺失结构；4. 在缺乏初始点的区域生成新的高斯基元。

Result: 在Waymo和nuScenes数据集上的广泛实验表明，VAD-GS优于最先进的3DGS方法，显著提高了静态和动态物体重建几何的质量。

Conclusion: VAD-GS通过可靠的几何先验指导新高斯基元的生成，有效解决了3DGS在城市场景中的几何恢复问题，即使在没有初始点的区域也能实现高质量重建。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated impressive performance in
synthesizing high-fidelity novel views. Nonetheless, its effectiveness
critically depends on the quality of the initialized point cloud. Specifically,
achieving uniform and complete point coverage over the underlying scene
structure requires overlapping observation frustums, an assumption that is
often violated in unbounded, dynamic urban environments. Training Gaussian
models with partially initialized point clouds often leads to distortions and
artifacts, as camera rays may fail to intersect valid surfaces, resulting in
incorrect gradient propagation to Gaussian primitives associated with occluded
or invisible geometry. Additionally, existing densification strategies simply
clone and split Gaussian primitives from existing ones, incapable of
reconstructing missing structures. To address these limitations, we propose
VAD-GS, a 3DGS framework tailored for geometry recovery in challenging urban
scenes. Our method identifies unreliable geometry structures via voxel-based
visibility reasoning, selects informative supporting views through
diversity-aware view selection, and recovers missing structures via patch
matching-based multi-view stereo reconstruction. This design enables the
generation of new Gaussian primitives guided by reliable geometric priors, even
in regions lacking initial points. Extensive experiments on the Waymo and
nuScenes datasets demonstrate that VAD-GS outperforms state-of-the-art 3DGS
approaches and significantly improves the quality of reconstructed geometry for
both static and dynamic objects. Source code will be released upon publication.

Conclusion: 这项工作为大规模森林生物量分析提供了强大工具，推进了基于LiDAR的森林清单方法。

Abstract: Accurate forest biomass quantification is vital for carbon cycle monitoring.
While airborne LiDAR excels at capturing 3D forest structure, directly
estimating woody volume and Aboveground Biomass (AGB) from point clouds is
challenging due to difficulties in modeling long-range dependencies needed to
distinguish trees.We propose Minkowski-MambaNet, a novel deep learning
framework that directly estimates volume and AGB from raw LiDAR. Its key
innovation is integrating the Mamba model's Selective State Space Model (SSM)
into a Minkowski network, enabling effective encoding of global context and
long-range dependencies for improved tree differentiation. Skip connections are
incorporated to enhance features and accelerate convergence.Evaluated on Danish
National Forest Inventory LiDAR data, Minkowski-MambaNet significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, providing more accurate and robust
estimates. Crucially, it requires no Digital Terrain Model (DTM) and is robust
to boundary artifacts. This work offers a powerful tool for large-scale forest
biomass analysis, advancing LiDAR-based forest inventories.

Motivation: 基于Transformer的模型在视觉任务中的推理效率仍然是一个挑战，特别是在目标检测等任务中。论文旨在利用DETR中MLP层固有的稀疏性来提高推理效率。

Method: 1. SIBS：基于固定激活模式的启发式方法，预测神经元不活跃性；2. MGS：在预训练DETR基础上训练的轻量级门控机制，使用小型线性层预测动态稀疏性。

Result: 在COCO数据集上的实验表明，MGS实现了85-95%的激活稀疏度，在保持甚至提升性能的同时显著减少了计算量。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种实用、输入自适应的稀疏化方法，能够在无需完全模型重新训练的情况下实现预训练视觉Transformer的高效部署。

Abstract: Efficient inference with transformer-based models remains a challenge,
especially in vision tasks like object detection. We analyze the inherent
sparsity in the MLP layers of DETR and introduce two methods to exploit it
without retraining. First, we propose Static Indicator-Based Sparsification
(SIBS), a heuristic method that predicts neuron inactivity based on fixed
activation patterns. While simple, SIBS offers limited gains due to the
input-dependent nature of sparsity. To address this, we introduce Micro-Gated
Sparsification (MGS), a lightweight gating mechanism trained on top of a
pretrained DETR. MGS predicts dynamic sparsity using a small linear layer and
achieves up to 85 to 95% activation sparsity. Experiments on the COCO dataset
show that MGS maintains or even improves performance while significantly
reducing computation. Our method offers a practical, input-adaptive approach to
sparsification, enabling efficient deployment of pretrained vision transformers
without full model retraining.

Motivation: 从单目视频重建的4D场景基于文本提示进行编辑在内容创作和虚拟环境中具有广泛应用价值，但面临在复杂动态场景中实现语义精确编辑同时保持未编辑内容完整性的挑战。

Method: 方法包括：1）用量化CLIP特征增强3D高斯形成语言嵌入动态表示；2）两阶段点级定位策略（CLIP相似度候选选择+空间范围细化）；3）使用基于扩散的视频编辑模型进行目标编辑，通过流和涂鸦引导确保空间保真度和时间一致性。

Conclusion: Mono4DEditor提供了一个灵活准确的文本驱动4D场景编辑框架，成功解决了复杂动态场景中语义精确编辑的挑战。

Abstract: Editing 4D scenes reconstructed from monocular videos based on text prompts
is a valuable yet challenging task with broad applications in content creation
and virtual environments. The key difficulty lies in achieving semantically
precise edits in localized regions of complex, dynamic scenes, while preserving
the integrity of unedited content. To address this, we introduce Mono4DEditor,
a novel framework for flexible and accurate text-driven 4D scene editing. Our
method augments 3D Gaussians with quantized CLIP features to form a
language-embedded dynamic representation, enabling efficient semantic querying
of arbitrary spatial regions. We further propose a two-stage point-level
localization strategy that first selects candidate Gaussians via CLIP
similarity and then refines their spatial extent to improve accuracy. Finally,
targeted edits are performed on localized regions using a diffusion-based video
editing model, with flow and scribble guidance ensuring spatial fidelity and
temporal coherence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Mono4DEditor enables
high-quality, text-driven edits across diverse scenes and object types, while
preserving the appearance and geometry of unedited areas and surpassing prior
approaches in both flexibility and visual fidelity.

Motivation: 现有学习方法在真实低光场景中仍难以处理严重噪声，主要原因是无法有效利用时间信息。

Method: 两阶段框架：第一阶段使用视觉状态空间块进行多帧对齐，恢复亮度、颜色和结构；第二阶段引入基于动态权重的时间聚合循环细化模块，通过光流指导自适应平衡静态和动态区域。

Conclusion: DWTA-Net通过联合利用短期和长期时间线索，成功解决了低光视频增强中的噪声问题，实现了高质量的增强效果。

Abstract: Low-light video enhancement (LLVE) is challenging due to noise, low contrast,
and color degradations. Learning-based approaches offer fast inference but
still struggle with heavy noise in real low-light scenes, primarily due to
limitations in effectively leveraging temporal information. In this paper, we
address this issue with DWTA-Net, a novel two-stage framework that jointly
exploits short- and long-term temporal cues. Stage I employs Visual State-Space
blocks for multi-frame alignment, recovering brightness, color, and structure
with local consistency. Stage II introduces a recurrent refinement module with
dynamic weight-based temporal aggregation guided by optical flow, adaptively
balancing static and dynamic regions. A texture-adaptive loss further preserves
fine details while promoting smoothness in flat areas. Experiments on
real-world low-light videos show that DWTA-Net effectively suppresses noise and
artifacts, delivering superior visual quality compared with state-of-the-art

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了SilvaScenes数据集，用于从林下图像进行树种实例分割，包含5个生物气候域的1476棵树和24个树种，展示了树种分类比树分割更具挑战性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 森林管理中的机器人技术需要先进的感知能力，但现有数据集往往关注城市环境或有限树种，无法满足复杂自然环境下的需求。

Method: 在加拿大魁北克五个生物气候域收集林下图像，由林业专家标注1476棵树和24个树种，构建SilvaScenes数据集，并基准测试现代深度学习方法。

Result: 树分割相对容易，最高mAP达67.65%，但树种分类极具挑战性，mAP仅为35.69%。

Conclusion: SilvaScenes数据集填补了森林环境感知数据集的空白，显示树种分类仍是重大挑战，为未来研究提供了基准。

Abstract: Interest in robotics for forest management is growing, but perception in
complex, natural environments remains a significant hurdle. Conditions such as
heavy occlusion, variable lighting, and dense vegetation pose challenges to
automated systems, which are essential for precision forestry, biodiversity
monitoring, and the automation of forestry equipment. These tasks rely on
advanced perceptual capabilities, such as detection and fine-grained species
classification of individual trees. Yet, existing datasets are inadequate to
develop such perception systems, as they often focus on urban settings or a
limited number of species. To address this, we present SilvaScenes, a new
dataset for instance segmentation of tree species from under-canopy images.
Collected across five bioclimatic domains in Quebec, Canada, SilvaScenes
features 1476 trees from 24 species with annotations from forestry experts. We
demonstrate the relevance and challenging nature of our dataset by benchmarking
modern deep learning approaches for instance segmentation. Our results show
that, while tree segmentation is easy, with a top mean average precision (mAP)
of 67.65%, species classification remains a significant challenge with an mAP
of only 35.69%. Our dataset and source code will be available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种维度熵最大化方法，通过正则化文本特征分布来缓解对比视觉语言模型中主导维度的影响，从而改善测试时提示调优的校准性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对比视觉语言模型存在模态间隙问题，由跨模态的单一主导特征维度引起。这些主导维度具有高预测敏感性，限制其影响可以改善校准误差。

Method: 提出维度熵最大化方法，通过正则化文本特征分布使其趋向均匀分布，从而减轻对主导维度的依赖。

Result: 该方法缓解了测试时提示调优中校准性能的退化，提高了视觉语言模型在真实部署场景中的可靠性。

Conclusion: 维度熵最大化为视觉语言模型提供了一种简单有效的解决方案，通过处理主导维度问题来增强模型的校准性能和可靠性。

Abstract: Test-time adaptation paradigm provides flexibility towards domain shifts by
performing immediate adaptation on unlabeled target data from the source model.
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) leverage their generalization capabilities for
diverse downstream tasks, and test-time prompt tuning has emerged as a
prominent solution for adapting VLMs. In this work, we explore contrastive VLMs
and identify the modality gap caused by a single dominant feature dimension
across modalities. We observe that the dominant dimensions in both text and
image modalities exhibit high predictive sensitivity, and that constraining
their influence can improve calibration error. Building on this insight, we
propose dimensional entropy maximization that regularizes the distribution of
textual features toward uniformity to mitigate the dependency of dominant
dimensions. Our method alleviates the degradation of calibration performance in
test-time prompt tuning, offering a simple yet effective solution to enhance
the reliability of VLMs in real-world deployment scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于DreamBooth的多令牌策略，结合LoRA高效微调，解决从少量参考角色生成无限新角色同时保持艺术风格的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决动画和游戏行业需要从少量人工设计角色生成大量新角色，同时保持原始艺术风格和视觉特征的挑战。

Method: 基于DreamBooth微调文本到图像扩散模型，采用多令牌策略（为单个角色和集体风格分配独立令牌），结合LoRA参数高效微调，移除类别特定正则化集，在生成时引入随机令牌和嵌入。

Result: 在五个小型专业数据集上的评估显示，该方法能生成高质量、多样化的角色，同时保持参考角色的独特美学特征，人类评估进一步证实了其有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了从少量参考角色无限生成新角色的目标，同时保持了原始艺术风格，为动画和游戏创作提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: The audiovisual industry is undergoing a profound transformation as it is
integrating AI developments not only to automate routine tasks but also to
inspire new forms of art. This paper addresses the problem of producing a
virtually unlimited number of novel characters that preserve the artistic style
and shared visual traits of a small set of human-designed reference characters,
thus broadening creative possibilities in animation, gaming, and related
domains. Our solution builds upon DreamBooth, a well-established fine-tuning
technique for text-to-image diffusion models, and adapts it to tackle two core
challenges: capturing intricate character details beyond textual prompts and
the few-shot nature of the training data. To achieve this, we propose a
multi-token strategy, using clustering to assign separate tokens to individual
characters and their collective style, combined with LoRA-based
parameter-efficient fine-tuning. By removing the class-specific regularization
set and introducing random tokens and embeddings during generation, our
approach allows for unlimited character creation while preserving the learned
style. We evaluate our method on five small specialized datasets, comparing it
to relevant baselines using both quantitative metrics and a human evaluation
study. Our results demonstrate that our approach produces high-quality, diverse
characters while preserving the distinctive aesthetic features of the reference
characters, with human evaluation further reinforcing its effectiveness and
highlighting the potential of our method.

Motivation: 当前交互式医学图像分割评估方法不一致且缺乏临床现实性，阻碍了公平比较和真实性能评估，需要建立标准化的评估框架。

Method: 提出了基于临床的评估任务和指标定义方法，构建了用于标准化评估管道的软件框架，并在异质复杂任务上评估了最先进的算法。

Result: 发现：(1)最小化用户交互处理中的信息损失对模型鲁棒性至关重要；(2)自适应缩放机制提升鲁棒性和收敛速度；(3)验证提示行为/预算与训练不一致会导致性能下降；(4)2D方法在板状图像和粗略目标上表现良好，但3D上下文有助于处理大或不规则形状目标；(5)非医学领域模型在对比度差和复杂形状时性能下降。

Conclusion: 建立了临床相关的交互式分割评估标准，揭示了关键性能影响因素，为开发更鲁棒和通用的医学图像分割算法提供了指导。

Abstract: Interactive segmentation is a promising strategy for building robust,
generalisable algorithms for volumetric medical image segmentation. However,
inconsistent and clinically unrealistic evaluation hinders fair comparison and
misrepresents real-world performance. We propose a clinically grounded
methodology for defining evaluation tasks and metrics, and built a software
framework for constructing standardised evaluation pipelines. We evaluate
state-of-the-art algorithms across heterogeneous and complex tasks and observe
that (i) minimising information loss when processing user interactions is
critical for model robustness, (ii) adaptive-zooming mechanisms boost
robustness and speed convergence, (iii) performance drops if validation
prompting behaviour/budgets differ from training, (iv) 2D methods perform well
with slab-like images and coarse targets, but 3D context helps with large or
irregularly shaped targets, (v) performance of non-medical-domain models (e.g.
SAM2) degrades with poor contrast and complex shapes.

TL;DR: PhysToolBench是首个专门评估多模态大语言模型对物理工具理解能力的基准测试，包含1000多个图像-文本对，评估工具识别、工具理解和工具创造三个难度层次的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然现代MLLMs利用其广泛常识知识在具身AI中进行高层规划，但它们在物理工具理解方面的真实能力尚未量化，需要专门的评估基准。

Method: 构建包含1000多个图像-文本对的VQA数据集，通过三个难度层次（工具识别、工具理解、工具创造）来系统评估32个MLLMs的物理工具理解能力。

Result: 对32个MLLMs的全面评估显示，在工具理解方面存在显著缺陷，特别是在理解工具操作原理和创造新工具方面表现不佳。

Conclusion: 当前MLLMs在物理工具理解方面存在明显不足，需要进一步改进，作者提供了深入分析和初步解决方案，代码和数据集已公开。

Abstract: The ability to use, understand, and create tools is a hallmark of human
intelligence, enabling sophisticated interaction with the physical world. For
any general-purpose intelligent agent to achieve true versatility, it must also
master these fundamental skills. While modern Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) leverage their extensive common knowledge for high-level planning in
embodied AI and in downstream Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, the extent
of their true understanding of physical tools remains unquantified. To bridge
this gap, we present PhysToolBench, the first benchmark dedicated to evaluating
the comprehension of physical tools by MLLMs. Our benchmark is structured as a
Visual Question Answering (VQA) dataset comprising over 1,000 image-text pairs.
It assesses capabilities across three distinct difficulty levels: (1) Tool
Recognition: Requiring the recognition of a tool's primary function. (2) Tool
Understanding: Testing the ability to grasp the underlying principles of a
tool's operation. (3) Tool Creation: Challenging the model to fashion a new
tool from surrounding objects when conventional options are unavailable. Our
comprehensive evaluation of 32 MLLMs-spanning proprietary, open-source,
specialized embodied, and backbones in VLAs-reveals a significant deficiency in
tool understanding. Furthermore, we provide an in-depth analysis and propose
preliminary solutions. Code and dataset are publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 三星智能手机存在对角线伪影问题，影响PRNU相机源验证。高端的S系列支持PRO模式拍摄RAW图像可避免此问题，但中端A系列无法使用RAW图像。这些伪影也可用于法证应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究三星智能手机对角线伪影对PRNU相机源验证的影响，以及如何利用这些伪影进行法证分析。

Method: 分析三星Galaxy S系列和A系列图像中的对角线伪影模式，比较RAW图像和JPEG图像在PRNU验证中的表现。

Result: 发现某些Galaxy S和A系列存在共同的伪影模式导致指纹碰撞，但支持PRO模式的设备使用RAW图像可进行可靠的PRNU验证。伪影还可用于减少HDR图像误检和定位人像模式中的合成虚化区域。

Conclusion: 三星智能手机的对角线伪影对PRNU验证构成挑战，但可通过RAW图像规避。这些伪影在法证应用中也有潜在价值。

Abstract: We investigate diagonal artifacts present in images captured by several
Samsung smartphones and their impact on PRNU-based camera source verification.
We first show that certain Galaxy S series models share a common pattern
causing fingerprint collisions, with a similar issue also found in some Galaxy
A models. Next, we demonstrate that reliable PRNU verification remains feasible
for devices supporting PRO mode with raw capture, since raw images bypass the
processing pipeline that introduces artifacts. This option, however, is not
available for the mid-range A series models or in forensic cases without access
to raw images. Finally, we outline potential forensic applications of the
diagonal artifacts, such as reducing misdetections in HDR images and localizing
regions affected by synthetic bokeh in portrait-mode images.

*PeiHuang Zheng,Yunlong Zhao,Zheng Cui,Yang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PRNet是一个实时检测框架，通过保留和有效利用原始浅层空间特征来增强小目标表示，在计算约束下实现了优于现有方法的精度-效率权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决航拍图像中小目标检测因像素表示有限导致特征提取过程中信息严重退化的问题，现有FPN方法通过后处理增强但重建细节往往偏离原始图像信息。

Method: 提出PRNet框架，包含两个模块：渐进式精化颈部（PRN）通过骨干网络重用和迭代精化实现空间-语义对齐；增强切片采样（ESSamp）通过优化重排和卷积在降采样过程中保留浅层信息。

Result: 在VisDrone、AI-TOD和UAVDT数据集上的广泛实验表明，PRNet在可比较的计算约束下优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: PRNet通过优先保留和有效利用原始浅层空间特征，成功提升了小目标检测的性能，实现了优越的精度-效率权衡。

Abstract: Small object detection in aerial images suffers from severe information
degradation during feature extraction due to limited pixel representations,
where shallow spatial details fail to align effectively with semantic
information, leading to frequent misses and false positives. Existing FPN-based
methods attempt to mitigate these losses through post-processing enhancements,
but the reconstructed details often deviate from the original image
information, impeding their fusion with semantic content. To address this
limitation, we propose PRNet, a real-time detection framework that prioritizes
the preservation and efficient utilization of primitive shallow spatial
features to enhance small object representations. PRNet achieves this via two
modules:the Progressive Refinement Neck (PRN) for spatial-semantic alignment
through backbone reuse and iterative refinement, and the Enhanced SliceSamp
(ESSamp) for preserving shallow information during downsampling via optimized
rearrangement and convolution. Extensive experiments on the VisDrone, AI-TOD,
and UAVDT datasets demonstrate that PRNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods
under comparable computational constraints, achieving superior
accuracy-efficiency trade-offs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多层感知机作为隐式神经表示进行变形建模时，需要昂贵的正则化，导致训练不稳定且特征对齐效果不佳。

Method: 将变形重新定义为微分向量流的构造，通过将结构流属性直接编码到网络架构中，确保连续性、可逆性和时间一致性。

Result: 在面部变形、图像变形和高斯溅射变形等多种应用中，FLOWING实现了最先进的变形质量，收敛速度更快。

Conclusion: 基于流的变形方法能够产生原理性且稳定的变换，实现准确且结构保持的变形。

Abstract: Morphing is a long-standing problem in vision and computer graphics,
requiring a time-dependent warping for feature alignment and a blending for
smooth interpolation. Recently, multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) have been
explored as implicit neural representations (INRs) for modeling such
deformations, due to their meshlessness and differentiability; however,
extracting coherent and accurate morphings from standard MLPs typically relies
on costly regularizations, which often lead to unstable training and prevent
effective feature alignment. To overcome these limitations, we propose FLOWING
(FLOW morphING), a framework that recasts warping as the construction of a
differential vector flow, naturally ensuring continuity, invertibility, and
temporal coherence by encoding structural flow properties directly into the
network architectures. This flow-centric approach yields principled and stable
transformations, enabling accurate and structure-preserving morphing of both 2D
images and 3D shapes. Extensive experiments across a range of applications -
including face and image morphing, as well as Gaussian Splatting morphing -
show that FLOWING achieves state-of-the-art morphing quality with faster
convergence. Code and pretrained models are available at

*Minkyoung Cho,Ruben Ohana,Christian Jacobsen,Adityan Jothi,Min-Hung Chen,Z. Morley Mao,Ethem Can*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出TC-LoRA（时间调制条件LoRA），一种通过超网络动态生成LoRA适配器的方法，在扩散过程的每个步骤中根据时间和用户条件调整模型权重，实现动态、上下文感知的控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前可控扩散模型使用静态条件策略处理动态多阶段去噪过程，限制了模型在生成从粗结构到精细细节演变过程中的适应能力。

Method: 使用超网络实时生成LoRA适配器，根据扩散步骤时间和用户条件为冻结主干网络定制权重修改，实现参数化动态控制。

Result: 在各种数据域的实验表明，这种动态参数控制相比静态激活方法显著提高了生成保真度和空间条件遵循度。

Conclusion: TC-LoRA建立了一种替代方法，通过更深层次的权重功能适应来修改模型的条件策略，使控制能够与任务和生成阶段的动态需求保持一致。

Abstract: Current controllable diffusion models typically rely on fixed architectures
that modify intermediate activations to inject guidance conditioned on a new
modality. This approach uses a static conditioning strategy for a dynamic,
multi-stage denoising process, limiting the model's ability to adapt its
response as the generation evolves from coarse structure to fine detail. We
introduce TC-LoRA (Temporally Modulated Conditional LoRA), a new paradigm that
enables dynamic, context-aware control by conditioning the model's weights
directly. Our framework uses a hypernetwork to generate LoRA adapters
on-the-fly, tailoring weight modifications for the frozen backbone at each
diffusion step based on time and the user's condition. This mechanism enables
the model to learn and execute an explicit, adaptive strategy for applying
conditional guidance throughout the entire generation process. Through
experiments on various data domains, we demonstrate that this dynamic,
parametric control significantly enhances generative fidelity and adherence to
spatial conditions compared to static, activation-based methods. TC-LoRA
establishes an alternative approach in which the model's conditioning strategy
is modified through a deeper functional adaptation of its weights, allowing
control to align with the dynamic demands of the task and generative stage.

TL;DR: FSP-DETR是一个统一的生物医学检测框架，能够在单个模型中实现少样本检测、开放集识别和跨任务泛化，显著优于现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物医学目标检测面临标注数据稀缺、新类别频繁出现的问题，现有方法通常孤立处理这些任务

Method: 基于类别无关的DETR骨干网络，通过原始支持图像构建类别原型，使用增强视图和轻量级transformer解码器学习嵌入空间，联合优化原型匹配损失、对齐分离损失和KL散度正则化

Result: 在卵细胞、血细胞和疟疾检测任务上的广泛实验表明，FSP-DETR显著优于现有少样本和基于原型的检测器，特别是在少样本和开放集场景下

Conclusion: FSP-DETR提供了一个统一的框架，能够在推理时灵活支持未见类别识别、背景拒绝和跨任务适应，无需重新训练

Abstract: Object detection in biomedical settings is fundamentally constrained by the
scarcity of labeled data and the frequent emergence of novel or rare
categories. We present FSP-DETR, a unified detection framework that enables
robust few-shot detection, open-set recognition, and generalization to unseen
biomedical tasks within a single model. Built upon a class-agnostic DETR
backbone, our approach constructs class prototypes from original support images
and learns an embedding space using augmented views and a lightweight
transformer decoder. Training jointly optimizes a prototype matching loss, an
alignment-based separation loss, and a KL divergence regularization to improve
discriminative feature learning and calibration under scarce supervision.
Unlike prior work that tackles these tasks in isolation, FSP-DETR enables
inference-time flexibility to support unseen class recognition, background
rejection, and cross-task adaptation without retraining. We also introduce a
new ova species detection benchmark with 20 parasite classes and establish
standardized evaluation protocols. Extensive experiments across ova, blood
cell, and malaria detection tasks demonstrate that FSP-DETR significantly
outperforms prior few-shot and prototype-based detectors, especially in
low-shot and open-set scenarios.

Conclusion: 研究趋势显示多模态和生成方法的主导地位，参数高效适应成为主流，训练实践从从头构建编码器转向指令调优和微调强骨干网络。跨会议比较显示CVPR在3D领域更强，ICLR在VLM领域占比最高。

Abstract: We present a transparent, reproducible measurement of research trends across
26,104 accepted papers from CVPR, ICLR, and NeurIPS spanning 2023-2025. Titles
and abstracts are normalized, phrase-protected, and matched against a
hand-crafted lexicon to assign up to 35 topical labels and mine fine-grained
cues about tasks, architectures, training regimes, objectives, datasets, and
co-mentioned modalities. The analysis quantifies three macro shifts: (1) a
sharp rise of multimodal vision-language-LLM work, which increasingly reframes
classic perception as instruction following and multi-step reasoning; (2)
steady expansion of generative methods, with diffusion research consolidating
around controllability, distillation, and speed; and (3) resilient 3D and video
activity, with composition moving from NeRFs to Gaussian splatting and a
growing emphasis on human- and agent-centric understanding. Within VLMs,
parameter-efficient adaptation like prompting/adapters/LoRA and lightweight
vision-language bridges dominate; training practice shifts from building
encoders from scratch to instruction tuning and finetuning strong backbones;
contrastive objectives recede relative to cross-entropy/ranking and
distillation. Cross-venue comparisons show CVPR has a stronger 3D footprint and
ICLR the highest VLM share, while reliability themes such as efficiency or
robustness diffuse across areas. We release the lexicon and methodology to
enable auditing and extension. Limitations include lexicon recall and
abstract-only scope, but the longitudinal signals are consistent across venues
and years.

Abstract: With the current surge in spatial reasoning explorations, researchers have
made significant progress in understanding indoor scenes, but still struggle
with diverse applications such as robotics and autonomous driving. This paper
aims to advance all-scale spatial reasoning across diverse scenarios by
tackling two key challenges: 1) the heavy reliance on indoor 3D scans and
labor-intensive manual annotations for dataset curation; 2) the absence of
effective all-scale scene modeling, which often leads to overfitting to
individual scenes. In this paper, we introduce a holistic solution that
integrates a structured spatial reasoning knowledge system, scale-aware
modeling, and a progressive training paradigm, as the first attempt to broaden
the all-scale spatial intelligence of MLLMs to the best of our knowledge. Using
a task-specific, specialist-driven automated pipeline, we curate over 38K video
scenes across 5 spatial scales to create SpaceVista-1M, a dataset comprising
approximately 1M spatial QA pairs spanning 19 diverse task types. While
specialist models can inject useful domain knowledge, they are not reliable for
evaluation. We then build an all-scale benchmark with precise annotations by
manually recording, retrieving, and assembling video-based data. However, naive
training with SpaceVista-1M often yields suboptimal results due to the
potential knowledge conflict. Accordingly, we introduce SpaceVista-7B, a
spatial reasoning model that accepts dense inputs beyond semantics and uses
scale as an anchor for scale-aware experts and progressive rewards. Finally,
extensive evaluations across 5 benchmarks, including our SpaceVista-Bench,
demonstrate competitive performance, showcasing strong generalization across
all scales and scenarios. Our dataset, model, and benchmark will be released on
https://peiwensun2000.github.io/mm2km .

TL;DR: 提出基于蒸馏的框架，通过将预训练小动作模型的知识转移到视觉语言模型中，使VLM具备动作执行能力，显著降低训练成本并提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言动作模型虽然提升了机器人操作的泛化能力，但从头训练成本高昂。需要一种高效的方法来赋予现有VLM动作执行能力。

Method: 采用两阶段训练策略：1) 轻量级对齐，将VLM隐藏状态映射到小动作模型的动作空间；2) 选择性微调语言模型、状态编码器和动作模块。添加动作令牌和状态编码器来整合物理输入。

Result: 在LIBERO上达到97.3%平均成功率（提升11.8%），在LIBERO-LONG上达到93.5%（提升24.5%）。真实世界实验中在5个操作任务上达到82.0%成功率（提升17%）。

Conclusion: 动作蒸馏能有效使VLM生成精确动作，同时大幅降低训练成本，在仿真和真实环境中均优于现有方法。

Abstract: Vision-Language Action (VLA) models significantly advance robotic
manipulation by leveraging the strong perception capabilities of pretrained
vision-language models (VLMs). By integrating action modules into these
pretrained models, VLA methods exhibit improved generalization. However,
training them from scratch is costly. In this work, we propose a simple yet
effective distillation-based framework that equips VLMs with action-execution
capability by transferring knowledge from pretrained small action models. Our
architecture retains the original VLM structure, adding only an action token
and a state encoder to incorporate physical inputs. To distill action
knowledge, we adopt a two-stage training strategy. First, we perform
lightweight alignment by mapping VLM hidden states into the action space of the
small action model, enabling effective reuse of its pretrained action decoder
and avoiding expensive pretraining. Second, we selectively fine-tune the
language model, state encoder, and action modules, enabling the system to
integrate multimodal inputs with precise action generation. Specifically, the
action token provides the VLM with a direct handle for predicting future
actions, while the state encoder allows the model to incorporate robot dynamics
not captured by vision alone. This design yields substantial efficiency gains
over training large VLA models from scratch. Compared with previous
state-of-the-art methods, our method achieves 97.3% average success rate on
LIBERO (11.8% improvement) and 93.5% on LIBERO-LONG (24.5% improvement). In
real-world experiments across five manipulation tasks, our method consistently
outperforms the teacher model, achieving 82.0% success rate (17% improvement),
which demonstrate that action distillation effectively enables VLMs to generate
precise actions while substantially reducing training costs.

TL;DR: StreamingVLM是一个专为实时处理无限视觉输入而设计的视觉语言模型，通过统一的训练-推理对齐框架和紧凑的KV缓存管理，解决了长视频处理中的计算复杂度和延迟问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在处理无限视频流时面临计算成本高、延迟大和内存使用激增的问题，无法满足实时助手和自主代理的需求。

Method: 采用统一的训练-推理对齐框架，通过监督微调策略在短重叠视频块上应用完整注意力，模拟推理时的注意力模式，同时维护包含注意力下沉点、近期视觉标记和文本标记的紧凑KV缓存。

Result: 在Inf-Streams-Eval基准测试中，StreamingVLM以66.18%的胜率击败GPT-4O mini，在单个NVIDIA H100上实现高达8 FPS的稳定实时性能，并在LongVideoBench和OVOBench Realtime上分别提升4.30和5.96分。

Conclusion: StreamingVLM通过创新的流式处理框架有效解决了长视频理解的计算挑战，不仅实现了实时性能，还提升了通用视觉问答能力，为实时视觉语言应用提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) could power real-time assistants and autonomous
agents, but they face a critical challenge: understanding near-infinite video
streams without escalating latency and memory usage. Processing entire videos
with full attention leads to quadratic computational costs and poor performance
on long videos. Meanwhile, simple sliding window methods are also flawed, as
they either break coherence or suffer from high latency due to redundant
recomputation. In this paper, we introduce StreamingVLM, a model designed for
real-time, stable understanding of infinite visual input. Our approach is a
unified framework that aligns training with streaming inference. During
inference, we maintain a compact KV cache by reusing states of attention sinks,
a short window of recent vision tokens, and a long window of recent text
tokens. This streaming ability is instilled via a simple supervised fine-tuning
(SFT) strategy that applies full attention on short, overlapped video chunks,
which effectively mimics the inference-time attention pattern without training
on prohibitively long contexts. For evaluation, we build Inf-Streams-Eval, a
new benchmark with videos averaging over two hours that requires dense,
per-second alignment between frames and text. On Inf-Streams-Eval, StreamingVLM
achieves a 66.18% win rate against GPT-4O mini and maintains stable, real-time
performance at up to 8 FPS on a single NVIDIA H100. Notably, our SFT strategy
also enhances general VQA abilities without any VQA-specific fine-tuning,
improving performance on LongVideoBench by +4.30 and OVOBench Realtime by
+5.96. Code is available at https://github.com/mit-han-lab/streaming-vlm.

*Ritesh Mehta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 评估GLiNER-BioMed模型在BioASQ数据集上的表现，引入基于词典的后处理策略来解决基因和化学物质等相似实体类型的误分类问题。后处理在开发集上显著提升性能（F1从0.79到0.83），但在盲测集上未能泛化（F1从0.79降到0.77）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决生物医学命名实体识别中相似实体类型（如基因和化学物质）难以区分的问题，提升模型在真实场景中的实用性。

Method: 使用GLiNER-BioMed模型，并引入基于词典的后处理策略来修正常见误分类，同时探索了条件随机场等替代方法。

Result: 后处理在开发集上显著提升性能（微F1从0.79到0.83），但在盲测集上表现不佳（微F1从0.79降到0.77），表明存在过拟合问题。

Conclusion: 基于词典的细化方法对预训练BioNER模型有潜力，但需解决对开发数据的过拟合问题，确保在真实世界应用中的稳健泛化能力。

Abstract: Biomedical Named Entity Recognition (BioNER), task6 in BioASQ (A challenge in
large-scale biomedical semantic indexing and question answering), is crucial
for extracting information from scientific literature but faces hurdles such as
distinguishing between similar entity types like genes and chemicals. This
study evaluates the GLiNER-BioMed model on a BioASQ dataset and introduces a
targeted dictionary-based post-processing strategy to address common
misclassifications. While this post-processing approach demonstrated notable
improvement on our development set, increasing the micro F1-score from a
baseline of 0.79 to 0.83, this enhancement did not generalize to the blind test
set, where the post-processed model achieved a micro F1-score of 0.77 compared
to the baselines 0.79. We also discuss insights gained from exploring
alternative methodologies, including Conditional Random Fields. This work
highlights the potential of dictionary-based refinement for pre-trained BioNER
models but underscores the critical challenge of overfitting to development
data and the necessity of ensuring robust generalization for real-world
applicability.

### [95] [Less Diverse, Less Safe: The Indirect But Pervasive Risk of Test-Time Scaling in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08592)
*Shahriar Kabir Nahin,Hadi Askari,Muhao Chen,Anshuman Chhabra*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Test-Time Scaling (TTS) 方法存在一个未被识别的失败模式：当候选答案多样性受限时，TTS 更可能产生不安全输出。研究者提出了 RefDiv 攻击方法来测试 TTS 管道的安全性，发现现有安全防护措施对此类攻击防护有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TTS 方法假设候选答案的多样性能够提高可靠性，但本研究揭示当多样性受限时，TTS 反而更容易产生不安全输出，这是一个之前未被认识到的安全漏洞。

Method: 提出 RefDiv（参考引导多样性减少协议）作为诊断攻击方法，在四个开源模型和两种 TTS 策略上进行广泛实验，测试多样性受限对安全性的影响。

Result: 多样性受限显著增加了 TTS 产生不安全结果的概率，这种影响甚至比高对抗性意图的提示更强。现有安全防护分类器无法有效检测 RefDiv 生成的对抗性输入提示。

Conclusion: TTS 存在基于多样性的安全漏洞，需要设计更鲁棒的 TTS 策略来抵御此类多样性导向的压力测试。

Abstract: Test-Time Scaling (TTS) improves LLM reasoning by exploring multiple
candidate responses and then operating over this set to find the best output. A
tacit premise behind TTS is that sufficiently diverse candidate pools enhance
reliability. In this work, we show that this assumption in TTS introduces a
previously unrecognized failure mode. When candidate diversity is curtailed,
even by a modest amount, TTS becomes much more likely to produce unsafe
outputs. We present a reference-guided diversity reduction protocol (RefDiv)
that serves as a diagnostic attack to stress test TTS pipelines. Through
extensive experiments across four open-source models (Qwen3, Mistral, Llama3.1,
Gemma3) and two widely used TTS strategies (Monte Carlo Tree Search and
Best-of-N), constraining diversity consistently signifies the rate at which TTS
produces unsafe results. The effect is often stronger than that produced by
prompts directly with high adversarial intent scores. This observed phenomenon
also transfers across TTS strategies and to closed-source models (e.g. OpenAI
o3 and Gemini-2.5-Pro), thus indicating that this is a general and extant
property of TTS rather than a model-specific artifact. Additionally, we find
that numerous widely used safety guardrail classifiers (e.g. Llama-Guard and
OpenAI Moderation API), are unable to flag the adversarial input prompts
generated by RefDiv, demonstrating that existing defenses offer limited
protection against this diversity-driven failure mode. Through this work, we
hope to motivate future research on designing robust TTS strategies that are
both effective and secure against diversity-targeted stress tests as
illustrated by RefDiv.

*Yuxin Li,Eng Siong Chng,Cuntai Guan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出HAREN-CTC模型，通过整合多层自监督学习特征和CTC损失，解决语音抑郁症检测中特征提取困难和稀疏时间监督的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语音抑郁症检测方法通常只使用自监督学习模型的最后一层或单一最佳层，无法充分利用层次结构来检测细微且持续的抑郁信号，容易过拟合特定数据集。

Method: HAREN-CTC结合多层SSL特征，使用交叉注意力机制和多任务学习框架，包含层次自适应聚类模块和跨模态融合模块，并采用CTC损失处理稀疏时间监督。

Result: 在DAIC-WOZ和MODMA数据集上分别达到0.81和0.82的宏F1分数，在两个评估场景下均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HAREN-CTC通过有效整合多层SSL特征和CTC对齐感知训练，显著提升了语音抑郁症检测的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Speech-based depression detection (SDD) is a promising, non-invasive
alternative to traditional clinical assessments. However, it remains limited by
the difficulty of extracting meaningful features and capturing sparse,
heterogeneous depressive cues over time. Pretrained self-supervised learning
(SSL) models such as WavLM provide rich, multi-layer speech representations,
yet most existing SDD methods rely only on the final layer or search for a
single best-performing one. These approaches often overfit to specific datasets
and fail to leverage the full hierarchical structure needed to detect subtle
and persistent depression signals.
  To address this challenge, we propose HAREN-CTC, a novel architecture that
integrates multi-layer SSL features using cross-attention within a multitask
learning framework, combined with Connectionist Temporal Classification loss to
handle sparse temporal supervision. HAREN-CTC comprises two key modules: a
Hierarchical Adaptive Clustering module that reorganizes SSL features into
complementary embeddings, and a Cross-Modal Fusion module that models
inter-layer dependencies through cross-attention. The CTC objective enables
alignment-aware training, allowing the model to track irregular temporal
patterns of depressive speech cues.
  We evaluate HAREN-CTC under both an upper-bound setting with standard data
splits and a generalization setting using five-fold cross-validation. The model
achieves state-of-the-art macro F1-scores of 0.81 on DAIC-WOZ and 0.82 on
MODMA, outperforming prior methods across both evaluation scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出了一个评估数学推理能力的新框架，通过分析GPT-3.5在GSM8K数据集上的推理步骤，识别特定失败点并量化不同推理模式的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI模型数学理解程度的评估问题，超越传统基准测试，诊断具体的推理失败点。

Method: 使用GPT-3.5生成结构化推理步骤，然后用GPT-4o-mini分类错误并进行无监督聚类，识别涌现的"推理模式"。

Result: 发现模型在顺序计算等程序性推理模式上表现近乎完美，但在需要组合推理的限制条件下表现急剧下降，显示出非人类式的脆弱性。

Conclusion: 通过识别和量化不同推理技能的可靠性，为评估数学理解提供了更细粒度的方法，并为开发新能力和更可靠应用提供了精确路线图。

Abstract: A central question in artificial intelligence is the extent to which machine
learning models comprehend mathematics. To address this, we propose a novel
framework for measuring mathematical reasoning that moves beyond standard
benchmarks to diagnose specific failure points. Our method first generates
structured, step-by-step reasoning from gpt-3.5-turbo on the GSM8K dataset. We
then use a more capable analyst model, gpt-4o-mini, to categorize errors and,
crucially, perform an unsupervised clustering of every reasoning sentence to
identify emergent "reasoning modes." This analysis reveals a cognitive profile
with a stark, nonhuman-like brittleness: while the model achieves near-perfect
accuracy on procedural modes like sequential calculation, its performance on
modes requiring combinatorial reasoning with restrictions plummets. By
identifying and quantifying the reliability of these distinct reasoning skills,
our work provides a more granular method to evaluate mathematical comprehension
and offers a precise roadmap for developing new capabilities and more reliable
future applications.

### [98] [Confidence, Not Perplexity: A Better Metric for the Creative Era of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08596)
*V. S. Raghu Parupudi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Confidence Score(CS)作为无参考指标，缓解传统基于流畅度指标对创意文本生成的偏见，相比self-perplexity等指标更公平地评估创造性内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统无参考指标如self-perplexity对创意文本生成存在强烈偏见，倾向于惩罚新颖性内容，需要更平衡的评估方法。

Method: 从模型输出概率分布中推导出Confidence Score(CS)，作为替代指标来评估文本生成质量。

Result: 在99个创意提示上，基于流畅度的指标在0%情况下偏好新颖回答，而CS在19%情况下偏好新颖回答，差异显著(95% CI: [11.1%, 27.3%])。CS还能有效区分不同难度任务。

Conclusion: Confidence Score减轻了传统指标对创造力的偏见，同时保留了核心评估优势，为现代LLM提供更平衡的评估方案。

Abstract: Reference-free metrics like self-perplexity are strongly biased against
creative text generation. We propose the Confidence Score (CS), derived from a
model's output probability distribution, as a less biased alternative.
Experiments on gpt-4o-mini show that while fluency-based metrics prefer novel
responses in 0\% of cases on 99 creative prompts, our CS does so 19% of the
time, a statistically significant difference (95% CI for difference: [11.1%,
27.3%]). We also show that CS effectively distinguishes between easy, medium,
and hard tasks, confirmed by non-overlapping confidence intervals. The
Confidence Score thus mitigates the creativity bias of traditional metrics
while retaining their core evaluative strengths, offering a more balanced
assessment for modern LLMs.

*Devleena Das,Rajeev Patwari,Ashish Sirasao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Recover-LoRA是一种轻量级、数据集无关的方法，通过合成数据和logit蒸馏学习选择性层的LoRA适配器，从模型权重退化中恢复语言模型精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化、剪枝、格式转换等推理优化可能导致语言模型功能退化，现有研究主要关注量化恢复，而本文关注从任何导致模型权重退化的源（如不当模型序列化）中恢复模型精度。

Method: 使用合成数据和logit蒸馏，在选择性层上学习LoRA适配器，使退化模型与其全精度模型对齐。

Result: 在多种小型语言模型（包括MHA和GQA注意力架构）上，Recover-LoRA能够恢复5-17%的模型精度。

Conclusion: Recover-LoRA提供了一种有效的方法来从各种模型权重退化源中恢复语言模型的任务性能。

Abstract: Inference optimizations such as quantization, pruning, format and datatype
conversion, model export, and serialization can lead to functional degradations
in language model task performance. While most efforts on performance recovery
for deployment focus on robust quantization techniques, we focus on recovering
model accuracies from any sources that degrade model weights, such as improper
model serialization. In this work, we propose Recover-LoRA, a lightweight and
dataset agnostic method to recover accuracy in degraded models. Recover-LoRA
uses synthetic data and logit distillation to learn LoRA adapters on selective
layers that facilitate aligning the degraded model to its full precision model.
We investigate the utility of Recover-LoRA across a diverse set of small
language models (SLMs), including models with varying attention architectures,
multi-head attention (MHA) and group-query attention (GQA), as well as several
evaluation datasets. Our results show that Recover-LoRA recovers model
accuracies by 5-17% on MHA and GQA SLMs.

*Aneesh Jonelagadda,Christina Hahn,Haoze Zheng,Salvatore Penachio*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Mnemosyne是一种受人类记忆启发的无监督长期记忆架构，专为边缘设备上的大语言模型设计，使用图结构存储和概率回忆机制，在医疗对话场景中显著优于传统检索增强方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前大语言模型内存系统在边缘设备上的局限性，传统方法要么依赖暴力扩展上下文，要么使用静态检索管道，无法处理语义相似但时间不同的重复对话。

Method: 采用图结构存储、模块化内容和冗余过滤器、内存提交和修剪机制，以及基于人类记忆建模的概率回忆（包含时间衰减和刷新过程），并引入浓缩的"核心摘要"来捕获用户个性特征。

Result: 在纵向医疗对话实验中，Mnemosyne在盲测人类评估中获得65.8%的胜率（基线RAG为31.1%），在LoCoMo基准测试中在时间推理和单跳检索方面达到最高分，总体得分54.6%排名第二，优于Mem0和OpenAI基线。

Conclusion: 通过边缘兼容且易于迁移的无监督内存架构，可以实现改进的事实回忆、增强的时间推理和更自然的用户响应，特别适用于纵向医疗助手等应用场景。

Abstract: Long-term memory is essential for natural, realistic dialogue. However,
current large language model (LLM) memory systems rely on either brute-force
context expansion or static retrieval pipelines that fail on edge-constrained
devices. We introduce Mnemosyne, an unsupervised, human-inspired long-term
memory architecture designed for edge-based LLMs. Our approach uses
graph-structured storage, modular substance and redundancy filters, memory
committing and pruning mechanisms, and probabilistic recall with temporal decay
and refresh processes modeled after human memory. Mnemosyne also introduces a
concentrated "core summary" efficiently derived from a fixed-length subset of
the memory graph to capture the user's personality and other domain-specific
long-term details such as, using healthcare application as an example,
post-recovery ambitions and attitude towards care. Unlike existing
retrieval-augmented methods, Mnemosyne is designed for use in longitudinal
healthcare assistants, where repetitive and semantically similar but temporally
distinct conversations are limited by naive retrieval. In experiments with
longitudinal healthcare dialogues, Mnemosyne demonstrates the highest win rate
of 65.8% in blind human evaluations of realism and long-term memory capability
compared to a baseline RAG win rate of 31.1%. Mnemosyne also achieves current
highest LoCoMo benchmark scores in temporal reasoning and single-hop retrieval
compared to other same-backboned techniques. Further, the average overall score
of 54.6% was second highest across all methods, beating commonly used Mem0 and
OpenAI baselines among others. This demonstrates that improved factual recall,
enhanced temporal reasoning, and much more natural user-facing responses can be
feasible with an edge-compatible and easily transferable unsupervised memory
architecture.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出将AI生成文本检测重新定义为离群检测问题，将人类文本视为分布外样本，机器生成文本视为分布内样本，使用单类学习和基于分数的方法实现更好的泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将AI文本检测视为二分类问题，但人类文本并不构成统一分布，导致分类器记忆OOD特征而非学习'非ID'行为的本质，限制了泛化能力。

Method: 使用单类学习方法（DeepSVDD和HRN）和基于分数的学习技术（如基于能量的方法），将人类文本作为分布外样本处理。

Result: 在DeepFake数据集上达到98.3%的AUROC和AUPR，FPR95仅为8.9%。在多语言、受攻击及未见模型和领域文本设置中均表现出鲁棒性和泛化性。

Conclusion: 将AI文本检测重新定义为OOD检测问题能显著提升检测器的泛化能力和鲁棒性，优于传统的二分类方法。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT,
DeepSeek, and Claude has significantly increased the presence of AI-generated
text in digital communication. This trend has heightened the need for reliable
detection methods to distinguish between human-authored and machine-generated
content. Existing approaches both zero-shot methods and supervised classifiers
largely conceptualize this task as a binary classification problem, often
leading to poor generalization across domains and models. In this paper, we
argue that such a binary formulation fundamentally mischaracterizes the
detection task by assuming a coherent representation of human-written texts. In
reality, human texts do not constitute a unified distribution, and their
diversity cannot be effectively captured through limited sampling. This causes
previous classifiers to memorize observed OOD characteristics rather than learn
the essence of `non-ID' behavior, limiting generalization to unseen
human-authored inputs. Based on this observation, we propose reframing the
detection task as an out-of-distribution (OOD) detection problem, treating
human-written texts as distributional outliers while machine-generated texts
are in-distribution (ID) samples. To this end, we develop a detection framework
using one-class learning method including DeepSVDD and HRN, and score-based
learning techniques such as energy-based method, enabling robust and
generalizable performance. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets
validate the effectiveness of our OOD-based approach. Specifically, the
OOD-based method achieves 98.3% AUROC and AUPR with only 8.9% FPR95 on DeepFake
dataset. Moreover, we test our detection framework on multilingual, attacked,
and unseen-model and -domain text settings, demonstrating the robustness and
generalizability of our framework. Code, pretrained weights, and demo will be
released.

TL;DR: YpathRAG是一个面向病理学的RAG框架，通过双通道混合检索和证据判断模块，显著提升了病理学领域的检索质量和事实可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在通用任务上表现优异，但在病理学等高门槛领域仍会产生幻觉。现有方法依赖领域微调，既不能扩展知识边界，也无法强制证据约束。

Method: 构建了包含28个子领域和153万段落的病理学向量数据库，采用双通道混合检索（BGE-M3密集检索+词汇引导稀疏检索）和基于LLM的支持性证据判断模块，形成检索-判断-生成的闭环。

Result: 在YpathR基准测试中Recall@5达到98.64%，比基线提升23个百分点；在YpathQA-M的300个最具挑战性问题集上，将通用和医学LLM的准确率平均提升9.0%，最高提升15.6%。

Conclusion: YpathRAG显著改善了检索质量和事实可靠性，为面向病理学的RAG提供了可扩展的构建范式和可解释的评估方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel on general tasks yet still hallucinate in
high-barrier domains such as pathology. Prior work often relies on domain
fine-tuning, which neither expands the knowledge boundary nor enforces
evidence-grounded constraints. We therefore build a pathology vector database
covering 28 subfields and 1.53 million paragraphs, and present YpathRAG, a
pathology-oriented RAG framework with dual-channel hybrid retrieval (BGE-M3
dense retrieval coupled with vocabulary-guided sparse retrieval) and an
LLM-based supportive-evidence judgment module that closes the
retrieval-judgment-generation loop. We also release two evaluation benchmarks,
YpathR and YpathQA-M. On YpathR, YpathRAG attains Recall@5 of 98.64%, a gain of
23 percentage points over the baseline; on YpathQA-M, a set of the 300 most
challenging questions, it increases the accuracies of both general and medical
LLMs by 9.0% on average and up to 15.6%. These results demonstrate improved
retrieval quality and factual reliability, providing a scalable construction
paradigm and interpretable evaluation for pathology-oriented RAG.

Result: LatentBreak生成的提示更短、困惑度更低，在多个安全对齐模型上优于其他越狱算法

Conclusion: 基于潜在空间优化的语义替换方法能有效生成自然、低困惑度的对抗提示，规避现有防御机制

Abstract: Jailbreaks are adversarial attacks designed to bypass the built-in safety
mechanisms of large language models. Automated jailbreaks typically optimize an
adversarial suffix or adapt long prompt templates by forcing the model to
generate the initial part of a restricted or harmful response. In this work, we
show that existing jailbreak attacks that leverage such mechanisms to unlock
the model response can be detected by a straightforward perplexity-based
filtering on the input prompt. To overcome this issue, we propose LatentBreak,
a white-box jailbreak attack that generates natural adversarial prompts with
low perplexity capable of evading such defenses. LatentBreak substitutes words
in the input prompt with semantically-equivalent ones, preserving the initial
intent of the prompt, instead of adding high-perplexity adversarial suffixes or
long templates. These words are chosen by minimizing the distance in the latent
space between the representation of the adversarial prompt and that of harmless
requests. Our extensive evaluation shows that LatentBreak leads to shorter and
low-perplexity prompts, thus outperforming competing jailbreak algorithms
against perplexity-based filters on multiple safety-aligned models.

Motivation: 对话情感识别面临证据稀疏、局部化和跨模态异步的挑战，需要聚焦于情感热点区域来改善识别效果。

Method: 检测文本、音频和视频中的每句话热点，通过热点门控融合将热点与全局特征结合，使用路由混合对齐器对齐模态，并构建跨模态图编码对话结构。

Result: 在标准ERC基准测试中表现优于强基线模型，消融实验证实了热点门控融合和混合对齐器的有效性。

Conclusion: 热点中心视角为多模态学习提供了新思路，为ERC中的模态融合提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Emotion Recognition in Conversations (ERC) is hard because discriminative
evidence is sparse, localized, and often asynchronous across modalities. We
center ERC on emotion hotspots and present a unified model that detects
per-utterance hotspots in text, audio, and video, fuses them with global
features via Hotspot-Gated Fusion, and aligns modalities using a routed
Mixture-of-Aligners; a cross-modal graph encodes conversational structure. This
design focuses modeling on salient spans, mitigates misalignment, and preserves
context. Experiments on standard ERC benchmarks show consistent gains over
strong baselines, with ablations confirming the contributions of HGF and MoA.
Our results point to a hotspot-centric view that can inform future multimodal
learning, offering a new perspective on modality fusion in ERC.

TL;DR: MMA-ASIA是一个评估LLMs在亚洲文化背景下的文化意识框架，包含多语言多模态对齐的基准数据集和五维评估协议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLMs在西方高资源环境外的多模态理解和推理能力下降，需要专门评估其在亚洲文化背景下的表现。

Method: 构建包含8个亚洲国家、10种语言、27,000个问题的多模态对齐基准数据集；提出五维评估协议；开发文化意识接地验证模块；使用比较模型分析、注意力追踪和VPR方法分析模型差异。

Result: 创建了首个在文本、图像和语音三种模态输入层面对齐的数据集；79%的问题需要基于文化背景的多步推理；提供了构建文化可靠多模态LLMs的可操作见解。

Conclusion: MMA-ASIA框架为评估和改进LLMs在亚洲文化背景下的表现提供了系统方法，有助于构建更具文化意识的多模态语言模型。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are now used worldwide, yet their multimodal
understanding and reasoning often degrade outside Western, high-resource
settings. We propose MMA-ASIA, a comprehensive framework to evaluate LLMs'
cultural awareness with a focus on Asian contexts. MMA-ASIA centers on a
human-curated, multilingual, and multimodally aligned multiple-choice benchmark
covering 8 Asian countries and 10 languages, comprising 27,000 questions; over
79 percent require multi-step reasoning grounded in cultural context, moving
beyond simple memorization. To our knowledge, this is the first dataset aligned
at the input level across three modalities: text, image (visual question
answering), and speech. This enables direct tests of cross-modal transfer.
Building on this benchmark, we propose a five-dimensional evaluation protocol
that measures: (i) cultural-awareness disparities across countries, (ii)
cross-lingual consistency, (iii) cross-modal consistency, (iv) cultural
knowledge generalization, and (v) grounding validity. To ensure rigorous
assessment, a Cultural Awareness Grounding Validation Module detects "shortcut
learning" by checking whether the requisite cultural knowledge supports correct
answers. Finally, through comparative model analysis, attention tracing, and an
innovative Vision-ablated Prefix Replay (VPR) method, we probe why models
diverge across languages and modalities, offering actionable insights for
building culturally reliable multimodal LLMs.

TL;DR: GraphGhost是一个统一框架，将神经元激活及其信号传播表示为图，用于解释LLMs如何从序列输入中捕获结构语义并通过结构一致机制生成输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型展现出卓越的推理能力，但其背后的结构机制仍未被充分探索。

Method: 采用基于图的视角，使用PageRank等图算法来表征LLMs的特性，识别激活的神经元并通过结构干预进行评估。

Result: 揭示了跨不同数据集的共享和模型特定的推理行为，对关键神经元节点的编辑会触发推理崩溃，改变逻辑流和语义理解。

Conclusion: GraphGhost是分析、干预并最终理解LLMs推理结构基础的强大工具。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable reasoning capabilities,
yet the structural mechanisms underlying these abilities remain under explored.
In this work, we introduce GraphGhost, a unified framework that represents
neuron activations and their signal propagation as graphs, explaining how LLMs
capture structural semantics from sequential inputs and generate outputs
through structurally consistent mechanisms. This graph-based perspective
enables us to employ graph algorithms such as PageRank to characterize the
properties of LLMs, revealing both shared and model-specific reasoning
behaviors across diverse datasets. We further identify the activated neurons
within GraphGhost and evaluate them through structural interventions, showing
that edits to key neuron nodes can trigger reasoning collapse, altering both
logical flow and semantic understanding. Together, these contributions position
GraphGhost as a powerful tool for analyzing, intervening in, and ultimately
understanding the structural foundations of reasoning in LLMs.

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型在医疗诊断中表现出性别偏见，特别是在判断患者性别相关性和必要性方面存在显著不一致性，可能影响AI辅助临床护理的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在医疗领域的应用日益广泛，但其对性别偏见的敏感性可能复制或放大临床决策中的性别偏见，影响医疗公平性。

Method: 使用新英格兰医学杂志挑战案例，为多个开源和专有LLM分配性别（女性、男性或未指定），评估其在诊断和判断患者性别相关性/必要性方面的一致性。

Result: 大多数模型在诊断方面相对一致，但在判断患者性别相关性和必要性方面所有模型都表现出显著不一致，特别是相关性判断，某些模型甚至显示出系统性的性别差异。

Conclusion: 这种未被充分探索的偏见可能削弱LLMs在临床实践中的可靠性，强调需要常规检查身份分配一致性以确保可靠和公平的AI辅助临床护理。

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into healthcare holds promise
to enhance clinical decision-making, yet their susceptibility to biases remains
a critical concern. Gender has long influenced physician behaviors and patient
outcomes, raising concerns that LLMs assuming human-like roles, such as
clinicians or medical educators, may replicate or amplify gender-related
biases. Using case studies from the New England Journal of Medicine Challenge
(NEJM), we assigned genders (female, male, or unspecified) to multiple
open-source and proprietary LLMs. We evaluated their response consistency
across LLM-gender assignments regarding both LLM-based diagnosis and models'
judgments on the clinical relevance or necessity of patient gender. In our
findings, diagnoses were relatively consistent across LLM genders for most
models. However, for patient gender's relevance and necessity in LLM-based
diagnosis, all models demonstrated substantial inconsistency across LLM
genders, particularly for relevance judgements. Some models even displayed a
systematic female-male disparity in their interpretation of patient gender.
These findings present an underexplored bias that could undermine the
reliability of LLMs in clinical practice, underscoring the need for routine
checks of identity-assignment consistency when interacting with LLMs to ensure
reliable and equitable AI-supported clinical care.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个利用LLMs自动生成数学应用题中干扰条件的迭代框架，保持原问题解法不变，减少人工标注成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数学应用题数据集缺乏有意义的干扰条件，且人工添加干扰条件会导致解法改变，需要大量人工检查重写。

Method: 设计迭代框架和提示词集，从多角度和认知层面修订数学应用题，生成有意义的干扰条件但不改变原解法。

Result: 该框架能高效生成高质量含干扰条件的数学应用题，大幅减少人工工作量。

Conclusion: 该自动生成框架为评估LLMs在复杂数学推理场景下的表现提供了可靠的数据集构建方案。

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning serves as a crucial testbed for evaluating the
intelligence of large language models (LLMs), and math word problems (MWPs)
represent one of the most widely used formats. Most existing MWP datasets
contain only the necessary information, while problems with distracting or
excessive conditions are often overlooked. Prior studies have shown that
popular LLMs experience a dramatic performance drop when such distracting
conditions are introduced. However, available datasets of MWPs with distracting
conditions remain limited, and most exhibit low difficulty and out-of-context
expressions. These shortcomings make the distracting conditions easy to detect
and disregard, thereby reducing the credibility of benchmarking on these
datasets. Moreover, when distracting conditions are added, the reasoning
process and answers may change, requiring intensive manual effort to check and
rewrite solutions.
  To address these issues, we design an iterative framework that leverages LLMs
to generate distracting conditions automatically. We develop a set of prompts
to revise MWPs from multiple perspectives and cognitive levels, encouraging the
creation of meaningful distracting conditions as well as suggestions for
further refinement. A key advantage of our framework is the preservation of
shared solutions between the original and revised problems: the LLMs are
explicitly guided to generate distractions that do not alter the original
solution, thus eliminating the need to produce new answers. This framework is
efficient and easy to deploy, substantially reducing the effort required to
generate MWPs with distracting conditions while maintaining high data quality.

*Juan Miguel Navarro Carranza*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种通过评估模型在基准问题改写版本上的表现来探测LLM泛化能力的简单协议，发现改写会导致明显的准确率下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的基准分数可能因记忆测试项目或其近似重复项而被夸大，需要探测其真实泛化能力。

Method: 使用Mistral-7B-Instruct和Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct模型，在ARC-Easy和ARC-Challenge数据集上测量原始问题和改写问题之间的准确率差距，包含解码控制、多选输出格式强制和改写清理步骤。

Result: 改写会导致非平凡的准确率下降（原始vs改写），与先前关于污染和脆弱的表面形式捷径的担忧一致。

Conclusion: 基准测试中的记忆效应和表面形式捷径确实存在，需要通过改写等方法来更准确地评估模型的真实泛化能力。

Abstract: Benchmark scores for Large Language Models (LLMs) can be inflated by
memorization of test items or near duplicates. We present a simple, protocol
that probes generalization by re-evaluating models on paraphrased versions of
benchmark questions. Using Mistral-7B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, we
measure the accuracy gap between original and paraphrased items on ARC-Easy and
ARC-Challenge. Our pipeline controls decoding, enforces multiple-choice output
format, and includes a robust paraphrase-cleaning step to preserve semantics.
We find that paraphrasing induces a non-trivial accuracy drop (original vs.
paraphrased), consistent with prior concerns about contamination and brittle
surface-form shortcuts.

TL;DR: JAI-1是一个750亿参数的泰语中心语言模型，采用上扩增策略从较小的英语模型扩展参数空间，专门集成泰语知识，在泰语基准测试中表现优于Typhoon2-70B。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有泰语模型主要依赖开源模型进行额外训练，但这种方法可能侵蚀模型原有的通用知识。需要一种既能保留通用智能又能有效集成泰语知识的方法。

Method: 从高性能英语开源LLM出发，扩展参数空间，利用新增容量系统集成泰语知识。预训练使用1.5T token（含300B泰语token），后训练阶段使用60万指令样本进行监督微调和对齐调优。

Result: 在泰语中心基准测试（IFEval-TH、MT-Bench-TH和JAI-Hall-Bench）中表现优于Typhoon2-70B，验证了上扩增和知识集成框架的有效性。

Conclusion: JAI-1的上扩增策略成功保留了原始模型的通用智能，同时建立了独特的架构，为未来可扩展增强奠定了基础。

Abstract: This technical report introduces JAI-1, a Thai-centric language model with
75B parameters. Recent Thai models have primarily relied on existing
open-source models, applying additional training without structural
modifications to specialize in Thai. However, this approach risks eroding
pre-existing knowledge in the model's parameter space during the injection of
Thai-specific information, as optimized parameters for general tasks may
conflict with new linguistic requirements. In contrast, JAI-1 adopts an
upscaling strategy: starting from a smaller, high-performing English
open-source LLM, we expanded its parameter space and utilized the newly
allocated capacity to systematically integrate Thai-language knowledge. This
methodology not only preserves the original model's general intelligence but
also establishes a unique architecture distinct from other open-source models,
enabling scalable future enhancements. During pre-training, JAI-1 was exposed
to 1.5T tokens, including over 300B Thai language tokens. This was followed by
post-training stages -- supervised fine-tuning and alignment tuning -- using
more than 600K instruction-based examples. The final model demonstrated
superior performance compared to Typhoon2-70B on Thai-centric benchmarks
(IFEval-TH, MT-Bench-TH, and JAI-Hall-Bench), validating the efficacy of its
upscaling and knowledge-integration framework.

TL;DR: 本文研究基于用户画像（年龄、性别、职业）的销售对话代理，发现职业对对话意图影响最大，提出了一种轻量级的职业条件化策略来优化对话效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着智能对话模型的快速发展，需要真实的用户模拟器研究来优化对话策略。本文旨在探索基于用户画像的销售对话代理如何根据用户特征调整对话策略。

Method: 研究销售导向的对话代理，分析年龄、性别和职业对对话意图的影响，并引入轻量级的职业条件化策略来指导代理优先选择符合用户偏好的对话意图。

Result: 研究发现年龄和性别影响整体性能，但职业对对话意图差异影响最显著。使用职业条件化策略后，对话更短且成功率更高。

Conclusion: 研究强调了丰富模拟器用户画像的重要性，并证明简单的基于人物特征的策略可以提升销售导向对话系统的有效性。

Abstract: Amid the rapid rise of agentic dialogue models, realistic user-simulator
studies are essential for tuning effective conversation strategies. This work
investigates a sales-oriented agent that adapts its dialogue based on user
profiles spanning age, gender, and occupation. While age and gender influence
overall performance, occupation produces the most pronounced differences in
conversational intent. Leveraging this insight, we introduce a lightweight,
occupation-conditioned strategy that guides the agent to prioritize intents
aligned with user preferences, resulting in shorter and more successful
dialogues. Our findings highlight the importance of rich simulator profiles and
demonstrate how simple persona-informed strategies can enhance the
effectiveness of sales-oriented dialogue systems.

*Francesco Dente,Fabiano Dalpiaz,Paolo Papotti*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Text2Stories提出了一个任务和指标，用于量化需求（用户故事）与利益相关者实际需求之间的对齐程度，包括正确性和完整性两个维度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大语言模型可以自动从自然语言输入生成软件需求，但评估这些需求是否真实反映利益相关者需求仍然主要依赖人工任务。

Method: 将访谈记录分段为文本块，将对齐问题实例化为文本块与用户故事之间的匹配问题，使用基于LLM的匹配器进行对齐评估。

Result: 在四个数据集上的实验表明，基于LLM的匹配器在保留注释上达到0.86的宏F1分数，而仅使用嵌入模型效果较差但可用于有效阻塞。

Conclusion: Text2Stories指标能够比较不同故事集（如人工生成vs自动生成），作为现有用户故事质量标准的可扩展、忠实于来源的补充。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can be employed for automating the generation of
software requirements from natural language inputs such as the transcripts of
elicitation interviews. However, evaluating whether those derived requirements
faithfully reflect the stakeholders' needs remains a largely manual task. We
introduce Text2Stories, a task and metrics for text-to-story alignment that
allow quantifying the extent to which requirements (in the form of user
stories) match the actual needs expressed by the elicitation session
participants. Given an interview transcript and a set of user stories, our
metric quantifies (i) correctness: the proportion of stories supported by the
transcript, and (ii) completeness: the proportion of transcript supported by at
least one story. We segment the transcript into text chunks and instantiate the
alignment as a matching problem between chunks and stories. Experiments over
four datasets show that an LLM-based matcher achieves 0.86 macro-F1 on held-out
annotations, while embedding models alone remain behind but enable effective
blocking. Finally, we show how our metrics enable the comparison across sets of
stories (e.g., human vs. generated), positioning Text2Stories as a scalable,
source-faithful complement to existing user-story quality criteria.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了PARSE系统，通过自动优化JSON模式和改进提取方法，显著提升LLM从非结构化文本中提取结构化信息的准确性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将JSON模式视为静态合约，导致提取性能不佳、频繁产生幻觉，以及当模式包含模糊或不完整规范时代理行为不可靠。

Method: PARSE系统包含两个组件：ARCHITECT自动优化JSON模式并保持向后兼容性，SCOPE实现基于反射的提取，结合静态和LLM防护机制。

Result: 在三个数据集上评估，SWDE提取准确率提升64.7%，综合框架改进达到10%，首次重试减少92%提取错误，同时保持实用延迟。

Conclusion: PARSE通过将JSON模式视为可解释和改进的自然语言理解合约，显著提升了LLM结构化信息提取的性能和可靠性。

Abstract: Structured information extraction from unstructured text is critical for
emerging Software 3.0 systems where LLM agents autonomously interact with APIs
and tools. Recent approaches apply large language models directly to extraction
tasks using existing JSON schemas, often with constraint decoding or
reinforcement learning approaches to ensure syntactic validity, but treat JSON
schemas as static contracts designed for human developers, leading to
suboptimal extraction performance, frequent hallucinations, and unreliable
agent behavior when schemas contain ambiguous or incomplete specifications. We
recognize that JSON schemas themselves are a form of natural language
understanding contract that encodes rules, relationships, and expectations
about data structure contracts that LLMs should be able to both interpret and
systematically improve. Consequently, we develop PARSE (Parameter Automated
Refinement and Schema Extraction), a novel system with two synergistic
components: ARCHITECT, which autonomously optimizes JSON schemas for LLM
consumption while maintaining backward compatibility through RELAY (an
integrated code generation system), and SCOPE, which implements
reflection-based extraction with combined static and LLM-based guardrails. We
evaluate PARSE qualitatively and quantitatively on three datasets including
Schema-Guided Dialogue (SGD), Structured Web Data Extraction (SWDE), and
internal retail conversation data, and find that it achieves up to 64.7%
improvement in extraction accuracy on SWDE with combined framework improvements
reaching 10% across models, while reducing extraction errors by 92% within the
first retry and and maintaining practical latency.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现评估导向的提示会人为夸大LLM性能，增加推理长度但未必提升准确率，建议采用中性措辞和双框架检查来确保基准测试反映真实部署能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM基准测试使用评估导向的提示（要求显式推理和严格格式），而实际部署需要简洁、契约约束的答案，研究旨在验证这种"评估气味"是否夸大了性能测量。

Method: 使用GPT-OSS-20B模型进行6组A/B测试，固定任务内容和解码，仅改变框架（评估导向vs真实世界）和推理深度，通过确定性验证器计算准确率、答案合规性、推理长度等指标。

Result: 评估框架显著增加推理长度（数百到1000+字符），降低答案合规性，准确率提升有限或不一致。激励措辞会改变错误构成，多语言标题会重现这些特征甚至降低准确率。

Conclusion: 需要采用中性措辞、双框架检查、契约感知评分等方法来确保基准测试收益反映可部署能力，避免评估气味导致的性能夸大。

Abstract: Benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) often rely on rubric-scented
prompts that request visible reasoning and strict formatting, whereas real
deployments demand terse, contract-bound answers. We investigate whether such
"evaluation scent" inflates measured performance without commensurate
capability gains. Using a single open-weights model (GPT-OSS-20B), we run six
paired A/B scenarios that hold task content and decoding fixed while varying
framing (evaluation-oriented vs. real-world) and reasoning depth (Medium/High):
deterministic math, strict code-fix, citation generation, incentive flips
(caution vs. competence), CoT visibility, and multilingual (Urdu) headers.
Deterministic validators compute accuracy, answer-only compliance,
hedging/refusals, chain-of-thought (CoT) length, and schema compliance, with
pre-registered deltas and composite indices. Across scenarios, evaluation
framing reliably inflates CoT (hundreds to >1000 characters) and reduces
answer-only compliance, with limited or inconsistent accuracy gains. In
structured outputs, it improves wrappers (e.g., fenced blocks, enumerated
lists) but not regex-validated substance. Incentive wording reweights error
composition: praising caution modestly improves accuracy at high reasoning and
reduces wrong-but-confident errors, whereas praising competence yields terser
but riskier outputs. Urdu rubric headers reproduce these signatures and can
decrease accuracy at higher reasoning depth, indicating multilingual parity
risks. We provide a reproducible A/B framework (prompt banks, validators,
per-run scores, scripts; versioned DOI) and practical guidance: neutral
phrasing or dual-framing checks, contract-aware grading, style-delta reporting,
confidence governance, and multilingual dashboards to ensure that benchmark
gains reflect deployable capability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型推理能力强但推理成本高，小型语言模型效率高但推理能力未被充分探索。现有系统未能充分利用自然语言理性作为学习信号的潜力。

Method: 提出PULSE框架，将SLM生成的理性作为直接学习信号，与交互历史共同监督，联合建模用户行为（what）和语义驱动因素（why），创建跨领域的Thought Space。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上超越了领先的ID、协同过滤和LLM序列推荐模型，在跨领域推荐中表现出优越的可迁移性，在下游推理问答任务中表现强劲。

Conclusion: PULSE通过将理性作为一等信号处理，产生了更鲁棒和可泛化的嵌入，证明了SLM在推荐系统中的潜力，为高效推荐系统提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced recommendation capabilities
through enhanced reasoning, but pose significant challenges for real-world
deployment due to high inference costs. Conversely, while Small Language Models
(SLMs) offer an efficient alternative, their reasoning capabilities for
recommendation remain underexplored. Existing systems often use natural
language rationales merely as unsupervised descriptive text, failing to harness
their full potential as learning signals. In this work our main idea is to
create a common understanding of user and items across multiple domains called
Thought Space with SLMs instead of using LLMs' distilled knowledge. To that end
we propose PULSE (Preference Understanding by Latent Semantic Embeddings), a
framework that treats SLM-generated rationales as director learning signals,
supervising them with interaction histories to jointly model user actions
(what) and their semantic drivers (why). Existing methods consider only
interactions such as sequences and embeddings, whereas PULSE treats rationales
as first-class signals, this novel design yields embeddings that are more
robust and generalizable. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PULSE
outperforms leading ID, Collaborative Filtering (CF), and LLM-based sequential
recommendation models across multiple benchmark datasets. Furthermore, PULSE
exhibits superior transferability in cross-domain recommendation and
demonstrates strong performance on downstream tasks such as reasoning-oriented
question answering. Our code is available

TL;DR: ExPO-HM提出了一种基于解释-检测策略优化的仇恨表情包检测方法，通过结合SFT预热、GRPO课程学习和条件决策熵奖励，在检测精度和推理质量上达到最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有仇恨表情包检测方法多为直接检测，只能提供二元预测，缺乏上下文和解释。而基于思维链的Explain-then-Detect方法性能甚至不如简单SFT基线，主要问题是模型无法假设政策相关线索，且二元奖励信号不足以指导推理。

Method: ExPO-HM结合SFT预热、GRPO课程学习和条件决策熵（CDE）作为推理质量的度量和奖励，模拟人类标注者的训练和评估过程。

Result: 在三个仇恨表情包基准测试中，ExPO-HM在二元检测、细粒度分类和推理质量方面达到最先进性能，相比GRPO和DPO基线分别提升15%和17%的F1分数。

Conclusion: ExPO-HM将仇恨表情包检测从简单的二元警报转变为解释驱动的检测，提供了准确、可解释且可操作的审核支持。

Abstract: Hateful memes have emerged as a particularly challenging form of online
abuse, motivating the development of automated detection systems. Most prior
approaches rely on direct detection, producing only binary predictions. Such
models fail to provide the context and explanations that real-world moderation
requires. Recent Explain-then-Detect approaches, using Chain-of-Thought
prompting or LMM agents, perform worse than simple SFT baselines, and even
advanced post-training methods such as GRPO fail to close the gap. Our analysis
identifies two key issues of such systems: important policy-relevant cues such
as targets and attack types are not hypothesized by the model as a likely
explanation; and the binary reward signal is insufficient to guide reasoning.
To address these challenges, we propose ExPO-HM (Explain-then-Detect Policy
Optimization for Hateful Memes), inspired by the training and evaluation
process of human annotators. ExPO-HM combines SFT warmup, GRPO with curriculum
learning, and Conditional Decision Entropy (CDE) as both metric and reward for
reasoning quality. Across three hateful meme benchmarks, ExPO-HM achieves
state-of-the-art performance on binary detection, fine-grained classification,
and reasoning quality, with up to 15\% and 17\% F1 improvement over the GRPO
and DPO baselines, respectively. By moving hateful meme detection from simple
binary alarms to explanation-driven detection, ExPO-HM provides accurate,
interpretable, and actionable moderation support.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语言模型在生成过程中缺乏层次化的语义控制，需要一种能够从抽象到具体逐步生成文本的方法

Method: 使用分层词汇结构，前向过程将token扰动到更高层次的抽象语义，反向过程则逐步预测更详细的语义，实现了时间变化的下一个语义尺度预测

Result: 在文本生成实验中，HDLM相比基线模型展现出更低的验证困惑度和生成困惑度

Conclusion: HDLM提供了一种通用的分层扩散语言建模框架，能够有效提升文本生成质量，并且包含现有MDLM作为特例

Abstract: In this paper we introduce Hierarchical Diffusion Language Models (HDLM) -- a
novel family of discrete diffusion models for language modeling. HDLM builds on
a hierarchical vocabulary where low-level tokens with detailed semantics are
surjectively mapped to high-level tokens with coarse-grained meanings. In the
forward process, each token is independently perturbed to its higher-level
ancestor with more abstract semantics according to the scheduler, while in the
reverse process the model progressively predicts the next, more detailed
semantics. Taken together, HDLM provides a general time-varying next semantic
scale prediction process for language modeling. We derive closed-form
expressions for the diffusion Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO), and show that HDLM
can be implemented in a flexible manner while including the existing MDLM as a
special case. We also propose practical training techniques based on the
insights. Extensive text generation experiments validate the effectiveness of
HDLM, which demonstrates consistently lower validation and generative
perplexity than baselines.

Method: 采用小模型(压缩器)和大模型(执行器)的协作工作流：第一阶段训练压缩器生成富含推理信息的前期思想嵌入；第二阶段优化执行器利用这些嵌入进行短推理。

Result: UCoT在保持执行器强大推理能力的同时显著减少CoT长度，在GSM8K数据集上token使用减少50%，性能比SOTA方法高3.08%。

Conclusion: UCoT框架有效解决了长CoT推理的效率问题，通过自动化CoT压缩实现了推理效率与性能的平衡。

Abstract: Recent developments have enabled advanced reasoning in Large Language Models
(LLMs) via long Chain-of-Thought (CoT), while long CoT suffers from high
computational costs and significant latency losses owing to the autoregressive
nature of generative LLMs. CoT compression aims to improve efficiency in the
reasoning process by reducing output length. Previous works trade reasoning
efficiency by either laborious discrete prompt designing or the construction of
external compressed CoT datasets that sacrifice key reasoning details. In this
work, we propose Upfront CoT (UCoT): an efficient reasoning framework with
upfront thought embedding to automate CoT compression. UCoT is a cooperative
workflow involving a small model (compressor) and a large model (executor). The
first stage of UCoT trains compressor to generate upfront thought embeddings
rich in reasoning information for the executor, avoiding the drawbacks of
manually designed prompts. The second stage optimizes executor to utilize
upfront thought embeddings to derive the correct answer with short reasoning,
using a reward mechanism. Extensive experiments show that UCoT maintains the
powerful reasoning ability of executor while significantly reducing the length
of CoT. It is worth mentioning that when applying UCoT to the
Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct model, the usage of tokens on GSM8K dataset is reduced by
50\%, while the performance is 3.08\% higher than that of the state-of-the-art
(SOTA) method. The code and dataset are in supplementary material.

*Gustave Cortal,Alain Finkel*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个分析个人叙事风格的正式框架，通过整合功能语言学、计算机科学和心理学，使用语言模型自动提取语言特征，并在梦境叙事中验证了该方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 个人叙事是作者构建意义的方式，风格对于传达主观体验至关重要，但目前缺乏系统分析这些风格选择的正式框架。

Method: 整合功能语言学、计算机科学和心理学，使用语言模型自动提取过程、参与者和环境等语言特征，分析语言选择模式。

Result: 在数百个梦境叙事中应用该框架，包括对患有创伤后应激障碍的战争退伍军人的案例研究，发现其叙事中言语过程主导心理过程的独特模式。

Conclusion: 该框架成功揭示了语言选择与心理状态之间的关系，为系统分析个人叙事风格提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Personal narratives are stories authors construct to make meaning of their
experiences. Style, the distinctive way authors use language to express
themselves, is fundamental to how these narratives convey subjective
experiences. Yet there is a lack of a formal framework for systematically
analyzing these stylistic choices. We present a novel approach that formalizes
style in personal narratives as patterns in the linguistic choices authors make
when communicating subjective experiences. Our framework integrates three
domains: functional linguistics establishes language as a system of meaningful
choices, computer science provides methods for automatically extracting and
analyzing sequential patterns, and these patterns are linked to psychological
observations. Using language models, we automatically extract linguistic
features such as processes, participants, and circumstances. We apply our
framework to hundreds of dream narratives, including a case study on a war
veteran with post-traumatic stress disorder. Analysis of his narratives
uncovers distinctive patterns, particularly how verbal processes dominate over
mental ones, illustrating the relationship between linguistic choices and
psychological states.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种结合LLM评分文本和传统评分量表的新框架，通过实证选择最具信息量的LLM评分指令来增强心理测量精度，在抑郁症评估案例中显著提升了测量准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统心理评估主要依赖结构化评分量表，无法充分利用受访者自然语言的丰富信息。本研究旨在利用LLM技术挖掘定性数据，增强传统心理测量工具。

Method: 开发了一个结合LLM评分文本和传统评分量表项目的增强测试框架，在高中生真实样本(n=693)和合成数据集(n=3,000)上进行验证，通过计算项目信息量来实证选择最优LLM评分指令。

Result: 在保留测试集上，增强测试在测量精度和准确性方面实现了统计显著提升。LLM项目带来的信息增益相当于在原有19项测试基础上增加了6.3-16.0个项目。

Conclusion: 该框架为利用转录文本增强传统心理测量提供了可扩展方法，绕过了传统自动评分的瓶颈，在临床健康等领域具有潜在应用价值。

Abstract: Psychological assessments typically rely on structured rating scales, which
cannot incorporate the rich nuance of a respondent's natural language. This
study leverages recent LLM advances to harness qualitative data within a novel
conceptual framework, combining LLM-scored text and traditional rating-scale
items to create an augmented test. We demonstrate this approach using
depression as a case study, developing and assessing the framework on a
real-world sample of upper secondary students (n=693) and corresponding
synthetic dataset (n=3,000). On held-out test sets, augmented tests achieved
statistically significant improvements in measurement precision and accuracy.
The information gain from the LLM items was equivalent to adding between 6.3
(real data) and 16.0 (synthetic data) items to the original 19-item test. Our
approach marks a conceptual shift in automated scoring that bypasses its
typical bottlenecks: instead of relying on pre-labelled data or complex
expert-created rubrics, we empirically select the most informative LLM scoring
instructions based on calculations of item information. This framework provides
a scalable approach for leveraging the growing stream of transcribed text to
enhance traditional psychometric measures, and we discuss its potential utility
in clinical health and beyond.

TL;DR: dInfer是一个用于扩散大语言模型(dLLM)的高效推理框架，通过模块化设计和系统优化，在保持输出质量的同时实现显著加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散大语言模型作为自回归模型的替代方案具有并行生成优势，但缺乏标准化和高效的推理框架限制了其广泛应用。

Method: 将推理管道分解为四个模块化组件（模型、扩散迭代管理器、解码策略和KV缓存管理器），并结合新颖算法和系统级优化。

Result: 在8×H800 GPU上，HumanEval基准测试达到1100+ tokens/s，六个基准测试平均800+ tokens/s；相比Fast-dLLM实现10倍加速，相比优化后的自回归模型QWen2.5-3B仍有2-3倍加速。

Conclusion: dInfer为扩散大语言模型提供了高效且可扩展的推理解决方案，显著提升了推理效率而不牺牲模型性能。

Abstract: Diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) have emerged as a promising
alternative to autoregressive (AR) LLMs, leveraging denoising-based generation
to enable inherent parallelism. Even more and more open-sourced dLLM models
emerge, yet their widespread adoption remains constrained by the lack of a
standardized and efficient inference framework. We present dInfer, an efficient
and extensible framework for dLLM inference. dInfer decomposes the inference
pipeline into four modular components-model, diffusion iteration manager,
decoding strategy, and KV-cache manager-and integrates novel algorithms for
each component alongside system-level optimizations. Through this combination
of algorithmic innovations and system enhancements, dInfer achieves substantial
efficiency gains without compromising output quality on LLaDA-MoE. At batch
size 1, it surpasses 1,100 tokens per second on HumanEval and averages over 800
tokens per second across six benchmarks on $8\times$ H800 GPUs. Compared to
prior systems, dInfer delivers $10\times$ speedup over Fast-dLLM while
maintaining similar model performance. Even compared with AR models (with a
comparable number of activation parameters and performance) QWen2.5-3B, which
is highly optimized with latest vLLM inference engine, dInfer still deliverers
$2$-$3\times$ speedup. The implementation of dInfer is open-sourced at

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Code Large Language Models (LLMs) are revolutionizing software engineering.
However, scaling laws that guide the efficient training are predominantly
analyzed on Natural Language (NL). Given the fundamental differences like
strict syntax between code and NL, it is unclear whether these laws are
directly applicable to code. To address this gap, we conduct the first
large-scale empirical study of scaling laws for code, comprising 117
experimental runs with model sizes from 0.2B to 3.8B and training tokens from
2B to 128B. We fit the Chinchilla law and the Farsser law. First, the results
show that the more expressive Farseer law offers greater accuracy. Second, the
analysis reveals that Code LLMs scale effectively with model size. Crucially,
code represents a more data-hungry regime, requiring a substantially higher
data-to-parameter ratio than NL. Finally, two additional sets of experiments on
code-NL mixtures show that NL benefits resource-constrained scenarios, but
becomes a detriment at higher compute budgets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型在复杂、细致的法律案例推理中的能力，特别是类比和区分先例的能力，这在美国法律实践中至关重要。

Method: 提出一个正式框架，将案例区分过程分解为三阶段推理任务：使用因素建模案例、构建法律知识层次结构、定义可验证的区分规则。

Result: 模型在表面推理（任务1）上准确率高，但在层次推理（任务2：64.82%-92.09%）和综合分析（任务3：11.46%-33.99%）上性能显著下降。错误回答比正确回答消耗更多计算资源。

Conclusion: 研究为复杂领域中LLM推理能力的细粒度分析提供了方法，揭示了必须解决的基本限制，以实现稳健可信的法律AI。

Abstract: Case-based reasoning is a cornerstone of U.S. legal practice, requiring
professionals to argue about a current case by drawing analogies to and
distinguishing from past precedents. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have
shown remarkable capabilities, their proficiency in this complex, nuanced form
of reasoning needs further investigation. We propose a formal framework that
decomposes the process of identifying significant distinctions between cases
into three-stage reasoning tasks. Our framework models cases using factual
predicates called factors, organizes them into a legal knowledge hierarchy, and
defines verifiable rules for identifying distinctions, analyzing their
argumentative support, and evaluating their significance. Through comprehensive
evaluation of modern reasoning LLMs, we reveal a paradox: while models achieve
high accuracy on surface-level reasoning (Task 1), performance degrades on
hierarchical reasoning (Task 2: 64.82%-92.09%) and collapses on integrated
analysis (Task 3: 11.46%-33.99%). Most strikingly, we find that models
consistently expend more computational resources on incorrect responses than
correct ones, suggesting that "thinking longer" does not always mean "thinking
smarter." Our work provides a methodology for fine-grained analysis of LLM
reasoning capabilities in complex domains and reveals fundamental limitations
that must be addressed for robust and trustworthy legal AI.

Motivation: 现有基准测试存在计算成本高、分数膨胀和偏向简单错误的问题，需要更有效的评估方法来测试LLM生成的测试用例。

Method: 将基准构建形式化为在二进制代码-测试矩阵中寻找最优诊断基础，提出WrongSelect算法选择最大多样性的错误代码。

Result: 构建的TC-Bench基准显示，即使最先进的测试用例生成方法也只能达到约60%的排除率，暴露了其诊断能力的显著差距。

Conclusion: 该框架能够构建紧凑、多样且抗膨胀的基准测试，有效评估LLM生成的测试用例质量，揭示了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Evaluating test cases automatically generated by Large Language Models (LLMs)
is a critical yet challenging task. Existing benchmarks suffer from high
computational costs, score inflation, and a bias towards trivial bugs over
rare, critical faults. In this work, we ask two fundamental questions: (1) What
is the minimal set of wrong codes sufficient to represent the entire error
space? and (2) What is the minimal set of test cases needed to distinguish
them? We introduce a framework that formalizes benchmark construction as
finding an optimal diagnostic basis in a binary code-test matrix. The rank of
this matrix specifies the minimal number of independent error patterns (wrong
codes) and provides a tight upper bound on the number of test cases required
for complete fault coverage. Our objective is to identify a basis of size equal
to the matrix rank that maximizes internal diversity. To tackle this NP-hard
problem, we propose WrongSelect, an efficient approximation algorithm to select
maximally diverse wrong codes. Applying this framework to millions of
competitive programming submissions, we construct TC-Bench, a compact, diverse,
and inflation-resistant benchmark. Extensive experiments show that even the
most advanced test case generation methods achieve only ~60% exclusion rates on
TC-Bench, exposing a significant gap in their diagnostic power. Our dataset is

TL;DR: 研究发现微基准测试在模型排名一致性方面存在局限性，需要250个样本才能可靠区分性能相近的模型，而现有方法推荐的10个样本远远不够。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语言模型开发中传统基准测试时间成本过高的问题，评估微基准测试是否能像完整基准测试一样一致地排名模型。

Method: 引入元评估方法，分析微基准测试在不同性能差异下对模型排名的可靠性，比较不同样本大小和采样方法的效果。

Result: 在MMLU-Pro和BIG-bench Hard上，需要250个样本才能可靠区分性能相近的模型，现有微基准测试方法在25个样本时超过一半的成对比较不可靠。

Conclusion: 微基准测试在效率和可靠性之间存在权衡，需要更多样本才能获得一致的模型排名结果，随机采样在足够样本量下与现有方法竞争力相当。

Abstract: Micro-benchmarking offers a solution to the often prohibitive time and cost
of language model development: evaluate on a very small subset of existing
benchmarks. Can these micro-benchmarks, however, rank models as consistently as
the full benchmarks they replace? And can they rank models more consistently
than selecting a random subset of data points? In many scenarios, we find that
the answer is no. We introduce a meta-evaluation measure for micro-benchmarking
which investigates how well a micro-benchmark can rank two models as a function
of their performance difference on the full benchmark. This approach can
determine which model pairs can be ranked correctly by a micro-benchmark,
allowing for a finer-grained analysis of the trade-off between micro-benchmark
size and reliability. Prior work has suggested selecting as few as 10 examples;
we find that no micro-benchmarking method can consistently rank model pairs 3.5
points of accuracy apart on MMLU-Pro or 4 points apart on BIG-bench Hard. In
order to consistently rank model pairs with relatively similar performances, we
show that often as many as 250 examples must be selected, at which point random
sampling is competitive with existing micro-benchmarking methods. When
comparing only 8B instruction-tuned models on MMLU-Pro micro-benchmarks with 25
examples, we find that more than half of pairwise comparisons are not likely to
be preserved. Our work provides actionable guidance for both micro-benchmark
users and developers in navigating the trade-off between evaluation efficiency
and reliability.

Conclusion: LLM在复合位置引用地理编码任务中表现出色，较小的微调模型可以替代大型现成模型，具有实用价值。

Abstract: Geocoding is the task of linking a location reference to an actual geographic
location and is essential for many downstream analyses of unstructured text. In
this paper, we explore the challenging setting of geocoding compositional
location references. Building on recent work demonstrating LLMs' abilities to
reason over geospatial data, we evaluate LLMs' geospatial knowledge versus
reasoning skills relevant to our task. Based on these insights, we propose an
LLM-based strategy for geocoding compositional location references. We show
that our approach improves performance for the task and that a relatively small
fine-tuned LLM can achieve comparable performance with much larger
off-the-shelf models.

Motivation: 随着LLM在全球多语言环境中的广泛使用，需要理解和保护其多语言响应，确保在不同语言和文化背景下的准确性和安全性。

Method: 使用五点评分标准和法官LLM，在五个维度上评估前沿和领先开源模型在低资源和高资源语言中的响应表现。

Result: GPT-5在各类别中平均表现最佳，特别是在同意与自主权（3.56分）和伤害预防与安全（4.73分）类别中得分最高，而Gemini 2.5 Pro表现最差（分别为1.39分和1.98分）。

Conclusion: 研究强调了需要进一步测试语言变化如何影响LLM在不同类别中的响应，并需要在这些领域进行改进。

Abstract: With LLM usage becoming widespread across countries, languages, and humanity
more broadly, the need to understand and guardrail their multilingual responses
increases. Large-scale datasets for testing and benchmarking have been created
to evaluate and facilitate LLM responses across multiple dimensions. In this
study, we evaluate the responses of frontier and leading open-source models in
five dimensions across low and high-resource languages to measure LLM accuracy
and consistency across multilingual contexts. We evaluate the responses using a
five-point grading rubric and a judge LLM. Our study shows that GPT-5 performed
the best on average in each category, while other models displayed more
inconsistency across language and category. Most notably, in the Consent &
Autonomy and Harm Prevention & Safety categories, GPT scored the highest with
averages of 3.56 and 4.73, while Gemini 2.5 Pro scored the lowest with averages
of 1.39 and 1.98, respectively. These findings emphasize the need for further
testing on how linguistic shifts impact LLM responses across various categories

TL;DR: 提出Adaptive Retention方法，通过概率性的层间token选择机制，在严格全局预算M下学习保留哪些表示，解决Transformer注意力O(n²)复杂度问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer注意力随序列长度呈二次方增长，限制了长上下文应用，需要一种高效的方法来减少计算和内存开销

Method: 使用伯努利门建模保留机制，通过Hard-Concrete/变分松弛训练，在推理时采用简单的top-M规则，使方法可微分且可直接替换标准编码器

Result: 在分类、抽取式QA和长文档摘要任务中，仅保留30-50%的token就能保持≥95%的完整模型性能，峰值内存减少约35-45%，吞吐量提升最高约1.8倍

Conclusion: 这种架构无关的方法在不修改基础注意力或任务头的情况下，为长上下文应用提供了实用的效率提升

Abstract: Transformer attention scales quadratically with sequence length O(n^2),
limiting long-context use. We propose Adaptive Retention, a probabilistic,
layer-wise token selection mechanism that learns which representations to keep
under a strict global budget M. Retention is modeled with Bernoulli gates
trained via a Hard-Concrete/variational relaxation and enforced with a simple
top-M rule at inference, making the method differentiable and drop-in for
standard encoders. Across classification, extractive QA, and long-document
summarization, keeping only 30-50% of tokens preserves >= 95% of full-model
performance while cutting peak memory by ~35-45% and improving throughput by up
to ~1.8x. This architecture-agnostic approach delivers practical long-context
efficiency without modifying base attention or task heads.

Conclusion: CCMOR基准揭示了LLM在中文多跳推理中的知识处理局限，检索增强是有效的解决方案，为未来研究提供了重要参考。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated advanced reasoning
capabilities, their comprehensive evaluation in general Chinese-language
contexts remains understudied. To bridge this gap, we propose Chinese
Commonsense Multi-hop Reasoning (CCMOR), a novel benchmark designed to evaluate
LLMs' ability to integrate Chinese-specific factual knowledge with multi-step
logical reasoning. Specifically, we first construct a domain-balanced seed set
from existing QA datasets, then develop an LLM-powered pipeline to generate
multi-hop questions anchored on factual unit chains. To ensure the quality of
resulting dataset, we implement a human-in-the-loop verification system, where
domain experts systematically validate and refine the generated questions.
Using CCMOR, we evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs, demonstrating persistent
limitations in LLMs' ability to process long-tail knowledge and execute
knowledge-intensive reasoning. Notably, retrieval-augmented generation
substantially mitigates these knowledge gaps, yielding significant performance
gains.

Motivation: 科学工作流程需要严谨的算法、深度领域知识和特定领域推理，而现有方法在处理需要解决一系列子问题的复杂科学任务时存在局限性。

Method: 采用训练免费的多智能体框架，设计专门代理进行自我反思、创建推理、编码和调试，结合学生-教师范式和统一上下文窗口来减少幻觉。

Result: 在科学编码基准测试中，MOSAIC在准确性、鲁棒性和可解释性方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MOSAIC框架通过多智能体协作和专门设计，有效解决了科学代码生成中的挑战，为复杂科学任务提供了更好的解决方案。

Abstract: We present MOSAIC, a multi-agent Large Language Model (LLM) framework for
solving challenging scientific coding tasks. Unlike general-purpose coding,
scientific workflows require algorithms that are rigorous, interconnected with
deep domain knowledge, and incorporate domain-specific reasoning, as well as
algorithm iteration without requiring I/O test cases. Many scientific problems
also require a sequence of subproblems to be solved, leading to the final
desired result. MOSAIC is designed as a training-free framework with specially
designed agents to self-reflect, create the rationale, code, and debug within a
student-teacher paradigm to address the challenges of scientific code
generation. This design facilitates stepwise problem decomposition, targeted
error correction, and, when combined with our Consolidated Context Window
(CCW), mitigates LLM hallucinations when solving complex scientific tasks
involving chained subproblems. We evaluate MOSAIC on scientific coding
benchmarks and demonstrate that our specialized agentic framework outperforms
existing approaches in terms of accuracy, robustness, and interpretability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在多语言应用中处理敏感数据时存在隐私风险，但现有研究主要针对英语，需要探究语言结构如何影响隐私泄露。

Method: 量化六种语言指标，评估三种攻击向量：提取攻击、反事实记忆和成员推断攻击，基于英语、西班牙语、法语和意大利语的医学语料库训练LLM。

Result: 隐私漏洞与语言冗余和分词粒度相关：意大利语泄露最强，英语成员推断分离性更高，法语和西班牙语因形态复杂度而更具韧性。

Conclusion: 语言结构确实影响隐私泄露，需要在LLM部署中开发语言感知的隐私保护机制。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed across multilingual
applications that handle sensitive data, yet their scale and linguistic
variability introduce major privacy risks. Mostly evaluated for English, this
paper investigates how language structure affects privacy leakage in LLMs
trained on English, Spanish, French, and Italian medical corpora. We quantify
six linguistic indicators and evaluate three attack vectors: extraction,
counterfactual memorization, and membership inference. Results show that
privacy vulnerability scales with linguistic redundancy and tokenization
granularity: Italian exhibits the strongest leakage, while English shows higher
membership separability. In contrast, French and Spanish display greater
resilience due to higher morphological complexity. Overall, our findings
provide the first quantitative evidence that language matters in privacy
leakage, underscoring the need for language-aware privacy-preserving mechanisms
in LLM deployments.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning abilities
yet remain unreliable on knowledge-intensive, multi-hop questions -- they miss
long-tail facts, hallucinate when uncertain, and their internal knowledge lags
behind real-world change. Knowledge graphs (KGs) offer a structured source of
relational evidence, but existing KGQA methods face fundamental trade-offs:
compiling complete SPARQL queries without knowing available relations proves
brittle, retrieving large subgraphs introduces noise, and complex agent
frameworks with parallel exploration exponentially expand search spaces. To
address these limitations, we propose Search-on-Graph (SoG), a simple yet
effective framework that enables LLMs to perform iterative informed graph
navigation using a single, carefully designed \textsc{Search} function. Rather
than pre-planning paths or retrieving large subgraphs, SoG follows an
``observe-then-navigate'' principle: at each step, the LLM examines actual
available relations from the current entity before deciding on the next hop.
This approach further adapts seamlessly to different KG schemas and handles
high-degree nodes through adaptive filtering. Across six KGQA benchmarks
spanning Freebase and Wikidata, SoG achieves state-of-the-art performance
without fine-tuning. We demonstrate particularly strong gains on Wikidata
benchmarks (+16\% improvement over previous best methods) alongside consistent
improvements on Freebase benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PE-CoA框架通过五种对话模式构建有效的多轮越狱攻击，在12个LLM和10个危害类别上实现最先进性能，揭示了模式特定的脆弱性和LLM行为特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多轮越狱方法依赖启发式探索策略，对模型底层弱点理解有限，对话模式与模型脆弱性之间的关系研究不足。

Method: 提出PE-CoA框架，包含五种对话模式来通过自然对话构建有效的多轮越狱攻击。

Result: 在12个LLM和10个危害类别上评估，达到最先进性能，发现模型具有不同的弱点分布，对一种对话模式的鲁棒性不能泛化到其他模式，模型家族共享相似的失败模式。

Conclusion: 这些发现凸显了安全训练的局限性，表明需要模式感知的防御机制。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to multi-turn jailbreaking
attacks that exploit conversational context to bypass safety constraints
gradually. These attacks target different harm categories (like malware
generation, harassment, or fraud) through distinct conversational approaches
(educational discussions, personal experiences, hypothetical scenarios).
Existing multi-turn jailbreaking methods often rely on heuristic or ad hoc
exploration strategies, providing limited insight into underlying model
weaknesses. The relationship between conversation patterns and model
vulnerabilities across harm categories remains poorly understood. We propose
Pattern Enhanced Chain of Attack (PE-CoA), a framework of five conversation
patterns to construct effective multi-turn jailbreaks through natural dialogue.
Evaluating PE-CoA on twelve LLMs spanning ten harm categories, we achieve
state-of-the-art performance, uncovering pattern-specific vulnerabilities and
LLM behavioral characteristics: models exhibit distinct weakness profiles where
robustness to one conversational pattern does not generalize to others, and
model families share similar failure modes. These findings highlight
limitations of safety training and indicate the need for pattern-aware
defenses. Code available on: https://github.com/Ragib-Amin-Nihal/PE-CoA

*Krzysztof Mrozinski,Minji Kang,Ahmed Khota,Vincent Michael Sutanto,Giovanni Gatti De Giacomo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文评估了质量估计重排在文档级机器翻译中的应用，发现使用学习型指标SLIDE和LLM指标GEMBA-DA都能显著提升翻译质量，在32个候选翻译时BLEURT-20得分分别提升+5.09和+4.30。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 质量估计重排虽然在句子级翻译中被证明有效，但在日益重要的文档级翻译领域应用不足，本文旨在探索其在文档级翻译中的性能表现。

Method: 使用各种学习型和基于大语言模型的质量估计指标，在文档级翻译任务中对生成的翻译候选进行评分和选择，评估不同候选数量下的重排效果。

Result: 使用最佳学习型指标SLIDE时，BLEURT-20得分在2个候选时提升+2.00，32个候选时提升+5.09；使用最佳LLM指标GEMBA-DA时，相应提升为+1.63和+4.30。尽管长文档上增益有所减小，但在512-1024词源文档上仍能获得显著改进。

Conclusion: 文档级质量估计重排具有实际应用价值，在合适的翻译模型和硬件条件下，能以最小的运行时开销显著提升文档级翻译质量。

Abstract: Quality estimation (QE) reranking is a form of quality-aware decoding which
aims to improve machine translation (MT) by scoring and selecting the best
candidate from a pool of generated translations. While known to be effective at
the sentence level, its application to the increasingly prominent domain of
document-level translation remains underexplored. In this work, we evaluate QE
reranking performance on document-level (rather than the typical
sentence-level) translation, using various learned and large language model
(LLM)-based QE metrics. We find that with our best learned metric, SLIDE,
BLEURT-20 scores improve by +2.00 with only two candidates, and by +5.09 with
32, across both decoder-only LLM models and encoder-decoder neural machine
translation (NMT) models. Using the best LLM-based metric, GEMBA-DA, gains of
+1.63 and +4.30 are achieved under the same conditions. Although gains shrink
with longer inputs, reranking with 32 candidates yields improvements of +2.34
(SLIDE) and +1.40 (GEMBA-DA) on our longest documents (512-1024 source tokens).
These findings demonstrate the practical value of document-level QE, with
minimal runtime overhead given suitable translation models and hardware.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FinAuditing是首个面向财务审计任务的基准测试，评估LLM在结构化、相互依赖的财务文档上的推理能力，包含语义一致性、关系一致性和数值一致性三个子任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GAAP的复杂性和XBRL的分层结构使得财务审计难以自动化和验证，而LLM在结构化财务文档上的推理能力尚未充分探索。

Method: 从真实的US-GAAP合规XBRL文件中构建FinAuditing基准，定义三个互补子任务：FinSM（语义一致性）、FinRE（关系一致性）、FinMR（数值一致性），并提出统一的评估框架。

Result: 对13个最先进LLM的零样本实验显示，当前模型在语义、关系和数学维度上表现不一致，当在多文档分层结构上推理时，准确率下降60-90%。

Conclusion: 现代LLM在基于分类法的财务推理中存在系统性局限，FinAuditing为开发可信赖、结构感知且符合法规的财务智能系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: The complexity of the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and the
hierarchical structure of eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) filings
make financial auditing increasingly difficult to automate and verify. While
large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in
unstructured text understanding, their ability to reason over structured,
interdependent, and taxonomy-driven financial documents remains largely
unexplored. To fill this gap, we introduce FinAuditing, the first
taxonomy-aligned, structure-aware, multi-document benchmark for evaluating LLMs
on financial auditing tasks. Built from real US-GAAP-compliant XBRL filings,
FinAuditing defines three complementary subtasks, FinSM for semantic
consistency, FinRE for relational consistency, and FinMR for numerical
consistency, each targeting a distinct aspect of structured auditing reasoning.
We further propose a unified evaluation framework integrating retrieval,
classification, and reasoning metrics across these subtasks. Extensive
zero-shot experiments on 13 state-of-the-art LLMs reveal that current models
perform inconsistently across semantic, relational, and mathematical
dimensions, with accuracy drops of up to 60-90% when reasoning over
hierarchical multi-document structures. Our findings expose the systematic
limitations of modern LLMs in taxonomy-grounded financial reasoning and
establish FinAuditing as a foundation for developing trustworthy,
structure-aware, and regulation-aligned financial intelligence systems. The
benchmark dataset is available at Hugging Face.

Motivation: 现有方法通常通过限制更新来间接鼓励探索，但未在token生成阶段本身明确促进探索行为。研究发现LLM中的token在推理任务中扮演不同角色，分为高熵推理token和低熵知识token。

Method: 引入多温度采样方法，对推理token应用较高温度以鼓励探索，对知识token保持较低温度以维持事实正确性，并系统研究多种多温度调度策略及其在强化学习中的影响。

Result: 在多个推理基准测试上的实证评估表明，该方法显著提升了LLM的推理性能。

Conclusion: 通过为不同类型的token应用差异化温度设置，能够有效平衡探索与事实准确性，从而提升LLM的推理能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning has demonstrated substantial improvements in the
reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), exhibiting significant
applicability across various domains. Recent research has identified that
tokens within LLMs play distinct roles during reasoning tasks, categorizing
them into high-entropy reasoning tokens and low-entropy knowledge tokens. Prior
approaches have typically focused on restricting updates to indirectly
encourage exploration, yet they do not explicitly facilitate exploratory
behavior during the token generation stage itself. In this work, we introduce a
complementary approach that explicitly promotes exploration during sampling by
applying distinct temperature settings for different token types. Specifically,
our method employs higher temperatures for reasoning tokens to actively
encourage exploration, while retaining lower temperatures for knowledge tokens
to maintain factual correctness. Furthermore, we systematically investigate
various multi-temperature scheduling strategies and their impacts within
reinforcement learning contexts. Empirical evaluations on several reasoning
benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances the reasoning
performance of LLMs. The code is available at

Abstract: Accurate recognition of biomedical named entities is critical for medical
information extraction and knowledge discovery. However, existing methods often
struggle with nested entities, entity boundary ambiguity, and cross-lingual
generalization. In this paper, we propose a unified Biomedical Named Entity
Recognition (BioNER) framework based on Large Language Models (LLMs). We first
reformulate BioNER as a text generation task and design a symbolic tagging
strategy to jointly handle both flat and nested entities with explicit boundary
annotation. To enhance multilingual and multi-task generalization, we perform
bilingual joint fine-tuning across multiple Chinese and English datasets.
Additionally, we introduce a contrastive learning-based entity selector that
filters incorrect or spurious predictions by leveraging boundary-sensitive
positive and negative samples. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets
and two unseen corpora show that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance and robust zero-shot generalization across languages. The source

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Semantic-Anchor Compression (SAC)方法，通过直接选择锚点token并聚合上下文信息到其KV表示中，避免了传统基于自编码任务的上下文压缩方法存在的优化目标与实际下游任务不匹配的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的上下文压缩方法主要依赖自编码任务训练上下文无关的压缩token，但这种方法存在根本性不匹配：模型优化的重构目标与实际下游任务存在差异，削弱了对实际使用更有益的特征。

Method: SAC直接从原始上下文中选择锚点token，将上下文信息聚合到其键值(KV)表示中。包含两个关键设计：(1)锚点嵌入使压缩器能够识别关键token，(2)双向注意力修改使锚点token能够捕获整个上下文的信息。

Result: 实验结果表明SAC在各种压缩比下始终优于现有的上下文压缩方法。在MRQA的分布外评估中，SAC在5倍压缩下比强基线提升了1 EM，且在更高压缩比下优势更加明显。

Conclusion: SAC通过直接从上下文token派生表示，消除了自编码训练的需求，提供了一种更有效的上下文压缩方法，在多个压缩比下都表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Context compression presents a promising approach for accelerating large
language model (LLM) inference by compressing long contexts into compact
representations. Current context compression methods predominantly rely on
autoencoding tasks to train context-agnostic compression tokens to compress
contextual semantics. While autoencoding tasks enable compression tokens to
acquire compression capabilities, compression via autoencoding tasks creates a
fundamental mismatch: the models are optimized for reconstruction that diverge
from actual downstream tasks, thereby weakening the features more beneficial
for real-world usage. We propose Semantic-Anchor Compression (SAC), a novel
method that shifts from autoencoding task based compression to an architecture
that is equipped with this compression capability \textit{a priori}. Instead of
training models to compress contexts through autoencoding tasks, SAC directly
selects so-called anchor tokens from the original context and aggregates
contextual information into their key-value (KV) representations. By deriving
representations directly from the contextual tokens, SAC eliminates the need
for autoencoding training. To ensure compression performance while directly
leveraging anchor tokens, SAC incorporates two key designs: (1) anchor
embeddings that enable the compressor to identify critical tokens, and (2)
bidirectional attention modification that allows anchor tokens to capture
information from the entire context. Experimental results demonstrate that SAC
consistently outperforms existing context compression methods across various
compression ratios. On out-of-distribution evaluation using MRQA, SAC achieves
1 EM improvement at 5x compression over strong baselines, with increasing
advantages at higher compression ratios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLM内部表征中是否存在类似人类印象和刻板印象的模式，以及这些人工印象如何影响模型的下游行为和响应质量。

Method: 使用刻板印象内容模型(SCM)的二维框架，在生成的提示上拟合线性探针来预测人工印象，并分析这些印象与模型隐藏表征的关系。

Result: 发现LLM在提示时不一致地报告印象，但印象可以从隐藏表征中更一致地线性解码；人工印象能预测模型响应的质量和使用对冲的情况；提示中的内容、风格和方言特征会影响LLM的印象形成。

Conclusion: LLM内部存在可解码的人工印象模式，这些印象影响模型行为，提示特征对印象形成有重要影响，为理解LLM的社会认知偏差提供了新视角。

Abstract: We introduce and study artificial impressions--patterns in LLMs' internal
representations of prompts that resemble human impressions and stereotypes
based on language. We fit linear probes on generated prompts to predict
impressions according to the two-dimensional Stereotype Content Model (SCM).
Using these probes, we study the relationship between impressions and
downstream model behavior as well as prompt features that may inform such
impressions. We find that LLMs inconsistently report impressions when prompted,
but also that impressions are more consistently linearly decodable from their
hidden representations. Additionally, we show that artificial impressions of
prompts are predictive of the quality and use of hedging in model responses. We
also investigate how particular content, stylistic, and dialectal features in
prompts impact LLM impressions.

TL;DR: 提出了SOP-Maze基准，从真实业务数据构建397个任务，评估大语言模型在复杂标准操作流程中的表现，发现现有模型在流程遵循、对话处理和计算推理方面存在困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要评估LLMs的指令遵循和决策能力，但在涉及复杂标准操作流程的业务场景中，LLMs的能力评估尚未充分探索，需要专门基准来填补这一空白。

Method: 从真实业务数据构建SOP-Maze基准，包含23个复杂SOP场景的397个任务，将任务分为横向根系统（宽选项精确选择）和核心根系统（深度逻辑推理）两类。

Result: 实验表明几乎所有最先进模型在SOP-Maze上都表现不佳，识别出三个关键错误类别：路线盲区（流程遵循困难）、对话脆弱性（无法处理真实对话细微差别）和计算错误（复杂上下文下的时间或算术推理错误）。

Conclusion: SOP-Maze基准为评估LLMs在复杂业务流程中的能力提供了新视角，揭示了模型在广度和深度任务中的挑战，为改进模型能力提供了重要见解。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are widely deployed as domain-specific
agents, many benchmarks have been proposed to evaluate their ability to follow
instructions and make decisions in real-world scenarios. However, business
scenarios often involve complex standard operating procedures (SOPs), and the
evaluation of LLM capabilities in such contexts has not been fully explored. To
bridge this gap, we propose SOP-Maze, a benchmark constructed from real-world
business data and adapted into a collection of 397 tasks from 23 complex SOP
scenarios. We further categorize SOP tasks into two broad classes: Lateral Root
System (LRS), representing wide-option tasks that demand precise selection; and
Heart Root System (HRS), which emphasizes deep logical reasoning with complex
branches. Extensive experiments reveal that nearly all state-of-the-art models
struggle with SOP-Maze. We conduct a comprehensive analysis and identify three
key error categories: (i) route blindness: difficulty following procedures;
(ii) conversational fragility: inability to handle real dialogue nuances; and
(iii) calculation errors: mistakes in time or arithmetic reasoning under
complex contexts. The systematic study explores LLM performance across SOP
tasks that challenge both breadth and depth, offering new insights for
improving model capabilities. We have open-sourced our work on
https://github.com/ADoublLEN/SOP-Maze.

Method: 使用710个项目的配对快照语料库，将文本解析为参与者、规则、动作和对象，通过熵测量均匀性、丰富度测量多样性、Jensen-Shannon散度测量漂移。

Result: 项目随时间定义更多角色和动作，这些分布更加均匀，而规则组成保持稳定。

Conclusion: 治理通过扩展和平衡参与类别而增长，没有重大规范性转变，为评估AI工作流对权威分配的影响提供了基准。

Abstract: We study how open source communities describe participation and control
through version controlled governance documents. Using a corpus of 710 projects
with paired snapshots, we parse text into actors, rules, actions, and objects,
then group them and measure change with entropy for evenness, richness for
diversity, and Jensen Shannon divergence for drift. Projects define more roles
and more actions over time, and these are distributed more evenly, while the
composition of rules remains stable. These findings indicate that governance
grows by expanding and balancing categories of participation without major
shifts in prescriptive force. The analysis provides a reproducible baseline for
evaluating whether future AI mediated workflows concentrate or redistribute
authority.

Motivation: 现有GRPO及其变体方法依赖于静态或过于简化的权重方案，无法适应模型演化能力，导致训练在不同难度级别上不均衡，阻碍整体性能提升。

Method: 提出难度感知重加权策略优化(DARO)，根据模型学习状态动态调整每个难度组的损失贡献，解决损失尺度问题。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B、Qwen2.5-Math-7B和Llama3.1-8B上的实验表明，DARO在六个数学基准测试中优于四个领先基线方法，实现更快收敛和更优最终性能。

Conclusion: DARO通过动态难度感知重加权机制有效解决了现有RLVR方法的局限性，显著提升了推理能力训练效果。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown that reasoning
ability can be significantly enhanced through Reinforcement Learning with
Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has
emerged as the de facto approach for RLVR, inspiring numerous variants.
However, our mathematical analysis reveals that these methods are fundamentally
weighted variations of GRPO. We provide a unified view, demonstrating that
their reliance on static or overly simplistic weighting schemes tied to sample
difficulty prevents adaptation to a model's evolving capabilities. This creates
a significant loss scale issue, where training disproportionately focuses on
certain difficulty levels at the expense of others, hindering overall
performance. To address these limitations, we introduce
\textbf{Difficulty-Aware Reweighting Policy Optimization (DARO)}, a method that
dynamically adjusts the loss contribution of each difficulty group based on the
model's learning state. Extensive experiments on Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B,
Qwen2.5-Math-7B, and Llama3.1-8B show that DARO outperforms four leading
baselines across six math benchmarks, achieving significantly faster
convergence and superior final performance.

TL;DR: LoRA-based Refusal-training enables performance-preserving safety alignment using only safety data, with LoRA serving as cost-efficient safety patches that decouple safety into a low-rank subspace.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safety alignment is essential for trustworthy AI but challenging to implement without degrading general performance. Current approaches require expensive searches for optimal data proportions.

Method: LoRA-based Refusal-training trained solely on safety data, with theoretical and experimental evidence showing LoRA decouples safety into a low-rank orthogonal subspace.

Result: Demonstrates that LoRA enables performance-preserving safety alignment without compromising general capabilities, serving as cost-efficient and plug-and-play safety patches.

Conclusion: LoRA effectively decouples safety enhancements from the model's intrinsic capabilities, providing a practical solution for safety alignment without performance degradation.

Abstract: Safety alignment is essential for building trustworthy artificial
intelligence, yet it remains challenging to enhance model safety without
degrading general performance. Current approaches require computationally
expensive searches for the optimal proportion of safety-critical and
general-purpose data to balance safety and general performance, incurring high
costs with limited gains. In this work, we show that LoRA-based
Refusal-training enables performance-preserving safety alignment even when
trained solely on safety data, demonstrating that LoRA serves as
cost-efficient, performance-preserving, and plug-and-play safety patches.
Beyond empirical findings, we provide both theoretical and experimental
evidence that LoRA effectively decouples safety into a low-rank subspace
largely orthogonal to the model's intrinsic transformation space, ensuring that
safety enhancements do not interfere with inherent capabilities.

schema linking using a vector database of pre-computed schema embeddings, and
(ii) a SQL Generator fine-tuned in two stages-supervised fine-tuning followed
by execution-guided reinforcement-enabling self-correction without costly
multi-candidate generation. On BIRD, LitE-SQL achieves 72.10% execution
accuracy, and on Spider 1.0 it reaches 88.45%, demonstrating comparable or
superior performance to LLM-based methods despite using 2x to 30x fewer
parameters. Our findings demonstrate that high-quality Text-to-SQL generation
is feasible with lightweight models, offering a practical solution for
privacy-sensitive and resource-constrained settings.

TL;DR: 该研究通过迭代优化评分标准来提升大语言模型在自动作文评分中的表现，在TOEFL11和ASAP数据集上实现了显著改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型的性能对提示词高度敏感，受提示优化领域启发，本研究探索通过优化评分标准来改进自动作文评分系统。

Method: 通过让模型反思自身评分理由与人类评分之间的差异，迭代优化评分标准，使用GPT-4.1、Gemini-2.5-Pro和Qwen-3-Next-80B-A3B-Instruct等模型进行实验。

Result: 在TOEFL11和ASAP数据集上，二次加权Kappa系数分别提升了0.19和0.47，即使使用简单初始评分标准也能达到或超过详细人工编写标准的效果。

Conclusion: 迭代评分标准优化对于提升基于大语言模型的自动作文评分系统与人类评估的一致性至关重要。

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) is highly sensitive to the
prompts they are given. Drawing inspiration from the field of prompt
optimization, this study investigates the potential for enhancing Automated
Essay Scoring (AES) by refining the scoring rubrics used by LLMs. Specifically,
our approach prompts models to iteratively refine rubrics by reflecting on
models' own scoring rationales and observed discrepancies with human scores on
sample essays. Experiments on the TOEFL11 and ASAP datasets using GPT-4.1,
Gemini-2.5-Pro, and Qwen-3-Next-80B-A3B-Instruct show Quadratic Weighted Kappa
(QWK) improvements of up to 0.19 and 0.47, respectively. Notably, even with a
simple initial rubric, our approach achieves comparable or better QWK than
using detailed human-authored rubrics. Our findings highlight the importance of
iterative rubric refinement in LLM-based AES to enhance alignment with human
evaluations.

TL;DR: 针对低资源印地语系语言Chakma，研究者构建了孟加拉语转写的Chakma语料库，并通过微调多语言Transformer模型在掩码语言建模任务上取得了显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chakma作为一种印地语系语言，可用数据有限，在语言模型中代表性不足，需要开发有效的低资源语言处理方法。

Method: 从Chakma文学作品中构建上下文连贯的孟加拉语转写Chakma语料库，经母语者验证后，对6种多语言Transformer模型进行掩码语言建模微调。

Result: 微调后的多语言模型在Bangla-transliterated Chakma上表现优于预训练模型，最高达到73.54%的token准确率和低至2.90的困惑度。

Conclusion: 孟加拉语转写的Chakma对于Chakma语言的迁移学习非常有效，数据质量对模型性能有重要影响，OCR管道对形态丰富的印地文字存在局限性。

Abstract: As an Indo-Aryan language with limited available data, Chakma remains largely
underrepresented in language models. In this work, we introduce a novel corpus
of contextually coherent Bangla-transliterated Chakma, curated from Chakma
literature, and validated by native speakers. Using this dataset, we fine-tune
six encoder-based multilingual and regional transformer models (mBERT,
XLM-RoBERTa, DistilBERT, DeBERTaV3, BanglaBERT, and IndicBERT) on masked
language modeling (MLM) tasks. Our experiments show that fine-tuned
multilingual models outperform their pre-trained counterparts when adapted to
Bangla-transliterated Chakma, achieving up to 73.54% token accuracy and a
perplexity as low as 2.90. Our analysis further highlights the impact of data
quality on model performance and shows the limitations of OCR pipelines for
morphologically rich Indic scripts. Our research demonstrates that
Bangla-transliterated Chakma can be very effective for transfer learning for
Chakma language, and we release our manually validated monolingual dataset to
encourage further research on multilingual language modeling for low-resource
languages.

*Chi Seng Cheang,Hou Pong Chan,Wenxuan Zhang,Yang Deng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs无法可靠地区分事实与幻觉，因为它们的内部状态只编码知识回忆模式而非真实性。当幻觉与主题知识相关时，其内部处理过程与正确回答相同，导致无法区分；只有与主题知识无关的幻觉才能被检测到。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs是否能在内部表示中可靠区分事实与幻觉，尽管已有研究表明LLMs编码事实性信号，但它们仍会产生事实错误，这引发了对内部计算可靠性的质疑。

Method: 通过机制分析比较两种类型的幻觉：基于主题知识的幻觉和与主题知识无关的幻觉，分析LLMs在处理事实查询时的内部状态几何结构。

Result: 当幻觉与主题知识相关时，LLMs使用与正确回答相同的内部回忆过程，隐藏状态几何结构重叠且无法区分；而与主题知识无关的幻觉产生独特的聚类表示，可以被检测到。

Conclusion: LLMs不在内部状态中编码真实性，只编码知识回忆模式，因此"LLMs并不真正知道它们不知道什么"，揭示了检测基于知识的幻觉的根本局限性。

Abstract: Recent work suggests that large language models (LLMs) encode factuality
signals in their internal representations, such as hidden states, attention
weights, or token probabilities, implying that LLMs may "know what they don't
know". However, LLMs can also produce factual errors by relying on shortcuts or
spurious associations. These error are driven by the same training objective
that encourage correct predictions, raising the question of whether internal
computations can reliably distinguish between factual and hallucinated outputs.
In this work, we conduct a mechanistic analysis of how LLMs internally process
factual queries by comparing two types of hallucinations based on their
reliance on subject information. We find that when hallucinations are
associated with subject knowledge, LLMs employ the same internal recall process
as for correct responses, leading to overlapping and indistinguishable
hidden-state geometries. In contrast, hallucinations detached from subject
knowledge produce distinct, clustered representations that make them
detectable. These findings reveal a fundamental limitation: LLMs do not encode
truthfulness in their internal states but only patterns of knowledge recall,
demonstrating that "LLMs don't really know what they don't know".

TL;DR: 提出了Alif-1.0-8B-Instruct，一个乌尔都语-英语多语言模型，使用改进的自指导技术生成高质量合成数据集，在低预算下实现了对乌尔都语任务的优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低资源语言（如乌尔都语）开发高性能LLM的挑战，包括高质量数据集稀缺、多语言不一致性和安全问题。现有方法通过翻译大量数据但缺乏质量和文化细微差别。

Method: 使用改进的自指导技术开发高质量多语言合成数据集（Urdu-Instruct），包含乌尔都语本地思维链推理、双语翻译、文化相关性和伦理安全对齐。基于预训练的Llama-3.1-8B构建模型。

Result: Alif-1.0-8B-Instruct在乌尔都语特定任务上优于Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct，并超越了Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3、Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct和Cohere-Aya-Expanse-8B等领先多语言LLM，训练预算低于100美元。

Conclusion: 使用改进的自指导方法可以高效开发高性能、低资源语言的LLM，并实现文化对齐。所有数据集、模型和代码都已公开。

Abstract: Developing a high-performing large language models (LLMs) for low-resource
languages such as Urdu, present several challenges. These challenges include
the scarcity of high-quality datasets, multilingual inconsistencies, and safety
concerns. Existing multilingual LLMs often address these issues by translating
large volumes of available data. However, such translations often lack quality
and cultural nuance while also incurring significant costs for data curation
and training. To address these issues, we propose Alif-1.0-8B-Instruct, a
multilingual Urdu-English model, that tackles these challenges with a unique
approach. We train the model on a high-quality, multilingual synthetic dataset
(Urdu-Instruct), developed using a modified self-instruct technique. By using
unique prompts and seed values for each task along with a global task pool,
this dataset incorporates Urdu-native chain-of-thought based reasoning,
bilingual translation, cultural relevance, and ethical safety alignments. This
technique significantly enhances the comprehension of Alif-1.0-8B-Instruct
model for Urdu-specific tasks. As a result, Alif-1.0-8B-Instruct, built upon
the pretrained Llama-3.1-8B, demonstrates superior performance compared to
Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct for Urdu specific-tasks. It also outperformed leading
multilingual LLMs, including Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3, Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct,
and Cohere-Aya-Expanse-8B, all within a training budget of under $100. Our
results demonstrate that high-performance and low-resource language LLMs can be
developed efficiently and culturally aligned using our modified self-instruct
approach. All datasets, models, and code are publicly available at:

*Chung-En Sun,Ge Yan,Akshay Kulkarni,Tsui-Wei Weng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了ReFIne训练框架，通过监督微调和GRPO相结合，提升推理模型的可解释性、忠实性和可靠性，使模型生成结构化推理轨迹、明确披露决策信息并提供置信度评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有长链思维推理研究过于关注准确性和效率，忽视了可信赖性的关键方面。可用的推理系统必须具备可解释性、忠实性和可靠性这三个可信赖特性。

Method: ReFIne训练框架结合监督微调和GRPO，鼓励模型：(i)生成结构化标签式推理轨迹，提高可解释性；(ii)明确披露每个解决方案的决策信息，保持跨部分一致性；(iii)提供推导合理性和最终答案置信度的自我评估。

Result: 在多个规模(1.7B/4B/8B)的Qwen3模型上应用ReFIne，在数学基准测试中显示：推理轨迹更清晰结构化(可解释性+44.0%)，更忠实暴露决策过程(忠实性+18.8%)，提供信息丰富的置信度估计(可靠性+42.4%)。

Conclusion: 研究强调了被忽视但重要的方向：推理模型不仅应优化准确性，还应优化可信赖性的更广泛维度。ReFIne框架有效提升了推理模型的可解释性、忠实性和可靠性。

Abstract: Recent advances in long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning have largely
prioritized answer accuracy and token efficiency, while overlooking aspects
critical to trustworthiness. We argue that usable reasoning systems must be
trustworthy, characterized by three properties: interpretability, faithfulness,
and reliability. To this end, we propose ReFIne, a new training framework that
integrates supervised fine-tuning with GRPO to encourage models to: (i) improve
interpretability by producing structured, tag-based traces with high-level
planning that are easier for humans to follow; (ii) enhance faithfulness by
explicitly disclosing the decisive information guiding each solution, with
consistent cross-section references; and (iii) promote reliability by providing
self-assessments of both the derivation's soundness and the confidence of the
final answer. We apply ReFIne to the Qwen3 models at multiple scales
(1.7B/4B/8B) and evaluate across mathematical benchmarks of varying difficulty.
Our experimental results show that ReFIne models generate clearer and
better-structured reasoning traces (interpretability +44.0%), more faithfully
expose their underlying decision process (faithfulness +18.8%), and offer
informative confidence estimates (reliability +42.4%). These findings highlight
an overlooked but important direction: reasoning models should be optimized not
only for accuracy, but also for broader dimensions of trustworthiness. Our code

*Chihiro Yano,Kosuke Yamada,Hayato Tsukagoshi,Ryohei Sasano,Koichi Takeda*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于因果语言模型(CLM)的语义框架归纳方法FrameEOL，通过提示工程获取框架嵌入，结合上下文学习和深度度量学习，在英语和日语FrameNet数据集上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然因果语言模型(如GPT、Llama系列)在各种语言理解任务中表现出色，但尚未应用于语义框架归纳任务。现有方法主要依赖掩码语言模型(MLM)，而CLM在对话中表现出对框架的理解能力却未被充分利用。

Method: 提出FrameEOL方法：1) 使用提示工程获取框架嵌入，输出代表给定情境的框架名称标签；2) 结合上下文学习(ICL)和深度度量学习(DML)获得更适合框架归纳的嵌入；3) 通过聚类嵌入进行框架归纳。

Result: 在英语和日语FrameNet数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法优于现有的框架归纳方法。特别是对于缺乏丰富框架资源的日语，仅使用5个ICL示例的CLM方法就达到了与使用DML微调的MLM方法相当的性能。

Conclusion: 证明了因果语言模型在语义框架归纳任务中的有效性，特别是在资源匮乏语言上的优越性，为框架语义分析提供了新的技术路径。

Abstract: Semantic frame induction is the task of clustering frame-evoking words
according to the semantic frames they evoke. In recent years, leveraging
embeddings of frame-evoking words that are obtained using masked language
models (MLMs) such as BERT has led to high-performance semantic frame
induction. Although causal language models (CLMs) such as the GPT and Llama
series succeed in a wide range of language comprehension tasks and can engage
in dialogue as if they understood frames, they have not yet been applied to
semantic frame induction. We propose a new method for semantic frame induction
based on CLMs. Specifically, we introduce FrameEOL, a prompt-based method for
obtaining Frame Embeddings that outputs One frame-name as a Label representing
the given situation. To obtain embeddings more suitable for frame induction, we
leverage in-context learning (ICL) and deep metric learning (DML). Frame
induction is then performed by clustering the resulting embeddings.
Experimental results on the English and Japanese FrameNet datasets demonstrate
that the proposed methods outperform existing frame induction methods. In
particular, for Japanese, which lacks extensive frame resources, the CLM-based
method using only 5 ICL examples achieved comparable performance to the
MLM-based method fine-tuned with DML.

TL;DR: 这篇论文对检索增强生成(RAG)进行了全面回顾，分析了RAG在解决大语言模型知识更新和领域特定查询方面的作用，指出了传统RAG框架面临的挑战，并展示了RAG与LLMs结合的应用场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在静态语料上训练，难以处理快速演变的信息或领域特定查询。RAG通过将LLMs与外部检索机制集成来克服这一限制，但随着LLMs自身能力的提升，传统RAG框架的相对优势变得不那么明显。

Method: 通过全面回顾RAG的总体目标和核心组件，分析RAG中的关键挑战，突出其可能限制有效性的关键弱点。

Result: 展示了LLMs单独表现不足但RAG与LLMs结合能显著提升有效性的应用场景。

Conclusion: 这项工作旨在鼓励研究人员重新思考RAG的作用，并激发下一代RAG系统的开发。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled a wide range of applications
through their powerful capabilities in language understanding and generation.
However, as LLMs are trained on static corpora, they face difficulties in
addressing rapidly evolving information or domain-specific queries.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) was developed to overcome this limitation
by integrating LLMs with external retrieval mechanisms, allowing them to access
up-to-date and contextually relevant knowledge. However, as LLMs themselves
continue to advance in scale and capability, the relative advantages of
traditional RAG frameworks have become less pronounced and necessary. Here, we
present a comprehensive review of RAG, beginning with its overarching
objectives and core components. We then analyze the key challenges within RAG,
highlighting critical weakness that may limit its effectiveness. Finally, we
showcase applications where LLMs alone perform inadequately, but where RAG,
when combined with LLMs, can substantially enhance their effectiveness. We hope
this work will encourage researchers to reconsider the role of RAG and inspire
the development of next-generation RAG systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器翻译评估主要依赖表层指标，无法有效评估网络小说翻译中的叙事和文化保真度等关键特性。

Method: 构建DITING评估框架，包含成语翻译、词汇歧义、术语本地化、时态一致性、零代词解析和文化安全性六个维度；提出AgentEval多智能体评估框架模拟专家审议；开发MetricAlign元评估数据集。

Result: 中文训练的LLM表现优于更大规模的外国模型，DeepSeek-V3在忠实度和风格一致性方面表现最佳；AgentEval在七个自动评估指标中与人类判断相关性最高。

Conclusion: 为LLM驱动的网络小说翻译建立了新的评估范式，提供了公开资源以推动未来研究。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have substantially advanced machine translation
(MT), yet their effectiveness in translating web novels remains unclear.
Existing benchmarks rely on surface-level metrics that fail to capture the
distinctive traits of this genre. To address these gaps, we introduce DITING,
the first comprehensive evaluation framework for web novel translation,
assessing narrative and cultural fidelity across six dimensions: idiom
translation, lexical ambiguity, terminology localization, tense consistency,
zero-pronoun resolution, and cultural safety, supported by over 18K
expert-annotated Chinese-English sentence pairs. We further propose AgentEval,
a reasoning-driven multi-agent evaluation framework that simulates expert
deliberation to assess translation quality beyond lexical overlap, achieving
the highest correlation with human judgments among seven tested automatic
metrics. To enable metric comparison, we develop MetricAlign, a meta-evaluation
dataset of 300 sentence pairs annotated with error labels and scalar quality
scores. Comprehensive evaluation of fourteen open, closed, and commercial
models reveals that Chinese-trained LLMs surpass larger foreign counterparts,
and that DeepSeek-V3 delivers the most faithful and stylistically coherent
translations. Our work establishes a new paradigm for exploring LLM-based web
novel translation and provides public resources to advance future research.

Motivation: 现有对话模型在模拟个体人格特质方面存在不足，希望通过思维外显话语（TAU）来更好地捕捉说话者的思考过程，从而提升人格建模的准确性。

Method: 使用思维外显话语增强对话数据训练人格LLM，并通过Big Five人格框架评估模型与说话者人格特质的一致性。

Result: TAU增强数据训练的LLM在Big Five人格特质的亲和性和神经质方面与说话者人格更接近，且TAU质量影响模型性能。

Conclusion: 思维外显话语增强能有效提升LLM的人格建模能力，特别是在亲和性和神经质特质方面，TAU质量是关键影响因素。

Abstract: This study proposes augmenting dialog data with think-aloud utterances (TAUs)
for modeling individual personalities in text chat by LLM. TAU is a
verbalization of a speaker's thought before articulating the utterance. We
expect "persona LLMs" trained with TAU-augmented data can mimic the speaker's
personality trait better. We tested whether the trained persona LLMs obtain the
human personality with respect to Big Five, a framework characterizing human
personality traits from five aspects. The results showed that LLMs trained with
TAU-augmented data more closely align to the speakers' Agreeableness and
Neuroticism of Big Five than those trained with original dialog data. We also
found that the quality of TAU-augmentation impacts persona LLM's performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本去识别方法难以评估其身份隐藏效果，需要通过重新识别攻击来评估去识别方法的鲁棒性。

Method: 1) 研究PII跨度重新识别顺序的影响，通过聚合多个顺序的预测来改进结果；2) 使用推理模型，特别是在攻击者拥有广泛背景知识的情况下。

Result: 多顺序聚合预测和推理模型都能显著提高重新识别性能，特别是在攻击者拥有丰富背景知识时效果更明显。

Conclusion: 提出的两种策略能够构建更强的重新识别攻击，为评估文本去识别方法的鲁棒性提供了更有效的手段。

Abstract: Text de-identification techniques are often used to mask personally
identifiable information (PII) from documents. Their ability to conceal the
identity of the individuals mentioned in a text is, however, hard to measure.
Recent work has shown how the robustness of de-identification methods could be
assessed by attempting the reverse process of _re-identification_, based on an
automated adversary using its background knowledge to uncover the PIIs that
have been masked. This paper presents two complementary strategies to build
stronger re-identification attacks. We first show that (1) the _order_ in which
the PII spans are re-identified matters, and that aggregating predictions
across multiple orderings leads to improved results. We also find that (2)
reasoning models can boost the re-identification performance, especially when
the adversary is assumed to have access to extensive background knowledge.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的翻译增强方法，通过指令模型和层选择性调优，在保持推理能力的同时显著提升多语言翻译性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用大语言模型擅长推理，但专门优化的翻译模型在推理任务上表现不佳，需要一种既能保持推理能力又能提升翻译性能的方法。

Method: 从指令模型开始，仅使用平行数据应用层选择性调优，开发了Qwen3-XPlus模型。

Result: 在高低资源语言翻译上均有显著提升，低资源语言如斯瓦希里语达到15+ spBLEU和40+ xComet；在7个多语言任务上平均提升1+分，同时在15个推理数据集上保持与Qwen3指令模型相当的水平。

Conclusion: 该方法为多语言增强提供了有前景的途径，显著降低了复杂性并提高了更多语言的可访问性。

Abstract: General Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in reasoning, but those enhanced
for translation struggle with reasoning tasks. To address this, we propose a
novel translationenhanced recipe that begins with instruct models and applies
layer-selective tuning only on parallel data. Following this pipeline, we
introduce the Qwen3-XPlus models, which demonstrate significant improvements in
translation performance across both high- and lowresource languages, achieving
15+ spBLEU and 40+ xComet in low-resource languages, like Swahili.
Interestingly, training only with small parallel datasets, Qwen3-XPlus achieves
an average improvement of 1+ points on 7 multilingual tasks while maintaining
proficiency comparable to the Qwen3 instruct model in 15 popular reasoning
datasets. This work offers a promising approach to multilingual enhancement,
significantly reducing complexity and enhancing accessibility for a wider range
of languages. The code and model are publicly available.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DICE是一个轻量级框架，通过小语言模型(SLMs)对大型语言模型(LLMs)的输出进行思维链修正，确保输出符合用户指定的结构化格式要求，同时保持LLMs的知识和推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当处理用户特定需求（如严格输出格式）时，大型语言模型往往优先考虑推理而忽略详细指令。直接微调LLMs成本高昂且参数访问受限。

Method: DICE采用解耦方法：先让LLMs生成自然语言响应，然后使用训练好的SLMs通过思维链分析并精炼这些输出以满足结构化规范。通过两阶段方法构建结构化CoT适应数据集，并应用双重调优策略微调SLMs。

Result: 实验表明，DICE将LLM输出的格式准确性和内容正确性分别提高了35.4%和29.4%，在竞争基线中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: DICE框架有效解决了LLMs在遵循结构化输出规范方面的不足，通过轻量级的SLMs修正机制，在保持LLMs优势的同时显著提升了输出质量。

Abstract: When performing reasoning tasks with user-specific requirements, such as
strict output formats, large language models (LLMs) often prioritize reasoning
over adherence to detailed instructions. Fine-tuning LLMs on supervised
datasets to address this is impractical due to high computational costs and
limited parameter access. To tackle this, we propose DICE, a lightweight
framework that guides small language models (SLMs) to refine LLMs' outputs
through chain-of-thought (CoT) correction. DICE decouples the process by first
prompting LLMs to generate natural language responses, then using trained SLMs
to analyze and refine these outputs to meet structured output specifications.
This framework preserves LLMs' broad knowledge and reasoning capabilities while
ensuring the outputs conform to user demands. Specifically, DICE first
constructs structured CoT adaptation datasets via a two-stage method and
subsequently applies a dual-tuning strategy to fine-tune SLMs for generating
structured outputs in an analyze-then-answer pattern. Experiments demonstrate
that DICE improves the average format accuracy and content correctness of LLM
outputs by 35.4\% and 29.4\%, respectively, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA)
performance over other competitive baselines.

Motivation: 传统统计方法面临数据收集成本高、已知关系重复计算、假设不现实等问题，而现有LLM方法只能发现已知关系，无法发现新关系。

Method: IRIS框架从初始变量开始，自动收集相关文档、提取变量、发现因果关系，采用混合方法结合统计算法和LLM，并包含缺失变量提议组件。

Result: 该框架能够实现实时因果发现，无需预存数据集，仅从初始变量集合出发即可工作。

Conclusion: IRIS解决了传统因果发现方法的局限性，能够同时发现已知和新的因果关系，并动态扩展因果图。

Abstract: Causal discovery is fundamental to scientific research, yet traditional
statistical algorithms face significant challenges, including expensive data
collection, redundant computation for known relations, and unrealistic
assumptions. While recent LLM-based methods excel at identifying commonly known
causal relations, they fail to uncover novel relations. We introduce IRIS
(Iterative Retrieval and Integrated System for Real-Time Causal Discovery), a
novel framework that addresses these limitations. Starting with a set of
initial variables, IRIS automatically collects relevant documents, extracts
variables, and uncovers causal relations. Our hybrid causal discovery method
combines statistical algorithms and LLM-based methods to discover known and
novel causal relations. In addition to causal discovery on initial variables,
the missing variable proposal component of IRIS identifies and incorporates
missing variables to expand the causal graphs. Our approach enables real-time
causal discovery from only a set of initial variables without requiring
pre-existing datasets.

Motivation: 在危机情况下有效识别威胁并减轻潜在损害至关重要，但目前NLP技术主要局限于分类任务，而使用NLG架构生成及时预警消息的潜力被大大忽视。

Method: 从现有危机描述出发创建事件链，为每个事件配对预警消息，遵循专家指南确保术语准确性和事实性。同时为每条消息提供三种次优警告类型，比较了监督微调、偏好对齐、零样本和少样本等不同NLG方法。

Result: 构建了包含40多万条预警消息的大规模数据集，覆盖近18,000个危机情境。实验比较了多种NLG方法的性能，并评估了分布外场景下的模型表现和自动后编辑器的有效性。

Conclusion: CrisiText数据集填补了危机预警消息生成领域的空白，为研究不同NLG方法提供了重要资源，有助于在紧急情况下为民众提供及时有效的警告信息。

Abstract: Effectively identifying threats and mitigating their potential damage during
crisis situations, such as natural disasters or violent attacks, is paramount
for safeguarding endangered individuals. To tackle these challenges, AI has
been used in assisting humans in emergency situations. Still, the use of NLP
techniques remains limited and mostly focuses on classification tasks. The
significant potential of timely warning message generation using NLG
architectures, however, has been largely overlooked. In this paper we present
CrisiText, the first large-scale dataset for the generation of warning messages
across 13 different types of crisis scenarios. The dataset contains more than
400,000 warning messages (spanning almost 18,000 crisis situations) aimed at
assisting civilians during and after such events. To generate the dataset, we
started from existing crisis descriptions and created chains of events related
to the scenarios. Each event was then paired with a warning message. The
generations follow experts' written guidelines to ensure correct terminology
and factuality of their suggestions. Additionally, each message is accompanied
by three suboptimal warning types to allow for the study of different NLG
approaches. To this end, we conducted a series of experiments comparing
supervised fine-tuning setups with preference alignment, zero-shot, and
few-shot approaches. We further assessed model performance in
out-of-distribution scenarios and evaluated the effectiveness of an automatic
post-editor.

*Chenyang Gu,Yewen Pu,Bruce Yang,Xiaofan Li,Huan Gao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出DSPO算法，通过序列级优化和动态样本过滤增强LLM的外部知识搜索能力，在多个QA基准上显著提升性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么依赖提示激发模型内在能力，要么在复杂交互任务中应用RL时存在性能瓶颈和崩溃问题，未能充分挖掘模型的智能体潜力

Method: DSPO算法：动态过滤序列级策略优化，通过纯RL训练实现多轮搜索和推理的交错，无需监督演示数据

Result: 7B模型在多个QA基准上比同类工作提升34.1%，在HotpotQA等复杂多跳QA上甚至超越之前14B模型近9%相对性能，训练稳定性优异

Conclusion: DSPO算法能有效增强LLM的外部知识搜索能力，在复杂任务中表现出色且训练稳定

Abstract: Enhancing LLMs with the ability to actively search external knowledge is
crucial for complex and real-world tasks. Current approaches either rely on
prompting to elicit the model's innate agent capabilities, or suffer from
performance ceilings and collapse when applying RL to complex interactive
tasks, leaving their true agentic potential untapped. To address this, we
introduce \textbf{D}ynamic-filter \textbf{S}equence-level \textbf{P}olicy
\textbf{O}ptimization (DSPO), an improved RL algorithm designed for robust
agent training through sequence-level optimization and dynamic sample
filtering. We train our model purely through RL to interleave multi-turn search
and reasoning, obviating the need for supervised demonstration data. Across
multiple QA benchmarks, our DSPO-trained 7B model improves over a comparable
previous work by \textbf{34.1\%}, and even outperforms the 14B model from
previous work in complex multihop QA such as HotpotQA by nearly \textbf{9\%
relative}, maintaining exceptional training stability.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了Self-Critique方法，首次系统研究RL后训练阶段的数据污染检测问题，通过检测模型输出熵分布崩溃来识别污染数据，在RL-MIA基准上显著优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据污染严重威胁大语言模型评估的可靠性。虽然已有方法检测预训练和SFT阶段的污染，但RL后训练这一关键阶段缺乏专门的污染检测方法，存在严重漏洞。

Method: 提出Self-Critique方法，基于RL后训练导致模型输出熵分布崩溃到特定稀疏模式的观察，通过探测底层策略崩溃来检测污染。同时构建RL-MIA基准模拟RL阶段污染场景。

Result: 大量实验表明，Self-Critique在多个模型和污染任务上显著优于基线方法，AUC提升高达30%。现有方法对RL阶段污染接近随机猜测，而本方法使检测成为可能。

Conclusion: Self-Critique有效解决了RL后训练阶段的数据污染检测问题，填补了该领域的研究空白，为可靠评估LLM提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Data contamination poses a significant threat to the reliable evaluation of
Large Language Models (LLMs). This issue arises when benchmark samples may
inadvertently appear in training sets, compromising the validity of reported
performance. While detection methods have been developed for the pre-training
and Supervised Fine-Tuning stages, a critical research gap exists for the
increasingly significant phase of Reinforcement Learning (RL) post-training. As
RL post-training becomes pivotal for advancing LLM reasoning, the absence of
specialized contamination detection methods in this paradigm presents a
critical vulnerability. To address this, we conduct the first systematic study
of data detection within RL post-training scenario and propose Self-Critique.
Our method is motivated by a key observation: after RL phase, the output
entropy distribution of LLMs tends to collapse into highly specific and sparse
modes. Self-Critique probes for the underlying policy collapse, i.e., the
model's convergence to a narrow reasoning path, which causes this entropy
reduction. To facilitate this research, we also introduce RL-MIA, a benchmark
constructed to simulate this specific contamination scenario. Extensive
experiments show that Self-Critique significantly outperforms baseline methods
across multiple models and contamination tasks, achieving an AUC improvement of
up to 30%. Whereas existing methods are close to a random guess for RL-phase
contamination, our method makes detection possible.

TL;DR: 提出了CFVBench基准测试，评估多模态检索增强生成模型在视频理解中的表现，发现现有模型难以捕捉细粒度多模态细节，并提出了自适应视觉优化框架AVR来改进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频MRAG基准测试在模态覆盖和格式多样性方面存在局限，主要关注单模态或有限模态任务，缺乏对细粒度多模态信息的评估。

Method: 构建了CFVBench大规模基准测试，包含599个公开视频和5360个开放问答对；提出了自适应视觉优化(AVR)框架，通过自适应增加帧采样密度和选择性调用外部工具来提升细粒度多模态理解。

Result: 系统评估了7种检索方法和14个常用MLLMs，发现当前模型（包括GPT5和Gemini）难以捕捉瞬态但关键的细粒度多模态细节；AVR框架在所有评估的MLLMs中一致提升了细粒度多模态理解和性能。

Conclusion: 细粒度多模态细节的捕捉是当前MLLMs的关键瓶颈，AVR框架提供了一种简单有效的解决方案，能够显著提升模型在复杂视频理解任务中的表现。

Abstract: Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MRAG) enables Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) to generate responses with external multimodal
evidence, and numerous video-based MRAG benchmarks have been proposed to
evaluate model capabilities across retrieval and generation stages. However,
existing benchmarks remain limited in modality coverage and format diversity,
often focusing on single- or limited-modality tasks, or coarse-grained scene
understanding. To address these gaps, we introduce CFVBench, a large-scale,
manually verified benchmark constructed from 599 publicly available videos,
yielding 5,360 open-ended QA pairs. CFVBench spans high-density formats and
domains such as chart-heavy reports, news broadcasts, and software tutorials,
requiring models to retrieve and reason over long temporal video spans while
maintaining fine-grained multimodal information. Using CFVBench, we
systematically evaluate 7 retrieval methods and 14 widely-used MLLMs, revealing
a critical bottleneck: current models (even GPT5 or Gemini) struggle to capture
transient yet essential fine-grained multimodal details. To mitigate this, we
propose Adaptive Visual Refinement (AVR), a simple yet effective framework that
adaptively increases frame sampling density and selectively invokes external
tools when necessary. Experiments show that AVR consistently enhances
fine-grained multimodal comprehension and improves performance across all
evaluated MLLMs

TL;DR: DyReMe是一个动态医疗诊断基准，通过生成类似真实咨询的病例、引入干扰因素和多样化表达风格，更准确地评估大语言模型在临床实践中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于静态医学考试题目的LLM评估方法与现实临床实践存在严重偏差，高估模型性能且忽略了真实世界中病例的模糊性和多样性。

Method: 提出DyReMe动态基准，生成新鲜咨询式病例，引入鉴别诊断和常见误诊因素等干扰项，并变化表达风格模拟真实查询习惯。

Result: 实验表明动态评估方法更具挑战性和真实性，揭示了最先进LLM表现与现实临床实践之间的显著偏差。

Conclusion: 迫切需要能更好反映可信医疗诊断需求的评估框架，DyReMe为此提供了更现实的评估方法。

Abstract: Medical diagnostics is a high-stakes and complex domain that is critical to
patient care. However, current evaluations of large language models (LLMs) are
fundamentally misaligned with real-world clinical practice. Most of them rely
on static benchmarks derived from public medical exam items, which tend to
overestimate model performance and ignore the difference between textbook cases
and the ambiguous, varying conditions in the real world. Recent efforts toward
dynamic evaluation offer a promising alternative, but their improvements are
limited to superficial perturbations and a narrow focus on accuracy. To address
these gaps, we propose DyReMe, a dynamic benchmark for medical diagnostics that
better reflects real clinical practice. Unlike static exam-style questions,
DyReMe generates fresh, consultation-like cases that introduce distractors such
as differential diagnoses and common misdiagnosis factors. It also varies
expression styles to mimic diverse real-world query habits. Beyond accuracy,
DyReMe evaluates LLMs on three additional clinically relevant dimensions:
veracity, helpfulness, and consistency. Our experiments demonstrate that this
dynamic approach yields more challenging and realistic assessments, revealing
significant misalignments between the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs and
real clinical practice. These findings highlight the urgent need for evaluation
frameworks that better reflect the demands of trustworthy medical diagnostics.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CLARity是一个成本效益高的强化学习框架，使用小型通用LLM来提升专家模型在稀缺数据领域的推理质量，通过一致性感知奖励机制和两阶段训练流程，显著改善了响应一致性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在数据稀缺领域训练专家LLM很困难，通常依赖多选题。但标准的基于结果的强化学习虽然可能提高准确性，却常常降低推理质量如逻辑一致性。现有监督推理的解决方案（如大规模过程奖励模型）成本过高。

Method: CLARity框架整合了：1）一致性感知奖励机制；2）两阶段的精炼-监控训练流程来增强推理一致性；3）动态数据重构策略以更好地利用有限数据。

Result: 实验表明，CLARity相比基线方法将响应一致性提高了16.5%，准确性提高了7.5%。人工评估进一步确认了在连贯性和专业性方面的整体改进。

Conclusion: CLARity提供了一个通用解决方案，使较小模型能够通过推理一致性有效指导专家模型。

Abstract: Training expert LLMs in domains with scarce data is difficult, often relying
on multiple-choice questions (MCQs). However, standard outcome-based
reinforcement learning (RL) on MCQs is risky. While it may improve accuracy, we
observe it often degrades reasoning quality such as logical consistency.
Existing solutions to supervise reasoning, such as large-scale Process Reward
Models (PRMs), are prohibitively expensive. To address this, we propose
CLARity, a cost-effective RL framework that enhances reasoning quality using
only a small, general-purpose LLM. CLARity integrates a consistency-aware
reward mechanism with a 2-stage refine-then-monitor training pipeline to
enhance reasoning consistency, and a dynamic data reformulation strategy to to
better exploit limited data. Experiments demonstrate that CLARity improves
response consistency by 16.5% and accuracy by 7.5% over baselines. Human
evaluations further confirm holistic improvements in coherence and
professionalism. Thus, CLARity offers a generalizable solution that enables
smaller models to effectively guide expert models by reasoning consistency.Our

TL;DR: DualCSE是一种句子嵌入方法，为每个句子分配两个嵌入向量：一个表示显式语义，另一个表示隐式语义，以克服传统单向量方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统句子嵌入方法为每个句子只分配单个向量，难以有效捕捉句子中的隐式语义，存在固有局限性。

Method: 提出DualCSE方法，为每个句子分配两个共存于共享空间的嵌入向量：显式语义嵌入和隐式语义嵌入，可根据特定任务需求选择相应语义。

Result: 实验结果表明DualCSE能够有效编码显式和隐式含义，并提升下游任务性能。

Conclusion: DualCSE通过双嵌入向量方法成功克服了传统句子嵌入在捕捉隐式语义方面的局限性，为信息检索和文本分类等任务提供了更好的语义表示。

Abstract: Sentence embedding methods have made remarkable progress, yet they still
struggle to capture the implicit semantics within sentences. This can be
attributed to the inherent limitations of conventional sentence embedding
methods that assign only a single vector per sentence. To overcome this
limitation, we propose DualCSE, a sentence embedding method that assigns two
embeddings to each sentence: one representing the explicit semantics and the
other representing the implicit semantics. These embeddings coexist in the
shared space, enabling the selection of the desired semantics for specific
purposes such as information retrieval and text classification. Experimental
results demonstrate that DualCSE can effectively encode both explicit and
implicit meanings and improve the performance of the downstream task.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型预训练过程中的评估存在显著不稳定性，这种不稳定性掩盖了真实的学习动态，阻碍了LLM研究的进展。

Method: 提出MaP双管齐下框架：1) 检查点合并 - 通过平均近期模型权重来平滑参数空间；2) Pass@k指标 - 提供稳健、低方差的模型能力统计估计。

Result: 实验表明MaP能显著平滑性能曲线，减少运行间方差，确保更一致的模型排名。

Conclusion: MaP为观察LLM训练动态提供了更可靠和真实的视角，为LLM研究奠定了重要的实证基础。

Abstract: Reliable evaluation is fundamental to the progress of Large Language Models
(LLMs), yet the evaluation process during pre-training is plagued by
significant instability that obscures true learning dynamics. In this work, we
systematically diagnose this instability, attributing it to two distinct
sources: \textit{Parameter Instability} from training stochasticity and
\textit{Evaluation Instability} from noisy measurement protocols. To counteract
both sources of noise, we introduce \textbf{MaP}, a dual-pronged framework that
synergistically integrates checkpoint \underline{M}erging \underline{a}nd the
\underline{P}ass@k metric. Checkpoint merging smooths the parameter space by
averaging recent model weights, while Pass@k provides a robust, low-variance
statistical estimate of model capability. Extensive experiments show that MaP
yields significantly smoother performance curves, reduces inter-run variance,
and ensures more consistent model rankings. Ultimately, MaP provides a more
reliable and faithful lens for observing LLM training dynamics, laying a
crucial empirical foundation for LLM research.

Motivation: 法院观点生成是法律人工智能中的基础任务，直接从原始案件事实生成法院观点存在性能限制，需要专门设计的模型来处理案件事实的多样性和复杂性。

Method: 构建了包含11万多个案件的中文法院观点生成数据集CCVG，每个案件包含事实描述和对应的法院观点。基于此数据集训练专门的大语言模型ShiZhi。

Result: ShiZhi在法院观点生成任务中达到58.5 BLEU-1，在罪名预测任务中达到86.1%准确率和92.5%宏F1，证明即使是小型大语言模型在高质量领域特定数据上训练也能生成合理且法律连贯的法院观点。

Conclusion: 实验结果表明，当在高质量领域特定数据上训练时，即使是小型大语言模型也能生成合理且法律连贯的法院观点，为法律人工智能领域提供了有价值的模型和数据集。

Abstract: Criminal Court View Generation (CVG) is a fundamental task in legal
artificial intelligence, aiming to automatically generate the "Court View"
section of a legal case document. Generating court views is challenging due to
the diversity and complexity of case facts, and directly generating from raw
facts may limit performance. In this paper, we present ShiZhi, the first large
language model (LLM) specifically designed for court view generation. We
construct a Chinese Court View Generation dataset, CCVG, of more than 110K
cases, each containing fact descriptions paired with corresponding court views.
Based on this dataset, ShiZhi achieving 58.5 BLEU-1 on court view generation
and 86.1\% accuracy with 92.5\% macro F1 on charge prediction. Experimental
results demonstrate that even a small LLM can generate reasonable and legally
coherent court views when trained on high-quality domain-specific data. Our

TL;DR: MaskKV是一个专为扩散大语言模型设计的训练无关缓存淘汰框架，通过掩码查询引导的评分机制和自适应缓存预算策略，显著减少KV缓存内存占用，在仅使用256对KV缓存时仍能保持94%性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散大语言模型的双向注意力缓存机制需要大量内存，限制了其在资源受限环境下处理长上下文的能力。现有的缓存淘汰策略为自回归模型设计，忽略了扩散模型的独特特性。

Method: 提出MaskKV框架：1）掩码查询引导的评分机制，利用注意力权重识别和淘汰每个注意力头中不太重要的提示词；2）自适应缓存预算策略，减少中间层分配，将资源集中在偏好提示的注意力头上。

Result: 在LLaDA模型上，仅使用256对KV缓存（少于5%的token）就能在LongBench上保持94%的完整缓存性能，在32k提示长度下实现高达31倍的加速。

Conclusion: MaskKV有效解决了扩散大语言模型的缓存内存瓶颈问题，为资源受限环境下的长上下文处理提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) present a promising alternative to
dominant autoregressive models (ARMs) by the ability of parallel decoding at
the expense of substantial computation and memory costs. Specifically, the
cache mechanism for bidirectional attention in dLLMs demands large memory
footprint, restricting their ability to handle long contexts under
resource-limited settings. Existing cache eviction strategies are designed for
ARMs and ignore the unique characteristics of dLLMs, thus leading to
unsatisfactory performance. To address these challenges, we introduce MaskKV, a
training-free cache eviction framework tailored to dLLMs, focusing on the
effect of mask tokens in dLLMs. MaskKV is built on two key innovations: (1) a
mask-query guided scoring mechanism that leverages attention weights to
identify and evict less critical prompt tokens for each head; (2) an adaptive
cache budgeting strategy that improves efficiency by reducing allocation in
intermediate layers and concentrating resources on prompt-preferring heads. On
LLaDA with MaskKV, compressing the KV cache to only 256 pairs (less than 5% of
tokens) retains 94% of the full-cache performance on LongBench and achieves up
to 31x acceleration at 32k prompt length. The code is publicly available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的CoT验证方法基于输出(黑盒)或激活(灰盒)预测推理正确性，但无法深入理解计算失败的原因。需要一种能揭示推理错误根本原因的白盒验证方法。

Method: 将正确CoT步骤的归因图视为潜在推理电路的执行轨迹，训练分类器识别这些图的结构特征差异。通过分析计算图的结构指纹来验证推理过程。

Result: 1) 错误的结构特征具有高度预测性；2) 不同推理任务的错误表现出不同的计算模式；3) 通过针对性干预transcoder特征成功纠正模型的错误推理。

Conclusion: 通过深入分析模型的计算过程，可以从简单的错误检测转向对LLM推理的因果理解，白盒方法为理解推理错误提供了新的科学见解。

Abstract: Current Chain-of-Thought (CoT) verification methods predict reasoning
correctness based on outputs (black-box) or activations (gray-box), but offer
limited insight into why a computation fails. We introduce a white-box method:
Circuit-based Reasoning Verification (CRV). We hypothesize that attribution
graphs of correct CoT steps, viewed as execution traces of the model's latent
reasoning circuits, possess distinct structural fingerprints from those of
incorrect steps. By training a classifier on structural features of these
graphs, we show that these traces contain a powerful signal of reasoning
errors. Our white-box approach yields novel scientific insights unattainable by
other methods. (1) We demonstrate that structural signatures of error are
highly predictive, establishing the viability of verifying reasoning directly
via its computational graph. (2) We find these signatures to be highly
domain-specific, revealing that failures in different reasoning tasks manifest
as distinct computational patterns. (3) We provide evidence that these
signatures are not merely correlational; by using our analysis to guide
targeted interventions on individual transcoder features, we successfully
correct the model's faulty reasoning. Our work shows that, by scrutinizing a
model's computational process, we can move from simple error detection to a
deeper, causal understanding of LLM reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型参数庞大，难以在资源受限硬件上部署。现有低秩压缩方法采用统一压缩比会导致性能显著下降，且在解码阶段表现不佳。

Method: FLRC高效确定每层最优秩分配，并采用渐进低秩解码技术来维持文本生成质量。

Result: 在多样化基准测试中，FLRC在摘要任务上的ROUGE-L得分比最先进低秩压缩方法提升高达17%。

Conclusion: FLRC建立了一个更鲁棒高效的框架来改进LLM推理，实现了更好的压缩效果和性能保持。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLM) have achieved remarkable performance,
their enormous parameter counts hinder deployment on resource-constrained
hardware. Low-rank compression can reduce both memory usage and computational
demand, but applying a uniform compression ratio across all layers often leads
to significant performance degradation, and previous methods perform poorly
during decoding. To address these issues, we propose the Fine-grained Low-Rank
Compressor (FLRC), which efficiently determines an optimal rank allocation for
each layer, and incorporates progressive low-rank decoding to maintain text
generation quality. Comprehensive experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate
the superiority of FLRC, achieving up to a 17% improvement in ROUGE-L on
summarization tasks compared to state-of-the-art low-rank compression methods,
establishing a more robust and efficient framework to improve LLM inference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: C2C平台上的个人卖家在二手产品定价方面面临困难，现有静态回归模型泛化能力差且无法捕捉市场动态变化。

Method: 使用LLM框架，先检索相似产品，然后通过双向推理构建的数据集进行监督微调和组相对策略优化的两阶段优化，并采用基于置信度的过滤机制。

Result: 在闲鱼平台部署后，在30%产品覆盖率下，静态采纳率从40%提升到72%，在90%召回率下仍保持47%的采纳率。

Conclusion: LLP框架显著优于现有方法，能够很好地泛化到未见过的类别，在实际应用中表现出色。

Abstract: Unlike Business-to-Consumer e-commerce platforms (e.g., Amazon),
inexperienced individual sellers on Consumer-to-Consumer platforms (e.g., eBay)
often face significant challenges in setting prices for their second-hand
products efficiently. Therefore, numerous studies have been proposed for
automating price prediction. However, most of them are based on static
regression models, which suffer from poor generalization performance and fail
to capture market dynamics (e.g., the price of a used iPhone decreases over
time). Inspired by recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs), we
introduce LLP, the first LLM-based generative framework for second-hand product
pricing. LLP first retrieves similar products to better align with the dynamic
market change. Afterwards, it leverages the LLMs' nuanced understanding of key
pricing information in free-form text to generate accurate price suggestions.
To strengthen the LLMs' domain reasoning over retrieved products, we apply a
two-stage optimization, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) followed by group relative
policy optimization (GRPO), on a dataset built via bidirectional reasoning.
Moreover, LLP employs a confidence-based filtering mechanism to reject
unreliable price suggestions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LLP
substantially surpasses existing methods while generalizing well to unseen
categories. We have successfully deployed LLP on Xianyu\footnote\{Xianyu is
China's largest second-hand e-commerce platform.\}, significantly outperforming
the previous pricing method. Under the same 30\% product coverage, it raises
the static adoption rate (SAR) from 40\% to 72\%, and maintains a strong SAR of
47\% even at 90\% recall.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估方法主要关注最终答案的准确性，忽略了推理过程的有效性，可能导致对小型语言模型能力的过度估计。

Method: 引入ReTraceQA基准测试，使用专家标注的数据集，并采用大型语言模型作为自动评判器进行推理感知评估。

Result: 研究发现14-24%的情况下小型语言模型给出正确答案但推理过程有缺陷；使用推理感知评估时，小型语言模型性能显著下降（最多下降25%）。

Conclusion: 仅依赖最终答案准确性会高估小型语言模型的推理能力，需要更全面的推理过程评估方法。

Abstract: While Small Language Models (SLMs) have demonstrated promising performance on
an increasingly wide array of commonsense reasoning benchmarks, current
evaluation practices rely almost exclusively on the accuracy of their final
answers, neglecting the validity of the reasoning processes that lead to those
answers. To address this issue, we introduce ReTraceQA, a novel benchmark that
introduces process-level evaluation for commonsense reasoning tasks. Our
expert-annotated dataset reveals that in a substantial portion of instances
(14-24%), SLMs provide correct final answers despite flawed reasoning
processes, suggesting that the capabilities of SLMs are often overestimated by
evaluation metrics that focus only on comparing the final answer with the
ground truth. Indeed, we show that when employing strong Large Language Models
(LLMs) as automated judges for reasoning-aware evaluation rather than
answer-only metrics, SLM performance drops significantly across all models and

TL;DR: ThinkLogit是一种无需训练的解码时方法，通过logit算术使用小推理模型引导大模型进行长链推理，ThinkLogit-DPO进一步通过偏好优化训练引导模型，显著提升推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型推理模型的长链推理能力是否可以在无需额外训练的情况下激发，避免昂贵的后训练成本。

Method: 提出ThinkLogit方法，利用logit算术将小推理模型作为引导器来调优目标大模型；进一步开发ThinkLogit-DPO，通过偏好优化训练引导模型。

Result: 在五个推理基准测试中，ThinkLogit和ThinkLogit-DPO分别实现了24.5%和29.1%的相对准确率提升，使用21倍小的引导模型就能有效提升大模型性能。

Conclusion: ThinkLogit方法有效解锁大型模型的长推理能力，无需昂贵后训练，且与不同模型家族兼容，为大规模模型推理提供实用路径。

Abstract: Large reasoning models exhibit long chain-of-thought reasoning with
strategies such as backtracking and self-correction, though recent studies
suggest that these abilities typically require additional training. We first
investigate whether such behaviors can be elicited without any training. To
this end, we propose a decoding-time approach, ThinkLogit, which utilizes logit
arithmetic to tune a target large non-reasoning model for long reasoning using
a substantially smaller reasoning model as the guider. We then show that we can
further boost its performance by training the guider model with preference
optimization over correct/incorrect reasoning pairs sampled from both the
target and guider model, a setup we refer to as ThinkLogit-DPO. Our experiments
demonstrate that ThinkLogit and ThinkLogit-DPO achieve a relative improvement
in average accuracy by 24.5% and 29.1%, respectively, over five reasoning
benchmarks using the Qwen2.5-32B guided by R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, a model 21x
smaller. Moreover, we find that ThinkLogit remains effective when the guider
and target come from different model families. It is also orthogonal to
post-training methods for small models, as guiders improved through supervised
distillation or reinforcement learning can be directly plugged in to yield
stronger large models, offering a practical path to unlock long reasoning in
large-scale models without costly post-training.

TL;DR: 提出NL2GenSym框架，将大语言模型与SOAR认知架构结合，从自然语言自动生成符号规则，解决了SOAR手动编码规则的低效问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SOAR认知架构需要手动编码规则，效率低下。大语言模型有生成规则的潜力，但缺乏实验验证。需要填补这一研究空白。

Method: 提出执行导向的生成器-批评者机制：LLM生成器基于检索增强生成访问自演进知识库生成规则，在SOAR环境中执行验证，批评者根据执行反馈迭代优化规则。

Result: 在Water Jug Problem数据集上，成功率达到86%以上，生成的新启发式规则将平均决策周期降至最优解的1.98倍，比基线方法减少1000倍。小参数模型表现优于大模型。

Conclusion: NL2GenSym框架有效解决了SOAR规则生成问题，实现了从自然语言到符号规则的自动转换，提升了认知架构的实用性。

Abstract: SOAR, a classic symbol-based cognitive architecture, has been fostering the
development of general, human-like intelligent agents. Nevertheless, its
practical adoption is hindered by the laborious manual rule coding. Emerging
Large Language Models (LLMs) present the immense potential for efficient rules
generation. However, there is a critical gap that current research
predominantly focuses on conceptual frameworks and lacks robust experimental
validation. To bridge this gap, we propose \textit{N}atural \textit{L}anguage
to \textit{Gen}erative \textit{Sym}bolic Rules (NL2GenSym), a novel framework
that integrates LLMs with SOAR to autonomously produce generative symbolic
rules from natural language. Specifically, our framework introduces a novel
Execution-Grounded Generator-Critic mechanism. The LLM-based Generator, guided
by a Retrieval-Augmented Generation-accessed self-evolving domain knowledge
base, proposes rules from natural language. Subsequently, these rules are
immediately executed within the SOAR environment to rigorously validate their
correctness. Based on this execution-grounded feedback, a reflective LLM-based
Critic drives the iterative refinement of these rules. Experiments on our
specialized Water Jug Problem (WJP) dataset, utilizing both Gemini and Qwen
series models, validate the efficacy of our framework. It achieves a success
rate over 86\% in generating rules from natural language. Crucially, the
framework also generates novel heuristic rules, reducing average decision
cycles for solving the WJP to 1.98 times the optimal solution and 1/1000 of
baseline methods. Additionally, our initial experiments show that NL2GenSym
enables smaller-parameter models to achieve better performance than larger
counterparts.

TL;DR: 本文首次系统研究医学大语言模型的领域特定微调机制，发现微调仅改变小部分表征子空间，提出tuning vectors框架捕获参数偏移方向，揭示微调主要向MLP层写入新方向信息并放大注意力头中的现有方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解领域特定微调如何重塑大语言模型的参数空间，现有研究主要关注自回归或通用指令模型，领域专业化LLM机制尚不明确。

Method: 提出tuning vectors框架（受task vectors启发），捕获微调引起的参数方向偏移，分析不同层的方向对齐。

Result: 微调仅修改小部分表征子空间，tuning vectors能提升指令遵循和生成质量，跨领域组合可改善泛化能力，MLP层写入新方向而注意力头放大现有方向。

Conclusion: 为LLM适应提供新见解，建立了分析大语言模型专业化的通用可解释框架。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) fine-tuned for specific domains exhibit strong
performance; however, the underlying mechanisms by which this fine-tuning
reshapes their parametric space are not well understood. Prior works primarily
focus on auto-regressive or general-purpose instruct models, leaving
domain-specialised LLMs under-explored. We present the first systematic study
of domain-specific fine-tuning in large medical language models. Our analysis
reveals that fine-tuning modifies only a small subset of the representational
subspace, essentially preserving the pre-trained model's representation. To
interpret these changes in subspaces, we propose tuning vectors, a novel
framework inspired by task vectors, which explicitly capture the directional
parameter shifts induced by fine-tuning. We demonstrate that these vectors are
critical for enhancing both instruction-following and generation quality.
Furthermore, combining tuning vectors across different domains yields improved
generalisation. Upon closer inspection of directional alignment, we find these
vectors primarily write new directional information into the MLP layers of the
model, while amplifying existing directions in attention heads. Our findings
offer new insights into LLM adaptation and provide a general, interpretable
framework for analysing specialisation in large language models.

Motivation: GRPO和相关熵正则化方法在链式思维推理中面临token奖励稀疏性挑战，现有方法依赖无差别的token级熵调整，常导致熵崩溃或模型崩溃。

Method: 提出TEPO框架，通过马尔可夫似然将组级奖励与token关联，实现token级聚合，解决奖励稀疏性问题。

Result: TEPO在所有关键指标上持续优于现有基线，在数学推理任务上达到新的最先进水平，并显著提升了训练稳定性。

Conclusion: TEPO框架有效解决了token奖励稀疏性问题，为提升语言模型推理能力提供了新方法。

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has significantly advanced the
reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs), particularly by boosting
their mathematical performance. However, GRPO and related
entropy-regularization methods still face challenges rooted in the sparse token
rewards inherent to chain-of-thought (CoT). Current approaches often rely on
undifferentiated token-level entropy adjustments, which frequently lead to
entropy collapse or model collapse. In this work, we propose TEPO, a novel
token-level framework that incorporates Markov Likelihood (sequence likelihood)
links group-level rewards with tokens via token-level aggregation. Experiments
show that TEPO consistently outperforms existing baselines across key metrics
(including @k and accuracy). It not only sets a new state of the art on
mathematical reasoning tasks but also significantly enhances training
stability.

Motivation: 自然语言中的歧义会导致AI生成的代码看似正确但不符合用户意图，特别是在数据可视化领域，这影响了人机协作的效果。

Method: 开发歧义分类法并提出量化指标，使用DS-1000数据集的Matplotlib问题进行验证，评估三种语用模型（Gricean合作原则、话语表征理论、问题讨论框架）的多轮对话策略。

Result: 提出的歧义指标比不确定性基线更好地与人工标注相关，多轮对话能有效减少歧义并提高代码准确性。

Conclusion: 多轮对话在代码生成中具有重要价值，能够通过减少歧义来更好地匹配用户目标，提高人机协作质量。

Abstract: Establishing shared goals is a fundamental step in human-AI communication.
However, ambiguities can lead to outputs that seem correct but fail to reflect
the speaker's intent. In this paper, we explore this issue with a focus on the
data visualization domain, where ambiguities in natural language impact the
generation of code that visualizes data. The availability of multiple views on
the contextual (e.g., the intended plot and the code rendering the plot) allows
for a unique and comprehensive analysis of diverse ambiguity types. We develop
a taxonomy of types of ambiguity that arise in this task and propose metrics to
quantify them. Using Matplotlib problems from the DS-1000 dataset, we
demonstrate that our ambiguity metrics better correlate with human annotations
than uncertainty baselines. Our work also explores how multi-turn dialogue can
reduce ambiguity, therefore, improve code accuracy by better matching user
goals. We evaluate three pragmatic models to inform our dialogue strategies:
Gricean Cooperativity, Discourse Representation Theory, and Questions under
Discussion. A simulated user study reveals how pragmatic dialogues reduce
ambiguity and enhance code accuracy, highlighting the value of multi-turn
exchanges in code generation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种多尺度图思维链提示框架，将多尺度结构信息融入图提示中，通过从粗到细的粒度动态整合多尺度信息，在少样本场景下显著优于现有单粒度图提示方法。


<details>

Motivation: 现有的图提示调优方法局限于单粒度提示生成，忽略了图数据固有的多尺度结构信息，限制了提示语义的多样性。

Method: 设计轻量级低秩粗化网络捕获多尺度结构特征作为层次基向量，模仿人类从粗到细的认知过程，在每个推理步骤动态整合多尺度信息，形成渐进式粗到细提示链。

Result: 在8个基准数据集上的实验表明，MSGCOT优于最先进的单粒度图提示调优方法，特别是在少样本场景下表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: 将多尺度信息整合到图提示中是有效的，MSGCOT框架通过多尺度思维链提示显著提升了图提示调优的性能。

Abstract: The "pre-train, prompt'' paradigm, designed to bridge the gap between
pre-training tasks and downstream objectives, has been extended from the NLP
domain to the graph domain and has achieved remarkable progress. Current
mainstream graph prompt-tuning methods modify input or output features using
learnable prompt vectors. However, existing approaches are confined to
single-granularity (e.g., node-level or subgraph-level) during prompt
generation, overlooking the inherently multi-scale structural information in
graph data, which limits the diversity of prompt semantics. To address this
issue, we pioneer the integration of multi-scale information into graph prompt
and propose a Multi-Scale Graph Chain-of-Thought (MSGCOT) prompting framework.
Specifically, we design a lightweight, low-rank coarsening network to
efficiently capture multi-scale structural features as hierarchical basis
vectors for prompt generation. Subsequently, mimicking human cognition from
coarse-to-fine granularity, we dynamically integrate multi-scale information at
each reasoning step, forming a progressive coarse-to-fine prompt chain.
Extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets demonstrate that MSGCOT
outperforms the state-of-the-art single-granularity graph prompt-tuning method,
particularly in few-shot scenarios, showcasing superior performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法依赖完全标注的数据集，标注成本高昂，需要一种能高效识别最佳LLM的框架。

Method: 自适应选择信息量最大的查询进行标注，并利用基于评判者的标注模型进一步减少标注成本。

Result: 在6个基准测试和151个LLM上的实验显示，标注成本降低高达59.62%，能有效选择最佳和次佳模型。

Conclusion: LLM SELECTOR提供了一种高效的模型选择方法，显著降低了标注需求，适用于实际应用场景。

Abstract: We introduce LLM SELECTOR, the first framework for active model selection of
Large Language Models (LLMs). Unlike prior evaluation and benchmarking
approaches that rely on fully annotated datasets, LLM SELECTOR efficiently
identifies the best LLM with limited annotations. In particular, for any given
task, LLM SELECTOR adaptively selects a small set of queries to annotate that
are most informative about the best model for the task. To further reduce
annotation cost, we leverage a judge-based oracle annotation model. Through
extensive experiments on 6 benchmarks with 151 LLMs, we show that LLM SELECTOR
reduces annotation costs by up to 59.62% when selecting the best and near-best
LLM for the task.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大语言模型如何内部表示实体，因为命名实体是文本知识的基础构件，但现有研究主要关注显式关系，对实体表示本身了解甚少。

Method: 引入实体提及重构框架，利用任务向量从LLMs隐藏状态的各种实体表示中一致生成多标记提及，提出Entity Lens扩展logit-lens来预测多标记提及。

Result: 发现LLMs能够开发实体特定机制来表示和操作任何多标记实体，包括训练期间未见过的实体。

Conclusion: LLMs确实形成了实体特定的内部表示机制，能够有效编码和处理多标记实体信息。

Abstract: Named entities are fundamental building blocks of knowledge in text,
grounding factual information and structuring relationships within language.
Despite their importance, it remains unclear how Large Language Models (LLMs)
internally represent entities. Prior research has primarily examined explicit
relationships, but little is known about entity representations themselves. We
introduce entity mention reconstruction as a novel framework for studying how
LLMs encode and manipulate entities. We investigate whether entity mentions can
be generated from internal representations, how multi-token entities are
encoded beyond last-token embeddings, and whether these representations capture
relational knowledge. Our proposed method, leveraging _task vectors_, allows to
consistently generate multi-token mentions from various entity representations
derived from the LLMs hidden states. We thus introduce the _Entity Lens_,
extending the _logit-lens_ to predict multi-token mentions. Our results bring
new evidence that LLMs develop entity-specific mechanisms to represent and
manipulate any multi-token entities, including those unseen during training.

Motivation: 研究如何有效管理口语对话中的上下文信息，以提升Speech-LLMs在口语对话状态跟踪任务中的性能。

Method: 系统评估了三种策略：传统多模态上下文（文本历史+口语当前轮）、完整口语历史、压缩口语历史（使用注意力池化）。在SpokenWOZ语料库上进行实验。

Result: 完整口语历史输入在相似模型规模下性能最高，显著超越先前方法。注意力池化压缩方法在减小上下文大小的同时保持了竞争力。

Conclusion: 更有效的上下文利用是性能提升的关键，注意力池化压缩提供了良好的权衡方案。

Abstract: This paper presents a comparative study of context management strategies for
end-to-end Spoken Dialog State Tracking using Speech-LLMs. We systematically
evaluate traditional multimodal context (combining text history and spoken
current turn), full spoken history, and compressed spoken history approaches.
Our experiments on the SpokenWOZ corpus demonstrate that providing the full
spoken conversation as input yields the highest performance among models of
similar size, significantly surpassing prior methods. Furthermore, we show that
attention-pooling-based compression of the spoken history offers a strong
trade-off, maintaining competitive accuracy with reduced context size. Detailed

Abstract: This work presents the first large-scale investigation into constructing a
fully open bilingual large language model (LLM) for a non-English language,
specifically Korean, trained predominantly on synthetic data. We introduce
KORMo-10B, a 10.8B-parameter model trained from scratch on a Korean-English
corpus in which 68.74% of the Korean portion is synthetic. Through systematic
experimentation, we demonstrate that synthetic data, when carefully curated
with balanced linguistic coverage and diverse instruction styles, does not
cause instability or degradation during large-scale pretraining. Furthermore,
the model achieves performance comparable to that of contemporary open-weight
multilingual baselines across a wide range of reasoning, knowledge, and
instruction-following benchmarks. Our experiments reveal two key findings: (1)
synthetic data can reliably sustain long-horizon pretraining without model
collapse, and (2) bilingual instruction tuning enables near-native reasoning
and discourse coherence in Korean. By fully releasing all components including
data, code, training recipes, and logs, this work establishes a transparent
framework for developing synthetic data-driven fully open models (FOMs) in
low-resource settings and sets a reproducible precedent for future multilingual

Abstract: Free-text crash narratives recorded in real-world crash databases have been
shown to play a significant role in improving traffic safety. However,
large-scale analyses remain difficult to implement as there are no documented
tools that can batch process the unstructured, non standardized text content
written by various authors with diverse experience and attention to detail. In
recent years, Transformer-based pre-trained language models (PLMs), such as
Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) and large
language models (LLMs), have demonstrated strong capabilities across various
natural language processing tasks. These models can extract explicit facts from
crash narratives, but their performance declines on inference-heavy tasks in,
for example, Crash Type identification, which can involve nearly 100
categories. Moreover, relying on closed LLMs through external APIs raises
privacy concerns for sensitive crash data. Additionally, these black-box tools
often underperform due to limited domain knowledge. Motivated by these
challenges, we study whether compact open-source PLMs can support
reasoning-intensive extraction from crash narratives. We target two challenging
objectives: 1) identifying the Manner of Collision for a crash, and 2) Crash
Type for each vehicle involved in the crash event from real-world crash
narratives. To bridge domain gaps, we apply fine-tuning techniques to inject
task-specific knowledge to LLMs with Low-Rank Adaption (LoRA) and BERT.
Experiments on the authoritative real-world dataset Crash Investigation
Sampling System (CISS) demonstrate that our fine-tuned compact models
outperform strong closed LLMs, such as GPT-4o, while requiring only minimal
training resources. Further analysis reveals that the fine-tuned PLMs can
capture richer narrative details and even correct some mislabeled annotations
in the dataset.

Abstract: Modern conversational agents like ChatGPT and Alexa+ rely on predefined
policies specifying metadata, response styles, and tool-usage rules. As these
LLM-based systems expand to support diverse business and user queries, such
policies, often implemented as in-context prompts, are becoming increasingly
complex and lengthy, making faithful adherence difficult and imposing large
fixed computational costs. With the rise of multimodal agents, policies that
govern visual and multimodal behaviors are critical but remain understudied.
Prior prompt-compression work mainly shortens task templates and
demonstrations, while existing policy-alignment studies focus only on
text-based safety rules. We introduce Multimodal Policy Internalization (MPI),
a new task that internalizes reasoning-intensive multimodal policies into model
parameters, enabling stronger policy-following without including the policy
during inference. MPI poses unique data and algorithmic challenges. We build
two datasets spanning synthetic and real-world decision-making and tool-using
tasks and propose TriMPI, a three-stage training framework. TriMPI first
injects policy knowledge via continual pretraining, then performs supervised
finetuning, and finally applies PolicyRollout, a GRPO-style reinforcement
learning extension that augments rollouts with policy-aware responses for
grounded exploration. TriMPI achieves notable gains in end-to-end accuracy,
generalization, and robustness to forgetting. As the first work on multimodal
policy internalization, we provide datasets, training recipes, and
comprehensive evaluations to foster future research. Project page:

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) is determined by their
training data. Despite the proliferation of open-weight LLMs, access to LLM
training data has remained limited. Even for fully open LLMs, the scale of the
data makes it all but inscrutable to the general scientific community, despite
potentially containing critical data scraped from the internet.
  In this paper, we present the full-text indexing pipeline for the Apertus LLM
training data. Leveraging Elasticsearch parallel indices and the Alps
infrastructure, a state-of-the-art, highly energy-efficient arm64 supercluster,
we were able to index 8.6T tokens out of 15.2T used to train the Apertus LLM
family, creating both a critical LLM safety tool and effectively an offline,
curated, open web search engine. Our contribution is threefold. First, we
demonstrate that Elasticsearch can be successfully ported onto next-generation
arm64-based infrastructure. Second, we demonstrate that full-text indexing at
the scale of modern LLM training datasets and the entire open web is feasible
and accessible. Finally, we demonstrate that such indices can be used to ensure
previously inaccessible jailbreak-agnostic LLM safety.
  We hope that our findings will be useful to other teams attempting
large-scale data indexing and facilitate the general transition towards greener
computation.

Abstract: Reasoning models have recently shown remarkable progress in domains such as
math and coding. However, their expert-level abilities in math and coding
contrast sharply with their performance in long-horizon, interactive tasks such
as web navigation and computer/phone-use. Inspired by literature on human
cognition, we argue that current AI agents need ''vicarious trial and error'' -
the capacity to mentally simulate alternative futures before acting - in order
to enhance their understanding and performance in complex interactive
environments. We introduce Dyna-Mind, a two-stage training framework that
explicitly teaches (V)LM agents to integrate such simulation into their
reasoning. In stage 1, we introduce Reasoning with Simulations (ReSim), which
trains the agent to generate structured reasoning traces from expanded search
trees built from real experience gathered through environment interactions.
ReSim thus grounds the agent's reasoning in faithful world dynamics and equips
it with the ability to anticipate future states in its reasoning. In stage 2,
we propose Dyna-GRPO, an online reinforcement learning method to further
strengthen the agent's simulation and decision-making ability by using both
outcome rewards and intermediate states as feedback from real rollouts.
Experiments on two synthetic benchmarks (Sokoban and ALFWorld) and one
realistic benchmark (AndroidWorld) demonstrate that (1) ReSim effectively
infuses simulation ability into AI agents, and (2) Dyna-GRPO leverages outcome
and interaction-level signals to learn better policies for long-horizon,
planning-intensive tasks. Together, these results highlight the central role of
simulation in enabling AI agents to reason, plan, and act more effectively in
the ever more challenging environments.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文区分了神经模型泛化能力的两个关键方面：组合性和递归性，发现LLMs在递归性方面表现良好但在组合性方面存在困难，并提出了一种结合符号推理与神经计算的混合架构来解决这些问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管神经模型取得了显著进展，但其泛化能力（特别是逻辑推理等应用中的泛化能力）仍然是一个关键挑战。作者旨在明确区分组合性和递归性这两个泛化能力的基本方面，并研究LLMs在这两方面的表现差异。

Method: 使用三段论片段作为自然语言推理的基准，评估预训练大语言模型的逻辑泛化能力。为了克服LLMs的局限性，提出了一种集成符号推理与神经计算的混合架构，通过协同交互实现稳健高效的推理。

Result: 研究发现LLMs在递归性方面表现出合理的熟练度，但在组合性方面存在显著困难。实验表明，即使使用相对较小的神经组件，混合架构也能保持高效率。

Conclusion: 混合模型有潜力有效解决神经推理系统中的关键泛化障碍，神经组件加速处理，而符号推理确保完整性，这种协同交互为建立可靠的逻辑证明器提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress in neural models, their ability to
generalize, a cornerstone for applications like logical reasoning, remains a
critical challenge. We delineate two fundamental aspects of this ability:
compositionality, the capacity to abstract atomic logical rules underlying
complex inferences, and recursiveness, the aptitude to build intricate
representations through iterative application of inference rules. In the
literature, these two aspects are often confounded together under the umbrella
term of generalization. To sharpen this distinction, we investigated the
logical generalization capabilities of pre-trained large language models (LLMs)
using the syllogistic fragment as a benchmark for natural language reasoning.
Though simple, this fragment provides a foundational yet expressive subset of
formal logic that supports controlled evaluation of essential reasoning
abilities. Our findings reveal a significant disparity: while LLMs demonstrate
reasonable proficiency in recursiveness, they struggle with compositionality.
To overcome these limitations and establish a reliable logical prover, we
propose a hybrid architecture integrating symbolic reasoning with neural
computation. This synergistic interaction enables robust and efficient
inference, neural components accelerate processing, while symbolic reasoning
ensures completeness. Our experiments show that high efficiency is preserved
even with relatively small neural components. As part of our proposed
methodology, this analysis gives a rationale and highlights the potential of
hybrid models to effectively address key generalization barriers in neural
reasoning systems.

TL;DR: 提出GRSP方法，通过步骤级惩罚来减少大型推理模型的过度思考问题，在保持准确性的同时提高计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于验证器奖励的强化学习方法虽然能减少推理模型的token消耗，但往往损害模型性能，这是因为token级监督过于简单。

Method: 提出组相对段惩罚(GRSP)，这是一种步骤级方法，通过分析推理段与token消耗和模型性能的强相关性，设计了跨段簇的长度感知加权机制。

Result: 实验表明GRSP在保持准确性的同时实现了优越的token效率，特别是在处理更难问题时优势明显，且能稳定RL训练并在不同模型规模上有效扩展。

Conclusion: 监督的粒度在平衡效率和准确性方面起着关键作用，GRSP通过步骤级惩罚有效解决了过度思考问题。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) boosted by Reinforcement Learning from Verifier
Reward (RLVR) have shown great power in problem solving, yet they often cause
overthinking: excessive, meandering reasoning that inflates computational cost.
Prior designs of penalization in RLVR manage to reduce token consumption while
often harming model performance, which arises from the oversimplicity of
token-level supervision. In this paper, we argue that the granularity of
supervision plays a crucial role in balancing efficiency and accuracy, and
propose Group Relative Segment Penalization (GRSP), a step-level method to
regularize reasoning. Since preliminary analyses show that reasoning segments
are strongly correlated with token consumption and model performance, we design
a length-aware weighting mechanism across segment clusters. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that GRSP achieves superior token efficiency without
heavily compromising accuracy, especially the advantages with harder problems.
Moreover, GRSP stabilizes RL training and scales effectively across model
sizes.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Sandwiched Policy Gradient (SPG)方法，通过使用对数似然的上界和下界来解决扩散大语言模型(dLLMs)强化学习中的策略梯度偏差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散大语言模型(dLLMs)虽然能并行解码多个token，但由于其难以处理的对数似然，无法直接应用标准策略梯度方法进行人类偏好或任务奖励的对齐。现有方法使用ELBO等替代方案会引入显著的政策梯度偏差。

Method: 提出Sandwiched Policy Gradient (SPG)方法，利用真实对数似然的上界和下界来减少策略梯度偏差，相比基于ELBO或一步估计的基线方法更准确。

Result: SPG在多个任务上显著优于基线方法：GSM8K准确率提升3.6%，MATH500提升2.6%，Countdown提升18.4%，Sudoku提升27.0%。

Conclusion: SPG方法有效解决了dLLMs强化学习中的策略梯度偏差问题，在多个推理任务上取得了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) are emerging as an efficient
alternative to autoregressive models due to their ability to decode multiple
tokens in parallel. However, aligning dLLMs with human preferences or
task-specific rewards via reinforcement learning (RL) is challenging because
their intractable log-likelihood precludes the direct application of standard
policy gradient methods. While prior work uses surrogates like the evidence
lower bound (ELBO), these one-sided approximations can introduce significant
policy gradient bias. To address this, we propose the Sandwiched Policy
Gradient (SPG) that leverages both an upper and a lower bound of the true
log-likelihood. Experiments show that SPG significantly outperforms baselines
based on ELBO or one-step estimation. Specifically, SPG improves the accuracy
over state-of-the-art RL methods for dLLMs by 3.6% in GSM8K, 2.6% in MATH500,
18.4% in Countdown and 27.0% in Sudoku.

Motivation: 统计学作为一门独特且综合的学科，在基准测试工作中尚未得到充分探索，现有的大语言模型在数学和逻辑推理方面表现出色，但在统计学推理方面存在不足。

Method: 设计了一个可扩展的多智能体流水线，结合人工验证，自动化大规模问题提取、重写和质量控制，确保学术严谨性；提出了针对计算和证明任务的鲁棒评估框架。

Result: 实验结果显示，闭源模型如GPT5-mini在研究级问题上准确率低于57%，开源模型表现更差，这突显了统计推理的独特挑战和当前大语言模型的局限性。

Conclusion: StatEval可作为推进大语言模型统计智能的严格基准测试，所有数据和代码已在web平台上公开。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable advances in
mathematical and logical reasoning, yet statistics, as a distinct and
integrative discipline, remains underexplored in benchmarking efforts. To
address this gap, we introduce \textbf{StatEval}, the first comprehensive
benchmark dedicated to statistics, spanning both breadth and depth across
difficulty levels. StatEval consists of 13,817 foundational problems covering
undergraduate and graduate curricula, together with 2374 research-level proof
tasks extracted from leading journals. To construct the benchmark, we design a
scalable multi-agent pipeline with human-in-the-loop validation that automates
large-scale problem extraction, rewriting, and quality control, while ensuring
academic rigor. We further propose a robust evaluation framework tailored to
both computational and proof-based tasks, enabling fine-grained assessment of
reasoning ability. Experimental results reveal that while closed-source models
such as GPT5-mini achieve below 57\% on research-level problems, with
open-source models performing significantly lower. These findings highlight the
unique challenges of statistical reasoning and the limitations of current LLMs.
We expect StatEval to serve as a rigorous benchmark for advancing statistical
intelligence in large language models. All data and code are available on our

TL;DR: 本文分析了无标签情况下评估NLP模型跨域性能排名的可靠性，发现基于大语言模型的错误预测器比基于数据漂移或零样本基线产生更强、更一致的排名相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解NLP模型如何泛化时，无需标签估计模型性能是一个重要目标。先前工作提出了基于数据集相似性或预测正确性的方法，但尚不清楚这些估计何时能在跨域情况下产生可靠的性能排名。

Method: 采用两步评估设置，使用四个基础分类器和多个大语言模型作为错误预测器。在GeoOLID和Amazon Reviews数据集（涵盖15个领域）上进行实验，比较基于大语言模型的错误预测器与基于漂移或零样本基线的效果。

Result: 实验表明，基于大语言模型的错误预测器比漂移基线和零样本基线产生更强、更一致的排名相关性。分析揭示两个关键发现：当跨域性能差异较大时排名更可靠，当错误模型的预测与基础模型的真实失败模式一致时排名更可靠。

Conclusion: 这些结果阐明了性能估计方法何时可以被信任，并为它们在跨域模型评估中的使用提供了指导。

Abstract: Estimating model performance without labels is an important goal for
understanding how NLP models generalize. While prior work has proposed measures
based on dataset similarity or predicted correctness, it remains unclear when
these estimates produce reliable performance rankings across domains. In this
paper, we analyze the factors that affect ranking reliability using a two-step
evaluation setup with four base classifiers and several large language models
as error predictors. Experiments on the GeoOLID and Amazon Reviews datasets,
spanning 15 domains, show that large language model-based error predictors
produce stronger and more consistent rank correlations with true accuracy than
drift-based or zero-shot baselines. Our analysis reveals two key findings:
ranking is more reliable when performance differences across domains are
larger, and when the error model's predictions align with the base model's true
failure patterns. These results clarify when performance estimation methods can
be trusted and provide guidance for their use in cross-domain model evaluation.

TL;DR: P-TTS是一种推理时数据增强策略，仅使用90个手动选择的推理实例，通过系统化改变提示强度来合成多样化的推理轨迹，从而增强LLM的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法需要大量人工标注的推理数据集，成本高昂且资源密集，而P-TTS旨在通过少量样本和推理时数据增强来低成本提升LLM的推理能力。

Method: 使用仅90个手动选择的推理实例，通过系统化改变提示强度在测试时合成多样化的推理轨迹上下文，然后对Qwen-2.5模型进行微调。

Result: 在多个数学推理基准测试中，P-TTS-7B和32B模型显著优于先前基线，在AIME'24上分别获得+26.66%和+30.00%的绝对准确率提升，在AIME'25上分别获得+13.34%和+6.67%的提升。

Conclusion: P-TTS有效探索了推理模式的潜在空间，以最小标注成本放大了LLM的问题解决能力，为资源受限或快速发展的领域提供了一种实用的低成本方法来激发LLM推理能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning
capabilities when provided with chain-of-thought exemplars, but curating large
reasoning datasets remains laborious and resource-intensive. In this work, we
introduce Prompting Test-Time Scaling (P-TTS), a simple yet effective
inference-time data augmentation strategy for enhancing LLM reasoning through
finetuning. Rather than collecting thousands or even millions of examples,
P-TTS leverages a small pool of only 90 manually selected reasoning instances
and systematically varies exemplar augmentation through principled instruction
prompting intensities at test time to synthesize diverse reasoning trajectory
contexts. Then we finetune the various sizes of Qwen-2.5 models on P-TTS data.
Across a suite of mathematical reasoning AIME2024 & 25, MATH500, and
GPQA-Diamond, our P-TTS-7B and 32B models outperform the prior competitive
baselines like S1 and S1.1 (1K-shot), achieving absolute accuracy gains of
+26.66% and +30.00% on AIME'24 (7B), and +13.34% and +6.67% on AIME'25 (7B);
P-TTS-32B yields gains of +23.33% and +16.63% on AIME'24, and +26.63% and
+3.33% on AIME'25 (vs. S1 and S1.1, respectively), with comparable or better
performance on MATH500 and GPQA-Diamond. We further show that P-TTS enhances
zero-shot generalization accuracy on out-of-domain reasoning benchmarks of
Gaokao, Kaoyan, OlympiadBench, AMC23, GradeSchoolMath, and Minerva. Our
analysis suggests that test-time scaling effectively explores the latent space
of reasoning patterns, amplifying LLM problem-solving with minimal annotation
overhead, and further unlocking the reasoning potential and capabilities of
LLMs. Prompting Test-Time Scaling offers a practical, low-cost way to elicit
LLM reasoning in resource-constrained or rapidly evolving domains.

<details>

Motivation: 预训练的transformer模型在自动语音识别中表现优异，但对口音和方言变化敏感，导致在英语和波斯语等语言多样性语言中词错误率升高。

Method: 训练基于频谱图的口音分类器，识别对预测影响最大的区域并进行掩码，使用掩码后的频谱图进行数据增强。

Result: 在英语和波斯语实验中，使用Whisper模型验证了该方法能显著降低词错误率，并发布了首个波斯语多地区口音数据集。

Conclusion: 该研究推进了多语言ASR系统的发展，使其对口音和方言多样性更具弹性，代码和数据集已公开。

Abstract: Pre-trained transformer-based models have significantly advanced automatic
speech recognition (ASR), yet they remain sensitive to accent and dialectal
variations, resulting in elevated word error rates (WER) in linguistically
diverse languages such as English and Persian. To address this challenge, we
propose an accent-invariant ASR framework that integrates accent and dialect
classification into the recognition pipeline. Our approach involves training a
spectrogram-based classifier to capture accent-specific cues, masking the
regions most influential to its predictions, and using the masked spectrograms
for data augmentation. This enhances the robustness of ASR models against
accent variability. We evaluate the method using both English and Persian
speech. For Persian, we introduce a newly collected dataset spanning multiple
regional accents, establishing the first systematic benchmark for accent
variation in Persian ASR that fills a critical gap in multilingual speech
research and provides a foundation for future studies on low-resource,
linguistically diverse languages. Experimental results with the Whisper model
demonstrate that our masking and augmentation strategy yields substantial WER
reductions in both English and Persian settings, confirming the effectiveness
of the approach. This research advances the development of multilingual ASR
systems that are resilient to accent and dialect diversity. Code and dataset

Motivation: 现有基准测试大多假设输入干净，而实际应用中用户输入常包含拼写错误，LLM在多语言环境下对拼写错误的鲁棒性尚未充分研究。

Method: 开发了基于语言特定键盘布局和打字行为的MulTypo多语言拼写错误生成算法，评估了18个开源LLM在语言推理、多选问答、数学推理和机器翻译等5个任务中的表现。

Result: 拼写错误持续降低性能，特别是在生成任务和需要推理的任务中；指令调优提高了干净输入性能但可能增加对噪声的脆弱性；高资源语言比低资源语言更鲁棒；从英语翻译比翻译成英语更鲁棒。

Conclusion: 研究强调了噪声感知训练和多语言鲁棒性评估的必要性，代码和数据已公开。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in multilingual,
real-world applications with user inputs -- naturally introducing typographical
errors (typos). Yet most benchmarks assume clean input, leaving the robustness
of LLMs to typos across languages largely underexplored. To address this gap,
we introduce MulTypo, a multilingual typo generation algorithm that simulates
human-like errors based on language-specific keyboard layouts and typing
behavior. We evaluate 18 open-source LLMs across three model families and five
downstream tasks spanning language inference, multi-choice question answering,
mathematical reasoning, and machine translation tasks. Our results show that
typos consistently degrade performance, particularly in generative tasks and
those requiring reasoning -- while the natural language inference task is
comparatively more robust. Instruction tuning improves clean-input performance
but may increase brittleness under noise. We also observe language-dependent
robustness: high-resource languages are generally more robust than low-resource
ones, and translation from English is more robust than translation into
English. Our findings underscore the need for noise-aware training and
multilingual robustness evaluation. We make our code and data publicly
available.

TL;DR: 本文识别了扩散大语言模型中的并行-顺序矛盾(PSC)，指出并行解码与推理所需的因果顺序存在冲突，导致DLLMs在复杂任务中退化为自回归行为，并提出了缓解策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散大语言模型虽然具有高吞吐量和有效顺序推理能力，但其并行解码机制与严格推理所需的因果顺序存在根本冲突，限制了模型的推理深度和探索广度。

Method: 通过行为分析识别并行-顺序矛盾，引入三个扩展维度(并行、扩散、顺序)来表征DLLMs，并提出并行导向提示、扩散早停和并行扩展等缓解策略。

Result: 实验表明DLLMs仅在可直接判定的输出上表现出真正并行性，任务难度增加时会退化为自回归行为；并行扩展能带来持续改进，但扩散和顺序扩展受PSC限制。

Conclusion: 并行-顺序矛盾是DLLMs的核心限制因素，提出的缓解策略能减少PSC导致的效果不佳和效率低下问题，为改进扩散模型提供了实用方向。

Abstract: Recently, Diffusion Large Language Models (DLLMs) have offered high
throughput and effective sequential reasoning, making them a competitive
alternative to autoregressive LLMs (ALLMs). However, parallel decoding, which
enables simultaneous token updates, conflicts with the causal order often
required for rigorous reasoning. We first identify this conflict as the core
Parallel-Sequential Contradiction (PSC). Behavioral analyses in both simple and
complex reasoning tasks show that DLLMs exhibit genuine parallelism only for
directly decidable outputs. As task difficulty increases, they revert to
autoregressive-like behavior, a limitation exacerbated by autoregressive
prompting, which nearly doubles the number of decoding steps with remasking
without improving quality. Moreover, PSC restricts DLLMs' self-reflection,
reasoning depth, and exploratory breadth. To further characterize PSC, we
introduce three scaling dimensions for DLLMs: parallel, diffusion, and
sequential. Empirically, while parallel scaling yields consistent improvements,
diffusion and sequential scaling are constrained by PSC. Based on these
findings, we propose several practical mitigations, parallel-oriented
prompting, diffusion early stopping, and parallel scaling, to reduce
PSC-induced ineffectiveness and inefficiencies.

Conclusion: 该方法为专业医学视频集合中的多语言检索提供了准确且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieving relevant instructional videos from multilingual medical archives
is crucial for answering complex, multi-hop questions across language
boundaries. However, existing systems either compress hour-long videos into
coarse embeddings or incur prohibitive costs for fine-grained matching. We
tackle the Multilingual Video Corpus Retrieval (mVCR) task in the NLPCC-2025
M4IVQA challenge with a multi-stage framework that integrates multilingual
semantics, domain terminology, and efficient long-form processing. Video
subtitles are divided into semantically coherent chunks, enriched with concise
knowledge-graph (KG) facts, and organized into a hierarchical tree whose node
embeddings are generated by a language-agnostic multilingual encoder. At query
time, the same encoder embeds the input question; a coarse-to-fine tree search
prunes irrelevant branches, and only the top-ranked chunks are re-scored by a
lightweight large language model (LLM). This design avoids exhaustive
cross-encoder scoring while preserving chunk-level precision. Experiments on
the mVCR test set demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, and ablation
studies confirm the complementary contributions of KG enrichment, hierarchical
indexing, and targeted LLM re-ranking. The proposed method offers an accurate
and scalable solution for multilingual retrieval in specialized medical video
collections.

Motivation: 虽然大型推理模型依赖思维链推理来提高任务性能，但在多语言环境中，导致最终答案的中间思维轨迹本身仍未得到充分探索。

Method: 评估语言遵从性、答案准确性和一致性；通过跨语言交换思维轨迹评估一致性；使用截断和错误注入等扰动技术探测思维轨迹的忠实性。

Result: 发现LRMs具有强烈的语言偏好，不同语言的性能存在差异；思维轨迹的质量和有效性因提示语言而异；模型在不同语言中对思维轨迹的依赖程度不同。

Conclusion: 多语言思维链推理存在显著的语言依赖性，思维轨迹的质量和有效性受语言影响，这为未来多语言推理研究提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) increasingly rely on step-by-step
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to improve task performance, particularly in
high-resource languages such as English. While recent work has examined
final-answer accuracy in multilingual settings, the thinking traces themselves,
i.e., the intermediate steps that lead to the final answer, remain
underexplored. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study of
multilingual CoT reasoning, evaluating three key dimensions: performance,
consistency, and faithfulness. We begin by measuring language compliance,
answer accuracy, and answer consistency when LRMs are explicitly instructed or
prompt-hacked to think in a target language, revealing strong language
preferences and divergent performance across languages. Next, we assess
crosslingual consistency of thinking traces by interchanging them between
languages. We find that the quality and effectiveness of thinking traces vary
substantially depending on the prompt language. Finally, we adapt
perturbation-based techniques -- i.e., truncation and error injection -- to
probe the faithfulness of thinking traces across languages, showing that models
rely on traces to varying degrees. We release our code and data to support
future research.

Conclusion: 研究为更细致地探索语言线索在语言模型中的功能作用铺平了道路，揭示了连接词类型对模型性能的重要影响。

Abstract: The role of world knowledge has been particularly crucial to predict the
discourse connective that marks the discourse relation between two arguments,
with language models (LMs) being generally successful at this task. We flip
this premise in our work, and instead study the inverse problem of
understanding whether discourse connectives can inform LMs about the world. To
this end, we present WUGNECTIVES, a dataset of 8,880 stimuli that evaluates
LMs' inferences about novel entities in contexts where connectives link the
entities to particular attributes. On investigating 17 different LMs at various
scales, and training regimens, we found that tuning an LM to show reasoning
behavior yields noteworthy improvements on most connectives. At the same time,
there was a large variation in LMs' overall performance across connective type,
with all models systematically struggling on connectives that express a
concessive meaning. Our findings pave the way for more nuanced investigations
into the functional role of language cues as captured by LMs. We release
WUGNECTIVES at https://github.com/sheffwb/wugnectives.

process and reduce the reliance on human effort, we introduce Automatic
Promotion (AutoPR), a novel task that transforms research papers into accurate,
engaging, and timely public content. To enable rigorous evaluation, we release
PRBench, a multimodal benchmark that links 512 peer-reviewed articles to
high-quality promotional posts, assessing systems along three axes: Fidelity
(accuracy and tone), Engagement (audience targeting and appeal), and Alignment
(timing and channel optimization). We also introduce PRAgent, a multi-agent
framework that automates AutoPR in three stages: content extraction with
multimodal preparation, collaborative synthesis for polished outputs, and
platform-specific adaptation to optimize norms, tone, and tagging for maximum
reach. When compared to direct LLM pipelines on PRBench, PRAgent demonstrates
substantial improvements, including a 604% increase in total watch time, a 438%
rise in likes, and at least a 2.9x boost in overall engagement. Ablation
studies show that platform modeling and targeted promotion contribute the most
to these gains. Our results position AutoPR as a tractable, measurable research
problem and provide a roadmap for scalable, impactful automated scholarly
communication.

*Donghang Wu,Haoyang Zhang,Jun Chen,Xiangyu,Zhang,Hexin Liu,Eng Siong Chng,Fei Tian,Xuerui Yang,Xiangyu Zhang,Daxin Jiang,Gang Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Mind-Paced Speaking (MPS)框架，通过双脑架构实现实时口语语言模型的高保真推理，显著降低延迟同时保持推理质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决实时口语语言模型在利用链式思维推理时因顺序生成整个思维过程而产生的高延迟问题，使模型能够像人类一样边思考边说话。

Method: 采用受大脑启发的双脑方法："制定脑"负责高层推理来引导"发音脑"进行流畅语音生成，消除模式切换，保持推理过程完整性。

Result: 在零延迟配置下，在数学推理任务Spoken-MQA上达到92.8%准确率，在语音对话任务URO-Bench上获得82.5分，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MPS有效弥合了高质量推理与实时交互之间的差距，在保持推理性能的同时大幅降低延迟。

Abstract: Real-time Spoken Language Models (SLMs) struggle to leverage Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) reasoning due to the prohibitive latency of generating the entire thought
process sequentially. Enabling SLMs to think while speaking, similar to humans,
is attracting increasing attention. We present, for the first time, Mind-Paced
Speaking (MPS), a brain-inspired framework that enables high-fidelity,
real-time reasoning. Similar to how humans utilize distinct brain regions for
thinking and responding, we propose a novel dual-brain approach, employing a
"Formulation Brain" for high-level reasoning to pace and guide a separate
"Articulation Brain" for fluent speech generation. This division of labor
eliminates mode-switching, preserving the integrity of the reasoning process.
Experiments show that MPS significantly outperforms existing
think-while-speaking methods and achieves reasoning performance comparable to
models that pre-compute the full CoT before speaking, while drastically
reducing latency. Under a zero-latency configuration, the proposed method
achieves an accuracy of 92.8% on the mathematical reasoning task Spoken-MQA and
attains a score of 82.5 on the speech conversation task URO-Bench. Our work
effectively bridges the gap between high-quality reasoning and real-time
interaction.

*Tennison Liu,Silas Ruhrberg Estévez,David L. Bentley,Mihaela van der Schaar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了AScience框架和ASCollab系统，使用LLM智能体网络进行大规模科学数据探索，通过社会动态机制持续产生和同行评审发现


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模科学数据集为无约束的探索性发现创造了机会，但需要支持在复杂假设空间中进行持续探索的方法

Method: 开发AScience框架，将发现建模为智能体、网络和评估规范的交互，实现为ASCollab分布式系统，包含具有异质行为的LLM研究智能体，这些智能体自组织成演化网络，在共享评估标准下持续产生和同行评审发现

Result: 实验显示这种社会动态能够沿多样性-质量-新颖性前沿积累专家评分结果，包括重新发现已建立的生物标志物、扩展已知通路和提出新的治疗靶点

Conclusion: 虽然湿实验室验证仍然不可或缺，但在癌症队列上的实验表明，社会结构化的智能体网络能够大规模持续进行探索性假设搜寻

Abstract: Large-scale scientific datasets -- spanning health biobanks, cell atlases,
Earth reanalyses, and more -- create opportunities for exploratory discovery
unconstrained by specific research questions. We term this process hypothesis
hunting: the cumulative search for insight through sustained exploration across
vast and complex hypothesis spaces. To support it, we introduce AScience, a
framework modeling discovery as the interaction of agents, networks, and
evaluation norms, and implement it as ASCollab, a distributed system of
LLM-based research agents with heterogeneous behaviors. These agents
self-organize into evolving networks, continually producing and peer-reviewing
findings under shared standards of evaluation. Experiments show that such
social dynamics enable the accumulation of expert-rated results along the
diversity-quality-novelty frontier, including rediscoveries of established
biomarkers, extensions of known pathways, and proposals of new therapeutic
targets. While wet-lab validation remains indispensable, our experiments on
cancer cohorts demonstrate that socially structured, agentic networks can
sustain exploratory hypothesis hunting at scale.

### [204] [Optimizing delivery for quick commerce factoring qualitative assessment of generated routes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08671)
*Milon Bhattacharya,Milan Kumar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究提出使用大语言模型(LLMs)来评估车辆路径规划(VRP)生成的配送路线，通过政策标准进行批判性分析，帮助物流运营商优先选择更高效的配送方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 印度电商市场快速增长，最后一公里配送占运营成本近一半。传统VRP求解器在现实场景中因非结构化地址、不完整地图和计算限制而效果有限。

Method: 开发了一个框架，使用LLMs根据政策标准对VRP生成的路线进行批判性评估。生成、标注和评估了400个案例，比较开源和专有LLM的性能。

Result: 开源LLMs识别路线问题的准确率达到79%，专有推理模型可达86%。LLM评估超越了传统的距离和时间指标。

Conclusion: 基于LLM的VRP路线评估是一种有效且可扩展的评估层，有助于提高最后一公里物流的成本效率、配送可靠性和可持续性，特别适用于印度等发展中国家。

Abstract: Indias e-commerce market is projected to grow rapidly, with last-mile
delivery accounting for nearly half of operational expenses. Although vehicle
routing problem (VRP) based solvers are widely used for delivery planning,
their effectiveness in real-world scenarios is limited due to unstructured
addresses, incomplete maps, and computational constraints in distance
estimation. This study proposes a framework that employs large language models
(LLMs) to critique VRP-generated routes against policy-based criteria, allowing
logistics operators to evaluate and prioritise more efficient delivery plans.
As a illustration of our approach we generate, annotate and evaluated 400 cases
using large language models. Our study found that open-source LLMs identified
routing issues with 79% accuracy, while proprietary reasoning models achieved
reach upto 86%. The results demonstrate that LLM-based evaluation of
VRP-generated routes can be an effective and scalable layer of evaluation which
goes beyond beyond conventional distance and time based metrics. This has
implications for improving cost efficiency, delivery reliability, and
sustainability in last-mile logistics, especially for developing countries like
India.

### [205] [Unified World Models: Memory-Augmented Planning and Foresight for Visual Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08713)
*Yifei Dong,Fengyi Wu,Guangyu Chen,Zhi-Qi Cheng,Qiyu Hu,Yuxuan Zhou,Jingdong Sun,Jun-Yan He,Qi Dai,Alexander G Hauptmann*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: UniWM是一个统一的世界模型，通过整合视觉预测和规划来解决视觉导航中的状态-动作对齐问题，显著提升了导航性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前模块化架构将导航规划与视觉世界建模分离，导致状态-动作不对齐，限制了在动态场景中的适应性。

Method: 提出统一记忆增强世界模型UniWM，在单一多模态自回归主干中整合自我中心视觉预测和规划，采用分层记忆机制整合短期感知线索和长期轨迹上下文。

Result: 在四个基准测试中导航成功率提升高达30%，轨迹误差显著减少，在未见数据集上展现出优秀的零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: UniWM是实现统一、想象力驱动的具身导航的重要进展。

Abstract: Enabling embodied agents to effectively imagine future states is critical for
robust and generalizable visual navigation. Current state-of-the-art
approaches, however, adopt modular architectures that separate navigation
planning from visual world modeling, leading to state-action misalignment and
limited adaptability in novel or dynamic scenarios. To overcome this
fundamental limitation, we propose UniWM, a unified, memory-augmented world
model integrating egocentric visual foresight and planning within a single
multimodal autoregressive backbone. Unlike modular frameworks, UniWM explicitly
grounds action decisions in visually imagined outcomes, ensuring tight
alignment between prediction and control. A hierarchical memory mechanism
further integrates detailed short-term perceptual cues with longer-term
trajectory context, enabling stable, coherent reasoning over extended horizons.
Extensive experiments across four challenging benchmarks (Go Stanford, ReCon,
SCAND, HuRoN) demonstrate that UniWM substantially improves navigation success
rates by up to 30%, significantly reduces trajectory errors compared to strong
baselines, and exhibits impressive zero-shot generalization on the unseen
TartanDrive dataset. These results highlight UniWM as a principled step toward
unified, imagination-driven embodied navigation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出使用API优先、可编程的数据湖仓作为安全设计的智能体工作流基础架构，通过Bauplan案例展示了数据分支和声明式环境如何支持智能体，实现可重现性和可观测性，同时减少攻击面。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据湖仓运行敏感工作负载，AI驱动的自动化引发了关于信任、正确性和治理的担忧。需要找到既能利用AI自动化优势又能确保安全性的解决方案。

Method: 使用Bauplan作为案例研究，采用数据分支和声明式环境扩展智能体功能，通过受证明携带代码启发的正确性检查来修复数据管道。

Result: 原型证明不受信任的AI智能体可以在生产数据上安全操作，并展示了实现完全智能体化湖仓的路径。

Conclusion: API优先、可编程的湖仓为安全设计的智能体工作流提供了合适的抽象，能够在不牺牲安全性的前提下实现AI驱动的自动化。

Abstract: Data lakehouses run sensitive workloads, where AI-driven automation raises
concerns about trust, correctness, and governance. We argue that API-first,
programmable lakehouses provide the right abstractions for safe-by-design,
agentic workflows. Using Bauplan as a case study, we show how data branching
and declarative environments extend naturally to agents, enabling
reproducibility and observability while reducing the attack surface. We present
a proof-of-concept in which agents repair data pipelines using correctness
checks inspired by proof-carrying code. Our prototype demonstrates that
untrusted AI agents can operate safely on production data and outlines a path
toward a fully agentic lakehouse.

*Pantea Karimi,Dany Rouhana,Pooria Namyar,Siva Kesava Reddy Kakarla,Venkat Arun,Behnaz Arzani*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 通过向LLM提供启发式算法表现不佳的实例、解释原因并针对输入空间特定区域进行专门设计，可以生成更鲁棒和性能更好的启发式算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有使用LLM设计启发式算法的方法可能不够鲁棒，需要工具来解释启发式算法表现不佳的原因并提供改进建议。

Method: 采用三个简单策略：(1)向LLM展示启发式算法表现不佳的实例；(2)解释表现不佳的原因；(3)针对输入空间的特定区域进行专门设计。

Result: 生成的启发式算法在最坏情况下性能比FunSearch好约28倍，平均性能也有所提升，同时保持运行时间不变。

Conclusion: 通过向LLM提供失败案例分析和针对性设计，可以显著提升启发式算法的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: We posit that we can generate more robust and performant heuristics if we
augment approaches using LLMs for heuristic design with tools that explain why
heuristics underperform and suggestions about how to fix them. We find even
simple ideas that (1) expose the LLM to instances where the heuristic
underperforms; (2) explain why they occur; and (3) specialize design to regions
in the input space, can produce more robust algorithms compared to existing
techniques~ -- ~the heuristics we produce have a $\sim28\times$ better
worst-case performance compared to FunSearch, improve average performance, and
maintain the runtime.

### [208] [COMPASS: Enhancing Agent Long-Horizon Reasoning with Evolving Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08790)
*Guangya Wan,Mingyang Ling,Xiaoqi Ren,Rujun Han,Sheng Li,Zizhao Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: COMPASS是一个轻量级分层框架，通过分离战术执行、战略监督和上下文管理来解决LLM代理在长时程任务中的上下文管理瓶颈问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长时程任务需要持续推理和多次工具交互，但LLM代理容易因小错误累积、幻觉或失去连贯性而失败，上下文管理是核心瓶颈。

Method: 提出COMPASS框架，包含三个专门组件：主代理（执行推理和工具使用）、元思考者（监控进度并发出战略干预）、上下文管理器（维护简洁相关的进度摘要）。

Result: 在GAIA、BrowseComp和Humanity's Last Exam三个基准测试中，COMPASS相比单代理和多代理基线准确率提升高达20%。

Conclusion: COMPASS通过分层专业化组件有效解决了长时程任务中的上下文管理问题，并可通过测试时扩展和后训练管道进一步提升性能和效率。

Abstract: Long-horizon tasks that require sustained reasoning and multiple tool
interactions remain challenging for LLM agents: small errors compound across
steps, and even state-of-the-art models often hallucinate or lose coherence. We
identify context management as the central bottleneck -- extended histories
cause agents to overlook critical evidence or become distracted by irrelevant
information, thus failing to replan or reflect from previous mistakes. To
address this, we propose COMPASS (Context-Organized Multi-Agent Planning and
Strategy System), a lightweight hierarchical framework that separates tactical
execution, strategic oversight, and context organization into three specialized
components: (1) a Main Agent that performs reasoning and tool use, (2) a
Meta-Thinker that monitors progress and issues strategic interventions, and (3)
a Context Manager that maintains concise, relevant progress briefs for
different reasoning stages. Across three challenging benchmarks -- GAIA,
BrowseComp, and Humanity's Last Exam -- COMPASS improves accuracy by up to 20%
relative to both single- and multi-agent baselines. We further introduce a
test-time scaling extension that elevates performance to match established
DeepResearch agents, and a post-training pipeline that delegates context
management to smaller models for enhanced efficiency.

### [209] [Everyone prefers human writers, including AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08831)
*Wouter Haverals,Meredith Martin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现人类和AI评估者在文学风格评价中都存在系统性的人类偏好偏见，AI模型的偏见程度比人类高2.5倍，且这种偏见在不同AI架构间普遍存在。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI写作工具的普及，需要了解人类和机器如何评估文学风格这一主观领域，特别是评估中可能存在的偏见问题。

Method: 使用Raymond Queneau的《风格练习》进行对照实验，研究1比较人类参与者(N=556)和AI模型(N=13)在盲测、准确标注和反事实标注三种条件下对文学段落的评价；研究2测试偏见在14×14矩阵的AI评估者和创作者间的泛化性。

Result: 人类表现出+13.7个百分点的偏见，AI模型表现出+34.3个百分点的偏见（2.5倍于人类），研究2确认这种偏见在不同AI架构间普遍存在（+25.8个百分点）。标注导致评估者反转评估标准，相同特征仅因感知作者身份而获得相反评价。

Conclusion: AI模型在训练过程中吸收了人类对人工创造力的文化偏见，不仅复制而且放大了人类的这种倾向，这是首次在美学判断中对人类和AI评估者的归因偏见进行对照比较。

Abstract: As AI writing tools become widespread, we need to understand how both humans
and machines evaluate literary style, a domain where objective standards are
elusive and judgments are inherently subjective. We conducted controlled
experiments using Raymond Queneau's Exercises in Style (1947) to measure
attribution bias across evaluators. Study 1 compared human participants (N=556)
and AI models (N=13) evaluating literary passages from Queneau versus
GPT-4-generated versions under three conditions: blind, accurately labeled, and
counterfactually labeled. Study 2 tested bias generalization across a
14$\times$14 matrix of AI evaluators and creators. Both studies revealed
systematic pro-human attribution bias. Humans showed +13.7 percentage point
(pp) bias (Cohen's h = 0.28, 95% CI: 0.21-0.34), while AI models showed +34.3
percentage point bias (h = 0.70, 95% CI: 0.65-0.76), a 2.5-fold stronger effect
(P$<$0.001). Study 2 confirmed this bias operates across AI architectures
(+25.8pp, 95% CI: 24.1-27.6%), demonstrating that AI systems systematically
devalue creative content when labeled as "AI-generated" regardless of which AI
created it. We also find that attribution labels cause evaluators to invert
assessment criteria, with identical features receiving opposing evaluations
based solely on perceived authorship. This suggests AI models have absorbed
human cultural biases against artificial creativity during training. Our study
represents the first controlled comparison of attribution bias between human
and artificial evaluators in aesthetic judgment, revealing that AI systems not
only replicate but amplify this human tendency.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Agent GPA（Goal-Plan-Action）评估框架，包含五个评估指标，能系统性地覆盖智能体失败情况，支持LLM评判器与人工标注高度一致，并能准确定位错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要一种系统性的评估范式来评估智能体在目标设定、计划制定和行动执行整个操作循环中的表现，覆盖各种类型的智能体失败。

Method: 基于智能体操作循环的GPA框架，包含五个评估指标：目标达成度、逻辑一致性、执行效率、计划质量和计划遵循度。在两个基准数据集上进行实验验证。

Result: 该框架能覆盖TRAIL/GAIA基准数据集中的所有智能体错误；LLM评判器与人工标注的一致性达到80%-95%以上；错误定位准确率达到86%。

Conclusion: Agent GPA框架为智能体评估提供了系统性的方法，能够全面覆盖智能体失败、支持可靠的自动评估，并能有效定位错误以针对性改进智能体性能。

Abstract: We introduce the Agent GPA (Goal-Plan-Action) framework: an evaluation
paradigm based on an agent's operational loop of setting goals, devising plans,
and executing actions. The framework includes five evaluation metrics: Goal
Fulfillment, Logical Consistency, Execution Efficiency, Plan Quality, and Plan
Adherence. Logical Consistency checks that an agent's actions are consistent
with its prior actions. Execution Efficiency checks whether the agent executes
in the most efficient way to achieve its goal. Plan Quality checks whether an
agent's plans are aligned with its goals; Plan Adherence checks if an agent's
actions are aligned with its plan; and Goal Fulfillment checks that agent's
final outcomes match the stated goals. Our experimental results on two
benchmark datasets - the public TRAIL/GAIA dataset and an internal dataset for
a production-grade data agent - show that this framework (a) provides a
systematic way to cover a broad range of agent failures, including all agent
errors on the TRAIL/GAIA benchmark dataset; (b) supports LLM-judges that
exhibit strong agreement with human annotation, covering 80% to over 95%
errors; and (c) localizes errors with 86% agreement to enable targeted
improvement of agent performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统同行评审存在的不一致性、评审员主观性和可扩展性挑战，探索AI如何系统性地辅助科学出版评审过程。

Method: 开发了模块化框架ReviewerToo，支持专门的评审员角色和结构化评估标准，可在真实会议工作流程中部分或完全集成，使用gpt-oss-120b模型进行验证。

Result: 在1,963篇ICLR 2025论文上的实验显示，AI评审员在分类准确率上接近人类平均水准，生成的评审质量被LLM评为高于人类平均，但在评估方法新颖性和理论贡献方面仍有不足。

Conclusion: AI可以增强评审的一致性、覆盖范围和公平性，但复杂评估仍需领域专家，为构建系统化的混合同行评审系统提供了基础。

Abstract: Peer review is the cornerstone of scientific publishing, yet it suffers from
inconsistencies, reviewer subjectivity, and scalability challenges. We
introduce ReviewerToo, a modular framework for studying and deploying
AI-assisted peer review to complement human judgment with systematic and
consistent assessments. ReviewerToo supports systematic experiments with
specialized reviewer personas and structured evaluation criteria, and can be
partially or fully integrated into real conference workflows. We validate
ReviewerToo on a carefully curated dataset of 1,963 paper submissions from ICLR
2025, where our experiments with the gpt-oss-120b model achieves 81.8% accuracy
for the task of categorizing a paper as accept/reject compared to 83.9% for the
average human reviewer. Additionally, ReviewerToo-generated reviews are rated
as higher quality than the human average by an LLM judge, though still trailing
the strongest expert contributions. Our analysis highlights domains where AI
reviewers excel (e.g., fact-checking, literature coverage) and where they
struggle (e.g., assessing methodological novelty and theoretical
contributions), underscoring the continued need for human expertise. Based on
these findings, we propose guidelines for integrating AI into peer-review
pipelines, showing how AI can enhance consistency, coverage, and fairness while
leaving complex evaluative judgments to domain experts. Our work provides a
foundation for systematic, hybrid peer-review systems that scale with the
growth of scientific publishing.

*Siqi Zhu,David Zhang,Pedro Cisneros-Velarde,Jiaxuan You*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了GTAlign框架，将博弈论决策整合到LLM的推理和训练中，通过构建收益矩阵来优化用户与模型之间的互动，实现互利共赢。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对齐方法假设最大化模型奖励就能最大化用户福利，但实践中模型常产生冗长或过度澄清的回答，而用户更喜欢简洁答案，这种个体理性选择导致社会次优结果。

Method: 在推理阶段将用户-LLM交互视为策略博弈，构建收益矩阵评估双方福利；在训练阶段引入互惠奖励强化合作响应；还包含基于博弈论推理的动态适应技术。

Result: 实验表明GTAlign在多样化任务中显著提升了推理效率、答案质量和互惠福利，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: GTAlign通过博弈论方法有效解决了LLM对齐中的社会效率问题，实现了用户与模型的双赢互动。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in reasoning,
yet sometimes produce responses that are suboptimal for users in tasks such as
writing, information seeking, or providing practical guidance. Conventional
alignment practices typically assume that maximizing model reward also
maximizes user welfare, but this assumption frequently fails in practice:
models may over-clarify or generate overly verbose reasoning when users prefer
concise answers. Such behaviors resemble the prisoner's dilemma, where
individually rational choices lead to socially suboptimal outcomes. The
fundamental challenge is the lack of a principled decision making mechanism
that mutually benefits both the LLM and the user. We propose Game-Theoretic
Alignment (GTAlign), an alignment framework that integrates game-theoretic
decision making into both reasoning and training. During reasoning, the model
explicitly treats user-LLM interaction as a strategic game: it constructs
payoff matrices within its reasoning chain to estimate welfare for both itself
and the user, and then selects actions that are mutually beneficial. During
training, we introduce a mutual welfare reward that reinforces cooperative
responses, aligning model behavior with socially efficient outcomes. In
addition, we introduce an inference technique that leverages game-theoretic
reasoning to dynamically adapt LLM's response when pricing policies of LLM
service change. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GTAlign substantially
improves reasoning efficiency, answer quality, and mutual welfare compared to
baselines across diverse tasks. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态模型基准测试往往无法捕捉其在实时对抗环境中的真实性能，需要一种动态、可复现的评估方法。

Method: 在受控的锦标赛中测试六个领先的开源和闭源模型，每个模型控制相同角色以确保公平比较，通过解读游戏画面和状态数据来选择行动。

Result: 该框架提供了完全自动化、可复现且客观的评估，能够衡量多模态模型在动态环境中的战略推理能力。

Conclusion: LM Fight Arena引入了一个具有挑战性和趣味性的基准测试，弥合了AI评估与互动娱乐之间的差距。

Abstract: Existing benchmarks for large multimodal models (LMMs) often fail to capture
their performance in real-time, adversarial environments. We introduce LM Fight
Arena (Large Model Fight Arena), a novel framework that evaluates LMMs by
pitting them against each other in the classic fighting game Mortal Kombat II,
a task requiring rapid visual understanding and tactical, sequential
decision-making. In a controlled tournament, we test six leading open- and
closed-source models, where each agent operates controlling the same character
to ensure a fair comparison. The models are prompted to interpret game frames
and state data to select their next actions. Unlike static evaluations, LM
Fight Arena provides a fully automated, reproducible, and objective assessment
of an LMM's strategic reasoning capabilities in a dynamic setting. This work
introduces a challenging and engaging benchmark that bridges the gap between AI
evaluation and interactive entertainment.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RADAR是一个通过机制可解释性检测LLM数据污染的新框架，通过区分基于记忆和基于推理的模型响应来识别污染问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据污染严重影响了LLM评估的可靠性，模型可能通过记忆训练数据而非真正推理来获得高性能表现。

Method: RADAR提取37个特征，涵盖表面级置信度轨迹和深层机制特性（注意力专门化、电路动态和激活流模式），并使用集成分类器进行检测。

Result: 在多样化评估集上达到93%的准确率，在清晰案例中表现完美，在具有挑战性的模糊示例中达到76.7%的准确率。

Conclusion: 这项工作展示了机制可解释性在超越传统表面级指标推进LLM评估方面的潜力。

Abstract: Data contamination poses a significant challenge to reliable LLM evaluation,
where models may achieve high performance by memorizing training data rather
than demonstrating genuine reasoning capabilities. We introduce RADAR (Recall
vs. Reasoning Detection through Activation Representation), a novel framework
that leverages mechanistic interpretability to detect contamination by
distinguishing recall-based from reasoning-based model responses. RADAR
extracts 37 features spanning surface-level confidence trajectories and deep
mechanistic properties including attention specialization, circuit dynamics,
and activation flow patterns. Using an ensemble of classifiers trained on these
features, RADAR achieves 93\% accuracy on a diverse evaluation set, with
perfect performance on clear cases and 76.7\% accuracy on challenging ambiguous
examples. This work demonstrates the potential of mechanistic interpretability
for advancing LLM evaluation beyond traditional surface-level metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注检索等特定方面，缺乏对RAG管道整体能力的评估，特别是在多模态信息处理方面的表现。

Method: 创建了93个人工编写的问题数据集，涵盖文本、表格、图像等多模态信息；提出了短语级召回指标和最近邻嵌入分类器来检测幻觉；比较了开源和闭源管道的性能。

Result: 闭源管道在正确性和幻觉检测方面显著优于开源管道，特别是在多模态和跨文档问题上表现差距更大；人工评估显示指标具有良好的一致性。

pipeline's ability to ingest, retrieve, and reason about several modalities of
information, differentiating it from existing benchmarks that focus on
particular aspects such as retrieval. We present (1) a small, human-created
dataset of 93 questions designed to evaluate a pipeline's ability to ingest
textual data, tables, images, and data spread across these modalities in one or
more documents; (2) a phrase-level recall metric for correctness; (3) a
nearest-neighbor embedding classifier to identify potential pipeline
hallucinations; (4) a comparative evaluation of 2 pipelines built with
open-source retrieval mechanisms and 4 closed-source foundation models; and (5)
a third-party human evaluation of the alignment of our correctness and
hallucination metrics. We find that closed-source pipelines significantly
outperform open-source pipelines in both correctness and hallucination metrics,
with wider performance gaps in questions relying on multimodal and
cross-document information. Human evaluation of our metrics showed average
agreement of 4.62 for correctness and 4.53 for hallucination detection on a 1-5
Likert scale (5 indicating "strongly agree").

*Zirui Liao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EcphoryRAG是一个基于实体中心知识图谱的RAG框架，通过提取核心实体和元数据实现轻量级索引，相比其他结构化RAG系统减少94%的token消耗。系统从查询中提取提示实体，在知识图谱上进行可扩展的多跳关联搜索，动态推断实体间隐含关系来填充上下文，无需预先枚举所有关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受人类认知神经科学启发，人类利用提示激活实体中心记忆痕迹进行复杂多跳回忆。作者希望模拟这种机制，开发一个更高效的实体中心知识图谱检索框架。

Method: 索引阶段仅提取和存储核心实体及元数据；检索阶段从查询中提取提示实体，在知识图谱上进行多跳关联搜索，动态推断实体间隐含关系来构建上下文。

Result: 在2WikiMultiHop、HotpotQA和MuSiQue基准测试中，EcphoryRAG实现了新的最先进性能，将平均精确匹配分数从0.392提升到0.474，优于HippoRAG等强KG-RAG方法。

Conclusion: 实体-提示-多跳检索范式在复杂问答任务中表现出高效性，验证了该方法的有效性。

Abstract: Cognitive neuroscience research indicates that humans leverage cues to
activate entity-centered memory traces (engrams) for complex, multi-hop
recollection. Inspired by this mechanism, we introduce EcphoryRAG, an
entity-centric knowledge graph RAG framework. During indexing, EcphoryRAG
extracts and stores only core entities with corresponding metadata, a
lightweight approach that reduces token consumption by up to 94\% compared to
other structured RAG systems. For retrieval, the system first extracts cue
entities from queries, then performs a scalable multi-hop associative search
across the knowledge graph. Crucially, EcphoryRAG dynamically infers implicit
relations between entities to populate context, enabling deep reasoning without
exhaustive pre-enumeration of relationships. Extensive evaluations on the
2WikiMultiHop, HotpotQA, and MuSiQue benchmarks demonstrate that EcphoryRAG
sets a new state-of-the-art, improving the average Exact Match (EM) score from
0.392 to 0.474 over strong KG-RAG methods like HippoRAG. These results validate
the efficacy of the entity-cue-multi-hop retrieval paradigm for complex
question answering.

*Jinxin Shi,Zongsheng Cao,Runmin Ma,Yusong Hu,Jie Zhou,Xin Li,Lei Bai,Liang He,Bo Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DualResearch是一个检索和融合框架，通过联合建模广度语义图和深度因果图来解决深度研究框架中的上下文污染、证据支持弱和执行路径脆弱等问题，在科学推理基准上取得显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度研究框架存在的三个主要问题：上下文污染、证据支持弱和脆弱的执行路径，这些限制了多步骤科学推理的效果。

Method: 提出DualResearch框架，联合建模两个互补图：广度语义图（编码稳定背景知识）和深度因果图（捕捉执行来源）。每个图都有层原生相关函数，广度图使用种子锚定的语义扩散，深度图使用因果语义路径匹配和可靠性加权。通过熵门控规则在log空间融合答案分布。

Result: 在科学推理基准HLE和GPQA上取得有竞争力的性能。使用InternAgent系统的日志文件，在HLE上的准确率提高7.7%，在GPQA上提高6.06%。

Conclusion: DualResearch能够将冗长的多工具执行日志压缩为简洁的推理图，稳定有效地重建答案，作为深度研究系统的补充具有良好效果。

Abstract: The deep-research framework orchestrates external tools to perform complex,
multi-step scientific reasoning that exceeds the native limits of a single
large language model. However, it still suffers from context pollution, weak
evidentiary support, and brittle execution paths. To address these issues, we
propose DualResearch, a retrieval and fusion framework that matches the
epistemic structure of tool-intensive reasoning by jointly modeling two
complementary graphs: a breadth semantic graph that encodes stable background
knowledge, and a depth causal graph that captures execution provenance. Each
graph has a layer-native relevance function, seed-anchored semantic diffusion
for breadth, and causal-semantic path matching with reliability weighting for
depth. To reconcile their heterogeneity and query-dependent uncertainty,
DualResearch converts per-layer path evidence into answer distributions and
fuses them in log space via an entropy-gated rule with global calibration. The
fusion up-weights the more certain channel and amplifies agreement. As a
complement to deep-research systems, DualResearch compresses lengthy multi-tool
execution logs into a concise reasoning graph, and we show that it can
reconstruct answers stably and effectively. On the scientific reasoning
benchmarks HLE and GPQA, DualResearch achieves competitive performance. Using
log files from the open-source system InternAgent, its accuracy improves by
7.7% on HLE and 6.06% on GPQA.

*Ruitong Liu,Yan Wen,Te Sun,Yunjia Wu,Pingyang Huang,Zihang Yu,Siyuan Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为语义条件调优（SCT）的新知识注入范式，通过图神经网络提取上下文感知的语义条件，并自适应地调制文本嵌入，实现深度、特征级的知识感知交互，显著优于前缀调优方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如前缀调优）简单地将知识嵌入与文本输入拼接，忽略了知识图谱中丰富的关系语义，并给LLM带来了显著的隐式推理负担来关联前缀与文本。

Method: SCT包含两个关键模块：语义图模块使用图神经网络从局部图邻域中提取上下文感知的语义条件；条件自适应融合模块通过两个参数化投影器自适应地调制文本嵌入，实现深度特征级交互。

Result: 在知识图谱基准测试上的广泛实验表明，SCT显著优于前缀调优和其他强基线方法。

Conclusion: 通过在LLM推理前用语义图上下文调制输入表示，SCT提供了更直接和强大的信号，实现了更准确和鲁棒的知识推理。

Abstract: Fusing Knowledge Graphs with Large Language Models is crucial for
knowledge-intensive tasks like knowledge graph completion. The prevailing
paradigm, prefix-tuning, simply concatenates knowledge embeddings with text
inputs. However, this shallow fusion overlooks the rich relational semantics
within KGs and imposes a significant implicit reasoning burden on the LLM to
correlate the prefix with the text. To address these, we propose
Semantic-condition Tuning (SCT), a new knowledge injection paradigm comprising
two key modules. First, a Semantic Graph Module employs a Graph Neural Network
to extract a context-aware semantic condition from the local graph
neighborhood, guided by knowledge-enhanced relations. Subsequently, this
condition is passed to a Condition-Adaptive Fusion Module, which, in turn,
adaptively modulates the textual embedding via two parameterized projectors,
enabling a deep, feature-wise, and knowledge-aware interaction. The resulting
pre-fused embedding is then fed into the LLM for fine-tuning. Extensive
experiments on knowledge graph benchmarks demonstrate that SCT significantly
outperforms prefix-tuning and other strong baselines. Our analysis confirms
that by modulating the input representation with semantic graph context before
LLM inference, SCT provides a more direct and potent signal, enabling more
accurate and robust knowledge reasoning.

TL;DR: Tiny-R1V是一个轻量级3B多模态大语言模型，通过两阶段优化实现更快推理和更高准确率，统一多任务多模态推理并使用更少token。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在推理效率上面临模型尺寸大、过度思考、轻量场景准确率低等挑战，而轻量级MLLMs的推理能力研究较为缺乏。

Method: 两阶段优化：第一阶段引入LIPO强化学习方法，动态调整组内响应优势，鼓励生成更短更准确的响应；第二阶段提出AMM训练无关模型合并方法，自适应调整任务向量权重并通过梯度投影正则化损失优化合并向量。

Result: 在十个广泛使用的推理基准测试（数学、结构化数据、OCR、通用能力）中表现出优越性能，使轻量模型在多样化多模态推理任务中表现出色。

Conclusion: Tiny-R1V通过创新的两阶段优化方法，成功解决了轻量级MLLMs的推理效率问题，在保持模型轻量化的同时实现了高性能的多模态推理能力。

Abstract: Although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities across diverse tasks, they encounter numerous
challenges in terms of reasoning efficiency, such as large model size,
overthinking, and compromised accuracy in lightweight scenarios. However,
research on the reasoning capabilities of lightweight MLLMs is quite lacking.
To this end, we propose Tiny-R1V, a novel lightweight 3B model that achieves
faster inference and higher accuracy via a two-stage optimization, while
unifying multimodal reasoning across multiple tasks and using fewer tokens. In
the first stage, Tiny-R1V introduces Length-Informed Relative Policy
Optimization (LIPO), a novel reinforcement learning method, to train each
reasoning model. The LIPO is designed to dynamically adjusts advantages of
responses within groups, that is, by prioritizing concise yet high-quality
responses to encourage the generation of shorter and more accurate response. In
the second stage, we propose Adaptive Model Merging (AMM), a training-free
model merging method that merges multiple specialist models into a unified
architecture. Specifically, AMM adaptively adjusts the weights of task vectors
and robustly optimizes the merged vectors via a novel gradient projection
regularization loss function, thus mitigating redundant conflicts between them.
Extensive evaluations on ten widely-used reasoning benchmarks covering
mathematics, structured data (charts, tables, documents), OCR, and general
capabilities showcase the superior performance of Tiny-R1V, enabling
lightweight models to excel in diverse multimodal reasoning tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有旅行规划基准在评估行程的可行性、可靠性和吸引力方面存在不足，需要更全面的评估框架来直接比较规划质量并支持强化学习。

Method: 构建包含4870个查询的大规模数据集，开发评估器将细粒度标准统一为单一奖励，采用多种方法包括测试时计算、神经符号方法、监督微调和GRPO强化学习进行实验。

Result: 评估器与旅行专家标注达到60.75%的一致性，优于多个LLM作为评判基准。强化学习方法在基础模型上普遍提高了行程可行性，获得了更高的统一奖励分数。

Conclusion: 提出的基准能够有效评估旅行规划质量，强化学习方法在提升行程可行性方面表现优异，为旅行规划任务提供了更可靠的评估框架。

Abstract: Travel planning is a valuable yet complex task that poses significant
challenges even for advanced large language models (LLMs). While recent
benchmarks have advanced in evaluating LLMs' planning capabilities, they often
fall short in evaluating feasibility, reliability, and engagement of travel
plans. We introduce a comprehensive benchmark for travel planning that unifies
fine-grained criteria into a single reward, enabling direct comparison of plan
quality and seamless integration with reinforcement learning (RL). Our
evaluator achieves moderate agreement with travel-expert annotations (60.75\%)
and outperforms multiple LLM-as-judge baselines. We further release a
large-scale dataset of 4,870 queries including 219 real-world, free-form
requests for generalization to authentic user intent. Using this benchmark, we
conduct extensive experiments across diverse methods and LLMs, including
test-time computation, neuro-symbolic approaches, supervised fine-tuning, and
RL via GRPO. Across base models, RL generally improves itinerary feasibility
over prompt-only and supervised baselines, yielding higher unified reward
scores.

TL;DR: 评估LLMs在数学证明评分方面的能力，包括错误检测、严重性判断和分数分配，并提出基于代理的工作流程来改进部分分数的校准问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在解决奥林匹克数学问题方面取得显著进展，需要评估它们在证明评分方面的能力，特别是在检测错误、判断严重性和分配公平分数方面的表现。

Method: 使用90个Gemini 2.5 Pro生成的解决方案和MathArena的IMO/USAMO 2025解决方案集，采用1-4分和0-7分两种评分标准。引入基于代理的工作流程，提取和分析参考解决方案，自动生成问题特定的评分标准，进行多步骤评分过程。

Result: 模型能够可靠地标记错误解决方案（包括细微错误），但在部分分数分配方面存在校准差距。提出的工作流程在人工评分一致性和部分分数处理一致性方面表现更好。

Conclusion: 代理工作流程能够显著提高LLMs在数学证明评分方面的表现，特别是在部分分数校准方面，为未来研究提供了有价值的工具和数据。

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs have progressed from struggling on proof-based
Olympiad problems to solving most of the IMO 2025 problems, with leading
systems reportedly handling 5 of 6 problems. Given this progress, we assess how
well these models can grade proofs: detecting errors, judging their severity,
and assigning fair scores beyond binary correctness. We study proof-analysis
capabilities using a corpus of 90 Gemini 2.5 Pro-generated solutions that we
grade on a 1-4 scale with detailed error annotations, and on MathArena solution
sets for IMO/USAMO 2025 scored on a 0-7 scale. Our analysis shows that models
can reliably flag incorrect (including subtly incorrect) solutions but exhibit
calibration gaps in how partial credit is assigned. To address this, we
introduce agentic workflows that extract and analyze reference solutions and
automatically derive problem-specific rubrics for a multi-step grading process.
We instantiate and compare different design choices for the grading workflows,
and evaluate their trade-offs. Across our annotated corpus and MathArena, our
proposed workflows achieve higher agreement with human grades and more
consistent handling of partial credit across metrics. We release all code,
data, and prompts/logs to facilitate future research.

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合框架LRR，结合符号方法和LLM的优势，解决正则表达式修复中的精度与泛化性权衡问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 正则表达式在现代计算中广泛应用，但存在ReDoS漏洞。现有方法面临权衡：符号方法精确但无法处理复杂模式，LLM泛化性强但可靠性不足

Method: 采用混合框架LRR，首先用符号模块定位漏洞子模式，然后调用LLM生成语义等效的修复方案

Result: 成功解决了规则方法无法处理的复杂修复案例，同时避免了纯LLM方法的语义错误，修复率比现有最优方法提高15.4%

Conclusion: LRR提供了一种经过验证的方法论，有效结合了符号方法的可靠性和LLM的泛化能力，为自动修复问题提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Regular expressions (regexes) are foundational to modern computing for
critical tasks like input validation and data parsing, yet their ubiquity
exposes systems to regular expression denial of service (ReDoS), a
vulnerability requiring automated repair methods. Current approaches, however,
are hampered by a trade-off. Symbolic, rule-based system are precise but fails
to repair unseen or complex vulnerability patterns. Conversely, large language
models (LLMs) possess the necessary generalizability but are unreliable for
tasks demanding strict syntactic and semantic correctness. We resolve this
impasse by introducing a hybrid framework, localized regex repair (LRR),
designed to harness LLM generalization while enforcing reliability. Our core
insight is to decouple problem identification from the repair process. First, a
deterministic, symbolic module localizes the precise vulnerable subpattern,
creating a constrained and tractable problem space. Then, the LLM invoked to
generate a semantically equivalent fix for this isolated segment. This combined
architecture successfully resolves complex repair cases intractable for
rule-based repair while avoiding the semantic errors of LLM-only approaches.
Our work provides a validated methodology for solving such problems in
automated repair, improving the repair rate by 15.4%p over the
state-of-the-art. Our code is available at https://github.com/cdltlehf/LRR.

*Wenyi Wu,Kun Zhou,Ruoxin Yuan,Vivian Yu,Stephen Wang,Zhiting Hu,Biwei Huang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种连续记忆机制，将GUI轨迹编码为固定长度的连续嵌入，显著减少上下文成本并保留细粒度视觉信息，通过自动扩展数据飞轮收集10万+轨迹，在真实GUI基准测试中显著提升长任务和分布偏移下的成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GUI代理将过去轨迹压缩为文本标记，导致上下文长度膨胀并丢失关键视觉线索（如精确的控件大小和位置），需要可扩展的记忆机制来帮助跨陌生界面和长任务泛化。

Method: 使用VLM本身作为编码器将GUI轨迹编码为固定长度的连续嵌入序列，直接插入主干网络的输入层；引入自动扩展数据飞轮，通过搜索发现新环境、使用开源VLM合成任务、代理执行轨迹、同一VLM验证成功来低成本扩展记忆。

Result: 随着记忆大小和检索深度增加，性能单调提升（与文本记忆在长提示下性能下降形成对比）；在真实GUI基准测试中，Qwen-2.5-VL-7B + 连续记忆达到与最先进闭源模型（如GPT-4o、Claude-4）相当的性能。

Conclusion: 连续记忆机制有效提升了GUI代理在长任务和分布偏移下的性能，通过低成本数据收集和仅微调记忆编码器（1.2%参数）实现了与顶级闭源模型竞争的效果。

Abstract: We study how to endow GUI agents with scalable memory that help generalize
across unfamiliar interfaces and long-horizon tasks. Prior GUI agents compress
past trajectories into text tokens, which balloons context length and misses
decisive visual cues (e.g., exact widget size and position). We propose a
continuous memory that encodes each GUI trajectory into a fixed-length sequence
of continuous embeddings using the VLM itself as an encoder; these embeddings
are plugged directly into the backbone's input layer, sharply reducing context
cost while preserving fine-grained visual information. As memory size and
retrieval depth increase, performance improves monotonically, unlike text
memories that degrade with long prompts. To grow memory at low cost, we
introduce an auto-scaling data flywheel that (i) discovers new environments via
search, (ii) synthesizes tasks with an open-source VLM, (iii) rolls out
trajectories with the agent, and (iv) verifies success with the same VLM. Using
this pipeline, we collect 100k+ trajectories for about \$4000 and fine-tune
only the memory encoder (LoRA on a Q-Former, 1.2\% parameters) with 1,500
samples. On real-world GUI benchmarks, our memory-augmented agent consistently
improves success rates under long horizons and distribution shifts. Notably,
Qwen-2.5-VL-7B + continuous memory achieves performance comparable to
state-of-the-art closed-source models (e.g., GPT-4o, Claude-4).

Motivation: 当前科学难以定义人类意识，虽然大语言模型在多个领域取得进展，但由于幻觉问题无法真正模仿人类意识。本研究旨在通过整合精神分析和人格理论来解决这一挑战。

Method: 基于精神分析原理开发了三种人工意识（自我意识、潜意识、前意识），设计了16种MBTI人格类型角色，创建了10种不同情境，通过问卷调查、ChatGPT三级分类和定性评估三种方式评估决策过程。

Result: 定量和定性分析表明模型有较高可能性模拟人类意识，但不同角色和意识之间的响应差异不显著。开发的模型能够构建更具直觉性和适应性的人工智能系统。

Conclusion: 该研究为在复杂认知情境中改进AI交互开辟了新途径，证明整合精神分析和人格理论元素可以构建更接近人类意识的人工智能系统。

Abstract: Human consciousness is still a concept hard to define with current scientific
understanding. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated
significant advancements across various domains including translation and
summarization, human consciousness is not something to imitate with current
upfront technology owing to so-called hallucination. This study, therefore,
proposes a novel approach to address these challenges by integrating
psychoanalysis and the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) into constructing
consciousness and personality modules. We developed three artificial
consciousnesses (self-awareness, unconsciousness, and preconsciousness) based
on the principles of psychoanalysis. Additionally, we designed 16 characters
with different personalities representing the sixteen MBTI types, with several
attributes such as needs, status, and memories. To determine if our model's
artificial consciousness exhibits human-like cognition, we created ten distinct
situations considering seven attributes such as emotional understanding and
logical thinking. The decision-making process of artificial consciousness and
the final action were evaluated in three ways: survey evaluation, three-tier
classification via ChatGPT, and qualitative review. Both quantitative and
qualitative analyses indicated a high likelihood of well-simulated
consciousness, although the difference in response between different characters
and consciousnesses was not very significant. This implies that the developed
models incorporating elements of psychoanalysis and personality theory can lead
to building a more intuitive and adaptable AI system with humanoid
consciousness. Therefore, this study contributes to opening up new avenues for
improving AI interactions in complex cognitive contexts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在代码复杂度预测中表现不佳，没有单一模型在所有复杂度类别上都表现优秀，每个模型只在特定类别上有优势。

Method: MEC³O系统将LLM分配到不同复杂度类别，提供类别专用指令使其成为专家，专家进行结构化辩论，通过加权共识机制整合预测结果。

Result: 在CodeComplex数据集上，MEC³O比开源基线模型准确率和macro-F1分数至少高出10%，在macro-F1上平均超过GPT-4o-mini，与GPT-4o和GPT-o4-mini的F1分数相当。

Conclusion: 多专家辩论和加权共识策略能有效生成最终预测，证明了该方法在代码复杂度预测任务上的有效性。

Abstract: Predicting the complexity of source code is essential for software
development and algorithm analysis. Recently, Baik et al. (2025) introduced
CodeComplex for code time complexity prediction. The paper shows that LLMs
without fine-tuning struggle with certain complexity classes. This suggests
that no single LLM excels at every class, but rather each model shows
advantages in certain classes. We propose MEC$^3$O, a multi-expert consensus
system, which extends the multi-agent debate frameworks. MEC$^3$O assigns LLMs
to complexity classes based on their performance and provides them with
class-specialized instructions, turning them into experts. These experts engage
in structured debates, and their predictions are integrated through a weighted
consensus mechanism. Our expertise assignments to LLMs effectively handle
Degeneration-of-Thought, reducing reliance on a separate judge model, and
preventing convergence to incorrect majority opinions. Experiments on
CodeComplex show that MEC$^3$O outperforms the open-source baselines, achieving
at least 10% higher accuracy and macro-F1 scores. It also surpasses GPT-4o-mini
in macro-F1 scores on average and demonstrates competitive on-par F1 scores to
GPT-4o and GPT-o4-mini on average. This demonstrates the effectiveness of
multi-expert debates and weight consensus strategy to generate the final
predictions. Our code and data is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 流式文本到图像模型遵循确定性轨迹，用户需要重复采样才能发现多样模式，这是一个成本高且效率低的过程。

Method: 使用特征空间目标鼓励轨迹间的横向扩散，并通过时间调度的随机扰动重新引入不确定性。关键创新是将扰动投影到与生成流正交的方向，从而在不降低图像细节或提示保真度的情况下增强多样性。

Result: 在固定采样预算下，该方法在多个文本到图像设置中持续提高了Vendi Score和Brisque等多样性指标，同时保持了图像质量和对齐度。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种原则性的解释，说明为什么生成质量能够稳健保持，同时通过几何约束近似保持边际分布，单调增加体积代理。

Abstract: Flow-based text-to-image models follow deterministic trajectories, forcing
users to repeatedly sample to discover diverse modes, which is a costly and
inefficient process. We present a training-free, inference-time control
mechanism that makes the flow itself diversity-aware. Our method simultaneously
encourages lateral spread among trajectories via a feature-space objective and
reintroduces uncertainty through a time-scheduled stochastic perturbation.
Crucially, this perturbation is projected to be orthogonal to the generation
flow, a geometric constraint that allows it to boost variation without
degrading image details or prompt fidelity. Our procedure requires no
retraining or modification to the base sampler and is compatible with common
flow-matching solvers. Theoretically, our method is shown to monotonically
increase a volume surrogate while, due to its geometric constraints,
approximately preserving the marginal distribution. This provides a principled
explanation for why generation quality is robustly maintained. Empirically,
across multiple text-to-image settings under fixed sampling budgets, our method
consistently improves diversity metrics such as the Vendi Score and Brisque
over strong baselines, while upholding image quality and alignment.

Abstract: Learning complex network dynamics is fundamental to understanding, modelling
and controlling real-world complex systems. There are two main problems in the
task of predicting the dynamic evolution of complex networks: on the one hand,
existing methods usually use simple graphs to describe the relationships in
complex networks; however, this approach can only capture pairwise
relationships, while there may be rich non-pairwise structured relationships in
the network. First-order GNNs have difficulty in capturing dynamic non-pairwise
relationships. On the other hand, theoretical prediction models lack accuracy
and data-driven prediction models lack interpretability. To address the above
problems, this paper proposes a higher-order network dynamics identification
method for long-term dynamic prediction of complex networks. Firstly, to
address the problem that traditional graph machine learning can only deal with
pairwise relations, dynamic hypergraph learning is introduced to capture the
higher-order non-pairwise relations among complex networks and improve the
accuracy of complex network modelling. Then, a dual-driven dynamic prediction
module for physical data is proposed. The Koopman operator theory is introduced
to transform the nonlinear dynamical differential equations for the dynamic
evolution of complex networks into linear systems for solving. Meanwhile, the
physical information neural differential equation method is utilised to ensure
that the dynamic evolution conforms to the physical laws. The dual-drive
dynamic prediction module ensures both accuracy and interpretability of the
prediction. Validated on public datasets and self-built industrial chain
network datasets, the experimental results show that the method in this paper

TL;DR: 提出基于Stackelberg竞争的强化学习框架，训练LLM代理在社交推理游戏中优化说服性沟通，显著超越基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM代理在社交推理游戏中主要关注信息处理和策略选择，忽视了说服性沟通对影响其他玩家信念和反应的重要性。

Method: 将回合制对话形式化为Stackelberg竞争，当前玩家作为领导者战略性地影响跟随者的响应，并基于此提出强化学习框架训练代理优化说服性话语。

Result: 在三个不同的社交推理游戏中进行全面实验，证明所提出的代理显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 这项工作代表了开发具有战略社交影响力AI代理的重要进展，对需要说服性沟通的场景具有广泛意义。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have shown remarkable progress in social
deduction games (SDGs). However, existing approaches primarily focus on
information processing and strategy selection, overlooking the significance of
persuasive communication in influencing other players' beliefs and responses.
In SDGs, success depends not only on making correct deductions but on
convincing others to response in alignment with one's intent. To address this
limitation, we formalize turn-based dialogue in SDGs as a Stackelberg
competition, where the current player acts as the leader who strategically
influences the follower's response. Building on this theoretical foundation, we
propose a reinforcement learning framework that trains agents to optimize
utterances for persuasive impact. Through comprehensive experiments across
three diverse SDGs, we demonstrate that our agents significantly outperform
baselines. This work represents a significant step toward developing AI agents
capable of strategic social influence, with implications extending to scenarios
requiring persuasive communication.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了PAC推理方法，通过置信上界控制性能损失，在用户指定的性能损失容忍度内动态切换思考模式以节省计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型在部署时计算成本高，现有动态切换方法缺乏统计性能保证，无法满足高风险应用需求。

Method: 构建性能损失的单调置信上界函数，确定切换到非思考模式的阈值，实现分布无关的性能损失控制。

Result: 在推理基准测试中，该方法能节省计算预算并控制用户指定的性能损失。

Conclusion: PAC推理方法为高效推理提供了统计保证，能在保证性能的前提下显著降低计算成本。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable progress in complex
problem-solving tasks. Despite this success, LRMs typically suffer from high
computational costs during deployment, highlighting a need for efficient
inference. A popular direction of efficiency improvement is to switch the LRM
between thinking and nonthinking modes dynamically. However, such approaches
often introduce additional reasoning errors and lack statistical guarantees for
the performance loss, which are critical for high-stakes applications. In this
work, we propose Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) reasoning that controls
the performance loss under the user-specified performance loss tolerance. In
particular, we construct an upper confidence bound on the performance loss,
formulated as a monotone function of the uncertainty score, and subsequently
determine a threshold for switching to the nonthinking model. Theoretically,
using the threshold to switch between the thinking and nonthinking modes
ensures bounded performance loss in a distribution-free manner. Our
comprehensive experiments on reasoning benchmarks show that the proposed method
can save computational budgets and control the user-specified performance loss.

*Emma Kondrup,Anne Imouza*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型在生成医疗建议时存在系统性偏见，对原住民和双性人等社会群体提供可读性较差、更复杂的建议，且交叉群体中这种趋势更加明显。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在医疗领域的广泛应用，需要评估其是否存在社会偏见，特别是在医疗建议生成中是否对不同社会群体产生不公平对待。

Method: 通过模拟不同性别、年龄和种族的患者档案向LLMs提出一系列医疗问题，比较生成回答的自然语言特征。

Result: LLMs生成的医疗建议在不同社会群体间存在系统性差异，原住民和双性人患者收到的建议可读性更差、更复杂，交叉群体的差异更加明显。

Conclusion: 鉴于公众对LLMs的信任度增加，需要提高AI素养，并呼吁AI开发者紧急调查和缓解这些系统性差异，确保公平的患者支持。

Abstract: With the rapid progress of Large Language Models (LLMs), the general public
now has easy and affordable access to applications capable of answering most
health-related questions in a personalized manner. These LLMs are increasingly
proving to be competitive, and now even surpass professionals in some medical
capabilities. They hold particular promise in low-resource settings,
considering they provide the possibility of widely accessible, quasi-free
healthcare support. However, evaluations that fuel these motivations highly
lack insights into the social nature of healthcare, oblivious to health
disparities between social groups and to how bias may translate into
LLM-generated medical advice and impact users. We provide an exploratory
analysis of LLM answers to a series of medical questions spanning key clinical
domains, where we simulate these questions being asked by several patient
profiles that vary in sex, age range, and ethnicity. By comparing natural
language features of the generated responses, we show that, when LLMs are used
for medical advice generation, they generate responses that systematically
differ between social groups. In particular, Indigenous and intersex patients
receive advice that is less readable and more complex. We observe these trends
amplify when intersectional groups are considered. Considering the increasing
trust individuals place in these models, we argue for higher AI literacy and
for the urgent need for investigation and mitigation by AI developers to ensure
these systemic differences are diminished and do not translate to unjust
patient support. Our code is publicly available on GitHub.

Result: 提出了支持知识融合的概念模型框架，能够整合多种上下文对齐的知识源。

Conclusion: 知识融合方法为医疗专业人员提供了从多个知识源中选择的机会，支持关键决策制定。

Abstract: In the field of medicine and healthcare, the utilization of medical
expertise, based on medical knowledge combined with patients' health
information is a life-critical challenge for patients and health professionals.
The within-laying complexity and variety form the need for a united approach to
gather, analyze, and utilize existing knowledge of medical treatments, and
medical operations to provide the ability to present knowledge for the means of
accurate patient-driven decision-making. One way to achieve this is the fusion
of multiple knowledge sources in healthcare. It provides health professionals
the opportunity to select from multiple contextual aligned knowledge sources
which enables the support for critical decisions. This paper presents multiple
conceptual models for knowledge fusion in the field of medicine, based on a
knowledge graph structure. It will evaluate, how knowledge fusion can be
enabled and presents how to integrate various knowledge sources into the
knowledge graph for rescue operations.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了基于PSPACE完全正则表达式问题的新基准，用于评估大语言模型的空间计算限制，发现模型在复杂推理任务中存在重复和冗长等常见失败模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注NP复杂度问题，但PSPACE完全问题能更严格评估计算能力，因为需要大规模搜索空间探索。

Method: 通过双指数空间探索构建包含百万正则表达式实例的数据集，使用6个LLM和5个LRM进行广泛评估。

Result: 揭示了模型在PSPACE完全问题上的常见失败模式，如冗长和重复，提供了评估高级推理能力的新框架。

Conclusion: 这是首次对LLM和LRM空间计算限制的实证研究，为评估其高级推理能力提供了新基准。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show strong performance across natural language
processing (NLP), mathematical reasoning, and programming, and recent large
reasoning models (LRMs) further emphasize explicit reasoning. Yet their
computational limits, particularly spatial complexity constrained by finite
context windows, remain poorly understood. While recent works often focus on
problems within the NP complexity class, we push the boundary by introducing a
novel benchmark grounded in two PSPACE-complete regular expression (regex)
problems: equivalence decision (RegexEQ) and minimization (RegexMin).
PSPACE-complete problems serve as a more rigorous standard for assessing
computational capacity, as their solutions require massive search space
exploration. We perform a double-exponential space exploration to construct a
labeled dataset of over a million regex instances with a sound filtering
process to build the benchmark. We conduct extensive evaluations on 6 LLMs and
5 LRMs of varying scales, revealing common failure patterns such as verbosity
and repetition. With its well-defined structure and quantitative evaluation
metrics, this work presents the first empirical investigation into the spatial
computational limitations of LLMs and LRMs, offering a new framework for
evaluating their advanced reasoning capabilities. Our code is available at

Motivation: 传统LLM在现实世界任务中存在局限性，研究旨在开发能够自动化复杂任务、弥合与人类能力差距的智能体化LLM。

Method: 构建包含四个关键组件的系统：感知系统（将环境感知转换为有意义表示）、推理系统（制定计划、适应反馈、评估行动）、记忆系统（通过短期和长期机制保留知识）、执行系统（将内部决策转化为具体行动）。

Result: 通过整合这些系统，可以开发出更强大和通用的软件机器人，模拟人类认知过程以实现自主智能行为。

Conclusion: 集成感知、推理、记忆和执行系统能够创建更智能的LLM智能体，实现自主和智能行为，弥合与人类能力的差距。

Abstract: This paper reviews the architecture and implementation methods of agents
powered by large language models (LLMs). Motivated by the limitations of
traditional LLMs in real-world tasks, the research aims to explore patterns to
develop "agentic" LLMs that can automate complex tasks and bridge the
performance gap with human capabilities. Key components include a perception
system that converts environmental percepts into meaningful representations; a
reasoning system that formulates plans, adapts to feedback, and evaluates
actions through different techniques like Chain-of-Thought and Tree-of-Thought;
a memory system that retains knowledge through both short-term and long-term
mechanisms; and an execution system that translates internal decisions into
concrete actions. This paper shows how integrating these systems leads to more
capable and generalized software bots that mimic human cognitive processes for
autonomous and intelligent behavior.

TL;DR: 提出了一种训练大型语言模型的新框架，通过可调节的局部性参数实现从局部化到分布式表示的连续调整，无需重新训练模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在可解释性和高性能之间的权衡问题，特别是在需要透明度和能力的监管领域。

Method: 使用组稀疏惩罚、信息论锚点设计和动态规则注入，通过可调节的局部性参数控制表示的局部化程度。

Result: 提供了严格的数学证明，建立了明确的阈值条件，当组稀疏惩罚超过特定值时，注意力机制会集中在语义相关块上，实现低熵和高保真度。

Conclusion: 该框架使从业者能够在可解释模式和高性能模式之间连续插值，支持需要透明度和能力的应用场景。

Abstract: We present a novel framework for training large language models with
continuously adjustable internal representations that span the full spectrum
from localist (interpretable, rule-based) to distributed (generalizable,
efficient) encodings. The key innovation is a locality dial, a tunable
parameter that dynamically controls the degree of localization during both
training and inference without requiring model retraining. This is achieved
through group sparsity penalties on attention mechanisms, information-theoretic
anchor design, and dynamic rule injection. We provide rigorous mathematical
proofs establishing explicit threshold conditions under which attention
provably concentrates on semantically relevant blocks, with exponential bounds
on attention entropy and pointer fidelity. Specifically, we prove that when
group sparsity penalties exceed certain threshold values, the model's attention
mechanisms concentrate on semantically relevant blocks, achieving low entropy
and high fidelity with negligible error. This framework enables practitioners
to continuously interpolate between interpretable and high-performance modes,
supporting applications in regulated domains requiring both transparency and
capability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大语言模型在逻辑推理问题中的内部机制，目前这些机制在很大程度上仍未被充分研究。

Method: 使用小语言模型解决演绎推理任务，分析其内部表示和计算电路，重点关注归纳头的作用。

Result: 发现模型通过学习底层规则而非统计模式来执行推理，归纳头在规则补全和规则链式推理步骤中发挥核心作用。

Conclusion: 小语言模型能够通过规则学习机制实现逻辑推理，归纳头是实现逻辑推理的关键计算组件。

Abstract: Recent large language models have demonstrated relevant capabilities in
solving problems that require logical reasoning; however, the corresponding
internal mechanisms remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we show that a
small language model can solve a deductive reasoning task by learning the
underlying rules (rather than operating as a statistical learner). A low-level
explanation of its internal representations and computational circuits is then
provided. Our findings reveal that induction heads play a central role in the
implementation of the rule completion and rule chaining steps involved in the
logical inference required by the task.

TL;DR: 本文提出了序列变量作为约束规划中处理车辆路径问题的新方法，能够处理可选访问点并支持插入启发式算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于后继变量的CP模型无法有效处理可选访问点或插入式启发式算法，限制了在车辆路径问题中的应用。

Method: 形式化定义了序列变量的计算域、更新操作和一致性级别，设计了专门的数据结构和全局约束，并实现了基于轨迹的CP求解器集成。

Result: 序列变量简化了问题建模，在Dial-a-Ride问题上实现了具有竞争力的计算性能。

Conclusion: 序列变量为车辆路径问题的约束规划建模提供了更直观和强大的框架，能够处理复杂约束并支持高效求解算法。

Abstract: Constraint Programming (CP) offers an intuitive, declarative framework for
modeling Vehicle Routing Problems (VRP), yet classical CP models based on
successor variables cannot always deal with optional visits or insertion based
heuristics. To address these limitations, this paper formalizes sequence
variables within CP. Unlike the classical successor models, this computational
domain handle optional visits and support insertion heuristics, including
insertion-based Large Neighborhood Search. We provide a clear definition of
their domain, update operations, and introduce consistency levels for
constraints on this domain. An implementation is described with the underlying
data structures required for integrating sequence variables into existing
trail-based CP solvers. Furthermore, global constraints specifically designed
for sequence variables and vehicle routing are introduced. Finally, the
effectiveness of sequence variables is demonstrated by simplifying problem
modeling and achieving competitive computational performance on the Dial-a-Ride
Problem.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 放射学具有多模态数据流和复杂工作流程的特点，适合利用LLM代理来适应上下文并自动化重复但复杂的任务，而单独使用LLM无法充分发挥其在复杂多步骤工作流程中的潜力。

Method: 通过为LLM配备外部工具和反馈机制，构建能够展现不同自主性程度的系统，从半自动化工作流到能够管理复杂流程的自适应代理。

Result: LLM及其多模态变体在放射学的信息提取和报告总结等单个任务中已显示出良好性能，但需要更复杂的代理系统来支持多步骤工作流程。

Conclusion: LLM驱动的代理系统在放射学中具有广阔应用前景，但面临错误级联、工具使用效率和健康IT集成等挑战，需要进一步研究和解决。

Abstract: Building agents, systems that perceive and act upon their environment with a
degree of autonomy, has long been a focus of AI research. This pursuit has
recently become vastly more practical with the emergence of large language
models (LLMs) capable of using natural language to integrate information,
follow instructions, and perform forms of "reasoning" and planning across a
wide range of tasks. With its multimodal data streams and orchestrated
workflows spanning multiple systems, radiology is uniquely suited to benefit
from agents that can adapt to context and automate repetitive yet complex
tasks. In radiology, LLMs and their multimodal variants have already
demonstrated promising performance for individual tasks such as information
extraction and report summarization. However, using LLMs in isolation
underutilizes their potential to support complex, multi-step workflows where
decisions depend on evolving context from multiple information sources.
Equipping LLMs with external tools and feedback mechanisms enables them to
drive systems that exhibit a spectrum of autonomy, ranging from semi-automated
workflows to more adaptive agents capable of managing complex processes. This
review examines the design of such LLM-driven agentic systems, highlights key
applications, discusses evaluation methods for planning and tool use, and
outlines challenges such as error cascades, tool-use efficiency, and health IT
integration.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GraphMERT是一个小型图形编码器模型，能够从非结构化文本语料库中提取高质量知识图谱，形成模块化的神经符号堆栈，在保持最先进基准精度的同时提供可验证的符号表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经符号人工智能领域近三十年来未能实现其承诺，主要因为大多数框架无法扩展，且神经方法的隐式表示和近似推理限制了可解释性和可信度。知识图谱作为显式语义知识的黄金标准表示可以解决符号方面的问题，但自动从文本语料库中推导可靠知识图谱仍是一个开放问题。

Method: 引入GraphMERT，一个小型图形编码器模型，从非结构化文本语料库及其内部表示中提取高质量知识图谱。GraphMERT及其等效知识图谱形成模块化神经符号堆栈：神经学习抽象；符号知识图谱用于可验证推理。

Result: 在PubMed糖尿病论文文本上，80M参数的GraphMERT生成的知识图谱达到69.8%的事实分数，而32B参数的基线LLM仅达到40.2%。GraphMERT知识图谱的有效性分数为68.8%，而LLM基线为43.0%。

Conclusion: GraphMERT+KG是第一个高效且可扩展的神经符号模型，在实现最先进基准精度的同时，相对于基线提供更优越的符号表示，解决了神经符号AI的可扩展性和可靠性问题。

Abstract: Researchers have pursued neurosymbolic artificial intelligence (AI)
applications for nearly three decades because symbolic components provide
abstraction while neural components provide generalization. Thus, a marriage of
the two components can lead to rapid advancements in AI. Yet, the field has not
realized this promise since most neurosymbolic AI frameworks fail to scale. In
addition, the implicit representations and approximate reasoning of neural
approaches limit interpretability and trust. Knowledge graphs (KGs), a
gold-standard representation of explicit semantic knowledge, can address the
symbolic side. However, automatically deriving reliable KGs from text corpora
has remained an open problem. We address these challenges by introducing
GraphMERT, a tiny graphical encoder-only model that distills high-quality KGs
from unstructured text corpora and its own internal representations. GraphMERT
and its equivalent KG form a modular neurosymbolic stack: neural learning of
abstractions; symbolic KGs for verifiable reasoning. GraphMERT + KG is the
first efficient and scalable neurosymbolic model to achieve state-of-the-art
benchmark accuracy along with superior symbolic representations relative to
baselines.
  Concretely, we target reliable domain-specific KGs that are both (1) factual
(with provenance) and (2) valid (ontology-consistent relations with
domain-appropriate semantics). When a large language model (LLM), e.g.,
Qwen3-32B, generates domain-specific KGs, it falls short on reliability due to
prompt sensitivity, shallow domain expertise, and hallucinated relations. On
text obtained from PubMed papers on diabetes, our 80M-parameter GraphMERT
yields a KG with a 69.8% FActScore; a 32B-parameter baseline LLM yields a KG
that achieves only 40.2% FActScore. The GraphMERT KG also attains a higher
ValidityScore of 68.8%, versus 43.0% for the LLM baseline.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前编程基准测试存在挑战性问题不足、测试用例覆盖不充分、依赖在线平台API等问题，需要更全面可靠的评估工具。

Method: 从72个官方信息学奥林匹克竞赛中收集403个专家策划的高质量题目，每个题目配备详细子任务评分标准和大量私有测试用例，并集成精英选手表现数据进行比较。

Result: 在测试32个流行LLM后，GPT-5达到81.76百分位数，但仍低于顶尖人类选手（通常超过90百分位数），而开源模型GPT-OSS-120B仅达到60百分位数。

Conclusion: 强大的推理模型应优先进行精确的问题分析而非过度探索，未来模型应强调结构化分析并减少不必要的探索。所有数据、代码和排行榜结果将公开。

Abstract: Competitive programming problems increasingly serve as valuable benchmarks to
evaluate the coding capabilities of large language models (LLMs) due to their
complexity and ease of verification. Yet, current coding benchmarks face
limitations such as lack of exceptionally challenging problems, insufficient
test case coverage, reliance on online platform APIs that limit accessibility.
To address these issues, we introduce LiveOIBench, a comprehensive benchmark
featuring 403 expert-curated Olympiad-level competitive programming problems,
each with an average of 60 expert-designed test cases. The problems are sourced
directly from 72 official Informatics Olympiads in different regions conducted
between 2023 and 2025. LiveOIBench distinguishes itself through four key
features: (1) meticulously curated high-quality tasks with detailed subtask
rubrics and extensive private test cases; (2) direct integration of elite
contestant performance data to enable informative comparison against
top-performing humans; (3) planned continuous, contamination-free updates from
newly released Olympiad problems; and (4) a self-contained evaluation system
facilitating offline and easy-to-reproduce assessments. Benchmarking 32 popular
general-purpose and reasoning LLMs, we find that GPT-5 achieves a notable
81.76th percentile, a strong result that nonetheless falls short of top human
contestant performance, who usually place above 90th. In contrast, among
open-weight reasoning models, GPT-OSS-120B achieves only a 60th percentile,
underscoring significant capability disparities from frontier closed models.
Detailed analyses indicate that robust reasoning models prioritize precise
problem analysis over excessive exploration, suggesting future models should
emphasize structured analysis and minimize unnecessary exploration. All data,
code, and leaderboard results will be made publicly available on our website.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Text-to-SQL系统在语义准确性和计算效率之间难以平衡，需要一种能够同时优化查询准确性和执行效率的方法。

Method: 采用思维模式融合的监督微调与GRPO结合，引入骨架完整性评分机制、查询延迟感知奖励系统和思维模式完成的自蒸馏过程。

Result: 在BIRD和KaggleDBQA基准测试上分别达到79.14%和54.9%的执行准确率，效率提升11%-20%。

Conclusion: 建立了一个新的Text-to-SQL系统范式，通过执行感知的强化学习有效平衡语义准确性和计算效率。

Abstract: We present HES-SQL, a novel hybrid training framework that advances
Text-to-SQL generation through the integration of thinking-mode-fused
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO).
Our approach introduces three key innovations: (1) a skeleton-completeness
scoring mechanism that enhances preference alignment between generated queries
and optimal SQL structures; (2) a query-latency-aware reward system that
incentivizes the generation of computationally efficient SQL queries; (3) a
self-distillation process for thinking-mode completion that prevents
degradation of the model's reasoning capabilities. This framework enables
hybrid thinking models to switch between reasoning and non-reasoning modes
while improving SQL query accuracy and execution efficiency.
  Experimental evaluation, conducted on MySQL 8.0 and SQLite 3.42 under
controlled single-user conditions, demonstrates that HES-SQL achieves
competitive performance with execution accuracies of 79.14\% and 54.9\% on the
BIRD and KaggleDBQA benchmarks, respectively. Query latency is measured as the
end-to-end execution time of generated queries on the DBMS, averaged over
multiple runs to mitigate variance. Efficiency gains range from 11\% to 20\%
relative to supervised baselines. Our results establish a new paradigm for
Text-to-SQL systems that effectively balances semantic accuracy with
computational efficiency through execution-informed reinforcement learning
(RL). The proposed methodology has significant implications for developing
robust natural language interfaces to databases and can be extended to broader
structured generation tasks requiring both correctness and efficiency
optimization.

Our results reveal that Titans does not always outperform established baselines
due to chunking. However, its Neural Memory component consistently improves
performance compared to attention-only models. These findings confirm the
model's innovative potential while highlighting its practical limitations and
raising questions for future research.
