TL;DR: 该论文是第一篇专门针对3D和4D世界建模与生成的综合综述，提出了标准化的定义和分类体系，填补了现有研究在3D/4D表示方法上的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有世界建模研究主要关注2D图像和视频生成方法，忽视了快速发展的3D和4D表示技术（如RGB-D、占据网格、LiDAR点云），且缺乏标准化的定义和分类体系，导致文献中的主张碎片化且不一致。

Method: 建立了精确的定义体系，提出了结构化分类法（VideoGen视频生成、OccGen占据生成、LiDARGen激光雷达生成），系统总结了适用于3D/4D场景的数据集和评估指标。

Result: 提供了首个专门针对3D和4D世界建模的全面综述，建立了标准化的分类框架，为领域发展提供了连贯的基础性参考。

Conclusion: 该综述填补了3D/4D世界建模领域的空白，为推进该领域研究提供了系统性的理论基础和实践指导，并指出了未来的研究方向和挑战。

Abstract: World modeling has become a cornerstone in AI research, enabling agents to
understand, represent, and predict the dynamic environments they inhabit. While
prior work largely emphasizes generative methods for 2D image and video data,
they overlook the rapidly growing body of work that leverages native 3D and 4D
representations such as RGB-D imagery, occupancy grids, and LiDAR point clouds
for large-scale scene modeling. At the same time, the absence of a standardized
definition and taxonomy for ``world models'' has led to fragmented and
sometimes inconsistent claims in the literature. This survey addresses these
gaps by presenting the first comprehensive review explicitly dedicated to 3D
and 4D world modeling and generation. We establish precise definitions,
introduce a structured taxonomy spanning video-based (VideoGen),
occupancy-based (OccGen), and LiDAR-based (LiDARGen) approaches, and
systematically summarize datasets and evaluation metrics tailored to 3D/4D
settings. We further discuss practical applications, identify open challenges,
and highlight promising research directions, aiming to provide a coherent and
foundational reference for advancing the field. A systematic summary of
existing literature is available at https://github.com/worldbench/survey

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: XFloodNet是一个基于深度学习的城市洪水分类框架，通过多模态特征融合和注意力机制，在三个基准数据集上取得了最先进的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统洪水检测方法依赖单模态数据和静态规则系统，无法捕捉洪水事件的动态非线性关系，现有注意力机制和集成学习方法在层次细化、跨模态特征整合和对噪声环境的适应性方面存在局限。

Method: XFloodNet包含三个核心组件：1)层次化跨模态门控注意力机制；2)异构卷积自适应多尺度注意力模块；3)级联卷积变换器特征细化技术，实现视觉和文本特征的动态对齐及多粒度交互。

Result: 在Chennai Floods、Rhine18 Floods和Harz17 Floods三个数据集上分别达到93.33%、82.24%和88.60%的F1分数，显著超越现有方法。

Conclusion: XFloodNet通过创新的深度学习技术重新定义了城市洪水分类，提供了更精确、鲁棒的洪水检测解决方案，对可持续城市发展具有重要意义。

Abstract: In an era of escalating climate change, urban flooding has emerged as a
critical challenge for sustainable cities, threatening lives, infrastructure,
and ecosystems. Traditional flood detection methods are constrained by their
reliance on unimodal data and static rule-based systems, which fail to capture
the dynamic, non-linear relationships inherent in flood events. Furthermore,
existing attention mechanisms and ensemble learning approaches exhibit
limitations in hierarchical refinement, cross-modal feature integration, and
adaptability to noisy or unstructured environments, resulting in suboptimal
flood classification performance. To address these challenges, we present
XFloodNet, a novel framework that redefines urban flood classification through
advanced deep-learning techniques. XFloodNet integrates three novel components:
(1) a Hierarchical Cross-Modal Gated Attention mechanism that dynamically
aligns visual and textual features, enabling precise multi-granularity
interactions and resolving contextual ambiguities; (2) a Heterogeneous
Convolutional Adaptive Multi-Scale Attention module, which leverages
frequency-enhanced channel attention and frequency-modulated spatial attention
to extract and prioritize discriminative flood-related features across spectral
and spatial domains; and (3) a Cascading Convolutional Transformer Feature
Refinement technique that harmonizes hierarchical features through adaptive
scaling and cascading operations, ensuring robust and noise-resistant flood
detection. We evaluate our proposed method on three benchmark datasets, such as
Chennai Floods, Rhine18 Floods, and Harz17 Floods, XFloodNet achieves
state-of-the-art F1-scores of 93.33%, 82.24%, and 88.60%, respectively,
surpassing existing methods by significant margins.

### [3] [Video Parallel Scaling: Aggregating Diverse Frame Subsets for VideoLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08016)
*Hyungjin Chung,Hyelin Nam,Jiyeon Kim,Hyojun Go,Byeongjun Park,Junho Kim,Joonseok Lee,Seongsu Ha,Byung-Hoon Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Video Parallel Scaling (VPS) 是一种推理时方法，通过并行处理视频帧子集来扩展视频大语言模型的感知带宽，无需增加上下文窗口或重新训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频大语言模型在处理更多输入帧时面临计算成本过高和长上下文性能下降的问题，需要一种高效的方法来提升时间推理能力。

Method: 运行多个并行推理流，每个流处理视频帧的不同子集，然后聚合输出概率来整合更丰富的视觉信息。

Result: 在多个模型架构和规模（2B-32B）上的实验显示，VPS 在 Video-MME 和 EventHallusion 等基准测试中显著提升性能，比其他并行方法更具扩展性。

Conclusion: VPS 提供了一个内存高效且鲁棒的框架，可增强视频大语言模型的时间推理能力，且与其他解码策略互补。

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) face a critical bottleneck:
increasing the number of input frames to capture fine-grained temporal detail
leads to prohibitive computational costs and performance degradation from long
context lengths. We introduce Video Parallel Scaling (VPS), an inference-time
method that expands a model's perceptual bandwidth without increasing its
context window. VPS operates by running multiple parallel inference streams,
each processing a unique, disjoint subset of the video's frames. By aggregating
the output probabilities from these complementary streams, VPS integrates a
richer set of visual information than is possible with a single pass. We
theoretically show that this approach effectively contracts the Chinchilla
scaling law by leveraging uncorrelated visual evidence, thereby improving
performance without additional training. Extensive experiments across various
model architectures and scales (2B-32B) on benchmarks such as Video-MME and
EventHallusion demonstrate that VPS consistently and significantly improves
performance. It scales more favorably than other parallel alternatives (e.g.
Self-consistency) and is complementary to other decoding strategies, offering a
memory-efficient and robust framework for enhancing the temporal reasoning
capabilities of VideoLLMs.

TL;DR: 提出了一种多模态立场检测框架，通过分层融合方法整合文本和视觉信息，在气候变化相关数据集上优于现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着社交媒体内容越来越多地结合文本和视觉元素，现有仅关注文本数据的方法已不足以应对现实需求，需要先进的多模态方法

Method: 使用大型语言模型提取立场相关文本摘要，结合领域感知图像字幕生成器解释视觉内容，通过专门的transformer模块联合建模文本和图像的交互

Result: 在MultiClimate数据集上达到76.2%的准确率、76.3%的精确率、76.2%的召回率和76.2%的F1分数，优于现有最先进方法

Conclusion: 提出的多模态融合框架能够有效整合不同模态信息，实现稳健的立场分类，为社交媒体多模态立场检测提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: With the rapid proliferation of information across digital platforms, stance
detection has emerged as a pivotal challenge in social media analysis. While
most of the existing approaches focus solely on textual data, real-world social
media content increasingly combines text with visual elements creating a need
for advanced multimodal methods. To address this gap, we propose a multimodal
stance detection framework that integrates textual and visual information
through a hierarchical fusion approach. Our method first employs a Large
Language Model to retrieve stance-relevant summaries from source text, while a
domain-aware image caption generator interprets visual content in the context
of the target topic. These modalities are then jointly modeled along with the
reply text, through a specialized transformer module that captures interactions
between the texts and images. The proposed modality fusion framework integrates
diverse modalities to facilitate robust stance classification. We evaluate our
approach on the MultiClimate dataset, a benchmark for climate change-related
stance detection containing aligned video frames and transcripts. We achieve
accuracy of 76.2%, precision of 76.3%, recall of 76.2% and F1-score of 76.2%,
respectively, outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches.

Na\"ive Bayes), resulting in 15 different base learners. These are aggregated
via weighted averaging to classify regions as Car, Van, Truck, Bus, or
background. Hyperparameters are optimized with the whale optimization algorithm
to balance accuracy, precision, and recall. Implemented in MATLAB R2020b with
parallel processing, SI-EDTL outperforms existing methods on the AU-AIR UAV
dataset.

*Rafał Osadnik,Pablo Gómez,Eleni Bohacek,Rickbir Bahia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了MCTED数据集，用于火星数字高程模型预测任务，包含80,898个样本，包含光学图像、DEM和掩码数据，并展示了在该数据集上训练的模型优于零样本深度估计基础模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决大规模DEM处理流程中的伪影和缺失数据问题，为机器学习应用提供高质量的火星地形数据。

Method: 开发了处理高分辨率火星正射影像和DEM对的数据处理流程，生成包含光学图像补丁、DEM补丁和掩码补丁的数据集，并使用U-Net架构进行训练。

Result: 即使很小的U-Net架构在MCTED数据集上的训练性能也优于DepthAnythingV2等深度估计基础模型的零样本性能。

Conclusion: MCTED数据集为火星地形研究提供了有价值的资源，专门训练的小模型可以超越通用基础模型，数据集和代码已开源。

Abstract: This work presents a new dataset for the Martian digital elevation model
prediction task, ready for machine learning applications called MCTED. The
dataset has been generated using a comprehensive pipeline designed to process
high-resolution Mars orthoimage and DEM pairs from Day et al., yielding a
dataset consisting of 80,898 data samples. The source images are data gathered
by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter using the CTX instrument, providing a very
diverse and comprehensive coverage of the Martian surface. Given the complexity
of the processing pipelines used in large-scale DEMs, there are often artefacts
and missing data points in the original data, for which we developed tools to
solve or mitigate their impact. We divide the processed samples into training
and validation splits, ensuring samples in both splits cover no mutual areas to
avoid data leakage. Every sample in the dataset is represented by the optical
image patch, DEM patch, and two mask patches, indicating values that were
originally missing or were altered by us. This allows future users of the
dataset to handle altered elevation regions as they please. We provide
statistical insights of the generated dataset, including the spatial
distribution of samples, the distributions of elevation values, slopes and
more. Finally, we train a small U-Net architecture on the MCTED dataset and
compare its performance to a monocular depth estimation foundation model,
DepthAnythingV2, on the task of elevation prediction. We find that even a very
small architecture trained on this dataset specifically, beats a zero-shot
performance of a depth estimation foundation model like DepthAnythingV2. We
make the dataset and code used for its generation completely open source in
public repositories.

### [7] [APML: Adaptive Probabilistic Matching Loss for Robust 3D Point Cloud Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08104)
*Sasan Sharifipour,Constantino Álvarez Casado,Mohammad Sabokrou,Miguel Bordallo López*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了适配性概率匹配损失(APML)，通过Sinkhorn迭代实现了高效的一对一匹配，解决了传统Chamfer距离和地运距离的缺陷


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有点云预测损失函数存在许多问题：Chamfer系列损失导致点括塞和覆盖不均，地运距离计算复杂度过高，且都存在非可微操作问题

Method: 利用Sinkhorn迭代在温度缩放的相似性矩阵上进行概率分配匹配，分析性计算温度以确保最小分配概率，避免手动调参

Result: APML实现了近二次方运行时间，在ShapeNet测试集和WiFi CSI到人体点云生成任务上都实现了更快收敛速度、更优的空间分布（特别是低密度区域）和收敛性能提升

Conclusion: APML损失作为一种高效、可微分的一对一匹配近似，在保持计算效率的同时提供了更好的点云预测质量，无需额外调参

Abstract: Training deep learning models for point cloud prediction tasks such as shape
completion and generation depends critically on loss functions that measure
discrepancies between predicted and ground-truth point sets. Commonly used
functions such as Chamfer Distance (CD), HyperCD, and InfoCD rely on
nearest-neighbor assignments, which often induce many-to-one correspondences,
leading to point congestion in dense regions and poor coverage in sparse
regions. These losses also involve non-differentiable operations due to index
selection, which may affect gradient-based optimization. Earth Mover Distance
(EMD) enforces one-to-one correspondences and captures structural similarity
more effectively, but its cubic computational complexity limits its practical
use. We propose the Adaptive Probabilistic Matching Loss (APML), a fully
differentiable approximation of one-to-one matching that leverages Sinkhorn
iterations on a temperature-scaled similarity matrix derived from pairwise
distances. We analytically compute the temperature to guarantee a minimum
assignment probability, eliminating manual tuning. APML achieves near-quadratic
runtime, comparable to Chamfer-based losses, and avoids non-differentiable
operations. When integrated into state-of-the-art architectures (PoinTr, PCN,
FoldingNet) on ShapeNet benchmarks and on a spatiotemporal Transformer (CSI2PC)
that generates 3D human point clouds from WiFi CSI measurements, APM loss
yields faster convergence, superior spatial distribution, especially in
low-density regions, and improved or on-par quantitative performance without
additional hyperparameter search. The code is available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出L-RPCANet轻量级框架，通过分层瓶颈结构和噪声抑制模块解决红外小目标检测中的参数轻量化和噪声鲁棒性问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度展开网络在红外小目标检测中虽然表现出色，但在参数轻量化和噪声鲁棒性方面仍面临重大挑战

Method: 基于鲁棒主成分分析构建分层瓶颈结构，使用瓶颈层减少通道维度，嵌入噪声抑制模块，并采用SENet通道注意力机制

Result: 在ISTD数据集上的大量实验验证了该方法相比RPCANet、DRPCANet和RPCANet++等最先进方法的优越性

Conclusion: L-RPCANet在保持轻量化和鲁棒性的同时实现了优异性能，代码将在GitHub上开源

Abstract: Infrared small target detection (ISTD) is one of the key techniques in image
processing. Although deep unfolding networks (DUNs) have demonstrated promising
performance in ISTD due to their model interpretability and data adaptability,
existing methods still face significant challenges in parameter lightweightness
and noise robustness. In this regard, we propose a highly lightweight framework
based on robust principal component analysis (RPCA) called L-RPCANet.
Technically, a hierarchical bottleneck structure is constructed to reduce and
increase the channel dimension in the single-channel input infrared image to
achieve channel-wise feature refinement, with bottleneck layers designed in
each module to extract features. This reduces the number of channels in feature
extraction and improves the lightweightness of network parameters. Furthermore,
a noise reduction module is embedded to enhance the robustness against complex
noise. In addition, squeeze-and-excitation networks (SENets) are leveraged as a
channel attention mechanism to focus on the varying importance of different
features across channels, thereby achieving excellent performance while
maintaining both lightweightness and robustness. Extensive experiments on the
ISTD datasets validate the superiority of our proposed method compared with
state-of-the-art methods covering RPCANet, DRPCANet, and RPCANet++. The code
will be available at https://github.com/xianchaoxiu/L-RPCANet.

### [9] [Sparse Transformer for Ultra-sparse Sampled Video Compressive Sensing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08228)
*Miao Cao,Siming Zheng,Lishun Wang,Ziyang Chen,David Brady,Xin Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了超稀疏采样(USS)策略和BSTFormer模型，通过降低数码相机的能耗来实现高速视频的压缩成像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统数码相机在高分辨率高帧率情况下能耗过高的问题，通过物理层压缩测量来降低每像素的能耗。

Method: 提出USS策略，在每个空间位置只设置一个子帧为1，其他为0。并设计BSTFormer模型，利用局部块注意力、全局稀疏注意力和全局时间注意力来处理USS测量数据。

Result: 在模拟和实际数据上的实验结果显示，该方法显著超过了之前的最先进算法，并具有比随机采样策略更高的动态范围。

Conclusion: USS策略是实现芯片上完整视频SCI系统的良好选择，具有固定曝光时间和高动态范围的优势。

Abstract: Digital cameras consume ~0.1 microjoule per pixel to capture and encode
video, resulting in a power usage of ~20W for a 4K sensor operating at 30 fps.
Imagining gigapixel cameras operating at 100-1000 fps, the current processing
model is unsustainable. To address this, physical layer compressive measurement
has been proposed to reduce power consumption per pixel by 10-100X. Video
Snapshot Compressive Imaging (SCI) introduces high frequency modulation in the
optical sensor layer to increase effective frame rate. A commonly used sampling
strategy of video SCI is Random Sampling (RS) where each mask element value is
randomly set to be 0 or 1. Similarly, image inpainting (I2P) has demonstrated
that images can be recovered from a fraction of the image pixels. Inspired by
I2P, we propose Ultra-Sparse Sampling (USS) regime, where at each spatial
location, only one sub-frame is set to 1 and all others are set to 0. We then
build a Digital Micro-mirror Device (DMD) encoding system to verify the
effectiveness of our USS strategy. Ideally, we can decompose the USS
measurement into sub-measurements for which we can utilize I2P algorithms to
recover high-speed frames. However, due to the mismatch between the DMD and
CCD, the USS measurement cannot be perfectly decomposed. To this end, we
propose BSTFormer, a sparse TransFormer that utilizes local Block attention,
global Sparse attention, and global Temporal attention to exploit the sparsity
of the USS measurement. Extensive results on both simulated and real-world data
show that our method significantly outperforms all previous state-of-the-art
algorithms. Additionally, an essential advantage of the USS strategy is its
higher dynamic range than that of the RS strategy. Finally, from the
application perspective, the USS strategy is a good choice to implement a
complete video SCI system on chip due to its fixed exposure time.

Motivation: 现有视频异常检测方法难以检测枪击和刺伤等致命事件，因为这类数据稀缺且存在伦理收集问题

Method: 使用GTA5游戏构建致命暴力数据集，提出片段级域适应策略，采用Wasserstein对抗训练来弥合合成特征与真实特征之间的差距

Result: 实验验证了GTA-Crime数据集的有效性，结合域适应策略能够持续提升真实世界致命暴力检测准确率

Conclusion: GTA-Crime为致命暴力检测提供了可行的合成数据解决方案，域适应策略成功解决了合成数据与真实数据之间的差异问题

Abstract: Recent advancements in video anomaly detection (VAD) have enabled
identification of various criminal activities in surveillance videos, but
detecting fatal incidents such as shootings and stabbings remains difficult due
to their rarity and ethical issues in data collection. Recognizing this
limitation, we introduce GTA-Crime, a fatal video anomaly dataset and
generation framework using Grand Theft Auto 5 (GTA5). Our dataset contains
fatal situations such as shootings and stabbings, captured from CCTV multiview
perspectives under diverse conditions including action types, weather, time of
day, and viewpoints. To address the rarity of such scenarios, we also release a
framework for generating these types of videos. Additionally, we propose a
snippet-level domain adaptation strategy using Wasserstein adversarial training
to bridge the gap between synthetic GTA-Crime features and real-world features
like UCF-Crime. Experimental results validate our GTA-Crime dataset and
demonstrate that incorporating GTA-Crime with our domain adaptation strategy
consistently enhances real world fatal violence detection accuracy. Our dataset
and the data generation framework are publicly available at

TL;DR: 提出RepViT-CXR方法，通过通道复制策略将单通道胸部X光图像适配到ViT架构，在TB和肺炎检测任务上达到最先进性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Vision Transformers在医学图像分析中的适配问题，因为ViT通常需要三通道输入而CXR是单通道灰度图像

Method: 采用通道复制策略将单通道CXR图像转换为ViT兼容的三通道格式，不引入额外信息损失

Result: 在三个基准数据集上表现优异：TB-CXR数据集准确率99.9%、AUC 99.9%；儿科肺炎数据集准确率99.0%、AUC 99.0%；深圳TB数据集准确率91.1%、AUC 91.2%

Conclusion: 简单有效的通道复制策略使ViT能够在灰度医学图像任务中充分发挥表征能力，为临床筛查系统部署展示了强大潜力

Abstract: Chest X-ray (CXR) imaging remains one of the most widely used diagnostic
tools for detecting pulmonary diseases such as tuberculosis (TB) and pneumonia.
Recent advances in deep learning, particularly Vision Transformers (ViTs), have
shown strong potential for automated medical image analysis. However, most ViT
architectures are pretrained on natural images and require three-channel
inputs, while CXR scans are inherently grayscale. To address this gap, we
propose RepViT-CXR, a channel replication strategy that adapts single-channel
CXR images into a ViT-compatible format without introducing additional
information loss. We evaluate RepViT-CXR on three benchmark datasets. On the
TB-CXR dataset,our method achieved an accuracy of 99.9% and an AUC of 99.9%,
surpassing prior state-of-the-art methods such as Topo-CXR (99.3% accuracy,
99.8% AUC). For the Pediatric Pneumonia dataset, RepViT-CXR obtained 99.0%
accuracy, with 99.2% recall, 99.3% precision, and an AUC of 99.0%,
outperforming strong baselines including DCNN and VGG16. On the Shenzhen TB
dataset, our approach achieved 91.1% accuracy and an AUC of 91.2%, marking a
performance improvement over previously reported CNN-based methods. These
results demonstrate that a simple yet effective channel replication strategy
allows ViTs to fully leverage their representational power on grayscale medical
imaging tasks. RepViT-CXR establishes a new state of the art for TB and
pneumonia detection from chest X-rays, showing strong potential for deployment
in real-world clinical screening systems.

Motivation: 现有研究多基于预训练或忽略了脖部疾病导致的不对称特征，需要一种能够有效判断疾病引起的左右脖缩缝不对称的方法

Method: 提出结构化磁共振成像与深度学习相结合的端到端网络，包含3D CNN编码器和对称交互Transformer(SIT)，通过左右半球特征对齐和交互分析来识别不对称特征

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效检测AD引起的结构性不对称特征，提高诊断性能和可解释性，为阻塞性脖病的预测和诊断提供了新的视角

Abstract: Structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) combined with deep learning has
achieved remarkable progress in the prediction and diagnosis of Alzheimer's
disease (AD). Existing studies have used CNN and transformer to build a
well-performing network, but most of them are based on pretraining or ignoring
the asymmetrical character caused by brain disorders. We propose an end-to-end
network for the detection of disease-based asymmetric induced by left and right
brain atrophy which consist of 3D CNN Encoder and Symmetry Interactive
Transformer (SIT). Following the inter-equal grid block fetch operation, the
corresponding left and right hemisphere features are aligned and subsequently
fed into the SIT for diagnostic analysis. SIT can help the model focus more on
the regions of asymmetry caused by structural changes, thus improving
diagnostic performance. We evaluated our method based on the ADNI dataset, and
the results show that the method achieves better diagnostic accuracy (92.5\%)
compared to several CNN methods and CNNs combined with a general transformer.
The visualization results show that our network pays more attention in regions
of brain atrophy, especially for the asymmetric pathological characteristics
induced by AD, demonstrating the interpretability and effectiveness of the
method.

that leverages the high temporal resolution of event cameras to mitigate motion
blur and enable intermediate frame prediction. Specifically, the Learnable
Double Integral (LDI) network is designed to estimate the mapping relation
between reference frames and sharp latent images. Then, we refine the coarse
results and optimize overall training efficiency by introducing a
learning-based division reconstruction module, enabling images to be converted
with varying exposure intervals. We devise an adaptive parameter-free fusion
strategy to obtain the final results, utilizing the confidence embedded in the
LDI outputs of concurrent events. A self-supervised learning framework is
proposed to enable network training with real-world blurry videos and events by
exploring the mutual constraints among blurry frames, latent images, and event
streams. We further construct a dataset with real-world blurry images and
events using a DAVIS346c camera, demonstrating the generalizability of the
proposed EVDI++ in real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments on both
synthetic and real-world datasets show that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance in video deblurring and interpolation tasks.

TL;DR: 提出HyMamba网络，通过状态空间模块统一建模光谱、跨深度和时间信息，在高光谱目标跟踪中实现最先进性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有高光谱跟踪器未能充分捕捉内在光谱信息、时间依赖性和跨深度交互，需要更有效的光谱特征建模方法

Method: 设计Spectral State Integration (SSI)模块和Hyperspectral Mamba (HSM)模块，通过三向扫描SSM同步学习空间和光谱信息，构建假彩色和高光谱输入的联合特征

Result: 在7个基准数据集上实现SOTA性能，在HOTC2020数据集上达到73.0%的AUC分数和96.3%的DP@20分数

Conclusion: HyMamba通过统一的光谱-跨深度-时间建模框架，有效解决了高光谱目标跟踪中的关键挑战，展现出卓越的性能表现

Abstract: Hyperspectral object tracking holds great promise due to the rich spectral
information and fine-grained material distinctions in hyperspectral images,
which are beneficial in challenging scenarios. While existing hyperspectral
trackers have made progress by either transforming hyperspectral data into
false-color images or incorporating modality fusion strategies, they often fail
to capture the intrinsic spectral information, temporal dependencies, and
cross-depth interactions. To address these limitations, a new hyperspectral
object tracking network equipped with Mamba (HyMamba), is proposed. It unifies
spectral, cross-depth, and temporal modeling through state space modules
(SSMs). The core of HyMamba lies in the Spectral State Integration (SSI)
module, which enables progressive refinement and propagation of spectral
features with cross-depth and temporal spectral information. Embedded within
each SSI, the Hyperspectral Mamba (HSM) module is introduced to learn spatial
and spectral information synchronously via three directional scanning SSMs.
Based on SSI and HSM, HyMamba constructs joint features from false-color and
hyperspectral inputs, and enhances them through interaction with original
spectral features extracted from raw hyperspectral images. Extensive
experiments conducted on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that HyMamba
achieves state-of-the-art performance. For instance, it achieves 73.0\% of the
AUC score and 96.3\% of the DP@20 score on the HOTC2020 dataset. The code will
be released at https://github.com/lgao001/HyMamba.

TL;DR: VLMs存在固有偏见，在回答需要关注图像特定区域的细节问题时表现不佳。本文开发了多维分析框架，研究输入数据特征如何影响VLM性能，发现图像特性和提示语细微变化会导致VLM回答方式和性能显著变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究表明VLMs在处理需要关注图像特定视觉属性的问题时，会依赖训练时学到的固有偏见而忽略视觉证据。需要系统性地研究输入数据特征如何导致这种性能差异。

Method: 使用开源VLMs，开发多维分析框架，通过改变输入参数（图像大小、物体数量、背景颜色、提示语特异性等）来研究注意力值波动和模型行为变化。

Result: 研究发现即使是图像特性和提示语特异性的微小修改，也会导致VLM回答方式和整体性能的巨大变化。

Conclusion: 需要开发方法来表征VLMs的行为变化，提高其对视觉证据的依赖程度，减少固有偏见的影响。

Abstract: Recent research on Vision Language Models (VLMs) suggests that they rely on
inherent biases learned during training to respond to questions about visual
properties of an image. These biases are exacerbated when VLMs are asked highly
specific questions that require focusing on specific areas of the image. For
example, a VLM tasked with counting stars on a modified American flag (e.g.,
with more than 50 stars) will often disregard the visual evidence and fail to
answer accurately. We build upon this research and develop a multi-dimensional
examination framework to systematically determine which characteristics of the
input data, including both the image and the accompanying prompt, lead to such
differences in performance. Using open-source VLMs, we further examine how
attention values fluctuate with varying input parameters (e.g., image size,
number of objects in the image, background color, prompt specificity). This
research aims to learn how the behavior of vision language models changes and
to explore methods for characterizing such changes. Our results suggest, among
other things, that even minor modifications in image characteristics and prompt
specificity can lead to large changes in how a VLM formulates its answer and,
subsequently, its overall performance.

Motivation: 解决3D点云广义零样本语义分割中模型偏向于训练时见过的类别的问题，特别是在3D应用中训练数据规模较小的情况下

Result: 在ScanNet v2和S3DIS等数据集上实现了最先进的性能

Conclusion: E3DPC-GZSL方法有效解决了3D点云零样本分割中的过拟合问题，通过不确定性估计和语义空间优化显著提升了模型性能

Abstract: Generalized zero-shot semantic segmentation of 3D point clouds aims to
classify each point into both seen and unseen classes. A significant challenge
with these models is their tendency to make biased predictions, often favoring
the classes encountered during training. This problem is more pronounced in 3D
applications, where the scale of the training data is typically smaller than in
image-based tasks. To address this problem, we propose a novel method called
E3DPC-GZSL, which reduces overconfident predictions towards seen classes
without relying on separate classifiers for seen and unseen data. E3DPC-GZSL
tackles the overconfidence problem by integrating an evidence-based uncertainty
estimator into a classifier. This estimator is then used to adjust prediction
probabilities using a dynamic calibrated stacking factor that accounts for
pointwise prediction uncertainty. In addition, E3DPC-GZSL introduces a novel
training strategy that improves uncertainty estimation by refining the semantic
space. This is achieved by merging learnable parameters with text-derived
features, thereby improving model optimization for unseen data. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art
performance on generalized zero-shot semantic segmentation datasets, including
ScanNet v2 and S3DIS.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的弱监督物体检测框架，解决了现有方法在伪真实框生成、基础网络设计和优化过程中的三个关键问题，在PASCAL VOC数据集上达到了狭领先水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的弱监督物体检测方法存在三个主要问题：1)伪真实框要么只覆盖区别性部分而不能捐捉整个物体，要么覆盖整个物体但无法区分相邻的同类实例；2)基础WSDDN网络缺乏背景类表征且分支间语义间隔大；3)优化过程中弃用被忽略的建议框，导致收敛慢。

Method: 提出了三个核心技术：1)热力图导向的建议框选择算法(HGPS)，利用双门限在热力图上预选建议框，使伪真实框既能捐捉整个物体又能区分相邻实例；2)弱监督基础检测网络(WSBDN)，为每个建议框增加背景类表征，并使用热力图进行预监督来缩小矩阵间的语义间隔；3)在被忽略的建议框上引入负确定性监督损失来加速收敛。

Result: 在PASCAL VOC 2007和2012数据集上进行了涉及范围广泛的实验，在VOC 2007上达到了58.5% mAP和81.8% mCorLoc，在VOC 2012上达到了55.6% mAP和80.5% mCorLoc，在弱监督物体检测方法中表现優异。

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法有效解决了弱监督物体检测中的三个关键问题，通过HGPS算法、WSBDN网络和负确定性监督损失的结合，在标准数据集上实现了狭领先的性能，为弱监督检测领域提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Weakly supervised object detection (WSOD) has attracted significant attention
in recent years, as it does not require box-level annotations. State-of-the-art
methods generally adopt a multi-module network, which employs WSDDN as the
multiple instance detection network module and multiple instance refinement
modules to refine performance. However, these approaches suffer from three key
limitations. First, existing methods tend to generate pseudo GT boxes that
either focus only on discriminative parts, failing to capture the whole object,
or cover the entire object but fail to distinguish between adjacent intra-class
instances. Second, the foundational WSDDN architecture lacks a crucial
background class representation for each proposal and exhibits a large semantic
gap between its branches. Third, prior methods discard ignored proposals during
optimization, leading to slow convergence. To address these challenges, we
first design a heatmap-guided proposal selector (HGPS) algorithm, which
utilizes dual thresholds on heatmaps to pre-select proposals, enabling pseudo
GT boxes to both capture the full object extent and distinguish between
adjacent intra-class instances. We then present a weakly supervised basic
detection network (WSBDN), which augments each proposal with a background class
representation and uses heatmaps for pre-supervision to bridge the semantic gap
between matrices. At last, we introduce a negative certainty supervision loss
on ignored proposals to accelerate convergence. Extensive experiments on the
challenging PASCAL VOC 2007 and 2012 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of
our framework. We achieve mAP/mCorLoc scores of 58.5%/81.8% on VOC 2007 and
55.6%/80.5% on VOC 2012, performing favorably against the state-of-the-art WSOD
methods. Our code is publicly available at

Abstract: Oil palm cultivation remains one of the leading causes of deforestation in
Indonesia. To better track and address this challenge, detailed and reliable
mapping is needed to support sustainability efforts and emerging regulatory
frameworks. We present an open-access geospatial dataset of oil palm
plantations and related land cover types in Indonesia, produced through expert
labeling of high-resolution satellite imagery from 2020 to 2024. The dataset
provides polygon-based, wall-to-wall annotations across a range of
agro-ecological zones and includes a hierarchical typology that distinguishes
oil palm planting stages as well as similar perennial crops. Quality was
ensured through multi-interpreter consensus and field validation. The dataset
was created using wall-to-wall digitization over large grids, making it
suitable for training and benchmarking both conventional convolutional neural
networks and newer geospatial foundation models. Released under a CC-BY

improve the accuracy of land cover types mapping. By supporting transparent
monitoring of oil palm expansion, the resource contributes to global

Conclusion: SimCroP框架能够有效捕捉稀疏放射影像中的关键病理结构，在多尺度下游任务中表现出优异性能

Abstract: Medical vision-language pre-training shows great potential in learning
representative features from massive paired radiographs and reports. However,
in computed tomography (CT) scans, the distribution of lesions which contain
intricate structures is characterized by spatial sparsity. Besides, the complex
and implicit relationships between different pathological descriptions in each
sentence of the report and their corresponding sub-regions in radiographs pose
additional challenges. In this paper, we propose a Similarity-Driven
Cross-Granularity Pre-training (SimCroP) framework on chest CTs, which combines
similarity-driven alignment and cross-granularity fusion to improve radiograph
interpretation. We first leverage multi-modal masked modeling to optimize the
encoder for understanding precise low-level semantics from radiographs. Then,
similarity-driven alignment is designed to pre-train the encoder to adaptively
select and align the correct patches corresponding to each sentence in reports.
The cross-granularity fusion module integrates multimodal information across
instance level and word-patch level, which helps the model better capture key
pathology structures in sparse radiographs, resulting in improved performance
for multi-scale downstream tasks. SimCroP is pre-trained on a large-scale
paired CT-reports dataset and validated on image classification and
segmentation tasks across five public datasets. Experimental results
demonstrate that SimCroP outperforms both cutting-edge medical self-supervised
learning methods and medical vision-language pre-training methods. Codes and
models are available at https://github.com/ToniChopp/SimCroP.

TL;DR: BTS-EE是一种针对早期退出CNN的增强训练方案，通过顺序训练和校准分支来解决协方差偏移问题，在保持精度的同时显著减少计算量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实时图像分类在资源受限平台上需要平衡准确性和延迟/功耗。传统早期退出策略存在协方差偏移问题，即下游分支在训练时处理全部样本，而推理时只处理困难样本，限制了效率-准确性的权衡。

Method: 提出BTS-EE顺序训练方法：1）逐层训练和校准分支，使分支训练与推理时数据分布对齐；2）采用基于1D卷积的轻量级分支架构；3）提出类精度边际（CPM）校准方法，实现每类阈值调优。

Result: 在CINIC-10数据集和ResNet18骨干网络上，BTS-EE在64种配置中均优于非增强训练，计算量减少高达45%，精度仅下降2%。

Conclusion: 该方法扩展了CNN在实时图像处理系统中的部署设计空间，为工业检测、嵌入式视觉和无人机监控等应用提供了实用的效率提升。

Abstract: Real-time image classification on resource-constrained platforms demands
inference methods that balance accuracy with strict latency and power budgets.
Early-exit strategies address this need by attaching auxiliary classifiers to
intermediate layers of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), allowing "easy"
samples to terminate inference early. However, conventional training of early
exits introduces a covariance shift: downstream branches are trained on full
datasets, while at inference they process only the harder, non-exited samples.
This mismatch limits efficiency--accuracy trade-offs in practice. We introduce
the Boosted Training Scheme for Early Exits (BTS-EE), a sequential training
approach that aligns branch training with inference-time data distributions.
Each branch is trained and calibrated before the next, ensuring robustness
under selective inference conditions. To further support embedded deployment,
we propose a lightweight branch architecture based on 1D convolutions and a
Class Precision Margin (CPM) calibration method that enables per-class
threshold tuning for reliable exit decisions. Experiments on the CINIC-10
dataset with a ResNet18 backbone demonstrate that BTS-EE consistently
outperforms non-boosted training across 64 configurations, achieving up to 45
percent reduction in computation with only 2 percent accuracy degradation.
These results expand the design space for deploying CNNs in real-time image
processing systems, offering practical efficiency gains for applications such
as industrial inspection, embedded vision, and UAV-based monitoring.

Abstract: Accurate and early diagnosis of malignant melanoma is critical for improving
patient outcomes. While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown promise
in dermoscopic image analysis, they often neglect clinical metadata and require
extensive preprocessing. Vision-language models (VLMs) offer a multimodal
alternative but struggle to capture clinical specificity when trained on
general-domain data. To address this, we propose a retrieval-augmented VLM
framework that incorporates semantically similar patient cases into the
diagnostic prompt. Our method enables informed predictions without fine-tuning
and significantly improves classification accuracy and error correction over
conventional baselines. These results demonstrate that retrieval-augmented
prompting provides a robust strategy for clinical decision support.

mitigating the impact of accumulated errors. Additionally, by incorporating
attention mechanisms applied to the raw features, it thereby mitigates the
impact of accumulated errors. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate
that InsFusion is compatible with various advanced baseline methods and
delivers new state-of-the-art performance for 3D object detection.

Abstract: We propose a novel and general framework to disentangle video data into its
dynamic motion and static content components. Our proposed method is a
self-supervised pipeline with less assumptions and inductive biases than
previous works: it utilizes a transformer-based architecture to jointly
generate flexible implicit features for frame-wise motion and clip-wise
content, and incorporates a low-bitrate vector quantization as an information
bottleneck to promote disentanglement and form a meaningful discrete motion
space. The bitrate-controlled latent motion and content are used as conditional
inputs to a denoising diffusion model to facilitate self-supervised
representation learning. We validate our disentangled representation learning
framework on real-world talking head videos with motion transfer and
auto-regressive motion generation tasks. Furthermore, we also show that our
method can generalize to other types of video data, such as pixel sprites of 2D
cartoon characters. Our work presents a new perspective on self-supervised
learning of disentangled video representations, contributing to the broader
field of video analysis and generation.

Abstract: Vision-based 3D semantic occupancy prediction is a critical task in 3D vision
that integrates volumetric 3D reconstruction with semantic understanding.
Existing methods, however, often rely on modular pipelines. These modules are
typically optimized independently or use pre-configured inputs, leading to
cascading errors. In this paper, we address this limitation by designing a
novel causal loss that enables holistic, end-to-end supervision of the modular
2D-to-3D transformation pipeline. Grounded in the principle of 2D-to-3D
semantic causality, this loss regulates the gradient flow from 3D voxel
representations back to the 2D features. Consequently, it renders the entire
pipeline differentiable, unifying the learning process and making previously
non-trainable components fully learnable. Building on this principle, we
propose the Semantic Causality-Aware 2D-to-3D Transformation, which comprises
three components guided by our causal loss: Channel-Grouped Lifting for
adaptive semantic mapping, Learnable Camera Offsets for enhanced robustness
against camera perturbations, and Normalized Convolution for effective feature
propagation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the Occ3D benchmark, demonstrating significant
robustness to camera perturbations and improved 2D-to-3D semantic consistency.

Result: 在带可见车牌的车辙图像数据集上，方法 consistently优于自编码器(AE)、生成对抗网络(GAN)和基于流的方法(FB)。与相同深度的AE相比，PSNR提升约20%，NMSE降低约50%，SSIM提升1%，参数仅增加约1%

Conclusion: VRAE架构通过输入感知特征注入机制，在保持参数效率的同时显著提升了交通监控图像增强性能，为车牌识别系统提供了有效的预处理解决方案

Abstract: In real-world traffic surveillance, vehicle images captured under adverse
weather, poor lighting, or high-speed motion often suffer from severe noise and
blur. Such degradations significantly reduce the accuracy of license plate
recognition systems, especially when the plate occupies only a small region
within the full vehicle image. Restoring these degraded images a fast realtime
manner is thus a crucial pre-processing step to enhance recognition
performance. In this work, we propose a Vertical Residual Autoencoder (VRAE)
architecture designed for the image enhancement task in traffic surveillance.
The method incorporates an enhancement strategy that employs an auxiliary
block, which injects input-aware features at each encoding stage to guide the
representation learning process, enabling better general information
preservation throughout the network compared to conventional autoencoders.
Experiments on a vehicle image dataset with visible license plates demonstrate
that our method consistently outperforms Autoencoder (AE), Generative
Adversarial Network (GAN), and Flow-Based (FB) approaches. Compared with AE at
the same depth, it improves PSNR by about 20\%, reduces NMSE by around 50\%,
and enhances SSIM by 1\%, while requiring only a marginal increase of roughly
1\% in parameters.

Conclusion: SCFusion有效缓解了传统BEV投影的局限性，为多视角目标检测和跟踪提供了鲁棒且准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-View Multi-Object Tracking (MVMOT) is essential for applications such
as surveillance, autonomous driving, and sports analytics. However, maintaining
consistent object identities across multiple cameras remains challenging due to
viewpoint changes, lighting variations, and occlusions, which often lead to
tracking errors.Recent methods project features from multiple cameras into a
unified Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) space to improve robustness against occlusion.
However, this projection introduces feature distortion and non-uniform density
caused by variations in object scale with distance. These issues degrade the
quality of the fused representation and reduce detection and tracking
accuracy.To address these problems, we propose SCFusion, a framework that
combines three techniques to improve multi-view feature integration. First, it
applies a sparse transformation to avoid unnatural interpolation during
projection. Next, it performs density-aware weighting to adaptively fuse
features based on spatial confidence and camera distance. Finally, it
introduces a multi-view consistency loss that encourages each camera to learn
discriminative features independently before fusion.Experiments show that
SCFusion achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching an IDF1 score of 95.9%
on WildTrack and a MODP of 89.2% on MultiviewX, outperforming the baseline
method TrackTacular. These results demonstrate that SCFusion effectively
mitigates the limitations of conventional BEV projection and provides a robust
and accurate solution for multi-view object detection and tracking.

TL;DR: LD-ViCE是一个基于潜在扩散模型的视频反事实解释框架，通过在潜在空间中操作降低计算成本，生成真实且可解释的反事实解释，在多个视频数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频AI系统在安全关键领域应用日益广泛，但现有解释技术存在时间连贯性不足、鲁棒性差、缺乏因果洞察等问题，且现有反事实解释方法通常不结合目标模型指导，降低了语义保真度和实用性。

Method: LD-ViCE使用最先进的扩散模型在潜在空间中操作，通过额外的细化步骤生成真实且可解释的反事实解释，显著降低了生成解释的计算成本。

Result: 在三个不同的视频数据集（EchoNet-Dynamic、FERV39k、Something-Something V2）上，LD-ViCE相比现有最先进方法，R2分数提升高达68%，同时推理时间减少一半。定性分析证实其生成语义有意义且时间连贯的解释。

Conclusion: LD-ViCE代表了在安全关键领域可信AI部署的重要进展，为理解视频AI模型行为提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: Video-based AI systems are increasingly adopted in safety-critical domains
such as autonomous driving and healthcare. However, interpreting their
decisions remains challenging due to the inherent spatiotemporal complexity of
video data and the opacity of deep learning models. Existing explanation
techniques often suffer from limited temporal coherence, insufficient
robustness, and a lack of actionable causal insights. Current counterfactual
explanation methods typically do not incorporate guidance from the target
model, reducing semantic fidelity and practical utility. We introduce Latent
Diffusion for Video Counterfactual Explanations (LD-ViCE), a novel framework
designed to explain the behavior of video-based AI models. Compared to previous
approaches, LD-ViCE reduces the computational costs of generating explanations
by operating in latent space using a state-of-the-art diffusion model, while
producing realistic and interpretable counterfactuals through an additional
refinement step. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of LD-ViCE
across three diverse video datasets, including EchoNet-Dynamic (cardiac
ultrasound), FERV39k (facial expression), and Something-Something V2 (action
recognition). LD-ViCE outperforms a recent state-of-the-art method, achieving
an increase in R2 score of up to 68% while reducing inference time by half.
Qualitative analysis confirms that LD-ViCE generates semantically meaningful
and temporally coherent explanations, offering valuable insights into the
target model behavior. LD-ViCE represents a valuable step toward the
trustworthy deployment of AI in safety-critical domains.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的球面布朗威桥扩散模型(SBDM)，用于预测个体化的高分辨率直角层厚度轨迹，在ADNI和OASIS数据集上实现了更低的预测错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确预测个体化的高分辨率直角层厚度轨迹对检测神经退行性过程至关重要，但由于大脑直角层的复杂非欧几里形状和多模态数据整合的需求，这是一项具有挑战性的任务。

Method: 提出了球面布朗威桥扩散模型(SBDM)，使用双向条件布朗威桥扩散过程预测注册直角层表面的顶点级CTh轨迹，包括新的去噪模型条件球面U-Net(CoS-UNet)，结合球面卷积和密集交叉注意力机制来整合直角层表面和表格条件数据。

Result: 与之前方法相比，SBDM在ADNI和OASIS纵向数据集上实现了显著更低的预测错误。同时还能够生成个体的事实和反事实CTh轨迹，为探索直角层发育的假设场景提供新框架。

Conclusion: SBDM为直角层厚度预测提供了一种有效的解决方案，能够处理复杂的非欧几里数据结构并整合多模态信息，在神经退行性疾病的早期诊断和干预策略方面具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: Accurate forecasting of individualized, high-resolution cortical thickness
(CTh) trajectories is essential for detecting subtle cortical changes,
providing invaluable insights into neurodegenerative processes and facilitating
earlier and more precise intervention strategies. However, CTh forecasting is a
challenging task due to the intricate non-Euclidean geometry of the cerebral
cortex and the need to integrate multi-modal data for subject-specific
predictions. To address these challenges, we introduce the Spherical Brownian
Bridge Diffusion Model (SBDM). Specifically, we propose a bidirectional
conditional Brownian bridge diffusion process to forecast CTh trajectories at
the vertex level of registered cortical surfaces. Our technical contribution
includes a new denoising model, the conditional spherical U-Net (CoS-UNet),
which combines spherical convolutions and dense cross-attention to integrate
cortical surfaces and tabular conditions seamlessly. Compared to previous
approaches, SBDM achieves significantly reduced prediction errors, as
demonstrated by our experiments based on longitudinal datasets from the ADNI
and OASIS. Additionally, we demonstrate SBDM's ability to generate individual
factual and counterfactual CTh trajectories, offering a novel framework for
exploring hypothetical scenarios of cortical development.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出HyperTTA框架，通过多退化数据集、光谱-空间Transformer分类器和轻量级测试时自适应策略，提升高光谱图像分类在多种退化条件下的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱图像分类模型对噪声、模糊、压缩和大气效应等多种现实世界退化引起的分布偏移高度敏感，需要提高模型在多样化退化条件下的鲁棒性。

Method: 1) 构建包含9种代表性退化的多退化高光谱数据集；2) 设计带有多层次感受野机制和标签平滑正则化的光谱-空间Transformer分类器；3) 提出置信度感知的熵最小化LayerNorm适配器(CELA)，仅更新LayerNorm层的仿射参数。

Result: 在两个基准数据集上的大量实验表明，HyperTTA在广泛的退化场景中优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: HyperTTA框架通过其分类主干和提出的TTA方案，有效提升了高光谱图像分类在各种退化条件下的鲁棒性和适应性。

Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification models are highly sensitive to
distribution shifts caused by various real-world degradations such as noise,
blur, compression, and atmospheric effects. To address this challenge, we
propose HyperTTA, a unified framework designed to enhance model robustness
under diverse degradation conditions. Specifically, we first construct a
multi-degradation hyperspectral dataset that systematically simulates nine
representative types of degradations, providing a comprehensive benchmark for
robust classification evaluation. Based on this, we design a spectral-spatial
transformer classifier (SSTC) enhanced with a multi-level receptive field
mechanism and label smoothing regularization to jointly capture multi-scale
spatial context and improve generalization. Furthermore, HyperTTA incorporates
a lightweight test-time adaptation (TTA) strategy, the confidence-aware
entropy-minimized LayerNorm adapter (CELA), which updates only the affine
parameters of LayerNorm layers by minimizing prediction entropy on
high-confidence unlabeled target samples. This confidence-aware adaptation
prevents unreliable updates from noisy predictions, enabling robust and dynamic
adaptation without access to source data or target annotations. Extensive
experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that HyperTTA outperforms
existing baselines across a wide range of degradation scenarios, validating the
effectiveness of both its classification backbone and the proposed TTA scheme.
Code will be made available publicly.

Result: 在单词提示段落中，检测和分割的可用面具率超过90%，准确度超过85%；塞充占总运行时间的60-75%

Conclusion: 提供了一个透明、可靠的模式，通过明确的拦截标准和运维实践提高了物体替换、场景增强和删除的可靠性

Abstract: Prompt-driven image analysis converts a single natural-language instruction
into multiple steps: locate, segment, edit, and describe. We present a
practical case study of a unified pipeline that combines open-vocabulary
detection, promptable segmentation, text-conditioned inpainting, and
vision-language description into a single workflow. The system works end to end
from a single prompt, retains intermediate artifacts for transparent debugging
(such as detections, masks, overlays, edited images, and before and after
composites), and provides the same functionality through an interactive UI and
a scriptable CLI for consistent, repeatable runs. We highlight integration
choices that reduce brittleness, including threshold adjustments, mask
inspection with light morphology, and resource-aware defaults. In a small,
single-word prompt segment, detection and segmentation produced usable masks in
over 90% of cases with an accuracy above 85% based on our criteria. On a
high-end GPU, inpainting makes up 60 to 75% of total runtime under typical
guidance and sampling settings, which highlights the need for careful tuning.
The study offers implementation-guided advice on thresholds, mask tightness,
and diffusion parameters, and details version pinning, artifact logging, and
seed control to support replay. Our contribution is a transparent, reliable
pattern for assembling modern vision and multimodal models behind a single
prompt, with clear guardrails and operational practices that improve
reliability in object replacement, scene augmentation, and removal.

Motivation: 现有的Mamba视觉模型主要关注网络架构和扫描路径，对SSM模块本身关注不足。为了挖掘SSM的潜力，需要改进其计算过程。

Method: 在SSM中应用一阶保持条件，推导新的离散化形式，并分析累积误差。通过引入token相关性来增强原始Mamba模块。

Result: 在五个基准数据集上，FSSM提升了MambaIR的性能，且不增加额外参数，超越了当前的轻量级SR方法，达到了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: FSSM通过改进SSM的计算过程，有效提升了轻量级超分辨率任务的性能，证明了SSM模块优化的重要性。

Abstract: State space models (SSMs), particularly Mamba, have shown promise in NLP
tasks and are increasingly applied to vision tasks. However, most Mamba-based
vision models focus on network architecture and scan paths, with little
attention to the SSM module. In order to explore the potential of SSMs, we
modified the calculation process of SSM without increasing the number of
parameters to improve the performance on lightweight super-resolution tasks. In
this paper, we introduce the First-order State Space Model (FSSM) to improve
the original Mamba module, enhancing performance by incorporating token
correlations. We apply a first-order hold condition in SSMs, derive the new
discretized form, and analyzed cumulative error. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that FSSM improves the performance of MambaIR on five benchmark
datasets without additionally increasing the number of parameters, and
surpasses current lightweight SR methods, achieving state-of-the-art results.

Method: 系统分类UOD挑战为五大领域，分析从传统图像处理到现代深度学习方法的演进，探索LVLMs的多模态能力，并通过案例研究(使用DALL-E 3生成合成数据集和微调Florence-2 LVLM)验证应用潜力。

Result: 识别出三个关键发现：当前UOD方法对动态水下环境中的图像退化和小目标检测不足；LVLMs合成数据生成有潜力但需要改进真实性；LVLMs在UOD中前景广阔但实时应用仍需优化技术研究。

Conclusion: LVLMs为水下目标检测带来了新的机遇，但在实际应用中仍需解决数据真实性、模型优化和实时性能等关键问题，需要进一步的研究和发展。

Abstract: Underwater object detection (UOD) is vital to diverse marine applications,
including oceanographic research, underwater robotics, and marine conservation.
However, UOD faces numerous challenges that compromise its performance. Over
the years, various methods have been proposed to address these issues, but they
often fail to fully capture the complexities of underwater environments. This
review systematically categorizes UOD challenges into five key areas: Image
quality degradation, target-related issues, data-related challenges,
computational and processing constraints, and limitations in detection
methodologies. To address these challenges, we analyze the progression from
traditional image processing and object detection techniques to modern
approaches. Additionally, we explore the potential of large vision-language
models (LVLMs) in UOD, leveraging their multi-modal capabilities demonstrated
in other domains. We also present case studies, including synthetic dataset
generation using DALL-E 3 and fine-tuning Florence-2 LVLM for UOD. This review
identifies three key insights: (i) Current UOD methods are insufficient to
fully address challenges like image degradation and small object detection in
dynamic underwater environments. (ii) Synthetic data generation using LVLMs
shows potential for augmenting datasets but requires further refinement to
ensure realism and applicability. (iii) LVLMs hold significant promise for UOD,
but their real-time application remains under-explored, requiring further
research on optimization techniques.

Abstract: The robustness of contrastive self-supervised learning (CSSL) for imbalanced
datasets is largely unexplored. CSSL usually makes use of \emph{multi-view}
assumptions to learn discriminatory features via similar and dissimilar data
samples. CSSL works well on balanced datasets, but does not generalize well for
imbalanced datasets. In a very recent paper, as part of future work, Yann LeCun
pointed out that the self-supervised multiview framework can be extended to
cases involving \emph{more than two views}. Taking a cue from this insight we
propose a theoretical justification based on the concept of \emph{mutual
information} to support the \emph{more than two views} objective and apply it
to the problem of dataset imbalance in self-supervised learning. The proposed
method helps extract representative characteristics of the tail classes by
segregating between \emph{intra} and \emph{inter} discriminatory
characteristics. We introduce a loss function that helps us to learn better
representations by filtering out extreme features. Experimental evaluation on a
variety of self-supervised frameworks (both contrastive and non-contrastive)
also prove that the \emph{more than two view} objective works well for
imbalanced datasets. We achieve a new state-of-the-art accuracy in
self-supervised imbalanced dataset classification (2\% improvement in
Cifar10-LT using Resnet-18, 5\% improvement in Cifar100-LT using Resnet-18, 3\%
improvement in Imagenet-LT (1k) using Resnet-50).

Motivation: 现有视频幻觉基准过度依赖人工分类，忽略了人类自然理解视频的感知过程，需要更系统化的评估方法。

Method: 使用问答框架（二元和多项选择），包含目标和陷阱实例，采用自底向上方法评估基础对象、粗到细的主体特征以及主体-动作对。

Result: 大型视频模型在识别基础对象和特征方面表现优异，但在处理细节或对齐多主体动作时幻觉显著增加。

Conclusion: MESH提供了一个有效且全面的视频幻觉识别方法，能够系统性评估LVMs的幻觉问题。

Abstract: Large Video Models (LVMs) build on the semantic capabilities of Large
Language Models (LLMs) and vision modules by integrating temporal information
to better understand dynamic video content. Despite their progress, LVMs are
prone to hallucinations-producing inaccurate or irrelevant descriptions.
Current benchmarks for video hallucination depend heavily on manual
categorization of video content, neglecting the perception-based processes
through which humans naturally interpret videos. We introduce MESH, a benchmark
designed to evaluate hallucinations in LVMs systematically. MESH uses a
Question-Answering framework with binary and multi-choice formats incorporating
target and trap instances. It follows a bottom-up approach, evaluating basic
objects, coarse-to-fine subject features, and subject-action pairs, aligning
with human video understanding. We demonstrate that MESH offers an effective
and comprehensive approach for identifying hallucinations in videos. Our
evaluations show that while LVMs excel at recognizing basic objects and
features, their susceptibility to hallucinations increases markedly when
handling fine details or aligning multiple actions involving various subjects
in longer videos.

Conclusion: 该方法能够生成紧凑但时间敏感的视频表征，在对称动作识别任务上表现优异，并能提升其他视频模型的性能

Abstract: Our objective is to develop compact video representations that are sensitive
to visual change over time. To measure such time-sensitivity, we introduce a
new task: chiral action recognition, where one needs to distinguish between a
pair of temporally opposite actions, such as "opening vs. closing a door",
"approaching vs. moving away from something", "folding vs. unfolding paper",
etc. Such actions (i) occur frequently in everyday life, (ii) require
understanding of simple visual change over time (in object state, size, spatial
position, count . . . ), and (iii) are known to be poorly represented by many
video embeddings. Our goal is to build time aware video representations which
offer linear separability between these chiral pairs. To that end, we propose a
self-supervised adaptation recipe to inject time-sensitivity into a sequence of
frozen image features. Our model is based on an auto-encoder with a latent
space with inductive bias inspired by perceptual straightening. We show that
this results in a compact but time-sensitive video representation for the
proposed task across three datasets: Something-Something, EPIC-Kitchens, and
Charade. Our method (i) outperforms much larger video models pre-trained on
large-scale video datasets, and (ii) leads to an improvement in classification
performance on standard benchmarks when combined with these existing models.

Conclusion: 多模态特定的校准策略对于可靠的大规模文本到图像评估至关重要，MMB方法为解决评估模型的偏见和不确定性提供了有前景的途径

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are increasingly used to evaluate
text-to-image (TTI) generation systems, providing automated judgments based on
visual and textual context. However, these "judge" models often suffer from
biases, overconfidence, and inconsistent performance across diverse image
domains. While prompt ensembling has shown promise for mitigating these issues
in unimodal, text-only settings, our experiments reveal that standard
ensembling methods fail to generalize effectively for TTI tasks. To address
these limitations, we propose a new multimodal-aware method called Multimodal
Mixture-of-Bayesian Prompt Ensembles (MMB). Our method uses a Bayesian prompt
ensemble approach augmented by image clustering, allowing the judge to
dynamically assign prompt weights based on the visual characteristics of each
sample. We show that MMB improves accuracy in pairwise preference judgments and
greatly enhances calibration, making it easier to gauge the judge's true
uncertainty. In evaluations on two TTI benchmarks, HPSv2 and MJBench, MMB
outperforms existing baselines in alignment with human annotations and
calibration across varied image content. Our findings highlight the importance
of multimodal-specific strategies for judge calibration and suggest a promising
path forward for reliable large-scale TTI evaluation.

Abstract: Significant advancements in AI-driven multimodal medical image diagnosis have
led to substantial improvements in ophthalmic disease identification in recent
years. However, acquiring paired multimodal ophthalmic images remains
prohibitively expensive. While fundus photography is simple and cost-effective,
the limited availability of OCT data and inherent modality imbalance hinder
further progress. Conventional approaches that rely solely on fundus or textual
features often fail to capture fine-grained spatial information, as each
imaging modality provides distinct cues about lesion predilection sites. In
this study, we propose a novel unpaired multimodal framework \UOPSL that
utilizes extensive OCT-derived spatial priors to dynamically identify
predilection sites, enhancing fundus image-based disease recognition. Our
approach bridges unpaired fundus and OCTs via extended disease text
descriptions. Initially, we employ contrastive learning on a large corpus of
unpaired OCT and fundus images while simultaneously learning the predilection
sites matrix in the OCT latent space. Through extensive optimization, this
matrix captures lesion localization patterns within the OCT feature space.
During the fine-tuning or inference phase of the downstream classification task
based solely on fundus images, where paired OCT data is unavailable, we
eliminate OCT input and utilize the predilection sites matrix to assist in
fundus image classification learning. Extensive experiments conducted on 9
diverse datasets across 28 critical categories demonstrate that our framework
outperforms existing benchmarks.

Abstract: Human-Centric Video Generation (HCVG) methods seek to synthesize human videos
from multimodal inputs, including text, image, and audio. Existing methods
struggle to effectively coordinate these heterogeneous modalities due to two
challenges: the scarcity of training data with paired triplet conditions and
the difficulty of collaborating the sub-tasks of subject preservation and
audio-visual sync with multimodal inputs. In this work, we present HuMo, a
unified HCVG framework for collaborative multimodal control. For the first
challenge, we construct a high-quality dataset with diverse and paired text,
reference images, and audio. For the second challenge, we propose a two-stage
progressive multimodal training paradigm with task-specific strategies. For the
subject preservation task, to maintain the prompt following and visual
generation abilities of the foundation model, we adopt the minimal-invasive
image injection strategy. For the audio-visual sync task, besides the commonly
adopted audio cross-attention layer, we propose a focus-by-predicting strategy
that implicitly guides the model to associate audio with facial regions. For
joint learning of controllabilities across multimodal inputs, building on
previously acquired capabilities, we progressively incorporate the audio-visual
sync task. During inference, for flexible and fine-grained multimodal control,
we design a time-adaptive Classifier-Free Guidance strategy that dynamically
adjusts guidance weights across denoising steps. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that HuMo surpasses specialized state-of-the-art methods in
sub-tasks, establishing a unified framework for collaborative
multimodal-conditioned HCVG. Project Page:

Abstract: Isolated Sign Language Recognition (ISLR) is challenged by gestures that are
morphologically similar yet semantically distinct, a problem rooted in the
complex interplay between hand shape and motion trajectory. Existing methods,
often relying on a single reference frame, struggle to resolve this geometric
ambiguity. This paper introduces Dual-SignLanguageNet (DSLNet), a
dual-reference, dual-stream architecture that decouples and models gesture
morphology and trajectory in separate, complementary coordinate systems. Our
approach utilizes a wrist-centric frame for view-invariant shape analysis and a

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出ViewSparsifier方法，通过多视角图像分析解决植物表型分析中的年龄预测和叶片计数问题，在ACM Multimedia 2025挑战赛中获胜。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的单视角分类或回归模型无法充分捕捉植物表型特征的所有信息，影响植物健康评估和收获预测的准确性。多视角数据集存在显著重叠和冗余信息，需要开发能够学习视角不变嵌入的方法。

Method: 提出ViewSparsifier方法，采用随机选择24个视角（选择向量）来学习视角不变嵌入。还尝试了在所有5个高度级别（共120个视角）进行随机化视角选择（选择矩阵）作为未来研究方向。

Result: ViewSparsifier方法在Plant Age Prediction和Leaf Count Estimation两个任务中都获得了优胜。

Conclusion: 多视角学习方法能有效解决植物表型分析中的信息冗余问题，随机视角选择策略是学习视角不变嵌入的有效方法，为未来研究提供了重要方向。

Abstract: Plant phenotyping involves analyzing observable characteristics of plants to
better understand their growth, health, and development. In the context of deep
learning, this analysis is often approached through single-view classification
or regression models. However, these methods often fail to capture all
information required for accurate estimation of target phenotypic traits, which
can adversely affect plant health assessment and harvest readiness prediction.
To address this, the Growth Modelling (GroMo) Grand Challenge at ACM Multimedia
2025 provides a multi-view dataset featuring multiple plants and two tasks:
Plant Age Prediction and Leaf Count Estimation. Each plant is photographed from
multiple heights and angles, leading to significant overlap and redundancy in
the captured information. To learn view-invariant embeddings, we incorporate 24
views, referred to as the selection vector, in a random selection. Our
ViewSparsifier approach won both tasks. For further improvement and as a
direction for future research, we also experimented with randomized view
selection across all five height levels (120 views total), referred to as
selection matrices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 硅中毒在南亚和东南亚是严重公共健康问题，早期皮肤表现容易误诊，特别是在农村地区皮肤科医生缺乏，需要自动化诊断解决方案

Method: 构建包含20类超11000张图像的数据集，比较CNN和Transformer模型，集成LIME和Grad-CAM可解释性技术，开发网页诊断工具

Result: Swin Transformer模型表现最佳（86%准确率），显著超过CNN模型，可解释性可视化确认模型关注痕迹区域，外部验证表现良好

Conclusion: 该框架证明深度学习可以实现无侵入、易访问和可解释的硅中毒诊断，在资源稀缺地区作为实用诊断工具，支持早期发现和及时干预

Abstract: Background: Arsenicosis is a serious public health concern in South and
Southeast Asia, primarily caused by long-term consumption of
arsenic-contaminated water. Its early cutaneous manifestations are clinically
significant but often underdiagnosed, particularly in rural areas with limited
access to dermatologists. Automated, image-based diagnostic solutions can
support early detection and timely interventions.
  Methods: In this study, we propose an end-to-end framework for arsenicosis
diagnosis using mobile phone-captured skin images. A dataset comprising 20
classes and over 11000 images of arsenic-induced and other dermatological
conditions was curated. Multiple deep learning architectures, including
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformer-based models, were
benchmarked for arsenicosis detection. Model interpretability was integrated
via LIME and Grad-CAM, while deployment feasibility was demonstrated through a
web-based diagnostic tool.
  Results: Transformer-based models significantly outperformed CNNs, with the
Swin Transformer achieving the best results (86\\% accuracy). LIME and Grad-CAM
visualizations confirmed that the models attended to lesion-relevant regions,
increasing clinical transparency and aiding in error analysis. The framework
also demonstrated strong performance on external validation samples, confirming
its ability to generalize beyond the curated dataset.
  Conclusion: The proposed framework demonstrates the potential of deep
learning for non-invasive, accessible, and explainable diagnosis of arsenicosis
from mobile-acquired images. By enabling reliable image-based screening, it can
serve as a practical diagnostic aid in rural and resource-limited communities,
where access to dermatologists is scarce, thereby supporting early detection
and timely intervention.

Motivation: 多模态模型在自然图像分割中表现优异，但在医学领域表现不佳，主要原因是文本提示与医学视觉特征间的语义鸿沟以及由此产生的特征分散问题

Method: 提出期望最大化(EM)聚合机制动态聚类特征为紧凑语义中心，以及文本引导像素解码器利用领域不变文本知识指导深度视觉表示

Result: 在公共心脏和眼底数据集上的大量实验表明，该方法在多个领域泛化基准测试中 consistently 超越现有SOTA方法

Conclusion: 通过语义聚合视角解决医学多模态分割问题，两种机制的协同作用显著提升了模型的泛化能力

Abstract: Multimodal models have achieved remarkable success in natural image
segmentation, yet they often underperform when applied to the medical domain.
Through extensive study, we attribute this performance gap to the challenges of
multimodal fusion, primarily the significant semantic gap between abstract
textual prompts and fine-grained medical visual features, as well as the
resulting feature dispersion. To address these issues, we revisit the problem
from the perspective of semantic aggregation. Specifically, we propose an
Expectation-Maximization (EM) Aggregation mechanism and a Text-Guided Pixel
Decoder. The former mitigates feature dispersion by dynamically clustering
features into compact semantic centers to enhance cross-modal correspondence.
The latter is designed to bridge the semantic gap by leveraging
domain-invariant textual knowledge to effectively guide deep visual
representations. The synergy between these two mechanisms significantly
improves the model's generalization ability. Extensive experiments on public
cardiac and fundus datasets demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms existing SOTA approaches across multiple domain generalization
benchmarks.

TL;DR: GraphTopoNet是一个图学习框架，用于融合异质监督并通过蒙特卡洛dropout显式建模不确定性，显著提升格陵兰冰床地图精度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 格陵兰冰下地形图的精确测绘对海平面预测至关重要，但雷达观测数据稀疏且分布不均，需要新的方法来处理这种不确定性数据

Method: 构建基于地表观测数据（高程、速度、质量平衡）的空间图，添加梯度特征和多项式趋势来捕捉局部变异性和宏观结构，采用混合损失函数结合置信度加权的雷达监督和动态平衡正则化

Result: 在格陵兰三个子区域的应用中，GraphTopoNet比插值、卷积和图基线方法表现更好，误差降低高达60%，同时保留了精细的冰川特征

Conclusion: GraphTopoNet展示了图机器学习如何将稀疏、不确定的地球物理观测转化为大陆尺度的可操作知识，提高了操作建模的可靠性

Abstract: Accurate maps of Greenland's subglacial bed are essential for sea-level
projections, but radar observations are sparse and uneven. We introduce
GraphTopoNet, a graph-learning framework that fuses heterogeneous supervision
and explicitly models uncertainty via Monte Carlo dropout. Spatial graphs built
from surface observables (elevation, velocity, mass balance) are augmented with
gradient features and polynomial trends to capture both local variability and
broad structure. To handle data gaps, we employ a hybrid loss that combines
confidence-weighted radar supervision with dynamically balanced regularization.
Applied to three Greenland subregions, GraphTopoNet outperforms interpolation,
convolutional, and graph-based baselines, reducing error by up to 60 percent
while preserving fine-scale glacial features. The resulting bed maps improve
reliability for operational modeling, supporting agencies engaged in climate
forecasting and policy. More broadly, GraphTopoNet shows how graph machine
learning can convert sparse, uncertain geophysical observations into actionable
knowledge at continental scale.

Conclusion: 该方法能够显著减轻医疗专业人员在复杂医学图像5206割任务中的手动工作负担，提高效率且支持多种医疗应用场景

Abstract: The objective of this paper is to significantly reduce the manual workload
required from medical professionals in complex 3D segmentation tasks that
cannot be yet fully automated. For instance, in radiotherapy planning, organs
at risk must be accurately identified in computed tomography (CT) or magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) scans to ensure they are spared from harmful radiation.
Similarly, diagnosing age-related degenerative diseases such as sarcopenia,
which involve progressive muscle volume loss and strength, is commonly based on
muscular mass measurements often obtained from manual segmentation of medical
volumes. To alleviate the manual-segmentation burden, this paper introduces an
implicit shape prior to segment volumes from sparse slice manual annotations
generalized to the multi-organ case, along with a simple framework for
automatically selecting the most informative slices to guide and minimize the
next interactions. The experimental validation shows the method's effectiveness
on two medical use cases: assisted segmentation in the context of at risks
organs for brain cancer patients, and acceleration of the creation of a new
database with unseen muscle shapes for patients with sarcopenia.

Abstract: With imaging devices delivering ever-higher resolutions and the emerging
diffusion-based forgery methods, current detectors trained only on traditional
datasets (with splicing, copy-moving and object removal forgeries) lack
exposure to this new manipulation type. To address this, we propose a novel
high-resolution SIF dataset of 1200+ diffusion-generated manipulations with
semantically extracted masks. However, this also imposes a challenge on
existing methods, as they face significant computational resource constraints
due to their prohibitive computational complexities. Therefore, we propose a
novel EfficientIML model with a lightweight, three-stage EfficientRWKV
backbone. EfficientRWKV's hybrid state-space and attention network captures
global context and local details in parallel, while a multi-scale supervision
strategy enforces consistency across hierarchical predictions. Extensive
evaluations on our dataset and standard benchmarks demonstrate that our
approach outperforms ViT-based and other SOTA lightweight baselines in
localization performance, FLOPs and inference speed, underscoring its
suitability for real-time forensic applications.

Conclusion: CLAPS提供了一个完全自动化和统一的视网膜图像分割管道，能够有效处理多任务多模态场景，展现出作为基础模型的强大潜力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in foundation models, such as the Segment Anything Model
(SAM), have significantly impacted medical image segmentation, especially in
retinal imaging, where precise segmentation is vital for diagnosis. Despite
this progress, current methods face critical challenges: 1) modality ambiguity
in textual disease descriptions, 2) a continued reliance on manual prompting
for SAM-based workflows, and 3) a lack of a unified framework, with most
methods being modality- and task-specific. To overcome these hurdles, we
propose CLIP-unified Auto-Prompt Segmentation (\CLAPS), a novel method for
unified segmentation across diverse tasks and modalities in retinal imaging.
Our approach begins by pre-training a CLIP-based image encoder on a large,
multi-modal retinal dataset to handle data scarcity and distribution imbalance.
We then leverage GroundingDINO to automatically generate spatial bounding box
prompts by detecting local lesions. To unify tasks and resolve ambiguity, we
use text prompts enhanced with a unique "modality signature" for each imaging
modality. Ultimately, these automated textual and spatial prompts guide SAM to
execute precise segmentation, creating a fully automated and unified pipeline.
Extensive experiments on 12 diverse datasets across 11 critical segmentation
categories show that CLAPS achieves performance on par with specialized expert
models while surpassing existing benchmarks across most metrics, demonstrating
its broad generalizability as a foundation model.

Conclusion: 广告视频作为一个富有挑战性的领域，能够有效地测试LLM的深层认知能力；ReAd-R模型通过奖励驱动的反思机制，显示了在这类复杂任务上的优势。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have taken a great step towards AGI. Meanwhile,
an increasing number of domain-specific problems such as math and programming
boost these general-purpose models to continuously evolve via learning deeper
expertise. Now is thus the time further to extend the diversity of specialized
applications for knowledgeable LLMs, though collecting high quality data with
unexpected and informative tasks is challenging. In this paper, we propose to
use advertisement (ad) videos as a challenging test-bed to probe the ability of
LLMs in perceiving beyond the objective physical content of common visual
domain. Our motivation is to take full advantage of the clue-rich and
information-dense ad videos' traits, e.g., marketing logic, persuasive
strategies, and audience engagement. Our contribution is three-fold: (1) To our
knowledge, this is the first attempt to use ad videos with well-designed tasks
to evaluate LLMs. We contribute AdsQA, a challenging ad Video QA benchmark
derived from 1,544 ad videos with 10,962 clips, totaling 22.7 hours, providing
5 challenging tasks. (2) We propose ReAd-R, a Deepseek-R1 styled RL model that
reflects on questions, and generates answers via reward-driven optimization.
(3) We benchmark 14 top-tier LLMs on AdsQA, and our \texttt{ReAd-R}~achieves
the state-of-the-art outperforming strong competitors equipped with long-chain
reasoning capabilities by a clear margin.

TL;DR: LADB是一个半监督框架，利用部分配对数据在共享潜在空间中对齐源域和目标域分布，实现样本到样本的跨域转换，在数据稀缺场景下平衡保真度和多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在数据稀缺领域面临挑战，需要大量重新训练或昂贵的配对数据。为了解决这些限制，需要一种能够利用部分配对数据进行跨域转换的方法。

Method: 通过在共享潜在空间中对齐源域和目标域分布，将预训练的源域扩散模型与目标域潜在对齐扩散模型（LADM）集成，使用部分配对的潜在表示进行训练，实现确定性域映射。

Result: 实验结果表明在部分监督下的深度到图像转换任务中表现优异，并能扩展到多源转换（深度图和分割掩码）和多目标转换（类条件风格迁移）。

Conclusion: LADB是现实世界域转换的可扩展和通用解决方案，特别适用于数据标注成本高或不完整的场景。

Abstract: Diffusion models excel at generating high-quality outputs but face challenges
in data-scarce domains, where exhaustive retraining or costly paired data are
often required. To address these limitations, we propose Latent Aligned
Diffusion Bridges (LADB), a semi-supervised framework for sample-to-sample
translation that effectively bridges domain gaps using partially paired data.
By aligning source and target distributions within a shared latent space, LADB
seamlessly integrates pretrained source-domain diffusion models with a
target-domain Latent Aligned Diffusion Model (LADM), trained on partially
paired latent representations. This approach enables deterministic domain
mapping without the need for full supervision. Compared to unpaired methods,
which often lack controllability, and fully paired approaches that require
large, domain-specific datasets, LADB strikes a balance between fidelity and
diversity by leveraging a mixture of paired and unpaired latent-target
couplings. Our experimental results demonstrate superior performance in
depth-to-image translation under partial supervision. Furthermore, we extend
LADB to handle multi-source translation (from depth maps and segmentation
masks) and multi-target translation in a class-conditioned style transfer task,
showcasing its versatility in handling diverse and heterogeneous use cases.
Ultimately, we present LADB as a scalable and versatile solution for real-world
domain translation, particularly in scenarios where data annotation is costly
or incomplete.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统光流估计方法需要大量标注数据，而真实标注难以获取。本文旨在开发无需真实标注的无监督方法，利用分形几何和自相似性原理来捕捉精细细节和长距离运动模式。

Method: 采用分形变形网络(FDN)架构，通过递归编码器-解码器嵌套和跳跃连接来捕获多尺度特征。训练目标基于变分公式，结合L1和L2数据保真度项以及总变差(TV)正则化项来保证亮度恒定性和空间平滑性。

Result: 在合成和基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法能够产生准确、平滑且保持边缘的光流场，特别适用于高分辨率数据和标注有限的情况。

Conclusion: FractalPINN-Flow成功实现了无监督光流估计，通过分形网络结构和变分正则化方法，在缺乏真实标注的情况下仍能获得高质量的光流结果，为实际应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We present FractalPINN-Flow, an unsupervised deep learning framework for
dense optical flow estimation that learns directly from consecutive grayscale
frames without requiring ground truth. The architecture centers on the Fractal
Deformation Network (FDN) - a recursive encoder-decoder inspired by fractal
geometry and self-similarity. Unlike traditional CNNs with sequential
downsampling, FDN uses repeated encoder-decoder nesting with skip connections
to capture both fine-grained details and long-range motion patterns. The
training objective is based on a classical variational formulation using total
variation (TV) regularization. Specifically, we minimize an energy functional
that combines $L^1$ and $L^2$ data fidelity terms to enforce brightness
constancy, along with a TV term that promotes spatial smoothness and coherent
flow fields. Experiments on synthetic and benchmark datasets show that
FractalPINN-Flow produces accurate, smooth, and edge-preserving optical flow
fields. The model is especially effective for high-resolution data and
scenarios with limited annotations.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive survey of computational imaging (CI)
techniques and their transformative impact on computer vision (CV)
applications. Conventional imaging methods often fail to deliver high-fidelity
visual data in challenging conditions, such as low light, motion blur, or high
dynamic range scenes, thereby limiting the performance of state-of-the-art CV
systems. Computational imaging techniques, including light field imaging, high

mitigation, address these limitations by enhancing image acquisition and
reconstruction processes. This survey systematically explores the synergies
between CI techniques and core CV tasks, including object detection, depth

analyzing the relationships between CI methods and their practical
contributions to CV applications, this work highlights emerging opportunities,
challenges, and future research directions. We emphasize the potential for
task-specific, adaptive imaging pipelines that improve robustness, accuracy,

Abstract: As multimodal large language models (MLLMs) advance, their large-scale
architectures pose challenges for deployment in resource-constrained
environments. In the age of large models, where energy efficiency,
computational scalability and environmental sustainability are paramount, the
development of lightweight and high-performance models is critical for
real-world applications. As such, we propose a lightweight MLLM framework for
end-to-end visual question answering. Our proposed approach centres on
BreezeCLIP, a compact yet powerful vision-language encoder optimised for
efficient multimodal understanding. With only 1.2 billion parameters overall,
our model significantly reduces computational cost while achieving performance
comparable to standard-size MLLMs. Experiments conducted on multiple datasets
further validate its effectiveness in balancing accuracy and efficiency. The
modular and extensible design enables generalisation to broader multimodal
tasks. The proposed lightweight vision-language framework is denoted as BcQLM
(BreezeCLIP-enhanced Q-Gated Multimodal Language Model). It offers a promising
path toward deployable MLLMs under practical hardware constraints. The source

Conclusion: CrowdQuery是首个有效桥接2D和3D拥挤环境检测的方法，无需额外数据，具有通用性和可扩展性，为拥挤场景目标检测提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel method for end-to-end crowd detection that
leverages object density information to enhance existing transformer-based
detectors. We present CrowdQuery (CQ), whose core component is our CQ module
that predicts and subsequently embeds an object density map. The embedded
density information is then systematically integrated into the decoder.
Existing density map definitions typically depend on head positions or
object-based spatial statistics. Our method extends these definitions to
include individual bounding box dimensions. By incorporating density
information into object queries, our method utilizes density-guided queries to
improve detection in crowded scenes. CQ is universally applicable to both 2D
and 3D detection without requiring additional data. Consequently, we are the
first to design a method that effectively bridges 2D and 3D detection in
crowded environments. We demonstrate the integration of CQ into both a general
2D and 3D transformer-based object detector, introducing the architectures CQ2D
and CQ3D. CQ is not limited to the specific transformer models we selected.
Experiments on the STCrowd dataset for both 2D and 3D domains show significant
performance improvements compared to the base models, outperforming most
state-of-the-art methods. When integrated into a state-of-the-art crowd
detector, CQ can further improve performance on the challenging CrowdHuman
dataset, demonstrating its generalizability. The code is released at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ArgoTweak是首个提供真实地图先验、当前地图和传感器数据三元组的公开数据集，通过双向映射框架实现细粒度地图元素级修改，显著减少了sim2real差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有公开数据集缺乏地图先验、当前地图和传感器数据的三元组，导致方法只能依赖合成先验，产生不一致性和显著的sim2real差距。

Method: 采用双向映射框架，将大规模修改分解为地图元素级的细粒度原子变化，确保可解释性，实现精确的变化检测和集成。

Result: 实验表明，在ArgoTweak上训练的模型相比合成先验显著减少了sim2real差距，消融实验进一步验证了结构化先验和详细变化标注的重要性。

Conclusion: ArgoTweak为可解释的先验辅助高精地图建立了基准，推动了可扩展、自改进的地图解决方案发展。

Abstract: Reliable integration of prior information is crucial for self-verifying and
self-updating HD maps. However, no public dataset includes the required triplet
of prior maps, current maps, and sensor data. As a result, existing methods
must rely on synthetic priors, which create inconsistencies and lead to a
significant sim2real gap. To address this, we introduce ArgoTweak, the first
dataset to complete the triplet with realistic map priors. At its core,
ArgoTweak employs a bijective mapping framework, breaking down large-scale
modifications into fine-grained atomic changes at the map element level, thus
ensuring interpretability. This paradigm shift enables accurate change
detection and integration while preserving unchanged elements with high
fidelity. Experiments show that training models on ArgoTweak significantly
reduces the sim2real gap compared to synthetic priors. Extensive ablations
further highlight the impact of structured priors and detailed change
annotations. By establishing a benchmark for explainable, prior-aided HD
mapping, ArgoTweak advances scalable, self-improving mapping solutions. The
dataset, baselines, map modification toolbox, and further resources are
available at https://kth-rpl.github.io/ArgoTweak/.

Motivation: 解决事件相机在星迹踪定向中缺乏准确真实值的问题，探索其在低成本、低延迟定向系统中的应用潜力

Method: 通过将静止事件相机指向夜空，使得唯一的相机运动来自地球自转，将产生的事件流处理为定向估计，与IERS测量的地球定向进行对比

Result: 系统实现了18.47秒的均方根锐差和78.84秒的绝对锐差，显示事件相机在星迹踪定向中的可行性

Conclusion: 事件相机经过验证具备了用于低成本、低延迟星迹踪定向的潜力，结合其高动态范围、低能耗、高更新率等优势

Abstract: Event-based cameras (EBCs) are a promising new technology for star
tracking-based attitude determination, but prior studies have struggled to
determine accurate ground truth for real data. We analyze the accuracy of an
EBC star tracking system utilizing the Earth's motion as the ground truth for
comparison. The Earth rotates in a regular way with very small irregularities
which are measured to the level of milli-arcseconds. By keeping an event camera
static and pointing it through a ground-based telescope at the night sky, we
create a system where the only camera motion in the celestial reference frame
is that induced by the Earth's rotation. The resulting event stream is
processed to generate estimates of orientation which we compare to the
International Earth Rotation and Reference System (IERS) measured orientation
of the Earth. The event camera system is able to achieve a root mean squared
across error of 18.47 arcseconds and an about error of 78.84 arcseconds.
Combined with the other benefits of event cameras over framing sensors (reduced
computation due to sparser data streams, higher dynamic range, lower energy
consumption, faster update rates), this level of accuracy suggests the utility
of event cameras for low-cost and low-latency star tracking. We provide all
code and data used to generate our results:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BEAMER提出了一种新颖的密集图像匹配方法，通过在每个尺度为每个源位置预测多个对应假设，而不是单一假设，显著提高了在深度不连续和强缩放情况下的匹配鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在每个尺度为每个源位置只产生单一对应假设，在深度不连续或目标图像是源图像的强缩放时，相邻源位置的对应关系可能分布广泛，单一假设容易导致错误匹配。

Method: 采用波束搜索策略在每个尺度传播多个假设，并将这些多假设整合到交叉注意力层中，构建了BEAMER密集匹配架构，学习在尺度间保持和传播多假设。

Result: BEAMER比现有最先进方法显著更鲁棒，特别是在深度不连续和目标图像是源图像强缩放的情况下表现优异。

Conclusion: 预测多个对应假设而非单一假设的策略有效提升了密集图像匹配在挑战性场景下的性能，BEAMER架构为此提供了可行的实现方案。

Abstract: Dense image matching aims to find a correspondent for every pixel of a source
image in a partially overlapping target image. State-of-the-art methods
typically rely on a coarse-to-fine mechanism where a single correspondent
hypothesis is produced per source location at each scale. In challenging cases
-- such as at depth discontinuities or when the target image is a strong
zoom-in of the source image -- the correspondents of neighboring source
locations are often widely spread and predicting a single correspondent
hypothesis per source location at each scale may lead to erroneous matches. In
this paper, we investigate the idea of predicting multiple correspondent
hypotheses per source location at each scale instead. We consider a beam search
strategy to propagat multiple hypotheses at each scale and propose integrating
these multiple hypotheses into cross-attention layers, resulting in a novel
dense matching architecture called BEAMER. BEAMER learns to preserve and
propagate multiple hypotheses across scales, making it significantly more
robust than state-of-the-art methods, especially at depth discontinuities or
when the target image is a strong zoom-in of the source image.

Result: 提出了GeneVA数据集，填补了视频生成领域缺乏专门时空伪影评估基准的空白

Conclusion: GeneVA数据集能够支持和辅助关键应用，如基准测试模型性能和提升生成视频质量

Abstract: Recent advances in probabilistic generative models have extended capabilities
from static image synthesis to text-driven video generation. However, the
inherent randomness of their generation process can lead to unpredictable
artifacts, such as impossible physics and temporal inconsistency. Progress in
addressing these challenges requires systematic benchmarks, yet existing
datasets primarily focus on generative images due to the unique spatio-temporal
complexities of videos. To bridge this gap, we introduce GeneVA, a large-scale
artifact dataset with rich human annotations that focuses on spatio-temporal
artifacts in videos generated from natural text prompts. We hope GeneVA can
enable and assist critical applications, such as benchmarking model performance
and improving generative video quality.

TL;DR: RewardDance是一个可扩展的视觉生成奖励建模框架，通过生成式奖励范式解决现有方法的局限性，支持模型规模扩展到260亿参数，并有效解决了奖励黑客问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有奖励模型在视觉生成中存在架构限制和Bradley-Terry损失与VLMs不匹配的问题，且RLHF优化过程中存在奖励黑客问题，阻碍了有效的规模化。

Method: 提出RewardDance框架，将奖励分数重新定义为模型预测"yes"标记的概率，表示生成图像在特定标准下优于参考图像，从而内在对齐奖励目标与VLM架构。

Result: RewardDance在文本到图像、文本到视频和图像到视频生成任务中显著超越最先进方法，大规模奖励模型在RL微调期间保持高奖励方差，证明其抗黑客攻击能力。

Conclusion: RewardDance通过生成式奖励范式成功解决了视觉生成奖励模型的规模化挑战和奖励黑客问题，为高质量多样化输出提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Reward Models (RMs) are critical for improving generation models via
Reinforcement Learning (RL), yet the RM scaling paradigm in visual generation
remains largely unexplored. It primarily due to fundamental limitations in
existing approaches: CLIP-based RMs suffer from architectural and input
modality constraints, while prevalent Bradley-Terry losses are fundamentally
misaligned with the next-token prediction mechanism of Vision-Language Models
(VLMs), hindering effective scaling. More critically, the RLHF optimization
process is plagued by Reward Hacking issue, where models exploit flaws in the
reward signal without improving true quality. To address these challenges, we
introduce RewardDance, a scalable reward modeling framework that overcomes
these barriers through a novel generative reward paradigm. By reformulating the
reward score as the model's probability of predicting a "yes" token, indicating
that the generated image outperforms a reference image according to specific
criteria, RewardDance intrinsically aligns reward objectives with VLM
architectures. This alignment unlocks scaling across two dimensions: (1) Model
Scaling: Systematic scaling of RMs up to 26 billion parameters; (2) Context
Scaling: Integration of task-specific instructions, reference examples, and
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
RewardDance significantly surpasses state-of-the-art methods in text-to-image,
text-to-video, and image-to-video generation. Crucially, we resolve the
persistent challenge of "reward hacking": Our large-scale RMs exhibit and
maintain high reward variance during RL fine-tuning, proving their resistance
to hacking and ability to produce diverse, high-quality outputs. It greatly
relieves the mode collapse problem that plagues smaller models.

Motivation: 解决三维动态场景重建中的挑战，特别是单目视频中的深度模糊问题，实现高质量的织物变形和渲染

Method: 使用物理模拟和可微分渲染，引入两个新的正则化项来处理单目视频中的深度模糊问题

Result: 3D重建误差比现有方法降低了2.64倍，每场景平均运行时间30分钟，能够从单目视频中恢复出锐利的细节

Conclusion: 该方法在单目RGB视频的织物动态场景重建方面取得了显著改进，同时实现了高质量的外观估计和渲染

Abstract: The reconstruction of three-dimensional dynamic scenes is a well-established
yet challenging task within the domain of computer vision. In this paper, we
propose a novel approach that combines the domains of 3D geometry
reconstruction and appearance estimation for physically based rendering and
present a system that is able to perform both tasks for fabrics, utilizing only
a single monocular RGB video sequence as input. In order to obtain realistic
and high-quality deformations and renderings, a physical simulation of the
cloth geometry and differentiable rendering are employed. In this paper, we
introduce two novel regularization terms for the 3D reconstruction task that
improve the plausibility of the reconstruction by addressing the depth
ambiguity problem in monocular video. In comparison with the most recent
methods in the field, we have reduced the error in the 3D reconstruction by a
factor of 2.64 while requiring a medium runtime of 30 min per scene.
Furthermore, the optimized motion achieves sufficient quality to perform an
appearance estimation of the deforming object, recovering sharp details from
this single monocular RGB video.

Abstract: Language identification is the task of determining the languages for a given
text. In many real world scenarios, text may contain more than one language,
particularly in multilingual communities. Bilingual Language Identification
(BLID) is the task of identifying and distinguishing between two languages in a
given text. This paper presents BLID for languages spoken in the southern part
of Ethiopia, namely Wolaita and Gofa. The presence of words similarities and
differences between the two languages makes the language identification task
challenging. To overcome this challenge, we employed various experiments on
various approaches. Then, the combination of the BERT based pretrained language
model and LSTM approach performed better, with an F1 score of 0.72 on the test
set. As a result, the work will be effective in tackling unwanted social media

Motivation: 开源权重LLM面临恶意微调攻击的风险，现有安全措施难以在保持模型通用能力的同时抵抗拥有完整模型访问权限的对手

Method: 使用双层优化程序，包含辅助对抗性超网络生成恶意LoRA权重，防御者LLM训练目标为抵消这些对抗性权重添加的影响

Result: 在52种红队攻击测试中，AntiDote比篡改抵抗和遗忘基线方法强27.4%，在MMLU等能力基准测试中性能下降小于0.5%

Conclusion: AntiDote提供了一种实用且计算高效的方法，使安全性成为开源权重模型中更内在和弹性的属性

Abstract: The release of open-weight large language models (LLMs) creates a tension
between advancing accessible research and preventing misuse, such as malicious
fine-tuning to elicit harmful content. Current safety measures struggle to
preserve the general capabilities of the LLM while resisting a determined
adversary with full access to the model's weights and architecture, who can use
full-parameter fine-tuning to erase existing safeguards. To address this, we
introduce AntiDote, a bi-level optimization procedure for training LLMs to be
resistant to such tampering. AntiDote involves an auxiliary adversary
hypernetwork that learns to generate malicious Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
weights conditioned on the defender model's internal activations. The defender
LLM is then trained with an objective to nullify the effect of these
adversarial weight additions, forcing it to maintain its safety alignment. We
validate this approach against a diverse suite of 52 red-teaming attacks,
including jailbreak prompting, latent space manipulation, and direct
weight-space attacks. AntiDote is upto 27.4\% more robust against adversarial
attacks compared to both tamper-resistance and unlearning baselines. Crucially,
this robustness is achieved with a minimal trade-off in utility, incurring a
performance degradation of upto less than 0.5\% across capability benchmarks
including MMLU, HellaSwag, and GSM8K. Our work offers a practical and compute
efficient methodology for building open-weight models where safety is a more
integral and resilient property.

Abstract: The alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human values is critical
for their safe and effective deployment across diverse user populations.
However, existing benchmarks often neglect cultural and demographic diversity,

metadata, making it the most comprehensive resource of its kind to date. Using
MVPBench, we conduct an in-depth analysis of several state-of-the-art LLMs,
revealing substantial disparities in alignment performance across geographic

methods, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and Direct Preference Optimization
(DPO), can significantly enhance value alignment in both in-domain and
out-of-domain settings. Our findings underscore the necessity for
population-aware alignment evaluation and provide actionable insights for
building culturally adaptive and value-sensitive LLMs. MVPBench serves as a

Abstract: Scientific literature is growing exponentially, creating a critical
bottleneck for researchers to efficiently synthesize knowledge. While
general-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) show potential in text processing,
they often fail to capture scientific domain-specific nuances (e.g., technical
jargon, methodological rigor) and struggle with complex scientific tasks,
limiting their utility for interdisciplinary research. To address these gaps,
this paper presents SciGPT, a domain-adapted foundation model for scientific
literature understanding and ScienceBench, an open source benchmark tailored to
evaluate scientific LLMs.
  Built on the Qwen3 architecture, SciGPT incorporates three key innovations:
(1) low-cost domain distillation via a two-stage pipeline to balance
performance and efficiency; (2) a Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) attention
mechanism that cuts memory consumption by 55\% for 32,000-token long-document
reasoning; and (3) knowledge-aware adaptation integrating domain ontologies to
bridge interdisciplinary knowledge gaps.
  Experimental results on ScienceBench show that SciGPT outperforms GPT-4o in
core scientific tasks including sequence labeling, generation, and inference.
It also exhibits strong robustness in unseen scientific tasks, validating its
potential to facilitate AI-augmented scientific discovery.

Motivation: 大型语言模型日益个性化，但人物设定提示可能导致模型错误拒绝用户请求，需要量化这种影响程度

Method: 使用15种社会人口学人物设定（性别、种族、宗教、残疾），测试16个不同模型在3个任务（自然语言推理、礼貌性和冒犯性分类）上的表现，采用蒙特卡洛方法进行高效量化

Result: 随着模型能力增强，人物设定对拒绝率的影响减小；某些社会人口学人物设定在某些模型中会增加虚假拒绝，表明对齐策略或安全机制存在潜在偏见；模型选择和任务类型对虚假拒绝有显著影响

Conclusion: 人物设定效应被高估，虚假拒绝可能更多由其他因素导致，模型能力和任务敏感性是更重要的影响因素

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into our daily lives
and personalized. However, LLM personalization might also increase unintended
side effects. Recent work suggests that persona prompting can lead models to
falsely refuse user requests. However, no work has fully quantified the extent
of this issue. To address this gap, we measure the impact of 15
sociodemographic personas (based on gender, race, religion, and disability) on
false refusal. To control for other factors, we also test 16 different models,
3 tasks (Natural Language Inference, politeness, and offensiveness
classification), and nine prompt paraphrases. We propose a Monte Carlo-based
method to quantify this issue in a sample-efficient manner. Our results show
that as models become more capable, personas impact the refusal rate less and
less. Certain sociodemographic personas increase false refusal in some models,
which suggests underlying biases in the alignment strategies or safety
mechanisms. However, we find that the model choice and task significantly
influence false refusals, especially in sensitive content tasks. Our findings
suggest that persona effects have been overestimated, and might be due to other
factors.

Abstract: Converging evidence suggests that systems of semantic categories across human
languages achieve near-optimal compression via the Information Bottleneck (IB)
complexity-accuracy principle. Large language models (LLMs) are not trained for
this objective, which raises the question: are LLMs capable of evolving
efficient human-like semantic systems? To address this question, we focus on
the domain of color as a key testbed of cognitive theories of categorization
and replicate with LLMs (Gemini 2.0-flash and Llama 3.3-70B-Instruct) two
influential human behavioral studies. First, we conduct an English color-naming
study, showing that Gemini aligns well with the naming patterns of native
English speakers and achieves a significantly high IB-efficiency score, while
Llama exhibits an efficient but lower complexity system compared to English.
Second, to test whether LLMs simply mimic patterns in their training data or
actually exhibit a human-like inductive bias toward IB-efficiency, we simulate
cultural evolution of pseudo color-naming systems in LLMs via iterated
in-context language learning. We find that akin to humans, LLMs iteratively
restructure initially random systems towards greater IB-efficiency and
increased alignment with patterns observed across the world's languages. These
findings demonstrate that LLMs are capable of evolving perceptually grounded,
human-like semantic systems, driven by the same fundamental principle that
governs semantic efficiency across human languages.

*Kosei Uemura,David Guzmán,Quang Phuoc Nguyen,Jesujoba Oluwadara Alabi,En-shiun Annie Lee,David Ifeoluwa Adelani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MERLIN是一个两阶段模型堆叠框架，通过课程学习策略和DoRA权重适配，显著提升低资源语言的复杂推理能力，在AfriMGSM基准上比MindMerger提升12.9个百分点，甚至超越GPT-4o-mini。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在英语表现优异，但在许多低资源语言的复杂推理方面仍有困难。现有的编码器-解码器方法对中高资源语言有效，但在低资源语言上存在较大差距。

Method: 提出MERLIN两阶段模型堆叠框架：1）应用课程学习策略，从通用双语文本到任务特定数据；2）仅适配少量DoRA权重。

Result: 在AfriMGSM基准上准确率比MindMerger提升+12.9pp，超越GPT-4o-mini；在MGSM和MSVAMP上分别获得+0.9pp和+2.8pp的稳定提升，在低资源和高资源设置下均有效。

Conclusion: MERLIN框架通过创新的课程学习和参数高效适配方法，成功解决了低资源语言复杂推理的挑战，为多语言NLP提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models excel in English but still struggle with complex
reasoning in many low-resource languages (LRLs). Existing encoder-plus-decoder
methods such as LangBridge and MindMerger raise accuracy on mid and
high-resource languages, yet they leave a large gap on LRLs. We present MERLIN,
a two-stage model-stacking framework that applies a curriculum learning
strategy -- from general bilingual bitext to task-specific data -- and adapts
only a small set of DoRA weights. On the AfriMGSM benchmark MERLIN improves
exact-match accuracy by +12.9 pp over MindMerger and outperforms GPT-4o-mini.
It also yields consistent gains on MGSM and MSVAMP (+0.9 and +2.8 pp),
demonstrating effectiveness across both low and high-resource settings.

TL;DR: 研究发现假设假设错误：假设错误可以通过提示调整从颇渗训的大语言模型传递到适配模型，而且常见的提示去假设方法并不能一致地阻止假设传递。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 前期工作存在一个危险假设：假设不会从颇渗训的大语言模型传递到适配模型。研究者想要验证这个假设在提示适配情况下是否成立，因为提示是实际应用中极其流行和易用的适配策略。

Method: 研究了在提示适配下的因果模型中的假设传递假设。评估了多种少样本组成参数（样本大小、定型内容、职业分布和代表性平衡）对假设传递的影响，并测试了几种提示基于的去假设策略的效果。

Result: 发现假设可以通过提示传递，内在假设与提示适配后假设之间的相关性在不同人口组和任务中保持中等到强度（如性别rho >= 0.94，年龄rho >= 0.98，宗教rho >= 0.69）。在变化少样本组成参数时，假设依然保持强相关性（rho >= 0.90）。不同的去假设策略有各自的优势，但没有一种能在所有模型、任务或人口组中一致地减少假设传递。

Conclusion: 纠正内在模型中的假设（以及潜在地改善推理能力）可能阻止假设向下游任务传播。这一发现对开发更公平的AI系统具有重要意义，强调了在源头减少假设的重要性。

Abstract: A dangerous assumption that can be made from prior work on the bias transfer
hypothesis (BTH) is that biases do not transfer from pre-trained large language
models (LLMs) to adapted models. We invalidate this assumption by studying the
BTH in causal models under prompt adaptations, as prompting is an extremely
popular and accessible adaptation strategy used in real-world applications. In
contrast to prior work, we find that biases can transfer through prompting and
that popular prompt-based mitigation methods do not consistently prevent biases
from transferring. Specifically, the correlation between intrinsic biases and
those after prompt adaptation remain moderate to strong across demographics and
tasks -- for example, gender (rho >= 0.94) in co-reference resolution, and age
(rho >= 0.98) and religion (rho >= 0.69) in question answering. Further, we
find that biases remain strongly correlated when varying few-shot composition
parameters, such as sample size, stereotypical content, occupational
distribution and representational balance (rho >= 0.90). We evaluate several
prompt-based debiasing strategies and find that different approaches have
distinct strengths, but none consistently reduce bias transfer across models,
tasks or demographics. These results demonstrate that correcting bias, and
potentially improving reasoning ability, in intrinsic models may prevent
propagation of biases to downstream tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种称为"语言化算法"的新范式，利用经典算法理论，将复杂任务分解为LLM能够可靠处理的简单自然语言操作


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的一次性查询LLM方式在推理任务中可能无法获得正确答案，需要更可靠的方法来利用LLM的能力

Method: 将任务分解为简单的自然语言字符串基本操作，让LLM仅作为二元比较等简单任务的预言机，结合已知的经典算法（如比特排序网络）

Result: 在排序和聚类任务上证明了该方法的有效性

Conclusion: 语言化算法提供了一种更可靠的方式来利用LLM进行复杂推理任务，通过限制LLM的作用范围到其擅长的简单操作

Abstract: Instead of querying LLMs in a one-shot manner and hoping to get the right
answer for a reasoning task, we propose a paradigm we call \emph{verbalized
algorithms} (VAs), which leverage classical algorithms with established
theoretical understanding. VAs decompose a task into simple elementary
operations on natural language strings that they should be able to answer
reliably, and limit the scope of LLMs to only those simple tasks. For example,
for sorting a series of natural language strings, \emph{verbalized sorting}
uses an LLM as a binary comparison oracle in a known and well-analyzed sorting
algorithm (e.g., bitonic sorting network). We demonstrate the effectiveness of
this approach on sorting and clustering tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 现有标注者过滤方法在主观任务中会错误移除有分歧的标注者而非垃圾标注者，导致准确性和标签多样性之间的次优权衡。研究发现保守的标注者移除比例(<5%)最佳，且垃圾标注者往往比非垃圾标注者更不随机。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了在机器学习数据集中准确代表人群的多样化观点，需要在过滤垃圾或低质量响应的同时保留数据标签的变异。需要平衡标注者可靠性和代表性。

Method: 通过实证评估一系列标注者过滤启发式方法对主观任务中变异保留的影响，分析合成垃圾数据上的性能表现。

Result: 现有方法经常移除有分歧的标注者而非垃圾标注者；保守的标注者移除设置(<5%)效果最好；垃圾标注者往往给出固定答案而非随机答案，比非垃圾标注者更不随机。

Conclusion: 需要开发能够考虑标签多样性的垃圾移除方法，现有基于变异即垃圾假设的过滤方法在需要保留变异的任务中表现不佳。

Abstract: For machine learning datasets to accurately represent diverse opinions in a
population, they must preserve variation in data labels while filtering out
spam or low-quality responses. How can we balance annotator reliability and
representation? We empirically evaluate how a range of heuristics for annotator
filtering affect the preservation of variation on subjective tasks. We find
that these methods, designed for contexts in which variation from a single
ground-truth label is considered noise, often remove annotators who disagree
instead of spam annotators, introducing suboptimal tradeoffs between accuracy
and label diversity. We find that conservative settings for annotator removal
(<5%) are best, after which all tested methods increase the mean absolute error
from the true average label. We analyze performance on synthetic spam to
observe that these methods often assume spam annotators are less random than
real spammers tend to be: most spammers are distributionally indistinguishable
from real annotators, and the minority that are distinguishable tend to give
fixed answers, not random ones. Thus, tasks requiring the preservation of
variation reverse the intuition of existing spam filtering methods: spammers
tend to be less random than non-spammers, so metrics that assume variation is
spam fare worse. These results highlight the need for spam removal methods that
account for label diversity.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于问题回答的方法来模型语义覆盖关系，通过构建合成数据集进行分类，识别文档间的信息对齐关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解不同格式文档间的信息共享方式对信息检索、摘要等任务至关重要。

Method: 采用问题回答方法，通过文档间共享问题的可回答性来表征语义覆盖关系，使用SQuAD语料库构建合成数据集进行训练和评测。

Result: 判别模型表现超过生成模型，RoBERTa-base模型达到61.4%的最高准确率，Random Forest模型在平衡性方面表现最佳（宏F1分数52.9%）。

Conclusion: 问题回答提供了有效的视角来评估不同风格文本间的语义关系，为现有模型的信息推理能力提供了见解。

Abstract: Understanding how information is shared across documents, regardless of the
format in which it is expressed, is critical for tasks such as information
retrieval, summarization, and content alignment. In this work, we introduce a
novel framework for modelling Semantic Coverage Relations (SCR), which
classifies document pairs based on how their informational content aligns. We
define three core relation types: equivalence, where both texts convey the same
information using different textual forms or styles; inclusion, where one
document fully contains the information of another and adds more; and semantic
overlap, where each document presents partially overlapping content. To capture
these relations, we adopt a question answering (QA)-based approach, using the
answerability of shared questions across documents as an indicator of semantic
coverage. We construct a synthetic dataset derived from the SQuAD corpus by
paraphrasing source passages and selectively omitting information, enabling
precise control over content overlap. This dataset allows us to benchmark
generative language models and train transformer-based classifiers for SCR
prediction. Our findings demonstrate that discriminative models significantly
outperform generative approaches, with the RoBERTa-base model achieving the
highest accuracy of 61.4% and the Random Forest-based model showing the best
balance with a macro-F1 score of 52.9%. The results show that QA provides an
effective lens for assessing semantic relations across stylistically diverse
texts, offering insights into the capacity of current models to reason about
information beyond surface similarity. The dataset and code developed in this
study are publicly available to support reproducibility.

Motivation: 探索LLM生成的合成毒性数据能否代替人工标注数据用于文本去毒训练

Method: 使用Llama 3和Qwen激活补丁模型为ParaDetox和SST-2数据集中的中性文本生成合成毒性对应片段

Result: 基于合成数据进行精调的模型表现一致比人工数据训练的模型差，性能下降达30%

Conclusion: 当前LLM在毒性内容生成方面存在限制，词汇多样性不足，强调了人工标注数据对建立健壮去毒系统的重要性

Abstract: Modern Large Language Models (LLMs) are excellent at generating synthetic
data. However, their performance in sensitive domains such as text
detoxification has not received proper attention from the scientific community.
This paper explores the possibility of using LLM-generated synthetic toxic data
as an alternative to human-generated data for training models for
detoxification. Using Llama 3 and Qwen activation-patched models, we generated
synthetic toxic counterparts for neutral texts from ParaDetox and SST-2
datasets. Our experiments show that models fine-tuned on synthetic data
consistently perform worse than those trained on human data, with a drop in
performance of up to 30% in joint metrics. The root cause is identified as a
critical lexical diversity gap: LLMs generate toxic content using a small,
repetitive vocabulary of insults that fails to capture the nuances and variety
of human toxicity. These findings highlight the limitations of current LLMs in
this domain and emphasize the continued importance of diverse, human-annotated
data for building robust detoxification systems.

TL;DR: ETLCH是一个基于LLaMA的10亿参数模型，通过少量样本（每任务几百到一千个）进行低秩适应微调，在JSON提取、知识图谱提取和命名实体识别任务中表现出色，证明了小模型在低资源环境下也能实现准确的结构化数据提取。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在结构化数据提取任务中成本高昂且需要大量高质量数据，小团队难以承受。现有研究主要关注70亿参数以上的大模型，缺乏小模型在低资源多任务条件下可靠性的证据。

Method: 基于LLaMA架构构建10亿参数模型ETLCH，使用低秩适应（LoRA）技术，仅用每任务几百到一千个样本进行微调，针对JSON提取、知识图谱提取和命名实体识别三个任务。

Result: ETLCH在大多数评估指标上优于强基线模型，即使在最低数据规模下也观察到显著增益，表现稳定准确。

Conclusion: 经过良好调优的小模型能够以极低的计算成本提供稳定准确的结构化输出，使资源受限环境能够构建经济高效且可靠的信息提取管道。

Abstract: Deploying large language models (LLMs) for structured data extraction in
domains such as financial compliance reporting, legal document analytics, and
multilingual knowledge base construction is often impractical for smaller teams
due to the high cost of running large architectures and the difficulty of
preparing large, high-quality datasets. Most recent instruction-tuning studies
focus on seven-billion-parameter or larger models, leaving limited evidence on
whether much smaller models can work reliably under low-resource, multi-task
conditions. This work presents ETLCH, a billion-parameter LLaMA-based model
fine-tuned with low-rank adaptation on only a few hundred to one thousand
samples per task for JSON extraction, knowledge graph extraction, and named
entity recognition. Despite its small scale, ETLCH outperforms strong baselines
across most evaluation metrics, with substantial gains observed even at the
lowest data scale. These findings demonstrate that well-tuned small models can
deliver stable and accurate structured outputs at a fraction of the
computational cost, enabling cost-effective and reliable information extraction
pipelines in resource-constrained environments.

Conclusion: 该工作解决了SpeechRE领域的数据稀缺和模型性能限制问题，通过真实数据集和创新框架推动了该领域的发展

Abstract: Speech Relation Extraction (SpeechRE) aims to extract relation triplets
directly from speech. However, existing benchmark datasets rely heavily on
synthetic data, lacking sufficient quantity and diversity of real human speech.
Moreover, existing models also suffer from rigid single-order generation
templates and weak semantic alignment, substantially limiting their
performance. To address these challenges, we introduce CommonVoice-SpeechRE, a
large-scale dataset comprising nearly 20,000 real-human speech samples from
diverse speakers, establishing a new benchmark for SpeechRE research.
Furthermore, we propose the Relation Prompt-Guided Multi-Order Generative
Ensemble (RPG-MoGe), a novel framework that features: (1) a multi-order triplet
generation ensemble strategy, leveraging data diversity through diverse element
orders during both training and inference, and (2) CNN-based latent relation
prediction heads that generate explicit relation prompts to guide cross-modal
alignment and accurate triplet generation. Experiments show our approach
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, providing both a benchmark dataset and an
effective solution for real-world SpeechRE. The source code and dataset are
publicly available at https://github.com/NingJinzhong/SpeechRE_RPG_MoGe.

Abstract: In an era where misinformation spreads freely, fact-checking (FC) plays a
crucial role in verifying claims and promoting reliable information. While
automated fact-checking (AFC) has advanced significantly, existing systems
remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks that manipulate or generate claims,
evidence, or claim-evidence pairs. These attacks can distort the truth, mislead
decision-makers, and ultimately undermine the reliability of FC models. Despite
growing research interest in adversarial attacks against AFC systems, a
comprehensive, holistic overview of key challenges remains lacking. These
challenges include understanding attack strategies, assessing the resilience of
current models, and identifying ways to enhance robustness. This survey
provides the first in-depth review of adversarial attacks targeting FC,
categorizing existing attack methodologies and evaluating their impact on AFC
systems. Additionally, we examine recent advancements in adversary-aware
defenses and highlight open research questions that require further
exploration. Our findings underscore the urgent need for resilient FC
frameworks capable of withstanding adversarial manipulations in pursuit of
preserving high verification accuracy.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Acquiescence bias, i.e. the tendency of humans to agree with statements in
surveys, independent of their actual beliefs, is well researched and
documented. Since Large Language Models (LLMs) have been shown to be very
influenceable by relatively small changes in input and are trained on
human-generated data, it is reasonable to assume that they could show a similar
tendency. We present a study investigating the presence of acquiescence bias in
LLMs across different models, tasks, and languages (English, German, and
Polish). Our results indicate that, contrary to humans, LLMs display a bias
towards answering no, regardless of whether it indicates agreement or
disagreement.

Result: 人设提示在调节语言抽象度方面效果有限，即使使用边缘群体人设也可能无意中传播定型观念

Conclusion: 人设提示方法在代表社会人口群体方面存在限制，需要谨慎使用以避免强化定型

Abstract: Persona-prompting is a growing strategy to steer LLMs toward simulating
particular perspectives or linguistic styles through the lens of a specified
identity. While this method is often used to personalize outputs, its impact on
how LLMs represent social groups remains underexplored. In this paper, we
investigate whether persona-prompting leads to different levels of linguistic
abstraction - an established marker of stereotyping - when generating short
texts linking socio-demographic categories with stereotypical or
non-stereotypical attributes. Drawing on the Linguistic Expectancy Bias
framework, we analyze outputs from six open-weight LLMs under three prompting
conditions, comparing 11 persona-driven responses to those of a generic AI
assistant. To support this analysis, we introduce Self-Stereo, a new dataset of
self-reported stereotypes from Reddit. We measure abstraction through three
metrics: concreteness, specificity, and negation. Our results highlight the
limits of persona-prompting in modulating abstraction in language, confirming
criticisms about the ecology of personas as representative of socio-demographic
groups and raising concerns about the risk of propagating stereotypes even when
seemingly evoking the voice of a marginalized group.

Motivation: 现有方法通常单独优化对齐维度，导致权衡和不一致行为；MoE架构存在路由校准问题，限制了在对齐任务中的有效性。

Method: 提出TrinityX框架，包含混合校准专家(MoCaE)，分别训练Helpfulness、Harmlessness、Honesty三个维度的专家，通过校准的任务自适应路由机制整合专家输出。

Result: 在三个标准对齐基准测试中：Alpaca(Helpfulness)、BeaverTails(Harmlessness)、TruthfulQA(Honesty)，TrinityX相比基线方法在胜率上提升32.5%，安全分数提升33.9%，真实性提升28.4%，同时内存使用和推理延迟降低40%以上。

Conclusion: TrinityX通过模块化专家设计和校准路由机制，有效解决了LLM对齐中的多维权衡问题，在性能提升的同时显著降低了计算成本，具有良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong performance across a wide range
of NLP tasks, yet aligning their outputs with the principles of Helpfulness,
Harmlessness, and Honesty (HHH) remains a persistent challenge. Existing
methods often optimize for individual alignment dimensions in isolation,
leading to trade-offs and inconsistent behavior. While Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
architectures offer modularity, they suffer from poorly calibrated routing,
limiting their effectiveness in alignment tasks. We propose TrinityX, a modular
alignment framework that incorporates a Mixture of Calibrated Experts (MoCaE)
within the Transformer architecture. TrinityX leverages separately trained
experts for each HHH dimension, integrating their outputs through a calibrated,
task-adaptive routing mechanism that combines expert signals into a unified,
alignment-aware representation. Extensive experiments on three standard
alignment benchmarks-Alpaca (Helpfulness), BeaverTails (Harmlessness), and
TruthfulQA (Honesty)-demonstrate that TrinityX outperforms strong baselines,
achieving relative improvements of 32.5% in win rate, 33.9% in safety score,
and 28.4% in truthfulness. In addition, TrinityX reduces memory usage and
inference latency by over 40% compared to prior MoE-based approaches. Ablation
studies highlight the importance of calibrated routing, and cross-model
evaluations confirm TrinityX's generalization across diverse LLM backbones.

Conclusion: 该方法证明了构建高质量偏好数据的必要性，为解决多语言对齐问题提供了有效解决方案，通过一致性引导的数据选择能够显著提升模型在不同语言间的对齐效果。

Abstract: Current large language models (LLMs) generally show a significant performance
gap in alignment between English and other languages. To bridge this gap,
existing research typically leverages the model's responses in English as a
reference to select the best/worst responses in other languages, which are then
used for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) training. However, we argue that
there are two limitations in the current methods that result in noisy
multilingual preference data and further limited alignment performance: 1) Not
all English responses are of high quality, and using a response with low
quality may mislead the alignment for other languages. 2) Current methods
usually use biased or heuristic approaches to construct multilingual preference
pairs. To address these limitations, we design a consistency-based data
selection method to construct high-quality multilingual preference data for
improving multilingual alignment (CM-Align). Specifically, our method includes
two parts: consistency-guided English reference selection and cross-lingual
consistency-based multilingual preference data construction. Experimental
results on three LLMs and three common tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and
superiority of our method, which further indicates the necessity of
constructing high-quality preference data.

Conclusion: 基于集成的零样本方法结合有效RAG管道，为生物医学问答提供了实用且可扩展的替代方案，精确检索对RAG至关重要

Abstract: Biomedical question answering (QA) poses significant challenges due to the
need for precise interpretation of specialized knowledge drawn from a vast,
complex, and rapidly evolving corpus. In this work, we explore how large
language models (LLMs) can be used for information retrieval (IR), and an
ensemble of zero-shot models can accomplish state-of-the-art performance on a
domain-specific Yes/No QA task. Evaluating our approach on the BioASQ challenge
tasks, we show that ensembles can outperform individual LLMs and in some cases
rival or surpass domain-tuned systems - all while preserving generalizability
and avoiding the need for costly fine-tuning or labeled data. Our method
aggregates outputs from multiple LLM variants, including models from Anthropic
and Google, to synthesize more accurate and robust answers. Moreover, our
investigation highlights a relationship between context length and performance:
while expanded contexts are meant to provide valuable evidence, they
simultaneously risk information dilution and model disorientation. These
findings emphasize IR as a critical foundation in Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) approaches for biomedical QA systems. Precise, focused
retrieval remains essential for ensuring LLMs operate within relevant
information boundaries when generating answers from retrieved documents. Our
results establish that ensemble-based zero-shot approaches, when paired with
effective RAG pipelines, constitute a practical and scalable alternative to
domain-tuned systems for biomedical question answering.

TL;DR: 本研究首次全面评估了医学领域大语言模型的记忆现象，发现记忆在所有适应场景中普遍存在且显著高于通用领域，可分为有益、无信息和有害三类记忆，并提出了相应的实用建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在医学领域展现出巨大潜力，但一个关键问题仍未解决：LLMs在多大程度上记忆医学训练数据。本研究旨在系统评估医学LLMs的记忆现象及其影响。

Method: 系统分析了三种常见适应场景：(1)医学语料库上的持续预训练，(2)标准医学基准上的微调，(3)真实世界临床数据上的微调（包括耶鲁纽黑文健康系统的13,000+住院记录）。评估了记忆的普遍性、特征、数量和下游影响。

Result: 记忆在所有适应场景中普遍存在且显著高于通用领域。记忆可分为三类：有益记忆（准确回忆临床指南和生物医学参考文献）、无信息记忆（重复免责声明或模板化医学文档语言）、有害记忆（再生数据集特定或敏感临床内容）。

Conclusion: 记忆现象影响医学LLMs的开发和采用。基于研究发现，提出了实用建议：促进有益记忆以增强领域特定推理和事实准确性，最小化无信息记忆以促进超越表面模式的深度学习，减轻有害记忆以防止敏感或可识别患者信息泄露。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in
medicine. To date, LLMs have been widely applied to tasks such as diagnostic
assistance, medical question answering, and clinical information synthesis.
However, a key open question remains: to what extent do LLMs memorize medical
training data. In this study, we present the first comprehensive evaluation of
memorization of LLMs in medicine, assessing its prevalence (how frequently it
occurs), characteristics (what is memorized), volume (how much content is
memorized), and potential downstream impacts (how memorization may affect
medical applications). We systematically analyze common adaptation scenarios:
(1) continued pretraining on medical corpora, (2) fine-tuning on standard
medical benchmarks, and (3) fine-tuning on real-world clinical data, including
over 13,000 unique inpatient records from Yale New Haven Health System. The
results demonstrate that memorization is prevalent across all adaptation
scenarios and significantly higher than reported in the general domain.
Memorization affects both the development and adoption of LLMs in medicine and
can be categorized into three types: beneficial (e.g., accurate recall of
clinical guidelines and biomedical references), uninformative (e.g., repeated
disclaimers or templated medical document language), and harmful (e.g.,
regeneration of dataset-specific or sensitive clinical content). Based on these
findings, we offer practical recommendations to facilitate beneficial
memorization that enhances domain-specific reasoning and factual accuracy,
minimize uninformative memorization to promote deeper learning beyond
surface-level patterns, and mitigate harmful memorization to prevent the
leakage of sensitive or identifiable patient information.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了OTESGN模型，通过最优传输增强的句法-语义图网络，结合句法图感知注意力和语义最优传输注意力，在ABSA任务中实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于句法树和方面感知注意力的方法难以建模复杂语义关系，线性点积特征无法捕捉非线性关联，导致无关词汇的噪声相似性掩盖关键观点词。

Method: 提出OTESGN模型，包含句法图感知注意力挖掘潜在句法依赖、语义最优传输注意力发现细粒度语义对齐，以及自适应注意力融合模块整合异构特征，并使用对比正则化提高鲁棒性。

Result: 在Twitter数据集上F1分数提升1.01%，在Laptop14数据集上提升1.30%，达到最先进水平。消融研究和可视化分析验证了其在精确定位观点词和抗噪声方面的有效性。

Conclusion: OTESGN通过句法-语义协同注意力机制，有效解决了ABSA任务中复杂语义关系建模和噪声干扰问题，显著提升了性能表现。

Abstract: Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) aims to identify aspect terms and
determine their sentiment polarity. While dependency trees combined with
contextual semantics effectively identify aspect sentiment, existing methods
relying on syntax trees and aspect-aware attention struggle to model complex
semantic relationships. Their dependence on linear dot-product features fails
to capture nonlinear associations, allowing noisy similarity from irrelevant
words to obscure key opinion terms. Motivated by Differentiable Optimal
Matching, we propose the Optimal Transport Enhanced Syntactic-Semantic Graph
Network (OTESGN), which introduces a Syntactic-Semantic Collaborative
Attention. It comprises a Syntactic Graph-Aware Attention for mining latent
syntactic dependencies and modeling global syntactic topology, as well as a
Semantic Optimal Transport Attention designed to uncover fine-grained semantic
alignments amidst textual noise, thereby accurately capturing sentiment signals
obscured by irrelevant tokens. A Adaptive Attention Fusion module integrates
these heterogeneous features, and contrastive regularization further improves
robustness. Experiments demonstrate that OTESGN achieves state-of-the-art
results, outperforming previous best models by +1.01% F1 on Twitter and +1.30%
F1 on Laptop14 benchmarks. Ablative studies and visual analyses corroborate its
efficacy in precise localization of opinion words and noise resistance.

TL;DR: X-Teaming Evolutionary M2S是一个自动化框架，通过语言模型引导的进化来发现和优化M2S模板，将多轮红队测试压缩为单轮结构化提示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的M2S方法依赖少量手动编写的模板，需要自动化方法来发现和优化更有效的单轮红队测试提示模板。

Method: 采用语言模型引导的进化框架，结合12个来源的智能采样和基于StrongREJECT的LLM-as-judge评估方法，设置成功阈值θ=0.70进行选择压力。

Result: 获得了5个进化世代、2个新模板家族，在GPT-4.1上达到44.8%的总体成功率（103/230）。跨模型评估显示结构增益可迁移但随目标模型变化，某些模型在相同阈值下得分为零。

Conclusion: 结构级搜索是获得更强单轮探测的可重复途径，强调了阈值校准和跨模型评估的重要性，同时发现提示长度与得分之间存在正相关关系。

Abstract: Multi-turn-to-single-turn (M2S) compresses iterative red-teaming into one
structured prompt, but prior work relied on a handful of manually written
templates. We present X-Teaming Evolutionary M2S, an automated framework that
discovers and optimizes M2S templates through language-model-guided evolution.
The system pairs smart sampling from 12 sources with an LLM-as-judge inspired
by StrongREJECT and records fully auditable logs.
  Maintaining selection pressure by setting the success threshold to $\theta =
0.70$, we obtain five evolutionary generations, two new template families, and
44.8% overall success (103/230) on GPT-4.1. A balanced cross-model panel of
2,500 trials (judge fixed) shows that structural gains transfer but vary by
target; two models score zero at the same threshold. We also find a positive
coupling between prompt length and score, motivating length-aware judging.
  Our results demonstrate that structure-level search is a reproducible route
to stronger single-turn probes and underscore the importance of threshold
calibration and cross-model evaluation. Code, configurations, and artifacts are

TL;DR: DSM是一种流式多模态序列到序列学习框架，通过引入延迟对齐机制，在保持流式推理的同时实现高性能的序列生成


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统序列到序列学习中离线处理或复杂策略选择的问题，提供更灵活高效的流式多模态序列生成方案

Method: 使用仅解码器语言模型，通过预处理步骤对齐多模态流并引入适当延迟，支持任意长度的输入输出序列

Result: 在自动语音识别和文本转语音任务上达到最先进性能，延迟低且支持任意长序列，甚至可与离线基线竞争

Conclusion: DSM为流式多模态序列到序列学习提供了通用且高效的解决方案，具有广泛的应用前景

Abstract: We introduce Delayed Streams Modeling (DSM), a flexible formulation for
streaming, multimodal sequence-to-sequence learning. Sequence-to-sequence
generation is often cast in an offline manner, where the model consumes the
complete input sequence before generating the first output timestep.
Alternatively, streaming sequence-to-sequence rely on learning a policy for
choosing when to advance on the input stream, or write to the output stream.
DSM instead models already time-aligned streams with a decoder-only language
model. By moving the alignment to a pre-processing step,and introducing
appropriate delays between streams, DSM provides streaming inference of
arbitrary output sequences, from any input combination, making it applicable to
many sequence-to-sequence problems. In particular, given text and audio
streams, automatic speech recognition (ASR) corresponds to the text stream
being delayed, while the opposite gives a text-to-speech (TTS) model. We
perform extensive experiments for these two major sequence-to-sequence tasks,
showing that DSM provides state-of-the-art performance and latency while
supporting arbitrary long sequences, being even competitive with offline
baselines. Code, samples and demos are available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现不同自回归Transformer架构在事实召回机制上存在显著差异，特别是Qwen模型在早期注意力层而非MLP层处理事实信息


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解Transformer语言模型如何存储和检索事实关联对于提高可解释性和实现针对性模型编辑至关重要，但先前研究主要基于GPT模型，不清楚这些发现是否适用于其他自回归架构

Method: 对多个模型（GPT、LLaMA、Qwen和DeepSeek）进行事实召回的综合评估，分析事实信息在何处以及如何被编码和访问

Result: 发现基于Qwen的模型表现出不同于以往模式的行为：最早层的注意力模块比MLP模块对事实召回的贡献更大

Conclusion: 即使在自回归Transformer家族内部，架构变化也会导致根本不同的事实召回机制

Abstract: Understanding how Transformer-based language models store and retrieve
factual associations is critical for improving interpretability and enabling
targeted model editing. Prior work, primarily on GPT-style models, has
identified MLP modules in early layers as key contributors to factual recall.
However, it remains unclear whether these findings generalize across different
autoregressive architectures. To address this, we conduct a comprehensive
evaluation of factual recall across several models -- including GPT, LLaMA,
Qwen, and DeepSeek -- analyzing where and how factual information is encoded
and accessed. Consequently, we find that Qwen-based models behave differently
from previous patterns: attention modules in the earliest layers contribute
more to factual recall than MLP modules. Our findings suggest that even within
the autoregressive Transformer family, architectural variations can lead to
fundamentally different mechanisms of factual recall.

TL;DR: 提出一种新的无监督注释评估方法CAI比率，通过学生模型与噪声教师(LLM)协作来评估和提升注释质量，无需人工反馈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在动态、无监督环境中，传统方法难以评估LLM注释质量，需要一种无需人工反馈的评估方法。

Method: 设计了一种氓代注释范式，学生模型作为无监督反馈机制，采用用户偏好多数投票策略评估LLM输出的一致性，并提出CAI比率指标。

Result: 在10个开放域NLP数据集和4个LLM上进行实验，CAI比率与LLM准确率呈强正相关关系。

Conclusion: CAI比率是一种有效的无监督评估指标，可用于动态环境中的模型选择和质量评估。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), when paired with prompt-based tasks, have
significantly reduced data annotation costs and reliance on human annotators.
However, evaluating the quality of their annotations remains challenging in
dynamic, unsupervised environments where oracle feedback is scarce and
conventional methods fail. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
agentic annotation paradigm, where a student model collaborates with a noisy
teacher (the LLM) to assess and refine annotation quality without relying on
oracle feedback. The student model, acting as an unsupervised feedback
mechanism, employs a user preference-based majority voting strategy to evaluate
the consistency of the LLM outputs. To systematically measure the reliability
of LLM-generated annotations, we introduce the Consistent and Inconsistent
(CAI) Ratio, a novel unsupervised evaluation metric. The CAI Ratio not only
quantifies the annotation quality of the noisy teacher under limited user
preferences but also plays a critical role in model selection, enabling the
identification of robust LLMs in dynamic, unsupervised environments. Applied to
ten open-domain NLP datasets across four LLMs, the CAI Ratio demonstrates a
strong positive correlation with LLM accuracy, establishing it as an essential
tool for unsupervised evaluation and model selection in real-world settings.

TL;DR: 提出MoVoC方法，将形态学分析融入子词分词，为吉兹文字语言提供形态感知的分词方案，虽然机器翻译质量提升有限，但在形态学指标上表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决子词分词方法在低资源、形态复杂语言（如吉兹文字语言）中无法保持形态边界的问题，提升语言学的保真度和分词效率。

Method: 结合监督形态分析和BPE分词，创建混合分割方法MoVoC-Tok，使用形态基元和BPE标记来保持形态完整性。

Result: 在自动翻译质量上没有显著提升，但在内在指标MorphoScore和Boundary Precision上表现一致改善，分词效率更高。

Conclusion: 形态感知分词在提升语言学保真度方面有价值，发布了标注数据和分词器以支持低资源形态丰富语言的进一步研究。

Abstract: Subword-based tokenization methods often fail to preserve morphological
boundaries, a limitation especially pronounced in low-resource, morphologically
complex languages such as those written in the Geez script. To address this, we
present MoVoC (Morpheme-aware Subword Vocabulary Construction) and train
MoVoC-Tok, a tokenizer that integrates supervised morphological analysis into
the subword vocabulary. This hybrid segmentation approach combines
morpheme-based and Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) tokens to preserve morphological
integrity while maintaining lexical meaning. To tackle resource scarcity, we
curate and release manually annotated morpheme data for four Geez script
languages and a morpheme-aware vocabulary for two of them. While the proposed
tokenization method does not lead to significant gains in automatic translation
quality, we observe consistent improvements in intrinsic metrics, MorphoScore,
and Boundary Precision, highlighting the value of morphology-aware segmentation
in enhancing linguistic fidelity and token efficiency. Our morpheme-annotated
datasets and tokenizer will be publicly available to support further research
in low-resource, morphologically rich languages. Our code and data are

Method: 采用可扩展的网络数据采集方法，构建8461萄牙语120B标记语料库。使用持续预训练设置，研究不同数据选择和预处理策略，包括语言特定过滤流水线、STEM分类器和毒性内容识别。

Result: 葡萄牙语语料库达到了与商业级语料库竞争的性能。适配模型到目标语言导致性能提升，强调了高质量语言特定数据的重要性。语言特定过滤管道显示出明显价值。

Conclusion: 研究提供了可扩展的方法来构建高质量多语言训练语料库，虽然案例研究重点在葡萄牙语，但方法适用于其他语言，为多语言LLM开发提供了重要见解。

Abstract: The performance of large language models (LLMs) is deeply influenced by the
quality and composition of their training data. While much of the existing work
has centered on English, there remains a gap in understanding how to construct
effective training corpora for other languages. We explore scalable methods for
building web-based corpora for LLMs. We apply them to build a new 120B token
corpus in Portuguese that achieves competitive results to an industrial-grade
corpus. Using a continual pretraining setup, we study how different data
selection and preprocessing strategies affect LLM performance when
transitioning a model originally trained in English to another language. Our
findings demonstrate the value of language-specific filtering pipelines,
including classifiers for education, science, technology, engineering, and
mathematics (STEM), as well as toxic content. We show that adapting a model to
the target language leads to performance improvements, reinforcing the
importance of high-quality, language-specific data. While our case study
focuses on Portuguese, our methods are applicable to other languages, offering
insights for multilingual LLM development.

Method: 复现21项已发表社会科学研究的37个数据标注任务，使用18个不同模型生成1300万个标签，测试2361个实际假设来分析研究者选择对统计结论的影响。

Result: 现有最优模型约1/3偏差导致错误结论，小模型一半偏差导致错误结论。高任务性能和更好模型能力能减少风险，但不能完全消除。人工标注有助减少偏差，但常见的回归校正技术效果有限。

Conclusion: LLM在社会科学研究中存在重大的系统性偏差风险，需要严格的验证和人工标注来确保研究结果的可靠性，以免LLM hacking导致的统计错误。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly transforming social science research
by enabling the automation of labor-intensive tasks like data annotation and
text analysis. However, LLM outputs vary significantly depending on the
implementation choices made by researchers (e.g., model selection, prompting
strategy, or temperature settings). Such variation can introduce systematic
biases and random errors, which propagate to downstream analyses and cause Type
I, Type II, Type S, or Type M errors. We call this LLM hacking.
  We quantify the risk of LLM hacking by replicating 37 data annotation tasks
from 21 published social science research studies with 18 different models.
Analyzing 13 million LLM labels, we test 2,361 realistic hypotheses to measure
how plausible researcher choices affect statistical conclusions. We find
incorrect conclusions based on LLM-annotated data in approximately one in three
hypotheses for state-of-the-art models, and in half the hypotheses for small
language models. While our findings show that higher task performance and
better general model capabilities reduce LLM hacking risk, even highly accurate
models do not completely eliminate it. The risk of LLM hacking decreases as
effect sizes increase, indicating the need for more rigorous verification of
findings near significance thresholds. Our extensive analysis of LLM hacking
mitigation techniques emphasizes the importance of human annotations in
reducing false positive findings and improving model selection. Surprisingly,
common regression estimator correction techniques are largely ineffective in
reducing LLM hacking risk, as they heavily trade off Type I vs. Type II errors.
  Beyond accidental errors, we find that intentional LLM hacking is
unacceptably simple. With few LLMs and just a handful of prompt paraphrases,
anything can be presented as statistically significant.

Abstract: In this paper, we survey recent advances in Reinforcement Learning (RL) for
reasoning with Large Language Models (LLMs). RL has achieved remarkable success
in advancing the frontier of LLM capabilities, particularly in addressing
complex logical tasks such as mathematics and coding. As a result, RL has
emerged as a foundational methodology for transforming LLMs into LRMs. With the
rapid progress of the field, further scaling of RL for LRMs now faces
foundational challenges not only in computational resources but also in
algorithm design, training data, and infrastructure. To this end, it is timely
to revisit the development of this domain, reassess its trajectory, and explore
strategies to enhance the scalability of RL toward Artificial SuperIntelligence

reasoning abilities, especially since the release of DeepSeek-R1, including
foundational components, core problems, training resources, and downstream
applications, to identify future opportunities and directions for this rapidly
evolving area. We hope this review will promote future research on RL for

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了两种基于学习的动态目标定位方法（强化学习和模仿学习），用于优化地球观测卫星的数据采集效率，在积累科学信息方面显著超过传统惯例方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 地球观测卫星存在轨道偏移困难、传感器视野有限、资源消耗大等限制，需要优化数据采集策略，动态目标定位把握住最重要的科学信息。

Method: 使用强化学习和模仿学习两种方法，基于动态规划解决方案来规划采样位置序列。

Result: 模仿学习比最佳惯例方法平均提高10.0%，强化学习平均提高13.7%，且都可以用较少数据有效训练。

Conclusion: 学习方法在动态目标定位应用中显示出显著优势，能够提高地球观测卫星的科学数据采集效率。

Abstract: Earth observing satellites are powerful tools for collecting scientific
information about our planet, however they have limitations: they cannot easily
deviate from their orbital trajectories, their sensors have a limited field of
view, and pointing and operating these sensors can take a large amount of the
spacecraft's resources. It is important for these satellites to optimize the
data they collect and include only the most important or informative
measurements. Dynamic targeting is an emerging concept in which satellite
resources and data from a lookahead instrument are used to intelligently
reconfigure and point a primary instrument. Simulation studies have shown that
dynamic targeting increases the amount of scientific information gathered
versus conventional sampling strategies. In this work, we present two different
learning-based approaches to dynamic targeting, using reinforcement and
imitation learning, respectively. These learning methods build on a dynamic
programming solution to plan a sequence of sampling locations. We evaluate our
approaches against existing heuristic methods for dynamic targeting, showing
the benefits of using learning for this application. Imitation learning
performs on average 10.0\% better than the best heuristic method, while
reinforcement learning performs on average 13.7\% better. We also show that
both learning methods can be trained effectively with relatively small amounts
of data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开源软件仓库数量庞大但复用过程仍依赖人工，存在文档理解、API学习和集成代码编写等障碍，需要更智能的自动化解决方案来提升软件复用效率。

Method: 采用三阶段方法：1)TODO引导的环境初始化；2)人类对齐的代理自动化；3)代理间(A2A)协作协议，结合大语言模型能力和结构化工具集成。

Result: 在GitTaskBench基准测试的18个跨领域仓库中，EnvX实现了74.07%的执行完成率和51.85%的任务通过率，优于现有框架，并能支持多仓库协作。

Conclusion: EnvX将仓库从被动代码资源转变为智能交互代理，标志着开源生态系统向更易访问和协作的方向发展。

Abstract: The widespread availability of open-source repositories has led to a vast
collection of reusable software components, yet their utilization remains
manual, error-prone, and disconnected. Developers must navigate documentation,
understand APIs, and write integration code, creating significant barriers to
efficient software reuse. To address this, we present EnvX, a framework that
leverages Agentic AI to agentize GitHub repositories, transforming them into
intelligent, autonomous agents capable of natural language interaction and
inter-agent collaboration. Unlike existing approaches that treat repositories
as static code resources, EnvX reimagines them as active agents through a
three-phase process: (1) TODO-guided environment initialization, which sets up
the necessary dependencies, data, and validation datasets; (2) human-aligned
agentic automation, allowing repository-specific agents to autonomously perform
real-world tasks; and (3) Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol, enabling multiple
agents to collaborate. By combining large language model capabilities with
structured tool integration, EnvX automates not just code generation, but the
entire process of understanding, initializing, and operationalizing repository
functionality. We evaluate EnvX on the GitTaskBench benchmark, using 18
repositories across domains such as image processing, speech recognition,
document analysis, and video manipulation. Our results show that EnvX achieves
a 74.07% execution completion rate and 51.85% task pass rate, outperforming
existing frameworks. Case studies further demonstrate EnvX's ability to enable
multi-repository collaboration via the A2A protocol. This work marks a shift
from treating repositories as passive code resources to intelligent,
interactive agents, fostering greater accessibility and collaboration within
the open-source ecosystem.

TL;DR: 提出基于大AI模型的师生代理架构2TSD模型，通过服务器端教师代理提取任务特定信任语义，减少设备端评估开销并提高协作选择准确性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决设备间协作信任评估中数据交换频繁、推理复杂、动态变化导致的显著开销和评估质量下降问题

Method: 采用LAM驱动的师生代理架构，服务器端教师代理负责多维信任数据收集、任务特定信任语义提取和任务-协作匹配分析，设备端学生代理接收信任语义进行快速协作选择

Result: 实验结果表明2TSD模型能减少协作评估时间、降低设备资源消耗、提高协作选择准确性

Conclusion: 所提出的2TSD模型通过任务特定信任语义蒸馏，有效解决了分布式协作环境中的信任评估挑战

Abstract: Accurate trustworthiness evaluation of potential collaborating devices is
essential for the effective execution of complex computing tasks. This
evaluation process involves collecting diverse trust-related data from
potential collaborators, including historical performance and available
resources, for collaborator selection. However, when each task owner
independently assesses all collaborators' trustworthiness, frequent data
exchange, complex reasoning, and dynamic situation changes can result in
significant overhead and deteriorated trust evaluation. To overcome these
challenges, we propose a task-specific trust semantics distillation (2TSD)
model based on a large AI model (LAM)-driven teacher-student agent
architecture. The teacher agent is deployed on a server with powerful
computational capabilities and an augmented memory module dedicated to
multidimensional trust-related data collection, task-specific trust semantics
extraction, and task-collaborator matching analysis. Upon receiving
task-specific requests from device-side student agents, the teacher agent
transfers the trust semantics of potential collaborators to the student agents,
enabling rapid and accurate collaborator selection. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed 2TSD model can reduce collaborator evaluation
time, decrease device resource consumption, and improve the accuracy of
collaborator selection.

Motivation: 解决具身智能体在动态非平稳环境中持续执行指令的挑战，增强LLM的环境推理能力，将任务规划与变化的环境上下文有效结合。

Method: 提出探索性检索增强规划框架，包括：1）信息探索与LLM规划集成；2）记忆增强查询评估；3）时间一致性精化处理知识衰减问题。

Result: 在VirtualHome、ALFRED和CARLA等基准测试中，该方法对各种指令规模、类型和非平稳度场景都表现出鲁棒性，在目标成功率和执行效率方面均优于现有最先进的LLM任务规划方法。

Conclusion: ExRAP框架通过有效平衡环境探索负载和记忆有效性，显著提升了具身智能体在动态环境中的持续指令跟随性能，为解决非平稳环境中的任务规划问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: This study presents an Exploratory Retrieval-Augmented Planning (ExRAP)
framework, designed to tackle continual instruction following tasks of embodied
agents in dynamic, non-stationary environments. The framework enhances Large
Language Models' (LLMs) embodied reasoning capabilities by efficiently
exploring the physical environment and establishing the environmental context
memory, thereby effectively grounding the task planning process in time-varying
environment contexts. In ExRAP, given multiple continual instruction following
tasks, each instruction is decomposed into queries on the environmental context
memory and task executions conditioned on the query results. To efficiently
handle these multiple tasks that are performed continuously and simultaneously,
we implement an exploration-integrated task planning scheme by incorporating
the {information-based exploration} into the LLM-based planning process.
Combined with memory-augmented query evaluation, this integrated scheme not
only allows for a better balance between the validity of the environmental
context memory and the load of environment exploration, but also improves
overall task performance. Furthermore, we devise a {temporal consistency
refinement} scheme for query evaluation to address the inherent decay of
knowledge in the memory. Through experiments with VirtualHome, ALFRED, and
CARLA, our approach demonstrates robustness against a variety of embodied
instruction following scenarios involving different instruction scales and
types, and non-stationarity degrees, and it consistently outperforms other
state-of-the-art LLM-based task planning approaches in terms of both goal
success rate and execution efficiency.

technology, generating and distributing music has become more diverse and
accessible. In this context, interest in music intellectual property protection
is increasing to safeguard individual music copyrights. In this work, we
propose a system for detecting music plagiarism by combining various MIR

musically meaningful segments from audio recordings to detect plagiarism across
different musical formats. With this system, we compute similarity scores based
on multiple musical features that can be evaluated through comprehensive
musical analysis. Our approach demonstrated promising results in music
plagiarism detection experiments, and the proposed method can be applied to
real-world music scenarios. We also collected a Similar Music Pair (SMP)
dataset for musical similarity research using real-world cases. The dataset are

Abstract: The evolution toward Level 4 (L4) Autonomous Networks (AN) represents a
strategic inflection point in telecommunications, where networks must transcend
reactive automation to achieve genuine cognitive capabilities--fulfilling TM
Forum's vision of self-configuring, self-healing, and self-optimizing systems
that deliver zero-wait, zero-touch, and zero-fault services. This work bridges
the gap between architectural theory and operational reality by implementing
Joseph Sifakis's AN Agent reference architecture in a functional cognitive
system, deploying coordinated proactive-reactive runtimes driven by hybrid
knowledge representation. Through an empirical case study of a Radio Access
Network (RAN) Link Adaptation (LA) Agent, we validate this framework's
transformative potential: demonstrating sub-10 ms real-time control in 5G NR
sub-6 GHz while achieving 6% higher downlink throughput than Outer Loop Link
Adaptation (OLLA) algorithms and 67% Block Error Rate (BLER) reduction for
ultra-reliable services through dynamic Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS)
optimization. These improvements confirm the architecture's viability in
overcoming traditional autonomy barriers and advancing critical L4-enabling
capabilities toward next-generation objectives.

Abstract: Generating regulatorily compliant Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) remains a
high-cost, low-scalability bottleneck in Anti-Money Laundering (AML) workflows.
While large language models (LLMs) offer promising fluency, they suffer from
factual hallucination, limited crime typology alignment, and poor
explainability -- posing unacceptable risks in compliance-critical domains.
This paper introduces Co-Investigator AI, an agentic framework optimized to
produce Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) significantly faster and with
greater accuracy than traditional methods. Drawing inspiration from recent
advances in autonomous agent architectures, such as the AI Co-Scientist, our
approach integrates specialized agents for planning, crime type detection,
external intelligence gathering, and compliance validation. The system features
dynamic memory management, an AI-Privacy Guard layer for sensitive data
handling, and a real-time validation agent employing the Agent-as-a-Judge
paradigm to ensure continuous narrative quality assurance. Human investigators
remain firmly in the loop, empowered to review and refine drafts in a
collaborative workflow that blends AI efficiency with domain expertise. We
demonstrate the versatility of Co-Investigator AI across a range of complex
financial crime scenarios, highlighting its ability to streamline SAR drafting,
align narratives with regulatory expectations, and enable compliance teams to
focus on higher-order analytical work. This approach marks the beginning of a
new era in compliance reporting -- bringing the transformative benefits of AI
agents to the core of regulatory processes and paving the way for scalable,
reliable, and transparent SAR generation.

Result: 在ALFWorld环境中实现26.67%的平均成功率，相比RL4VLM提升6%，有效缓解了微调后的模型退化问题。

Conclusion: TCPO方法证明了将偏好学习技术与思维链过程结合可以显著增强视觉语言模型在具身智能体中的决策能力，为解决动态环境中的模型对齐问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Using effective generalization capabilities of vision language models (VLMs)
in context-specific dynamic tasks for embodied artificial intelligence remains
a significant challenge. Although supervised fine-tuned models can better align
with the real physical world, they still exhibit sluggish responses and
hallucination issues in dynamically changing environments, necessitating
further alignment. Existing post-SFT methods, reliant on reinforcement learning
and chain-of-thought (CoT) approaches, are constrained by sparse rewards and
action-only optimization, resulting in low sample efficiency, poor consistency,
and model degradation. To address these issues, this paper proposes
Thought-Centric Preference Optimization (TCPO) for effective embodied
decision-making. Specifically, TCPO introduces a stepwise preference-based
optimization approach, transforming sparse reward signals into richer step
sample pairs. It emphasizes the alignment of the model's intermediate reasoning
process, mitigating the problem of model degradation. Moreover, by
incorporating Action Policy Consistency Constraint (APC), it further imposes
consistency constraints on the model output. Experiments in the ALFWorld
environment demonstrate an average success rate of 26.67%, achieving a 6%
improvement over RL4VLM and validating the effectiveness of our approach in
mitigating model degradation after fine-tuning. These results highlight the
potential of integrating preference-based learning techniques with CoT
processes to enhance the decision-making capabilities of vision-language models
in embodied agents.

TL;DR: 利用LLM作为判官评估其他LLM时，通过逻辑一致性分析不同判官的分歧来证明至少有一个判官评分能力不达标，开发了无偏差的警报机制


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM作为判官评估其他LLM时的监督问题，避免无限监控链条，在不知道真实答案且不想完全信任专家的情况下提高评估的可靠性

Method: 通过观察不同LLM判官在评分其他LLM时的一致性和分歧，将逻辑一致性形式化为整数规划问题，计算判官评分能力的唯一可能评估

Result: 开发了一种无知识警报机制，可以在没有偏差的情况下检测到至少一个判官漏洞违反用户指定的评分能力要求

Conclusion: 利用逻辑一致性可以在不知道真实答案的情况下有效监控LLM判官的评分质量，提供了一种可靠的警报机制来检测判官缺陷

Abstract: If we use LLMs as judges to evaluate the complex decisions of other LLMs, who
or what monitors the judges? Infinite monitoring chains are inevitable whenever
we do not know the ground truth of the decisions by experts and we do not want
to trust them. One way to ameliorate our evaluation uncertainty is to exploit
the use of logical consistency between disagreeing experts. By observing how
LLM judges agree and disagree while grading other LLMs, we can compute the only
possible evaluations of their grading ability. For example, if two LLM judges
disagree on which tasks a third one completed correctly, they cannot both be
100\% correct in their judgments. This logic can be formalized as a Linear
Programming problem in the space of integer response counts for any finite
test. We use it here to develop no-knowledge alarms for misaligned LLM judges.
The alarms can detect, with no false positives, that at least one member or
more of an ensemble of judges are violating a user specified grading ability
requirement.

Motivation: 多智能体系统在实际部署中面临故障归因的严峻挑战，现有基于统计相关性的诊断工具在复杂基准测试中准确率不足15%，无法有效定位故障根因步骤。

Method: 1) 性能因果反转原理：通过反转执行日志中的数据流正确建模性能依赖关系，结合Shapley值准确分配智能体级责任；2) CDC-MAS因果发现算法：针对MAS交互数据的非平稳特性，鲁棒地识别关键故障步骤。

Result: 在Who&When和TRAIL基准测试中，方法达到36.2%的步骤级准确率，生成的优化方案平均提升22.4%的整体任务成功率。

Conclusion: 该工作为调试复杂智能体交互提供了原则性和有效的解决方案，为构建更可靠和可解释的多智能体系统铺平了道路。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) are critical for automating complex tasks, yet
their practical deployment is severely hampered by the challenge of failure
attribution. Current diagnostic tools, which rely on statistical correlations,
are fundamentally inadequate; on challenging benchmarks like Who\&When,
state-of-the-art methods achieve less than 15\% accuracy in locating the
root-cause step of a failure. To address this critical gap, we introduce the
first failure attribution framework for MAS grounded in multi-granularity
causal inference. Our approach makes two key technical contributions: (1) a
performance causal inversion principle, which correctly models performance
dependencies by reversing the data flow in execution logs, combined with
Shapley values to accurately assign agent-level blame; (2) a novel causal
discovery algorithm, CDC-MAS, that robustly identifies critical failure steps
by tackling the non-stationary nature of MAS interaction data. The framework's
attribution results directly fuel an automated optimization loop, generating
targeted suggestions whose efficacy is validated via counterfactual
simulations. Evaluations on the Who\&When and TRAIL benchmarks demonstrate a
significant leap in performance. Our method achieves up to 36.2\% step-level
accuracy. Crucially, the generated optimizations boost overall task success
rates by an average of 22.4\%. This work provides a principled and effective
solution for debugging complex agent interactions, paving the way for more
reliable and interpretable multi-agent systems.

Abstract: We introduce a novel Theory of Mind (ToM) framework inspired by dual-process
theories from cognitive science, integrating a fast, habitual graph-based
reasoning system (System 1), implemented via graph convolutional networks
(GCNs), and a slower, context-sensitive meta-adaptive learning system (System
2), driven by meta-learning techniques. Our model dynamically balances
intuitive and deliberative reasoning through a learned context gate mechanism.
We validate our architecture on canonical false-belief tasks and systematically
explore its capacity to replicate hallmark cognitive biases associated with
dual-process theory, including anchoring, cognitive-load fatigue, framing
effects, and priming effects. Experimental results demonstrate that our
dual-process approach closely mirrors human adaptive behavior, achieves robust
generalization to unseen contexts, and elucidates cognitive mechanisms
underlying reasoning biases. This work bridges artificial intelligence and
cognitive theory, paving the way for AI systems exhibiting nuanced, human-like
social cognition and adaptive decision-making capabilities.

Abstract: AI scientist systems, capable of autonomously executing the full research
workflow from hypothesis generation and experimentation to paper writing, hold
significant potential for accelerating scientific discovery. However, the
internal workflow of these systems have not been closely examined. This lack of
scrutiny poses a risk of introducing flaws that could undermine the integrity,
reliability, and trustworthiness of their research outputs. In this paper, we
identify four potential failure modes in contemporary AI scientist systems:
inappropriate benchmark selection, data leakage, metric misuse, and post-hoc
selection bias. To examine these risks, we design controlled experiments that
isolate each failure mode while addressing challenges unique to evaluating AI
scientist systems. Our assessment of two prominent open-source AI scientist
systems reveals the presence of several failures, across a spectrum of
severity, which can be easily overlooked in practice. Finally, we demonstrate
that access to trace logs and code from the full automated workflow enables far
more effective detection of such failures than examining the final paper alone.
We thus recommend journals and conferences evaluating AI-generated research to
mandate submission of these artifacts alongside the paper to ensure
transparency, accountability, and reproducibility.

Method: 采用双系统架构：强化学习策略根据历史经验建议行动，语言模型通过不同故事框架处理建议来指导决策，在可配置的gridworld环境中实现

Result: 建立了一个模块化的实验平台，能够控制测试环境复杂性、故事参数以及强化学习与故事基于决策的交互作用，记录了从RL策略价值到语言模型推理的基本决策指标

Conclusion: 这个初步实现为研究不同故事框架如何影响奖励基于决策提供了基础，并为探索优化基于学习与符号推理在AI系统中的潜在交互作用创造了条件

Abstract: We present a preliminary experimental platform that explores how narrative
elements might shape AI decision-making by combining reinforcement learning
(RL) with language model reasoning. While AI systems can now both make
decisions and engage in narrative reasoning, these capabilities have mostly
been studied separately. Our platform attempts to bridge this gap using a
dual-system architecture to examine how narrative frameworks could influence
reward-based learning. The system comprises a reinforcement learning policy
that suggests actions based on past experience, and a language model that
processes these suggestions through different narrative frameworks to guide
decisions. This setup enables initial experimentation with narrative elements
while maintaining consistent environment and reward structures. We implement
this architecture in a configurable gridworld environment, where agents receive
both policy suggestions and information about their surroundings. The
platform's modular design facilitates controlled testing of environmental
complexity, narrative parameters, and the interaction between reinforcement
learning and narrative-based decisions. Our logging system captures basic
decision metrics, from RL policy values to language model reasoning to action
selection patterns. While preliminary, this implementation provides a
foundation for studying how different narrative frameworks might affect
reward-based decisions and exploring potential interactions between
optimization-based learning and symbolic reasoning in AI systems.

Motivation: 微服务架构虽然为发展可扩展的现代软件系统提供了基础，但也带来管理异构分布式数据的重大挑战，需要找到有效的数据持久化解决方案。

Method: 结合理论概念与实践实施证据，对关系型、文档型、键值型、列家族型和图形数据库进行比较性基准测评，采用行业案例研究（如Netflix、Uber、Shopify）和调查数据分析实际采用趋势和挑战。

Result: 研究结果显示多语言持久化能够提高系统的适应性、性能和领域对齐能力，但同时也增加了管理和运维复杂性。

Conclusion: 为应对多语言持久化带来的权衡挑战，需要采用架构模式如saga工作流程、事件源汇总和外部集成等方法来管理数据一致性和集成复杂性。

Abstract: Microservices architectures have become the foundation for developing
scalable and modern software systems, but they also bring significant
challenges in managing heterogeneous and distributed data. The pragmatic
solution is polyglot persistence, the deliberate use of several different
database technologies adapted to a given microservice requirement - is one such
strategy. This paper examines polyglot persistence in microservice based
systems. This paper brings together theoretical concepts with evidence from
practical implementations and comparative benchmarks of standard database
platforms. A comparative framework is applied to relational, document,
key-value, column-family and graph databases to assess scalability,
consistency, query expressiveness, operational overhead and integration ease.
Empirical data drawn from industry case studies such as Netflix, Uber, and
Shopify, and survey data illustrate real-life adoption trends and challenges.
These findings demonstrate that polyglot persistence increases adaptability ,
performance , domain alignment but also governance or operational complexity.
To cope with such trade-offs, architectural patterns such as saga workflows,
event sourcing, and outbox integration are discussed.

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 本文提出了个性化w-event隐私保护机制，允许不同用户有不同的隐私需求，设计了PWSM、PBD和PBA三种方法，在满足隐私要求的同时显著提高了数据流估计的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的w-event隐私研究主要关注所有用户的同质隐私需求，但在实际应用中不同用户可能有不同的隐私保护要求，因此需要个性化的隐私保护方案。

Method: 提出了三种机制：PWSM（个性化窗口大小机制）允许用户在每个时间槽保持恒定隐私要求；PBD（个性化预算分配）确保为下一个时间步骤提供至少与之前发布消耗相同的隐私预算；PBA（个性化预算吸收）完全吸收前k个时间槽的隐私预算，并借用后k个时间槽的预算来增加当前时间槽的预算。

Result: PBD在真实数据集上比BD平均减少68%的误差，PBA在合成数据集上比BA平均减少24.9%的误差，两种方法都优于现有的流估计方法。

Conclusion: 个性化w-event隐私保护机制能够有效满足不同用户的隐私需求，同时在数据流估计准确性方面显著优于现有的同质隐私保护方法。

Abstract: Streaming data collection is indispensable for stream data analysis, such as
event monitoring. However, publishing these data directly leads to privacy
leaks. $w$-event privacy is a valuable tool to protect individual privacy
within a given time window while maintaining high accuracy in data collection.
Most existing $w$-event privacy studies on infinite data stream only focus on
homogeneous privacy requirements for all users. In this paper, we propose
personalized $w$-event privacy protection that allows different users to have
different privacy requirements in private data stream estimation. Specifically,
we design a mechanism that allows users to maintain constant privacy
requirements at each time slot, namely Personalized Window Size Mechanism
(PWSM). Then, we propose two solutions to accurately estimate stream data
statistics while achieving $w$-event level $\epsilon$ personalized differential
privacy ( ($w$, $\epsilon$)-EPDP), namely Personalized Budget Distribution
(PBD) and Peronalized Budget Absorption (PBA). PBD always provides at least the
same privacy budget for the next time step as the amount consumed in the
previous release. PBA fully absorbs the privacy budget from the previous $k$
time slots, while also borrowing from the privacy budget of the next $k$ time
slots, to increase the privacy budget for the current time slot. We prove that
both PBD and PBA outperform the state-of-the-art private stream estimation
methods while satisfying the privacy requirements of all users. We demonstrate
the efficiency and effectiveness of our PBD and PBA on both real and synthetic
data sets, compared with the recent uniformity $w$-event approaches, Budget
Distribution (BD) and Budget Absorption (BA). Our PBD achieves 68% less error
than BD on average on real data sets. Besides, our PBA achieves 24.9% less
error than BA on average on synthetic data sets.

Result: 在多个真实数据集上测试显示，SINDI在不同规模、语言和模型的数据集上都达到最先进性能。在MsMarco数据集上，Recall@50超过99%时，单线程QPS比SEISMIC和PyANNs提升4.2-26.4倍。

Conclusion: SINDI有效解决了稀疏向量MIPS的性能瓶颈问题，已被集成到蚂蚁集团开源向量搜索库VSAG中，具有重要的实际应用价值。

Abstract: Sparse vector Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS) is crucial in multi-path
retrieval for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Recent inverted index-based
and graph-based algorithms have achieved high search accuracy with practical
efficiency. However, their performance in production environments is often
limited by redundant distance computations and frequent random memory accesses.
Furthermore, the compressed storage format of sparse vectors hinders the use of
SIMD acceleration. In this paper, we propose the sparse inverted non-redundant
distance index (SINDI), which incorporates three key optimizations: (i)
Efficient Inner Product Computation: SINDI leverages SIMD acceleration and
eliminates redundant identifier lookups, enabling batched inner product
computation; (ii) Memory-Friendly Design: SINDI replaces random memory accesses
to original vectors with sequential accesses to inverted lists, substantially
reducing memory-bound latency. (iii) Vector Pruning: SINDI retains only the
high-magnitude non-zero entries of vectors, improving query throughput while
maintaining accuracy. We evaluate SINDI on multiple real-world datasets.
Experimental results show that SINDI achieves state-of-the-art performance
across datasets of varying scales, languages, and models. On the MsMarco
dataset, when Recall@50 exceeds 99%, SINDI delivers single-thread
query-per-second (QPS) improvements ranging from 4.2 to 26.4 times compared
with SEISMIC and PyANNs. Notably, SINDI has been integrated into Ant Group's
open-source vector search library, VSAG.

Abstract: This article proposes a paraconsistent framework for evaluating similarity in
knowledge bases. Unlike classical approaches, this framework explicitly
integrates contradictions, enabling a more robust and interpretable similarity
measure. A new measure $ S^* $ is introduced, which penalizes inconsistencies
while rewarding shared properties. Paraconsistent super-categories $ \Xi_K^* $
are defined to hierarchically organize knowledge entities. The model also
includes a contradiction extractor $ E $ and a repair mechanism, ensuring
consistency in the evaluations. Theoretical results guarantee reflexivity,
symmetry, and boundedness of $ S^* $. This approach offers a promising solution
for managing conflicting knowledge, with perspectives in multi-agent systems.

Abstract: SQL queries in real world analytical environments, whether written by humans
or generated automatically often suffer from syntax errors, inefficiency, or
semantic misalignment, especially in complex OLAP scenarios. To address these
challenges, we propose SQLGovernor, an LLM powered SQL toolkit that unifies
multiple functionalities, including syntax correction, query rewriting, query
modification, and consistency verification within a structured framework
enhanced by knowledge management. SQLGovernor introduces a fragment wise
processing strategy to enable fine grained rewriting and localized error
correction, significantly reducing the cognitive load on the LLM. It further
incorporates a hybrid self learning mechanism guided by expert feedback,
allowing the system to continuously improve through DBMS output analysis and
rule validation. Experiments on benchmarks such as BIRD and BIRD CRITIC, as
well as industrial datasets, show that SQLGovernor consistently boosts the
performance of base models by up to 10%, while minimizing reliance on manual
expertise. Deployed in production environments, SQLGovernor demonstrates strong
practical utility and effective performance.
