TL;DR: 基于YOLOv8改进的自定义模型在CCTV监控中实时检测火舟送出口吸烟行为，达到78.90%回率和83.70% mAP，在Jetson Xavier NX边缘设备上处理速度52-97ms，适用于实时安全监控。


<details>

Abstract: A deep learning real-time smoking detection system for CCTV surveillance of
fire exit areas is proposed due to critical safety requirements. The dataset
contains 8,124 images from 20 different scenarios along with 2,708 raw samples
demonstrating low-light areas. We evaluated three advanced object detection
models: YOLOv8, YOLOv11, and YOLOv12, followed by development of a custom model
derived from YOLOv8 with added structures for challenging surveillance
contexts. The proposed model outperformed the others, achieving a recall of
78.90 percent and mAP at 50 of 83.70 percent, delivering optimal object
detection across varied environments. Performance evaluation on multiple edge
devices using multithreaded operations showed the Jetson Xavier NX processed
data at 52 to 97 milliseconds per inference, establishing its suitability for
time-sensitive operations. This system offers a robust and adaptable platform
for monitoring public safety and enabling automatic regulatory compliance.

### [2] [Separating Knowledge and Perception with Procedural Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11697)
*Adrián Rodríguez-Muñoz,Manel Baradad,Phillip Isola,Antonio Torralba*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过仅使用程序生成数据训练表征模型，结合视觉内存数据库实现了与实际图像完全隔离的强大性能，在多个认知任务上接近或超越传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统深度学习模型对实际图像数据的依赖问题，通过程序生成数据训练实现完全的数据隔离，同时保持强大的表征学习能力。

Method: 仅使用程序生成数据训练表征模型，通过显式的视觉内存数据库（参考图像嵌入的数据库）来处理视视相似性、分类和语义分割任务，无需额外训练。

Result: 在NIGHTS视觉相似性任务上与Places训练模型相差仅1%以内；在CUB200和Flowers102细粒度分类任务上分别超15%和8%；在ImageNet-1K分类任务上相差10%以内；零样本分割任务上在COCO数据集上的R²指标与实际数据训练模型相差10%以内。

Conclusion: 程序生成数据模型可以实现与实际图像完全隔离的同时保持强大性能。性能差距主要来自于同一物体不同部分在程序模型中表征不相似，导致内存搜索错误。

Abstract: We train representation models with procedural data only, and apply them on
visual similarity, classification, and semantic segmentation tasks without
further training by using visual memory -- an explicit database of reference
image embeddings. Unlike prior work on visual memory, our approach achieves
full compartmentalization with respect to all real-world images while retaining
strong performance. Compared to a model trained on Places, our procedural model
performs within $1\%$ on NIGHTS visual similarity, outperforms by $8\%$ and
$15\%$ on CUB200 and Flowers102 fine-grained classification, and is within
$10\%$ on ImageNet-1K classification. It also demonstrates strong zero-shot
segmentation, achieving an $R^2$ on COCO within $10\%$ of the models trained on
real data. Finally, we analyze procedural versus real data models, showing that
parts of the same object have dissimilar representations in procedural models,
resulting in incorrect searches in memory and explaining the remaining
performance gap.

### [3] [FusionFM: Fusing Eye-specific Foundational Models for Optimized Ophthalmic Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11721)
*Ke Zou,Jocelyn Hui Lin Goh,Yukun Zhou,Tian Lin,Samantha Min Er Yew,Sahana Srinivasan,Meng Wang,Rui Santos,Gabor M. Somfai,Huazhu Fu,Haoyu Chen,Pearse A. Keane,Ching-Yu Cheng,Yih Chung Tham*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文系统评估眼科基础模型(FMs)的表现，提出FusionFM评估框架和两种融合策略，发现DINORET和RetiZero在眼部和系统性疾病预测中表现最佳，Gating融合策略在某些病残预测中有中等改善效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 眼科基础模型虽然出现但缺乏系统性评估，需要回答哪个FM表现最好、是否在不同任务上都好、以及融合所有FM的效果如何等基本问题

Method: 提出FusionFM评估框架，包含两种融合方法，测试四个先进FM(RETFound、VisionFM、RetiZero、DINORET)，涉及眼科疾病(青光眼、糖尿病视网膜病变、黑睛变性)和系统性疾病(糖尿病、高血压)预测，使用多国标准数据集和AUC/F1指标

Result: DINORET和RetiZero在眼科和系统性疾病任务中表现最优，RetiZero在外部数据集上显示更强的泛化能力；Gating融合策略在青光眼、AMD和高血压预测中有中等改善；预测系统性疾病特别是外部群体的高血压仍面临挑战

Conclusion: 研究提供了眼科FM的证据基础评估，强调了模型融合的优势，并指明了提高临床应用性的策略方向

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) have shown great promise in medical image analysis by
improving generalization across diverse downstream tasks. In ophthalmology,
several FMs have recently emerged, but there is still no clear answer to
fundamental questions: Which FM performs the best? Are they equally good across
different tasks? What if we combine all FMs together? To our knowledge, this is
the first study to systematically evaluate both single and fused ophthalmic
FMs. To address these questions, we propose FusionFM, a comprehensive
evaluation suite, along with two fusion approaches to integrate different
ophthalmic FMs. Our framework covers both ophthalmic disease detection
(glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, and age-related macular degeneration) and
systemic disease prediction (diabetes and hypertension) based on retinal
imaging. We benchmarked four state-of-the-art FMs (RETFound, VisionFM,
RetiZero, and DINORET) using standardized datasets from multiple countries and
evaluated their performance using AUC and F1 metrics. Our results show that
DINORET and RetiZero achieve superior performance in both ophthalmic and
systemic disease tasks, with RetiZero exhibiting stronger generalization on
external datasets. Regarding fusion strategies, the Gating-based approach
provides modest improvements in predicting glaucoma, AMD, and hypertension.
Despite these advances, predicting systemic diseases, especially hypertension
in external cohort remains challenging. These findings provide an
evidence-based evaluation of ophthalmic FMs, highlight the benefits of model
fusion, and point to strategies for enhancing their clinical applicability.

### [4] [UniDCF: A Foundation Model for Comprehensive Dentocraniofacial Hard Tissue Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11728)
*Chunxia Ren,Ning Zhu,Yue Lai,Gui Chen,Ruijie Wang,Yangyi Hu,Suyao Liu,Shuwen Mao,Hong Su,Yu Zhang,Li Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniDCF是一个统一的多模态深度学习框架，能够通过点云和多视角图像的融合编码来重建多个牙颌面硬组织，解决了现有单模态方法的局限性，在几何精度、结构完整性和空间准确性方面优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 牙颌面硬组织缺损严重影响患者的生理功能、面部美观和心理健康，当前深度学习模型仅限于单组织场景和特定模态成像输入，导致泛化性差，需要在解剖保真度、计算效率和跨组织适应性之间进行权衡。

Method: UniDCF通过点云和多视角图像的多模态融合编码，利用各模态的互补优势，并加入基于分数的去噪模块来优化表面平滑度，构建了包含6,609名患者54,555个标注实例的最大多模态数据集。

Result: 评估显示UniDCF在几何精度、结构完整性和空间准确性方面优于现有最先进方法。临床模拟表明UniDCF将重建设计时间减少99%，临床医生接受率超过94%。

Conclusion: UniDCF实现了快速、自动化、高保真度的重建，支持个性化和精确的修复治疗，简化临床工作流程，改善患者治疗效果。

Abstract: Dentocraniofacial hard tissue defects profoundly affect patients'
physiological functions, facial aesthetics, and psychological well-being,
posing significant challenges for precise reconstruction. Current deep learning
models are limited to single-tissue scenarios and modality-specific imaging
inputs, resulting in poor generalizability and trade-offs between anatomical
fidelity, computational efficiency, and cross-tissue adaptability. Here we
introduce UniDCF, a unified framework capable of reconstructing multiple
dentocraniofacial hard tissues through multimodal fusion encoding of point
clouds and multi-view images. By leveraging the complementary strengths of each
modality and incorporating a score-based denoising module to refine surface
smoothness, UniDCF overcomes the limitations of prior single-modality
approaches. We curated the largest multimodal dataset, comprising intraoral
scans, CBCT, and CT from 6,609 patients, resulting in 54,555 annotated
instances. Evaluations demonstrate that UniDCF outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods in terms of geometric precision, structural
completeness, and spatial accuracy. Clinical simulations indicate UniDCF
reduces reconstruction design time by 99% and achieves clinician-rated
acceptability exceeding 94%. Overall, UniDCF enables rapid, automated, and
high-fidelity reconstruction, supporting personalized and precise restorative
treatments, streamlining clinical workflows, and enhancing patient outcomes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Ovis2.5是一个多模态大语言模型的升级版本，采用原生分辨率视觉Transformer处理图像，避免固定分辨率分块带来的质量下降，并通过反思机制增强推理能力。模型在OpenCompass多模态排行榜上取得78.3分，在40B参数以下的开源模型中达到SOTA水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决固定分辨率图像处理导致的细节丢失和全局布局破坏问题，特别是在处理复杂图表等视觉密集内容时，需要开发能够处理原生分辨率图像并具备更强推理能力的多模态模型。

Method: 采用原生分辨率视觉Transformer处理可变分辨率图像，引入反思机制（包括自检查和修订）作为可选的"思考模式"，通过五阶段课程学习进行训练：基础视觉和多模态预训练、大规模指令调优、DPO和GRPO对齐与推理增强，使用多模态数据打包和混合并行技术提升效率。

Result: Ovis2.5-9B在OpenCompass多模态排行榜上平均得分78.3，相比前代Ovis2-8B有显著提升，在40B参数以下的开源MLLM中达到SOTA；Ovis2.5-2B得分73.9，在同规模模型中建立SOTA。在STEM基准测试、接地任务、视频任务和复杂图表分析方面均取得领先结果。

Conclusion: Ovis2.5通过原生分辨率处理和反思推理机制，在多模态理解任务上实现了显著的性能提升，特别是在处理视觉密集内容和复杂推理任务方面表现出色，为资源受限的设备提供了高性能的小型模型选择。

Abstract: We present Ovis2.5, a successor to Ovis2 designed for native-resolution
visual perception and strong multimodal reasoning. Ovis2.5 integrates a
native-resolution vision transformer that processes images at their native,
variable resolutions, avoiding the degradation from fixed-resolution tiling and
preserving both fine detail and global layout -- crucial for visually dense
content like complex charts. To strengthen reasoning, we train the model to
move beyond linear chain-of-thought and perform reflection -- including
self-checking and revision. This advanced capability is exposed as an optional
"thinking mode" at inference time, allowing users to trade latency for enhanced
accuracy on difficult inputs. The model is trained via a comprehensive
five-phase curriculum that progressively builds its skills. The process begins
with foundational visual and multimodal pretraining, advances through
large-scale instruction tuning, and culminates in alignment and reasoning
enhancement using DPO and GRPO. To scale these upgrades efficiently, we employ
multimodal data packing and hybrid parallelism, yielding a significant
end-to-end speedup. We release two open-source models: Ovis2.5-9B and
Ovis2.5-2B. The latter continues the "small model, big performance" philosophy
of Ovis2, making it ideal for resource-constrained, on-device scenarios. On the
OpenCompass multimodal leaderboard, Ovis2.5-9B averages 78.3, marking a
substantial improvement over its predecessor, Ovis2-8B, and achieving
state-of-the-art results among open-source MLLMs in the sub-40B parameter
range; Ovis2.5-2B scores 73.9, establishing SOTA for its size. Beyond aggregate
scores, Ovis2.5 achieves leading results on STEM benchmarks, exhibits strong
capabilities on grounding and video tasks, and achieves open-source SOTA at its
scale for complex chart analysis.

*Ming Cheng,Tong Wu,Jiazhen Hu,Jiaying Gong,Hoda Eldardiry*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoAVE是首个公开的视频到文本电商属性值提取数据集，涵盖14个领域172个属性，包含224k训练数据和25k评估数据，通过CLIP-MoE过滤系统确保质量，并建立了全面的基准测试。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有AVE数据集缺乏视频支持、属性覆盖有限且不公开的问题，填补视频到文本电商属性值提取的研究空白。

Method: 提出CLIP-based Mixture of Experts过滤系统(CLIP-MoE)来移除不匹配的视频-产品对，构建高质量数据集，并评估多种先进视频视觉语言模型。

Result: 视频到文本AVE仍然是一个具有挑战性的问题，特别是在开放设置中，现有模型在利用有效时间信息方面仍有改进空间。

Conclusion: VideoAVE为视频属性值提取研究提供了重要资源，展示了该领域的挑战性，并为开发更先进的视觉语言模型指明了方向。

Abstract: Attribute Value Extraction (AVE) is important for structuring product
information in e-commerce. However, existing AVE datasets are primarily limited
to text-to-text or image-to-text settings, lacking support for product videos,
diverse attribute coverage, and public availability. To address these gaps, we
introduce VideoAVE, the first publicly available video-to-text e-commerce AVE
dataset across 14 different domains and covering 172 unique attributes. To
ensure data quality, we propose a post-hoc CLIP-based Mixture of Experts
filtering system (CLIP-MoE) to remove the mismatched video-product pairs,
resulting in a refined dataset of 224k training data and 25k evaluation data.
In order to evaluate the usability of the dataset, we further establish a
comprehensive benchmark by evaluating several state-of-the-art video vision
language models (VLMs) under both attribute-conditioned value prediction and
open attribute-value pair extraction tasks. Our results analysis reveals that
video-to-text AVE remains a challenging problem, particularly in open settings,
and there is still room for developing more advanced VLMs capable of leveraging
effective temporal information. The dataset and benchmark code for VideoAVE are
available at: https://github.com/gjiaying/VideoAVE

### [7] [An MLP Baseline for Handwriting Recognition Using Planar Curvature and Gradient Orientation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11803)
*Azam Nouri*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 基于二阶几何线索（曲率大小、曲率符号和梯度方向）的MLP分类器在手写字符识别中表现优异，MNIST数字达到97%准确率，EMNIST字母达到89%准确率，证明曲率特征具有强大判别能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索是否仅使用二阶几何线索就能驱动MLP分类器进行手写字符识别，为卷积神经网络提供替代方案，同时保持特征的可解释性。

Method: 使用手工设计的三个特征图（平面曲率大小、曲率符号和梯度方向）作为输入，构建多层感知机（MLP）分类器进行手写字符识别。

Result: 在MNIST数字数据集上达到97%准确率，在EMNIST字母数据集上达到89%准确率，证明了曲率特征的有效性。

Conclusion: 曲率基表示对手写字符图像具有强大的判别能力，深度学习优势可以通过可解释的手工设计特征实现，为特征工程提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: This study investigates whether second-order geometric cues - planar
curvature magnitude, curvature sign, and gradient orientation - are sufficient
on their own to drive a multilayer perceptron (MLP) classifier for handwritten
character recognition (HCR), offering an alternative to convolutional neural
networks (CNNs). Using these three handcrafted feature maps as inputs, our
curvature-orientation MLP achieves 97 percent accuracy on MNIST digits and 89
percent on EMNIST letters. These results underscore the discriminative power of
curvature-based representations for handwritten character images and
demonstrate that the advantages of deep learning can be realized even with
interpretable, hand-engineered features.

### [8] [Labels or Input? Rethinking Augmentation in Multimodal Hate Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11808)
*Sahajpreet Singh,Rongxin Ouyang,Subhayan Mukerjee,Kokil Jaidka*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种双重措施来改善多模态恨恨图片检测：通过提示优化框架和多模态数据增强管道，在二进制和评分级设置下都取得了更好的检测精度和演化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代网络中多模态恨恨内容流行，通过文本和图像的细微交互传递有害意图。虽然视觉-语言模型有一定演化，但缺乏细粒度监督支持且容易受隐式恨恨语的影响。

Method: 1. 提出提示优化框架，系统性变化提示结构、监督粒度和训练模态。 2. 引入多模态数据增强管道，通过多代理LLM-VLM设置生成2,479个反事实中立图片，通过隔离和重写恨恨模态来减少偏偏相关性。

Result: 结构化提示在小模型中也能提高演化性，InternVL2在二进制和评分级设置下都获得最佳F1分数。数据增强管道成功减少了偏偏相关性并改善了分类器的演化性能。

Conclusion: 提示结构和数据组成与模型大小同样重要，目标定向的数据增强可以支持更可信豖和上下文敏感的恨恨检测，为构建健壮和公平的视觉-语言模型提供了新方向。

Abstract: The modern web is saturated with multimodal content, intensifying the
challenge of detecting hateful memes, where harmful intent is often conveyed
through subtle interactions between text and image under the guise of humor or
satire. While recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show promise,
these models lack support for fine-grained supervision and remain susceptible
to implicit hate speech. In this paper, we present a dual-pronged approach to
improve multimodal hate detection. First, we propose a prompt optimization
framework that systematically varies prompt structure, supervision granularity,
and training modality. We show that prompt design and label scaling both
influence performance, with structured prompts improving robustness even in
small models, and InternVL2 achieving the best F1-scores across binary and
scaled settings. Second, we introduce a multimodal data augmentation pipeline
that generates 2,479 counterfactually neutral memes by isolating and rewriting
the hateful modality. This pipeline, powered by a multi-agent LLM-VLM setup,
successfully reduces spurious correlations and improves classifier
generalization. Our approaches inspire new directions for building synthetic
data to train robust and fair vision-language models. Our findings demonstrate
that prompt structure and data composition are as critical as model size, and
that targeted augmentation can support more trustworthy and context-sensitive
hate detection.

### [9] [Towards Understanding 3D Vision: the Role of Gaussian Curvature](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11825)
*Sherlon Almeida da Silva,Davi Geiger,Luiz Velho,Moacir Antonelli Ponti*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文探讨了高斯曲率在3D表面建模中的作用，指出当前深度学习方法缺乏显式几何模型的限制，并通过Middlebury双目数据集验证了高斯曲率的优势


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度学习方法虽然在双目匹配和单目深度重建任务中取得了显著成功，但缺乏可直接分析、跨模态转移或系统性修改的显式3D几何模型

Method: 研究高斯曲率在3D表面建模中的作用，使用Middlebury双目数据集进行验证和分析

Result: 高斯曲率提供了稀疏且紧凑的3D表面描述，当前最优方法隐式考虑了该量，可作为几何先验知识改善3D重建，并可作为无监督评量标准

Conclusion: 高斯曲率作为一种不变量，在3D表面建模中具有重要价值，可补充当前数据驱动方法的不足，为提高几何理解和控制提供了新的视角

Abstract: Recent advances in computer vision have predominantly relied on data-driven
approaches that leverage deep learning and large-scale datasets. Deep neural
networks have achieved remarkable success in tasks such as stereo matching and
monocular depth reconstruction. However, these methods lack explicit models of
3D geometry that can be directly analyzed, transferred across modalities, or
systematically modified for controlled experimentation. We investigate the role
of Gaussian curvature in 3D surface modeling. Besides Gaussian curvature being
an invariant quantity under change of observers or coordinate systems, we
demonstrate using the Middlebury stereo dataset that it offers: (i) a sparse
and compact description of 3D surfaces, (ii) state-of-the-art monocular and
stereo methods seem to implicitly consider it, but no explicit module of such
use can be extracted, (iii) a form of geometric prior that can inform and
improve 3D surface reconstruction, and (iv) a possible use as an unsupervised
metric for stereo methods.

*Dehn Xu,Tim Katzke,Emmanuel Müller*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文系统性评估了多种图像到图象转换方法在图神经网络图级异常检测任务中的效果，发现颜色描述符表现最佳，而形状和纹理特征能进一步提升检测效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然GNN已被应用于图像演化的图表示，但仍缺乏对多种图像到图转换方法在图级异常检测任务中的系统性比较研究。

Method: 系统性评估多种分割方案、边缘构建策略和节点特征集（包括颜色、纹理、形状描述符），在皮肤镜图像上使用最先进的GLAD模型进行完全无监督、弱监督和全监督实验。

Result: 颜色描述符单独表现最佳，形状和纹理特征能持续提升检测效果。最佳无监督配置达到0.805 AUC-ROC，弱监督提升至0.872，全监督达到0.914。

Conclusion: 该研究为图像到图转换方法的选择提供了系统性指南，表明适当的特征组合能在不依赖预训练模型的情况下实现竞争性能能。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful approach for
graph-based machine learning tasks. Previous work applied GNNs to image-derived
graph representations for various downstream tasks such as classification or
anomaly detection. These transformations include segmenting images, extracting
features from segments, mapping them to nodes, and connecting them. However, to
the best of our knowledge, no study has rigorously compared the effectiveness
of the numerous potential image-to-graph transformation approaches for
GNN-based graph-level anomaly detection (GLAD). In this study, we
systematically evaluate the efficacy of multiple segmentation schemes, edge
construction strategies, and node feature sets based on color, texture, and
shape descriptors to produce suitable image-derived graph representations to
perform graph-level anomaly detection. We conduct extensive experiments on
dermoscopic images using state-of-the-art GLAD models, examining performance
and efficiency in purely unsupervised, weakly supervised, and fully supervised
regimes. Our findings reveal, for example, that color descriptors contribute
the best standalone performance, while incorporating shape and texture features
consistently enhances detection efficacy. In particular, our best unsupervised
configuration using OCGTL achieves a competitive AUC-ROC score of up to 0.805
without relying on pretrained backbones like comparable image-based approaches.
With the inclusion of sparse labels, the performance increases substantially to
0.872 and with full supervision to 0.914 AUC-ROC.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯抽射技术在安全关键任务中快速应用，需要研究恶意攻击者如何篡改图像造成害害，曝露新的安全风险。

Method: 利用标准3DGS轮廓方法创建视角点特异性谜色，在场景物体中嵌入仅在特定视角下可见的恶意内容，无需模型架构或权重访问。

Result: 实验表明ComplicitSplat能成功攻击多种流行检测器（单阶段、多阶段和Transformer基础模型），在真实物球物体和合成场景中都有效。

Conclusion: 这是首个基于3DGS的黑盒攻击下游目标检测器的方法，曝露了自主导航等任务关锠机器系统的新安全风险。

Abstract: As 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) gains rapid adoption in safety-critical tasks
for efficient novel-view synthesis from static images, how might an adversary
tamper images to cause harm? We introduce ComplicitSplat, the first attack that
exploits standard 3DGS shading methods to create viewpoint-specific camouflage
- colors and textures that change with viewing angle - to embed adversarial
content in scene objects that are visible only from specific viewpoints and
without requiring access to model architecture or weights. Our extensive
experiments show that ComplicitSplat generalizes to successfully attack a
variety of popular detector - both single-stage, multi-stage, and
transformer-based models on both real-world capture of physical objects and
synthetic scenes. To our knowledge, this is the first black-box attack on
downstream object detectors using 3DGS, exposing a novel safety risk for
applications like autonomous navigation and other mission-critical robotic
systems.

Result: 研究发现：1）微调集与测试集之间高/低质量图像比例的变化会导致下游性能显著差异；2）微调集中足够高质量图像对保持强性能至关重要；3）当质量比例一致时，微调所需标注数据远少于从头训练；4）缺乏高质量微调数据时，预训练模型可能无法超越无预训练模型。

Conclusion: 图像质量分布对基础模型的标签效率有重要影响，需要在微调和部署时评估和对齐质量分布，为特定下游任务制定微调数据的质量标准，以充分实现基础模型的数据和计算效率优势。

Abstract: Foundation models in medical imaging have shown promising label efficiency,
achieving high downstream performance with only a fraction of annotated data.
Here, we evaluate this in prostate multiparametric MRI using ProFound, a
domain-specific vision foundation model pretrained on large-scale prostate MRI
datasets. We investigate how variable image quality affects label-efficient
finetuning by measuring the generalisability of finetuned models. Experiments
systematically vary high-/low-quality image ratios in finetuning and evaluation
sets. Our findings indicate that image quality distribution and its
finetune-and-test mismatch significantly affect model performance. In
particular: a) Varying the ratio of high- to low-quality images between
finetuning and test sets leads to notable differences in downstream
performance; and b) The presence of sufficient high-quality images in the
finetuning set is critical for maintaining strong performance, whilst the
importance of matched finetuning and testing distribution varies between
different downstream tasks, such as automated radiology reporting and prostate
cancer detection.When quality ratios are consistent, finetuning needs far less
labeled data than training from scratch, but label efficiency depends on image
quality distribution. Without enough high-quality finetuning data, pretrained
models may fail to outperform those trained without pretraining. This
highlights the importance of assessing and aligning quality distributions
between finetuning and deployment, and the need for quality standards in
finetuning data for specific downstream tasks. Using ProFound, we show the
value of quantifying image quality in both finetuning and deployment to fully
realise the data and compute efficiency benefits of foundation models.

*Ying Huang,Yuanbin Man,Wenqi Jia,Zhengzhong Tu,Junzhou Huang,Miao Yin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AdaRing是一个基于张量环分解的视觉语言模型微调框架，通过跨层共享张量核心和层特定切片来减少冗余，同时集成多样化适配器以增强表示能力，在减少90%训练参数的同时达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的适配器微调方法存在两个主要限制：1)由于忽略跨层冗余而导致的压缩率有限；2)同质适配器的表示能力有限。需要开发更高效的参数高效微调方法。

Method: 提出基于跨层张量环分解(TRD)的框架，将适配器表示为层共享的张量核心和层特定的切片，利用张量级低秩性去除跨层冗余，并通过泛化感知微调指导多样化秩驱动适配器协作。

Result: 实验表明AdaRing在减少平均训练参数90%的情况下，达到了最先进的性能表现。

Conclusion: AdaRing框架成功实现了VLMs的超轻量参数高效适应，通过张量环分解和多样化适配器协作有效解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Adapter-based fine-tuning has gained remarkable attention in adapting large
pre-trained vision language models (VLMs) for a wide range of downstream tasks
efficiently. In this paradigm, only the inserted adapters are fine-tuned,
without the need for training the original VLM backbone. Existing works scale
adapters by integrating them into every layer of VLMs to increase the capacity
of adapters. However, these methods face two primary limitations: 1) limited
compression rate due to ignoring cross-layer redundancy, and 2) limited
representational capacity across homogeneous adapters. In this paper, we
propose a novel vision-language fine-tuning framework based on cross-layer
tensor ring decomposition (TRD) with the integration and collaboration of
diverse adapters, called AdaRing, achieving ultra-light parameter-efficient
adaptation of VLMs on various tasks. To remove the high redundancy that exists
among adapters across layers, we exploit the tensor-level low-rankness to
formulate adapters as layer-shared tensor cores and layer-specific slices.
Moreover, guided by generalization-aware fine-tuning, diverse rank-driven
adapters cooperate to handle tasks that require different representations. Our
experiments show that the proposed AdaRing achieves the state-of-the-art
performance while reducing average training parameters by 90%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在指令视觉分割任务中的推理成本过高，特别是在视频处理时，需要找到高效的视觉到征采样方法来加速推理

Method: 提出EVTP-IV方法，基于k-center算法并集成空间信息，选择空间上具有代表性的紧凑到征子集，并通过信息论分析验证设计

Result: 在标准IVS测试集上实现5X的视频任务加速和3.5X的图像任务加速，仅使用20%到征即可维持相当的准确性，且在不同剩余比下都超过最新剩剪基线方法

Conclusion: EVTP-IV通过智能到征采样有效降低了MLLM模型的推理成本，在保持分割性能的同时实现了显著的速度提升，为高效视觉语言模型推理提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Instructed Visual Segmentation (IVS) tasks require segmenting objects in
images or videos based on natural language instructions. While recent
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved strong performance on
IVS, their inference cost remains a major bottleneck, particularly in video. We
empirically analyze visual token sampling in MLLMs and observe a strong
correlation between subset token coverage and segmentation performance. This
motivates our design of a simple and effective token pruning method that
selects a compact yet spatially representative subset of tokens to accelerate
inference. In this paper, we introduce a novel visual token pruning method for
IVS, called EVTP-IV, which builds upon the k-center by integrating spatial
information to ensure better coverage. We further provide an
information-theoretic analysis to support our design. Experiments on standard
IVS benchmarks show that our method achieves up to 5X speed-up on video tasks
and 3.5X on image tasks, while maintaining comparable accuracy using only 20%
of the tokens. Our method also consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
pruning baselines under varying pruning ratios.

*Quanwei Hu,Yinggan Tang,Xuguang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过纯卷积神经网络结构，结合大核卷积和交叉门控制机制，在保持轻量化的同时提升超分辨率性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决超分辨率任务中轻量模型的性能与延迟问题，CNN模型速度快但缺乏非局部特征捐捕能力，Transformer能捐捕非局部特征但速度慢

Method: 提出LKMN模型，包含两个核心组件：增强垂直大核块(EPLKB)通过频道混淆和波带大核卷积提取非局部特征，交叉门前羽网络(CGFN)通过学习参数和交叉门策略调节特征融合

Result: 在Manga109数据集上以倍超分辨率下，LKMN-L模型比DAT-light提升了0.23 dB PSNR，速度提升了近4.8倍，性能超越现有轻量化SOTA模型

Conclusion: LKMN通过纯CNN结构成功实现了性能与效率的平衡，为资源受限场景下的图像超分辨率提供了高效解决方案

Abstract: Image super-resolution (SR) in resource-constrained scenarios demands
lightweight models balancing performance and latency. Convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) offer low latency but lack non-local feature capture, while
Transformers excel at non-local modeling yet suffer slow inference. To address
this trade-off, we propose the Large Kernel Modulation Network (LKMN), a pure
CNN-based model. LKMN has two core components: Enhanced Partial Large Kernel
Block (EPLKB) and Cross-Gate Feed-Forward Network (CGFN). The EPLKB utilizes
channel shuffle to boost inter-channel interaction, incorporates channel
attention to focus on key information, and applies large kernel strip
convolutions on partial channels for non-local feature extraction with reduced
complexity. The CGFN dynamically adjusts discrepancies between input, local,
and non-local features via a learnable scaling factor, then employs a
cross-gate strategy to modulate and fuse these features, enhancing their
complementarity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms
existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) lightweight SR models while balancing quality
and efficiency. Specifically, LKMN-L achieves 0.23 dB PSNR improvement over
DAT-light on the Manga109 dataset at $\times$4 upscale, with nearly $\times$4.8
times faster. Codes are in the supplementary materials. The code is available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索一阶边缘映射是否足以驱动全连接MLP进行手写字符识别，作为卷积神经网络的替代方案，追求更小的内存占用和更透明的特征表示。

Method: 仅使用水平和垂直Sobel导数作为输入，在MNIST和EMNIST Letters数据集上训练多层感知机(MLP)。

Result: 在MNIST数字上达到98%准确率，在EMNIST字母上达到92%准确率，接近CNN性能，同时具有更小的内存占用和透明特征。

Conclusion: 手写字符图像中的类判别信息大部分已经被一阶梯度捕获，边缘感知的MLP是手写字符识别的一个有吸引力的选择。

Abstract: We revisit the classical Sobel operator to ask a simple question: Are
first-order edge maps sufficient to drive an all-dense multilayer perceptron
(MLP) for handwritten character recognition (HCR), as an alternative to
convolutional neural networks (CNNs)? Using only horizontal and vertical Sobel
derivatives as input, we train an MLP on MNIST and EMNIST Letters. Despite its
extreme simplicity, the resulting network reaches 98% accuracy on MNIST digits
and 92% on EMNIST letters -- approaching CNNs while offering a smaller memory
footprint and transparent features. Our findings highlight that much of the
class-discriminative information in handwritten character images is already
captured by first-order gradients, making edge-aware MLPs a compelling option
for HCR.

TL;DR: 提出在线视频基准任务OVG-HQ，支持多模态查询，解决传统方法在流式视频和视觉符号查询中的问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视频基准方法在流式视频和视觉符号查询场景下表现不佳，需要支持多模态查询的在线解决方案

Method: 提出OVG-HQ-Unify统一框架，包含参数化记忆块(PMB)保留历史知识，以及跨模态荟蓬策略平衡不同模态的学习效果

Result: 在新构建的QVHighlights-Unify数据集上，OVG-HQ-Unify模型表现超过现有方法，同时提出了适用于在线评估的新指标oR@n、IoU=m和omAP

Conclusion: 该方法为在线混合模态视频基准提供了稳健解决方案，有效处理了上下文限制和模态不平衡问题

Abstract: Video grounding (VG) task focuses on locating specific moments in a video
based on a query, usually in text form. However, traditional VG struggles with
some scenarios like streaming video or queries using visual cues. To fill this
gap, we present a new task named Online Video Grounding with Hybrid-modal
Queries (OVG-HQ), which enables online segment localization using text, images,
video segments, and their combinations. This task poses two new challenges:
limited context in online settings and modality imbalance during training,
where dominant modalities overshadow weaker ones. To address these, we propose
OVG-HQ-Unify, a unified framework featuring a Parametric Memory Block (PMB)
that retain previously learned knowledge to enhance current decision and a
cross-modal distillation strategy that guides the learning of non-dominant
modalities. This design enables a single model to effectively handle
hybrid-modal queries. Due to the lack of suitable datasets, we construct
QVHighlights-Unify, an expanded dataset with multi-modal queries. Besides,
since offline metrics overlook prediction timeliness, we adapt them to the
online setting, introducing oR@n, IoU=m, and online mean Average Precision
(omAP) to evaluate both accuracy and efficiency. Experiments show that our
OVG-HQ-Unify outperforms existing models, offering a robust solution for
online, hybrid-modal video grounding. Source code and datasets are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SafeCtrl是一个轻量级非侵入式插件，通过检测-抑制范式来提升文本到图像模型的安全性，在保持生成质量的同时有效抑制有害内容


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全方法（如提示重写或模型微调）在安全性和保真度之间存在权衡，基于定位的方法依赖显式概念替换可能导致语义不连贯

Method: 采用检测-抑制范式，首先精确定位不安全内容，然后抑制有害语义而非硬性替换，使用DPO训练策略利用图像级偏好数据学习抑制行为

Result: 在安全性和保真度保持方面显著优于现有最先进方法

Conclusion: 解耦的基于抑制的控制是构建更负责任生成模型的高效且可扩展方向

Abstract: The widespread deployment of text-to-image models is challenged by their
potential to generate harmful content. While existing safety methods, such as
prompt rewriting or model fine-tuning, provide valuable interventions, they
often introduce a trade-off between safety and fidelity. Recent
localization-based approaches have shown promise, yet their reliance on
explicit ``concept replacement" can sometimes lead to semantic incongruity. To
address these limitations, we explore a more flexible detect-then-suppress
paradigm. We introduce SafeCtrl, a lightweight, non-intrusive plugin that first
precisely localizes unsafe content. Instead of performing a hard A-to-B
substitution, SafeCtrl then suppresses the harmful semantics, allowing the
generative process to naturally and coherently resolve into a safe,
context-aware alternative. A key aspect of our work is a novel training
strategy using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). We leverage readily
available, image-level preference data to train our module, enabling it to
learn nuanced suppression behaviors and perform region-guided interventions at
inference without requiring costly, pixel-level annotations. Extensive
experiments show that SafeCtrl significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in both safety efficacy and fidelity preservation. Our findings suggest
that decoupled, suppression-based control is a highly effective and scalable
direction for building more responsible generative models.

Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在遥感应用中面临两个关键挑战：依赖大空间瓦片增加计算成本，以及依赖文本监督但文本数据往往不易获得。

Method: 利用Sentinel-2影像的光谱和时间信息，结合地理标记的地面照片进行跨视角学习，最小化基于标题的训练需求，同时保持卫星和地面视角之间的语义对齐。

Result: 实验证明单个像素输入结合时空和光谱线索足以进行专题制图，为大规模遥感应用提供了可扩展和高效的替代方案。

Conclusion: 该方法在LULC、作物类型和生态系统类型分类任务中表现出色，代码已开源。

Abstract: Vision-language models have shown significant promise in remote sensing
applications, particularly for land-use and land-cover (LULC) via zero-shot
classification and retrieval. However, current approaches face two key
challenges: reliance on large spatial tiles that increase computational cost,
and dependence on text-based supervision, which is often not readily available.
In this work, we present TimeSenCLIP, a lightweight framework that reevaluate
the role of spatial context by evaluating the effectiveness of a single pixel
by leveraging its temporal and spectral dimensions, for classifying LULC and
ecosystem types. By leveraging spectral and temporal information from
Sentinel-2 imagery and cross-view learning with geo-tagged ground-level photos,
we minimises the need for caption-based training while preserving semantic
alignment between overhead (satellite) and ground perspectives. Our approach is
grounded in the LUCAS and Sen4Map datasets, and evaluated on classification
tasks including LULC, crop type, and ecosystem type. We demonstrate that single
pixel inputs, when combined with temporal and spectral cues, are sufficient for
thematic mapping, offering a scalable and efficient alternative for large-scale
remote sensing applications. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决脱脑脱罐分割中的数据稀缺、标注数据资源有限以及类别不平衡问题，通过生成式模型生成合成数据来提升数据集多样性。

Method: 使用预训练的GAN模型生成合成MRI数据，将真实数据（BraTS 2020）与合成数据按不同比例混合训练U-Net分割网络，对比不同混合比例下的性能。

Result: 整体量化指标（Dice系数、IoU、精度、召回率、准确度）在真实数据和混合数据之间相似，但质性分析显示混合数据（特别是40%真实+60%合成）改善了整体脱罐边界的划分。然而，脱罐核心和增强区域的分割准确性仍较低，表明类别不平衡问题仍存在。

Conclusion: 合成数据作为数据增强策略在脱脑脱罐分割中具有可行性，但需要进一步进行大规模实验、保证体积数据的一致性并消除类别不平衡问题。

Abstract: Manual brain tumor segmentation from MRI scans is challenging due to tumor
heterogeneity, scarcity of annotated data, and class imbalance in medical
imaging datasets. Synthetic data generated by generative models has the
potential to mitigate these issues by improving dataset diversity. This study
investigates, as a proof of concept, the impact of incorporating synthetic MRI
data, generated using a pre-trained GAN model, into training a U-Net
segmentation network. Experiments were conducted using real data from the BraTS
2020 dataset, synthetic data generated with the medigan library, and hybrid
datasets combining real and synthetic samples in varying proportions. While
overall quantitative performance (Dice coefficient, IoU, precision, recall,
accuracy) was comparable between real-only and hybrid-trained models,
qualitative inspection suggested that hybrid datasets, particularly with 40%
real and 60% synthetic data, improved whole tumor boundary delineation.
However, region-wise accuracy for the tumor core and the enhancing tumor
remained lower, indicating a persistent class imbalance. The findings support
the feasibility of synthetic data as an augmentation strategy for brain tumor
segmentation, while highlighting the need for larger-scale experiments,
volumetric data consistency, and mitigating class imbalance in future work.

Abstract: Real-world environment-derived point clouds invariably exhibit noise across
varying modalities and intensities. Hence, point cloud denoising (PCD) is
essential as a preprocessing step to improve downstream task performance. Deep
learning (DL)-based PCD models, known for their strong representation
capabilities and flexible architectures, have surpassed traditional methods in
denoising performance. To our best knowledge, despite recent advances in
performance, no comprehensive survey systematically summarizes the developments
of DL-based PCD. To fill the gap, this paper seeks to identify key challenges
in DL-based PCD, summarizes the main contributions of existing methods, and
proposes a taxonomy tailored to denoising tasks. To achieve this goal, we
formulate PCD as a two-step process: outlier removal and surface noise
restoration, encompassing most scenarios and requirements of PCD. Additionally,
we compare methods in terms of similarities, differences, and respective
advantages. Finally, we discuss research limitations and future directions,
offering insights for further advancements in PCD.

Conclusion: DynamicPose框架成功解决了快速运动场景下的6D位姿跟踪挑战，通过协同组件和闭环系统设计实现了优异的跟踪性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: We present DynamicPose, a retraining-free 6D pose tracking framework that
improves tracking robustness in fast-moving camera and object scenarios.
Previous work is mainly applicable to static or quasi-static scenes, and its
performance significantly deteriorates when both the object and the camera move
rapidly. To overcome these challenges, we propose three synergistic components:
(1) A visual-inertial odometry compensates for the shift in the Region of
Interest (ROI) caused by camera motion; (2) A depth-informed 2D tracker
corrects ROI deviations caused by large object translation; (3) A VIO-guided
Kalman filter predicts object rotation, generates multiple candidate poses, and
then obtains the final pose by hierarchical refinement. The 6D pose tracking
results guide subsequent 2D tracking and Kalman filter updates, forming a
closed-loop system that ensures accurate pose initialization and precise pose
tracking. Simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
of our method, achieving real-time and robust 6D pose tracking for fast-moving
cameras and objects.

Abstract: This paper investigates multi-scale feature approximation and transferable
features for object detection from point clouds. Multi-scale features are
critical for object detection from point clouds. However, multi-scale feature
learning usually involves multiple neighborhood searches and scale-aware
layers, which can hinder efforts to achieve lightweight models and may not be
conducive to research constrained by limited computational resources. This
paper approximates point-based multi-scale features from a single neighborhood
based on knowledge distillation. To compensate for the loss of constructive
diversity in a single neighborhood, this paper designs a transferable feature
embedding mechanism. Specifically, class-aware statistics are employed as
transferable features given the small computational cost. In addition, this
paper introduces the central weighted intersection over union for localization
to alleviate the misalignment brought by the center offset in optimization.
Note that the method presented in this paper saves computational costs.
Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed method.

Abstract: Despite the impressive progress on understanding and generating images shown
by the recent unified architectures, the integration of 3D tasks remains
challenging and largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce UniUGG, the
first unified understanding and generation framework for 3D modalities. Our
unified framework employs an LLM to comprehend and decode sentences and 3D
representations. At its core, we propose a spatial decoder leveraging a latent
diffusion model to generate high-quality 3D representations. This allows for
the generation and imagination of 3D scenes based on a reference image and an
arbitrary view transformation, while remaining supports for spatial visual
question answering (VQA) tasks. Additionally, we propose a geometric-semantic
learning strategy to pretrain the vision encoder. This design jointly captures
the input's semantic and geometric cues, enhancing both spatial understanding
and generation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of
our method in visual representation, spatial understanding, and 3D generation.

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment and track objects
in videos based on natural language expressions, requiring precise alignment
between visual content and textual queries. However, existing methods often
suffer from semantic misalignment, largely due to indiscriminate frame sampling
and supervision of all visible objects during training -- regardless of their
actual relevance to the expression. To address this, we introduce a
moment-aware RVOS framework named SAMDWICH, along with a newly annotated
dataset, MeViS-M, built upon the challenging MeViS benchmark. We manually
annotate temporal moments indicating when each object is referred to by the
expression, enabling semantically grounded supervision that strengthens
video-text alignment. SAMDWICH leverages these aligned text-to-clip pairs to
guide training, significantly enhancing referential understanding. Building
upon this framework, we propose Moment-guided Dual-path Propagation (MDP), a
moment-aware propagation strategy that improves both object grounding and
tracking by training on both relevant and irrelevant frames through a
moment-centric memory mechanism. In addition, we introduce Object-level
Selective Supervision (OSS), an object-level filtering strategy that supervises
only the objects temporally aligned with the expression in each training clip.
This selective supervision reduces semantic noise and reinforces
language-conditioned learning. Extensive experiments show that SAMDWICH
achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging MeViS benchmark,
particularly excelling in complex scenarios involving diverse expressions.

Method: 提出PEdger++协作学习框架，利用异构架构、多样化训练时刻和多重参数采样的交叉信息，从集成学习角度增强特征提取能力。

Conclusion: PEdger++成功实现了边缘检测精度和计算效率的平衡，展示了在资源受限设备上的良好适应性，为实际部署提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Edge detection serves as a critical foundation for numerous computer vision
applications, including object detection, semantic segmentation, and image
editing, by extracting essential structural cues that define object boundaries
and salient edges. To be viable for broad deployment across devices with
varying computational capacities, edge detectors shall balance high accuracy
with low computational complexity. While deep learning has evidently improved
accuracy, they often suffer from high computational costs, limiting their
applicability on resource-constrained devices. This paper addresses the
challenge of achieving that balance: \textit{i.e.}, {how to efficiently capture
discriminative features without relying on large-size and sophisticated
models}. We propose PEdger++, a collaborative learning framework designed to
reduce computational costs and model sizes while improving edge detection
accuracy. The core principle of our PEdger++ is that cross-information derived
from heterogeneous architectures, diverse training moments, and multiple
parameter samplings, is beneficial to enhance learning from an ensemble
perspective. Extensive experimental results on the BSDS500, NYUD and Multicue
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, both quantitatively and
qualitatively, showing clear improvements over existing methods. We also
provide multiple versions of the model with varying computational requirements,
highlighting PEdger++'s adaptability with respect to different resource
constraints. Codes are accessible at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个新的多分辨率多模态微表情数据集，使用同步RGB和事件相机在可变光照条件下录制，展示了事件相机在微表情识别和帧重建任务中的优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微表情分析在人机交互和驾驶员监控系统中有重要应用，但传统RGB相机在捕捉细微快速面部运动时存在时间分辨率限制和运动模糊问题。事件相机具有微秒级精度、高动态范围和低延迟的优势，但缺乏公开的事件基AU数据集。

Method: 构建了同步RGB和事件相机的多模态微表情数据集，在可变光照条件下录制。使用脉冲神经网络进行动作单元分类，使用条件变分自编码器进行帧重建。

Result: 事件数据在AU分类任务中达到51.23%准确率（RGB仅为23.12%），在高分辨率事件输入下帧重建达到SSIM=0.8513和PSNR=26.89dB的优异结果。

Abstract: Micro-expression analysis has applications in domains such as Human-Robot
Interaction and Driver Monitoring Systems. Accurately capturing subtle and fast
facial movements remains difficult when relying solely on RGB cameras, due to
limitations in temporal resolution and sensitivity to motion blur. Event
cameras offer an alternative, with microsecond-level precision, high dynamic
range, and low latency. However, public datasets featuring event-based
recordings of Action Units are still scarce. In this work, we introduce a
novel, preliminary multi-resolution and multi-modal micro-expression dataset
recorded with synchronized RGB and event cameras under variable lighting
conditions. Two baseline tasks are evaluated to explore the spatial-temporal
dynamics of micro-expressions: Action Unit classification using Spiking Neural
Networks (51.23\% accuracy with events vs. 23.12\% with RGB), and frame
reconstruction using Conditional Variational Autoencoders, achieving SSIM =
0.8513 and PSNR = 26.89 dB with high-resolution event input. These promising
results show that event-based data can be used for micro-expression recognition
and frame reconstruction.

TL;DR: MOON是首个基于生成式多模态大语言模型的产品表示学习方法，通过引导专家混合模块、核心语义区域检测和负采样策略，解决了产品多模态表示学习的关键挑战，并在多个下游任务中展现出优秀的零样本性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有判别式双流架构难以建模产品多图像与文本之间的多对一对应关系，而生成式多模态大语言模型在提升产品表示学习方面具有巨大潜力，但面临缺乏多模态建模模块、产品图像背景噪声干扰以及标准评估基准缺失等挑战。

Method: 提出MOON模型：(1)使用引导专家混合模块进行多模态和特定方面的目标建模；(2)有效检测产品图像中的核心语义区域以减少背景噪声干扰；(3)引入专门的负采样策略增加负样本难度和多样性。

Conclusion: MOON通过创新的多模态建模方法有效解决了产品表示学习的关键问题，案例研究和可视化结果证明了其在产品理解方面的有效性，为生成式MLLM在产品领域的应用提供了有力支持。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of e-commerce, exploring general representations
rather than task-specific ones has attracted increasing research attention. For
product understanding, although existing discriminative dual-flow architectures
drive progress in this field, they inherently struggle to model the many-to-one
alignment between multiple images and texts of products. Therefore, we argue
that generative Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) hold significant
potential for improving product representation learning. Nevertheless,
achieving this goal still remains non-trivial due to several key challenges:
the lack of multimodal and aspect-aware modeling modules in typical LLMs; the
common presence of background noise in product images; and the absence of a
standard benchmark for evaluation. To address these issues, we propose the
first generative MLLM-based model named MOON for product representation
learning. Our method (1) employs a guided Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) module for
targeted modeling of multimodal and aspect-specific product content; (2)
effectively detects core semantic regions in product images to mitigate the
distraction and interference caused by background noise; and (3) introduces the
specialized negative sampling strategy to increase the difficulty and diversity
of negative samples. In addition, we release a large-scale multimodal benchmark
MBE for various product understanding tasks. Experimentally, our model
demonstrates competitive zero-shot performance on both our benchmark and the
public dataset, showcasing strong generalization across various downstream
tasks, including cross-modal retrieval, product classification, and attribute
prediction. Furthermore, the case study and visualization illustrate the
effectiveness of MOON for product understanding.

TL;DR: InstDrive是一个面向动态驾驶场景的实例感知3D高斯泼溅框架，首次实现了开放世界驾驶场景的3D实例分割，无需数据预处理或复杂优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将所有背景元素统一为单一表示，阻碍了实例级理解和灵活场景编辑；现有2D分割提升到3D的方法依赖预处理实例ID或复杂管道，且主要针对室内场景，不适用于室外驾驶场景。

Method: 使用SAM生成的掩码作为伪真值，通过对比损失和伪监督目标指导2D特征学习；在3D层面引入正则化隐式编码实例身份，通过体素损失强制一致性；使用轻量级静态码本桥接连续特征和离散身份。

Result: 定量和定性实验证明了InstDrive的有效性，是首个在动态开放世界驾驶场景中实现3D实例分割的框架。

Conclusion: InstDrive成功解决了动态驾驶场景中实例级3D重建的挑战，为自动驾驶和场景理解提供了更灵活和精确的解决方案。

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic driving scenes from dashcam videos has attracted
increasing attention due to its significance in autonomous driving and scene
understanding. While recent advances have made impressive progress, most
methods still unify all background elements into a single representation,
hindering both instance-level understanding and flexible scene editing. Some
approaches attempt to lift 2D segmentation into 3D space, but often rely on
pre-processed instance IDs or complex pipelines to map continuous features to
discrete identities. Moreover, these methods are typically designed for indoor
scenes with rich viewpoints, making them less applicable to outdoor driving
scenarios. In this paper, we present InstDrive, an instance-aware 3D Gaussian
Splatting framework tailored for the interactive reconstruction of dynamic
driving scene. We use masks generated by SAM as pseudo ground-truth to guide 2D
feature learning via contrastive loss and pseudo-supervised objectives. At the
3D level, we introduce regularization to implicitly encode instance identities
and enforce consistency through a voxel-based loss. A lightweight static
codebook further bridges continuous features and discrete identities without
requiring data pre-processing or complex optimization. Quantitative and
qualitative experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of InstDrive, and to the
best of our knowledge, it is the first framework to achieve 3D instance
segmentation in dynamic, open-world driving scenes.More visualizations are

TL;DR: WiseLVAM是一个全自动的左心室线性测量框架，通过结合B模式图像的结构感知和AMM模式的运动感知，自动放置虚拟扫描线并进行测量，提高临床应用的准确性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自动化方法直接从B模式图像估计地标点进行测量，即使预测点沿左心室壁有微小偏移也会导致显著的测量误差，降低了临床可靠性。需要开发全自动且符合临床指南的测量方法。

Method: 提出轮廓感知的扫描线放置方法：使用弱监督B模式地标检测器估计左心室轮廓，推断左心室长轴和基底水平来放置扫描线。然后基于生成的解剖运动模式(AMM)图像预测地标点进行测量。

Result: 开发了WiseLVAM框架，能够全自动执行左心室线性测量，同时保持手动适应性。结合了B模式图像的结构感知和AMM模式的运动感知优势。

Conclusion: WiseLVAM为常规临床应用提供了一个实用的解决方案，通过自动化扫描线放置和测量过程，提高了左心室线性测量的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Clinical guidelines recommend performing left ventricular (LV) linear
measurements in B-mode echocardiographic images at the basal level -- typically
at the mitral valve leaflet tips -- and aligned perpendicular to the LV long
axis along a virtual scanline (SL). However, most automated methods estimate
landmarks directly from B-mode images for the measurement task, where even
small shifts in predicted points along the LV walls can lead to significant
measurement errors, reducing their clinical reliability. A recent
semi-automatic method, EnLVAM, addresses this limitation by constraining
landmark prediction to a clinician-defined SL and training on generated
Anatomical Motion Mode (AMM) images to predict LV landmarks along the same. To
enable full automation, a contour-aware SL placement approach is proposed in
this work, in which the LV contour is estimated using a weakly supervised
B-mode landmark detector. SL placement is then performed by inferring the LV
long axis and the basal level-mimicking clinical guidelines. Building on this
foundation, we introduce \textit{WiseLVAM} -- a novel, fully automated yet
manually adaptable framework for automatically placing the SL and then
automatically performing the LV linear measurements in the AMM mode.
\textit{WiseLVAM} utilizes the structure-awareness from B-mode images and the
motion-awareness from AMM mode to enhance robustness and accuracy with the
potential to provide a practical solution for the routine clinical application.

Result: 在VQA-RAD数据集上超越了之前的模型，尤其在需要图像-文本推理的复杂案例中表现更优

Conclusion: 该方法为建设智能、明确且有用的医生AI工具提供了有前景的途径

Abstract: Solving tough clinical questions that require both image and text
understanding is still a major challenge in healthcare AI. In this work, we
propose Q-FSRU, a new model that combines Frequency Spectrum Representation and
Fusion (FSRU) with a method called Quantum Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(Quantum RAG) for medical Visual Question Answering (VQA). The model takes in
features from medical images and related text, then shifts them into the
frequency domain using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). This helps it focus on
more meaningful data and filter out noise or less useful information. To
improve accuracy and ensure that answers are based on real knowledge, we add a
quantum-inspired retrieval system. It fetches useful medical facts from
external sources using quantum-based similarity techniques. These details are
then merged with the frequency-based features for stronger reasoning. We
evaluated our model using the VQA-RAD dataset, which includes real radiology
images and questions. The results showed that Q-FSRU outperforms earlier
models, especially on complex cases needing image-text reasoning. The mix of
frequency and quantum information improves both performance and explainability.
Overall, this approach offers a promising way to build smart, clear, and
helpful AI tools for doctors.

Conclusion: VimoRAG框架通过视频检索增强的方法有效解决了运动生成中的数据稀缺问题，为运动大语言模型提供了新的性能提升途径。

Abstract: This paper introduces VimoRAG, a novel video-based retrieval-augmented motion
generation framework for motion large language models (LLMs). As motion LLMs
face severe out-of-domain/out-of-vocabulary issues due to limited annotated
data, VimoRAG leverages large-scale in-the-wild video databases to enhance 3D
motion generation by retrieving relevant 2D human motion signals. While
video-based motion RAG is nontrivial, we address two key bottlenecks: (1)
developing an effective motion-centered video retrieval model that
distinguishes human poses and actions, and (2) mitigating the issue of error
propagation caused by suboptimal retrieval results. We design the Gemini Motion
Video Retriever mechanism and the Motion-centric Dual-alignment DPO Trainer,
enabling effective retrieval and generation processes. Experimental results
show that VimoRAG significantly boosts the performance of motion LLMs
constrained to text-only input.

Abstract: Recent advances in computer vision have made training object detectors more
efficient and effective; however, assessing their performance in real-world
applications still relies on costly manual annotation. To address this
limitation, we develop an automated model evaluation (AutoEval) framework for
object detection. We propose Prediction Consistency and Reliability (PCR),
which leverages the multiple candidate bounding boxes that conventional
detectors generate before non-maximum suppression (NMS). PCR estimates
detection performance without ground-truth labels by jointly measuring 1) the
spatial consistency between boxes before and after NMS, and 2) the reliability
of the retained boxes via the confidence scores of overlapping boxes. For a
more realistic and scalable evaluation, we construct a meta-dataset by applying
image corruptions of varying severity. Experimental results demonstrate that
PCR yields more accurate performance estimates than existing AutoEval methods,
and the proposed meta-dataset covers a wider range of detection performance.

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了事件边界检测中的多样性问题，通过生成式方法提供了更符合人类主观感知的边界预测结果。

Abstract: Generic event boundary detection (GEBD) aims to identify natural boundaries
in a video, segmenting it into distinct and meaningful chunks. Despite the
inherent subjectivity of event boundaries, previous methods have focused on
deterministic predictions, overlooking the diversity of plausible solutions. In
this paper, we introduce a novel diffusion-based boundary detection model,
dubbed DiffGEBD, that tackles the problem of GEBD from a generative
perspective. The proposed model encodes relevant changes across adjacent frames
via temporal self-similarity and then iteratively decodes random noise into
plausible event boundaries being conditioned on the encoded features.
Classifier-free guidance allows the degree of diversity to be controlled in
denoising diffusion. In addition, we introduce a new evaluation metric to
assess the quality of predictions considering both diversity and fidelity.
Experiments show that our method achieves strong performance on two standard
benchmarks, Kinetics-GEBD and TAPOS, generating diverse and plausible event
boundaries.

Conclusion: 该方法将系统误差量化转换为监督学习问题，能够在保留关键几何特征的同时进行精确校正，为高精度几何模型创建和改造提供更准确的空间测量

Abstract: We propose a multi-stage convolutional neural network (MSCNN) based
integrated method for reducing uncertainty of 3D point accuracy of lasar
scanner (LS) in rough indoor rooms, providing more accurate spatial
measurements for high-precision geometric model creation and renovation. Due to
different equipment limitations and environmental factors, high-end and low-end
LS have positional errors. Our approach pairs high-accuracy scanners (HAS) as
references with corresponding low-accuracy scanners (LAS) of measurements in
identical environments to quantify specific error patterns. By establishing a
statistical relationship between measurement discrepancies and their spatial
distribution, we develop a correction framework that combines traditional
geometric processing with targeted neural network refinement. This method
transforms the quantification of systematic errors into a supervised learning
problem, allowing precise correction while preserving critical geometric
features. Experimental results in our rough indoor rooms dataset show
significant improvements in measurement accuracy, with mean square error (MSE)
reductions exceeding 70% and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) improvements of
approximately 6 decibels. This approach enables low-end devices to achieve
measurement uncertainty levels approaching those of high-end devices without

Abstract: Diffusion models have transformed image synthesis by establishing
unprecedented quality and creativity benchmarks. Nevertheless, their
large-scale deployment faces challenges due to computationally intensive
iterative denoising processes. Although post-training quantization(PTQ)
provides an effective pathway for accelerating sampling, the iterative nature
of diffusion models causes stepwise quantization errors to accumulate
progressively during generation, inevitably compromising output fidelity. To
address this challenge, we develop a theoretical framework that mathematically
formulates error propagation in Diffusion Models (DMs), deriving per-step
quantization error propagation equations and establishing the first closed-form
solution for cumulative error. Building on this theoretical foundation, we
propose a timestep-aware cumulative error compensation scheme. Extensive
experiments across multiple image datasets demonstrate that our compensation
strategy effectively mitigates error propagation, significantly enhancing
existing PTQ methods to achieve state-of-the-art(SOTA) performance on
low-precision diffusion models.

Abstract: Vision-and-language models (VLMs) have been increasingly explored in the
medical domain, particularly following the success of CLIP in general domain.
However, unlike the relatively straightforward pairing of 2D images and text,
curating large-scale paired data in the medical field for volumetric modalities
such as CT scans remains a challenging and time-intensive process. This
difficulty often limits the performance on downstream tasks. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel vision-language pre-training (VLP) framework,
termed as \textbf{VELVET-Med}, specifically designed for limited volumetric
data such as 3D CT and associated radiology reports. Instead of relying on
large-scale data collection, our method focuses on the development of effective
pre-training objectives and model architectures. The key contributions are: 1)
We incorporate uni-modal self-supervised learning into VLP framework, which are
often underexplored in the existing literature. 2) We propose a novel language
encoder, termed as \textbf{TriBERT}, for learning multi-level textual
semantics. 3) We devise the hierarchical contrastive learning to capture
multi-level vision-language correspondence. Using only 38,875 scan-report
pairs, our approach seeks to uncover rich spatial and semantic relationships
embedded in volumetric medical images and corresponding clinical narratives,
thereby enhancing the generalization ability of the learned encoders. The
resulting encoders exhibit strong transferability, achieving state-of-the-art
performance across a wide range of downstream tasks, including 3D segmentation,
cross-modal retrieval, visual question answering, and report generation.

Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在长思维链推理方面能力不足，需要探索如何更好地模拟人类"看图思考"的迭代推理过程

Method: 提出集成动态视觉工具（裁剪、缩放、重用）的交错视觉语言推理框架，通过监督微调和可扩展的数据合成管道生成高质量推理链

Conclusion: Simple o3建立了强大且计算高效的多模态推理范式，首次深入分析了不同交错推理策略对模型性能的影响

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown impressive performance on
vision-language tasks, but their long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) capabilities in
multimodal scenarios remain underexplored. Inspired by OpenAI's o3 model, which
emulates human-like ''thinking with image'' through iterative visual
transformations and linguistic reasoning, we propose Simple o3, an end-to-end
framework that integrates dynamic tool interactions (e.g., cropping, zooming,
and reusing) into interleaved vision-language reasoning via supervised
fine-tuning (SFT). Our approach features a scalable data synthesis pipeline
that generates high-quality interleaved vision-language reasoning chains via an
''observe-reason-act'' cycle, complete with executable visual operations and
rigorous verification, yielding the open-source TWI-Tools-146K dataset.
Experimental results demonstrate Simple o3's superior performance on diverse
benchmarks, outperforming existing approaches. By combining enhanced reasoning
capabilities, Simple o3 establishes a powerful yet computationally affordable
paradigm for advancing multimodal reasoning. Remarkably, we provide the first
in-depth analysis of different interleaved reasoning strategies, offering
insights into their impact on model performance. We found that by introducing
additional visual tokens for interleaved vision-language reasoning, reusing and
magnifying the original image significantly improves the model's visual
reasoning and fine-grained perception, while image cropping based on precise
visual grounding allows the model to effectively focus on key entities or

*Minh Tran,Johnmark Clements,Annie Prasanna,Tri Nguyen,Ngan Le*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DualFit是一个两阶段的虚拟试穿方法，通过变形和保真融合来保持服装细节，解决了现有方法无法保留logo和印刷文本等细粒度细节的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于扩散模型的免变形虚拟试穿方法虽然提高了感知质量，但往往无法保持对品牌完整性和客户信任至关重要的细粒度服装细节（如logo和印刷文本元素）。

Method: DualFit采用两阶段混合管道：第一阶段使用学习到的流场将目标服装变形以对齐人物图像；第二阶段通过保真试穿模块将变形后的服装与保留的人体区域进行融合，使用保留区域输入和修复掩码来指导过程。

Result: 广泛的定性结果表明，DualFit实现了视觉上无缝的试穿效果，同时忠实地保持了高频服装细节，在重建准确性和感知真实性之间取得了有效平衡。

Conclusion: DualFit通过结合变形和保真融合的方法，成功解决了虚拟试穿中细粒度细节保持的问题，为在线时尚零售提供了更好的可视化体验。

Abstract: Virtual Try-On technology has garnered significant attention for its
potential to transform the online fashion retail experience by allowing users
to visualize how garments would look on them without physical trials. While
recent advances in diffusion-based warping-free methods have improved
perceptual quality, they often fail to preserve fine-grained garment details
such as logos and printed text elements that are critical for brand integrity
and customer trust. In this work, we propose DualFit, a hybrid VTON pipeline
that addresses this limitation by two-stage approach. In the first stage,
DualFit warps the target garment to align with the person image using a learned
flow field, ensuring high-fidelity preservation. In the second stage, a
fidelity-preserving try-on module synthesizes the final output by blending the
warped garment with preserved human regions. Particularly, to guide this
process, we introduce a preserved-region input and an inpainting mask, enabling
the model to retain key areas and regenerate only where necessary, particularly
around garment seams. Extensive qualitative results show that DualFit achieves
visually seamless try-on results while faithfully maintaining high-frequency
garment details, striking an effective balance between reconstruction accuracy
and perceptual realism.

### [41] [TriQDef: Disrupting Semantic and Gradient Alignment to Prevent Adversarial Patch Transferability in Quantized Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12132)
*Amira Guesmi,Bassem Ouni,Muhammad Shafique*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TriQDef是一个三级量化感知防御框架，通过特征不对齐惩罚和梯度感知失谐惩罚来破坏补丁对抗攻击在量化神经网络中的可迁移性，在未见过的量化和补丁组合上降低攻击成功率40%以上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化神经网络(QNNs)虽然在计算和内存使用上高效，但对基于补丁的对抗攻击防御有限，现有方法要么过拟合固定量化设置，要么无法解决跨比特位宽的泛化漏洞。

Method: TriQDef包含三个核心组件：1)特征不对齐惩罚(FDP)通过惩罚中间表示的感知相似性来强制语义不一致；2)梯度感知失谐惩罚(GPDP)通过边缘IoU和HOG余弦度量最小化结构方向一致性来显式错位输入梯度；3)联合量化感知训练协议，在多个量化级别上统一这些惩罚。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和ImageNet上的广泛实验表明，TriQDef在未见过的补丁和量化组合上将攻击成功率(ASR)降低了40%以上，同时保持了高清洁准确率。

Conclusion: 研究强调了破坏语义和感知梯度对齐对于缓解QNNs中补丁可迁移性的重要性，TriQDef框架有效解决了跨比特位宽的防御泛化问题。

Abstract: Quantized Neural Networks (QNNs) are increasingly deployed in edge and
resource-constrained environments due to their efficiency in computation and
memory usage. While shown to distort the gradient landscape and weaken
conventional pixel-level attacks, it provides limited robustness against
patch-based adversarial attacks-localized, high-saliency perturbations that
remain surprisingly transferable across bit-widths. Existing defenses either
overfit to fixed quantization settings or fail to address this cross-bit
generalization vulnerability. We introduce \textbf{TriQDef}, a tri-level
quantization-aware defense framework designed to disrupt the transferability of
patch-based adversarial attacks across QNNs. TriQDef consists of: (1) a Feature
Disalignment Penalty (FDP) that enforces semantic inconsistency by penalizing
perceptual similarity in intermediate representations; (2) a Gradient
Perceptual Dissonance Penalty (GPDP) that explicitly misaligns input gradients
across bit-widths by minimizing structural and directional agreement via Edge
IoU and HOG Cosine metrics; and (3) a Joint Quantization-Aware Training
Protocol that unifies these penalties within a shared-weight training scheme
across multiple quantization levels. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and
ImageNet demonstrate that TriQDef reduces Attack Success Rates (ASR) by over
40\% on unseen patch and quantization combinations, while preserving high clean
accuracy. Our findings underscore the importance of disrupting both semantic
and perceptual gradient alignment to mitigate patch transferability in QNNs.

Motivation: 大规模对比预训练的视觉-语言模型在细粒度开放集检索任务上表现次优，传统微调方法容易导致恐怖忘记，严重影响模型的通用能力

Method: 受继承学习文献启发，系统分析标准正则化技术，提出高效有效的组合策略，同时关注验证集设计和超参数调整等关键因素

Result: 在细粒度和粗粒度图像-图像、图像-文本检索测试中持续获得强劲结果，在不使用文本数据或原始文本编码器的情况下保持了视觉-文本对齐能力

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效解决细粒度领域适配与预训练知识保持之间的平衡问题，为视觉-语言模型的微调提供了可靠的方案

Abstract: Large-scale contrastive pre-training produces powerful Vision-and-Language
Models (VLMs) capable of generating representations (embeddings) effective for
a wide variety of visual and multimodal tasks. However, these pretrained
embeddings remain suboptimal for fine-grained open-set visual retrieval, where
state-of-the-art results require fine-tuning the vision encoder using annotated
domain-specific samples. Naively performing such fine-tuning typically leads to
catastrophic forgetting, severely diminishing the model's general-purpose
visual and cross-modal capabilities.
  In this work, we propose a fine-tuning method explicitly designed to achieve
optimal balance between fine-grained domain adaptation and retention of the
pretrained VLM's broad multimodal knowledge. Drawing inspiration from continual
learning literature, we systematically analyze standard regularization
techniques aimed at knowledge retention and propose an efficient and effective
combination strategy. Additionally, we address the commonly overlooked yet
critical aspects of validation set design and hyperparameter tuning to ensure
reproducibility and robust generalization across datasets and pretrained
models. We extensively evaluate our method on both fine-grained and
coarse-grained image-image and image-text retrieval benchmarks. Our approach
consistently achieves strong results, notably retaining the visual-text
alignment without utilizing any text data or the original text encoder during
fine-tuning. Code and model checkpoints: https://github.com/nikosips/infusing .

Motivation: 现有INR方法主要关注基于坐标的位置嵌入来学习映射，但忽略了目标点及其邻域上下文特征表示的重要性，限制了心脏电影MRI重建的质量

Method: 提出KP-INR双分支INR方法：一个分支处理k空间坐标的位置嵌入，另一个分支学习该坐标处的局部多尺度k空间特征表示，通过跨分支交互来近似目标k空间值

Result: 在CMRxRecon2024数据集上的实验证实了该方法相比基线模型的性能提升，在具有挑战性的笛卡尔k空间数据上表现出色

Conclusion: KP-INR通过结合位置嵌入和局部特征表示的双分支设计，为心脏电影MRI重建领域提供了有前景的解决方案，展示了在该领域的应用潜力

Abstract: Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) imaging is a non-invasive method for
assessing cardiac structure, function, and blood flow. Cine MRI extends this by
capturing heart motion, providing detailed insights into cardiac mechanics. To
reduce scan time and breath-hold discomfort, fast acquisition techniques have
been utilized at the cost of lowering image quality. Recently, Implicit Neural
Representation (INR) methods have shown promise in unsupervised reconstruction
by learning coordinate-to-value mappings from undersampled data, enabling
high-quality image recovery. However, current existing INR methods primarily
focus on using coordinate-based positional embeddings to learn the mapping,
while overlooking the feature representations of the target point and its
neighboring context. In this work, we propose KP-INR, a dual-branch INR method
operating in k-space for cardiac cine MRI reconstruction: one branch processes
the positional embedding of k-space coordinates, while the other learns from
local multi-scale k-space feature representations at those coordinates. By
enabling cross-branch interaction and approximating the target k-space values
from both branches, KP-INR can achieve strong performance on challenging
Cartesian k-space data. Experiments on the CMRxRecon2024 dataset confirms its
improved performance over baseline models and highlights its potential in this
field.

TL;DR: 提出了FB-Mem方法，通过分割技术量化扩散模型中图像生成的记忆化现象，发现记忆化比之前认为的更普遍，现有缓解方法效果有限


<details>

Motivation: 当前检测方法只能识别完全相同的记忆化，无法捕捉小区域的部分记忆化以及超越特定提示-图像对的复杂记忆模式

Method: 提出基于分割的FB-Mem度量方法，对生成图像中的记忆化区域进行分类和量化，并使用聚类方法进行更强的缓解

Result: 发现记忆化现象更普遍：单个提示生成可能关联多个相似训练图像；现有神经元失活和剪枝等缓解方法无法消除局部记忆化，特别是在前景区域

Conclusion: 建立了有效的扩散模型记忆化测量框架，证明了当前缓解方法的不足，并提出基于聚类的更强缓解方法

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) memorize training images and can reproduce
near-duplicates during generation. Current detection methods identify verbatim
memorization but fail to capture two critical aspects: quantifying partial
memorization occurring in small image regions, and memorization patterns beyond
specific prompt-image pairs. To address these limitations, we propose
Foreground Background Memorization (FB-Mem), a novel segmentation-based metric
that classifies and quantifies memorized regions within generated images. Our
method reveals that memorization is more pervasive than previously understood:
(1) individual generations from single prompts may be linked to clusters of
similar training images, revealing complex memorization patterns that extend
beyond one-to-one correspondences; and (2) existing model-level mitigation
methods, such as neuron deactivation and pruning, fail to eliminate local
memorization, which persists particularly in foreground regions. Our work
establishes an effective framework for measuring memorization in diffusion
models, demonstrates the inadequacy of current mitigation approaches, and
proposes a stronger mitigation method using a clustering approach.

Abstract: Emotion is a critical component of artificial social intelligence. However,
while current methods excel in lip synchronization and image quality, they
often fail to generate accurate and controllable emotional expressions while
preserving the subject's identity. To address this challenge, we introduce
RealTalk, a novel framework for synthesizing emotional talking heads with high
emotion accuracy, enhanced emotion controllability, and robust identity
preservation. RealTalk employs a variational autoencoder (VAE) to generate 3D
facial landmarks from driving audio, which are concatenated with emotion-label
embeddings using a ResNet-based landmark deformation model (LDM) to produce
emotional landmarks. These landmarks and facial blendshape coefficients jointly
condition a novel tri-plane attention Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) to
synthesize highly realistic emotional talking heads. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that RealTalk outperforms existing methods in emotion accuracy,
controllability, and identity preservation, advancing the development of
socially intelligent AI systems.

Abstract: Radio Frequency (RF) sensing has emerged as a powerful, privacy-preserving
alternative to vision-based methods for indoor perception tasks. However,
collecting high-quality RF data in dynamic and diverse indoor environments
remains a major challenge. To address this, we introduce WaveVerse, a
prompt-based, scalable framework that simulates realistic RF signals from
generated indoor scenes with human motions. WaveVerse introduces a
language-guided 4D world generator, which includes a state-aware causal
transformer for human motion generation conditioned on spatial constraints and
texts, and a phase-coherent ray tracing simulator that enables the simulation
of accurate and coherent RF signals. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
of our approach in conditioned human motion generation and highlight how phase
coherence is applied to beamforming and respiration monitoring. We further
present two case studies in ML-based high-resolution imaging and human activity
recognition, demonstrating that WaveVerse not only enables data generation for
RF imaging for the first time, but also consistently achieves performance gain
in both data-limited and data-adequate scenarios.

Conclusion: 提出的统一特征提升框架能有效解决多视图不一致性问题，提供高质量特征提升，在3D场景理解任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Feature lifting has emerged as a crucial component in 3D scene understanding,
enabling the attachment of rich image feature descriptors (e.g., DINO, CLIP)
onto splat-based 3D representations. The core challenge lies in optimally
assigning rich general attributes to 3D primitives while addressing the
inconsistency issues from multi-view images. We present a unified, kernel- and
feature-agnostic formulation of the feature lifting problem as a sparse linear
inverse problem, which can be solved efficiently in closed form. Our approach
admits a provable upper bound on the global optimal error under convex losses
for delivering high quality lifted features. To address inconsistencies and
noise in multi-view observations, we introduce two complementary regularization
strategies to stabilize the solution and enhance semantic fidelity. Tikhonov
Guidance enforces numerical stability through soft diagonal dominance, while
Post-Lifting Aggregation filters noisy inputs via feature clustering. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance
on open-vocabulary 3D segmentation benchmarks, outperforming training-based,
grouping-based, and heuristic-forward baselines while producing the lifted
features in minutes. Code is available at

Abstract: Ultrasound computed tomography (USCT) is a radiation-free, high-resolution
modality but remains limited for musculoskeletal imaging due to conventional
ray-based reconstructions that neglect strong scattering. We propose a
generative neural physics framework that couples generative networks with
physics-informed neural simulation for fast, high-fidelity 3D USCT. By learning
a compact surrogate of ultrasonic wave propagation from only dozens of
cross-modality images, our method merges the accuracy of wave modeling with the
efficiency and stability of deep learning. This enables accurate quantitative
imaging of in vivo musculoskeletal tissues, producing spatial maps of acoustic
properties beyond reflection-mode images. On synthetic and in vivo data
(breast, arm, leg), we reconstruct 3D maps of tissue parameters in under ten
minutes, with sensitivity to biomechanical properties in muscle and bone and
resolution comparable to MRI. By overcoming computational bottlenecks in
strongly scattering regimes, this approach advances USCT toward routine
clinical assessment of musculoskeletal disease.

Motivation: 现有显著目标检测方法在自然场景中表现良好，但缺乏对天气噪声影响的研究，主要原因是缺少带有像素级标注的天气噪声数据集。

Method: 提出了WXSOD数据集（14,945张RGB图像），包含合成和真实天气噪声测试集。设计了WFANet网络，采用双分支架构：天气预测分支挖掘天气相关特征，显著性检测分支融合语义特征和天气特征进行检测。

Result: 与17种SOD方法进行综合比较，WFANet在WXSOD数据集上取得了优越性能。

Conclusion: WXSOD数据集填补了天气噪声SOD研究的空白，WFANet为复杂天气条件下的显著目标检测提供了有效的基准方法。

Abstract: Salient object detection (SOD) in complex environments remains a challenging
research topic. Most existing methods perform well in natural scenes with
negligible noise, and tend to leverage multi-modal information (e.g., depth and
infrared) to enhance accuracy. However, few studies are concerned with the
damage of weather noise on SOD performance due to the lack of dataset with
pixel-wise annotations. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces a novel
Weather-eXtended Salient Object Detection (WXSOD) dataset. It consists of
14,945 RGB images with diverse weather noise, along with the corresponding
ground truth annotations and weather labels. To verify algorithm
generalization, WXSOD contains two test sets, i.e., a synthesized test set and
a real test set. The former is generated by adding weather noise to clean
images, while the latter contains real-world weather noise. Based on WXSOD, we
propose an efficient baseline, termed Weather-aware Feature Aggregation Network
(WFANet), which adopts a fully supervised two-branch architecture.
Specifically, the weather prediction branch mines weather-related deep
features, while the saliency detection branch fuses semantic features extracted
from the backbone with weather features for SOD. Comprehensive comparisons
against 17 SOD methods shows that our WFANet achieves superior performance on
WXSOD. The code and benchmark results will be made publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于超像素的连续低秩张量表示框架(SCTR)，解决了传统低秩张量方法在实际应用中的两大限制：整体低秩假设不合理和仅能处理网格数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统低秩张量表示方法假设整体数据都是低秩的，但实际场景中空间变化很大，这个假设常常不成立。同时这些方法只能处理离散网格数据，灵活性和适用性受限。

Method: 提出SCTR框架：1)使用超像素作为基本建模单元，因为语义一致的区域具有更强的低秩特性；2)提出非对称低秩张量分解(ALTF)，通过共享神经网络与专门头部来参数化超像素特征矩阵，分离全局模式学习和局部适应。

Result: 在多个标准数据集上进行了广泛实验，结果显示SCTR在多谱图像、视频和色彩图像处理中，比现有低秩张量方法提高了3-5 dB的PSNR。

Conclusion: SCTR框架通过超像素建模和非对称分解方法，成功克服了传统低秩张量方法的两大限制，实现了连续、灵活的多维数据建模，在保持模型效率的同时提高了适应性和表达能力。

Abstract: Low-rank tensor representation (LRTR) has emerged as a powerful tool for
multi-dimensional data processing. However, classical LRTR-based methods face
two critical limitations: (1) they typically assume that the holistic data is
low-rank, this assumption is often violated in real-world scenarios with
significant spatial variations; and (2) they are constrained to discrete
meshgrid data, limiting their flexibility and applicability. To overcome these
limitations, we propose a Superpixel-informed Continuous low-rank Tensor
Representation (SCTR) framework, which enables continuous and flexible modeling
of multi-dimensional data beyond traditional grid-based constraints. Our
approach introduces two main innovations: First, motivated by the observation
that semantically coherent regions exhibit stronger low-rank characteristics
than holistic data, we employ superpixels as the basic modeling units. This
design not only encodes rich semantic information, but also enhances
adaptability to diverse forms of data streams. Second, we propose a novel
asymmetric low-rank tensor factorization (ALTF) where superpixel-specific
factor matrices are parameterized by a shared neural network with specialized
heads. By strategically separating global pattern learning from local
adaptation, this framework efficiently captures both cross-superpixel
commonalities and within-superpixel variations. This yields a representation
that is both highly expressive and compact, balancing model efficiency with
adaptability. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate
that SCTR achieves 3-5 dB PSNR improvements over existing LRTR-based methods
across multispectral images, videos, and color images.

Abstract: Despite significant progress, existing research on Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) mainly focuses on general visual understanding, overlooking the
ability to integrate textual context associated with objects for a more
context-aware multimodal understanding -- an ability we refer to as
Region-level Context-aware Multimodal Understanding (RCMU). To address this
limitation, we first formulate the RCMU task, which requires models to respond
to user instructions by integrating both image content and textual information
of regions or objects. To equip MLLMs with RCMU capabilities, we propose
Region-level Context-aware Visual Instruction Tuning (RCVIT), which
incorporates object information into the model input and enables the model to
utilize bounding box coordinates to effectively associate objects' visual
content with their textual information. To address the lack of datasets, we
introduce the RCMU dataset, a large-scale visual instruction tuning dataset
that covers multiple RCMU tasks. We also propose RC\&P-Bench, a comprehensive
benchmark that can evaluate the performance of MLLMs in RCMU and multimodal
personalized understanding tasks. Additionally, we propose a reference-free
evaluation metric to perform a comprehensive and fine-grained evaluation of the
region-level context-aware image descriptions. By performing RCVIT on Qwen2-VL
models with the RCMU dataset, we developed RC-Qwen2-VL models. Experimental
results indicate that RC-Qwen2-VL models not only achieve outstanding
performance on multiple RCMU tasks but also demonstrate successful applications
in multimodal RAG and personalized conversation. Our data, model and benchmark

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), characterized by discrete binary activations,
offer high computational efficiency and low energy consumption, making them
well-suited for computation-intensive tasks such as stereo image restoration.
In this work, we propose SNNSIR, a simple yet effective Spiking Neural Network
for Stereo Image Restoration, specifically designed under the spike-driven
paradigm where neurons transmit information through sparse, event-based binary
spikes. In contrast to existing hybrid SNN-ANN models that still rely on
operations such as floating-point matrix division or exponentiation, which are
incompatible with the binary and event-driven nature of SNNs, our proposed
SNNSIR adopts a fully spike-driven architecture to achieve low-power and
hardware-friendly computation. To address the expressiveness limitations of
binary spiking neurons, we first introduce a lightweight Spike Residual Basic
Block (SRBB) to enhance information flow via spike-compatible residual
learning. Building on this, the Spike Stereo Convolutional Modulation (SSCM)
module introduces simplified nonlinearity through element-wise multiplication
and highlights noise-sensitive regions via cross-view-aware modulation.
Complementing this, the Spike Stereo Cross-Attention (SSCA) module further
improves stereo correspondence by enabling efficient bidirectional feature
interaction across views within a spike-compatible framework. Extensive
experiments on diverse stereo image restoration tasks, including rain streak
removal, raindrop removal, low-light enhancement, and super-resolution
demonstrate that our model achieves competitive restoration performance while
significantly reducing computational overhead. These results highlight the
potential for real-time, low-power stereo vision applications. The code will be
available after the article is accepted.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶平台面临多样化驾驶场景，各自具有不同的硬件资源和精度要求。在嵌入式设备计算能力有限的情况下，需要根据目标平台的计算成本进行网络定制

Method: 采用三级控制机制（宽度倍增器、分类器深度、分类器内核）实现细粒度控制，利用贝叶斯优化和代模建模高效探索超参数空间

Conclusion: 该方法通过动态适配机制有效优化了自动驾驶平台的硬件利用率，能够根据具体场景和任务需求进行精准的资源分配和性能优化

Abstract: Autonomous driving platforms encounter diverse driving scenarios, each with
varying hardware resources and precision requirements. Given the computational
limitations of embedded devices, it is crucial to consider computing costs when
deploying on target platforms like the NVIDIA\textsuperscript{\textregistered}
DRIVE PX 2. Our objective is to customize the semantic segmentation network
according to the computing power and specific scenarios of autonomous driving
hardware. We implement dynamic adaptability through a three-tier control
mechanism -- width multiplier, classifier depth, and classifier kernel --
allowing fine-grained control over model components based on hardware
constraints and task requirements. This adaptability facilitates broad model
scaling, targeted refinement of the final layers, and scenario-specific
optimization of kernel sizes, leading to improved resource allocation and
performance.
  Additionally, we leverage Bayesian Optimization with surrogate modeling to
efficiently explore hyperparameter spaces under tight computational budgets.
Our approach addresses scenario-specific and task-specific requirements through
automatic parameter search, accommodating the unique computational complexity
and accuracy needs of autonomous driving. It scales its Multiply-Accumulate
Operations (MACs) for Task-Specific Learning Adaptation (TSLA), resulting in
alternative configurations tailored to diverse self-driving tasks. These TSLA
customizations maximize computational capacity and model accuracy, optimizing
hardware utilization.

TL;DR: 本文提出CLAIR方法，利用CLIP大模型生成噪声伪标签进行弱监督跨域图像检索，通过置信度评分、对比学习和跨域映射来提升检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型基础模型能够轻松为大量未标注数据生成伪标签，无监督零样本跨域图像检索变得不再那么重要，因此转向研究使用CLIP等大模型生成噪声伪标签的弱监督方法。

Method: 提出CLAIR方法：1）使用CLIP文本和图像特征的相似度计算置信度来精炼噪声伪标签；2）设计实例间和簇间对比损失来编码类感知潜在空间；3）使用域间对比损失减少域差异；4）学习闭式跨域映射函数；5）引入可学习提示增强零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: CLAIR方法有效解决了弱监督零样本跨域图像检索问题，通过精炼噪声伪标签、对比学习和跨域映射等技术，显著提升了检索性能，特别是在处理新类别时表现出良好的零样本泛化能力。

Abstract: The recent growth of large foundation models that can easily generate
pseudo-labels for huge quantity of unlabeled data makes unsupervised Zero-Shot
Cross-Domain Image Retrieval (UZS-CDIR) less relevant. In this paper, we
therefore turn our attention to weakly supervised ZS-CDIR (WSZS-CDIR) with
noisy pseudo labels generated by large foundation models such as CLIP. To this
end, we propose CLAIR to refine the noisy pseudo-labels with a confidence score
from the similarity between the CLIP text and image features. Furthermore, we
design inter-instance and inter-cluster contrastive losses to encode images
into a class-aware latent space, and an inter-domain contrastive loss to
alleviate domain discrepancies. We also learn a novel cross-domain mapping
function in closed-form, using only CLIP text embeddings to project image
features from one domain to another, thereby further aligning the image
features for retrieval. Finally, we enhance the zero-shot generalization
ability of our CLAIR to handle novel categories by introducing an extra set of
learnable prompts. Extensive experiments are carried out using TUBerlin,
Sketchy, Quickdraw, and DomainNet zero-shot datasets, where our CLAIR
consistently shows superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art
methods.

TL;DR: 改进3D高斯散点的密化策略，通过边缘感知选择、长轴分割和抑制过拟合技术，在不增加计算开销的情况下提升渲染质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯散点的密化策略导致重建质量不佳，需要从密化时机、方式和过拟合控制三个方面进行全面改进

Method: 提出边缘感知分数选择分割候选高斯，长轴分割策略减少几何失真，以及恢复感知剪枝、多步更新和增长控制来抑制过拟合

Result: 方法在不增加训练或推理开销的情况下，使用更少的高斯实现了独创的渲染保真度

Conclusion: 通过系统性的密化流程改进，显著提升了3D高斯散点的重建质量，为实时渲染领域提供了更有效的解决方案

Abstract: Although 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has achieved impressive performance in
real-time rendering, its densification strategy often results in suboptimal
reconstruction quality. In this work, we present a comprehensive improvement to
the densification pipeline of 3DGS from three perspectives: when to densify,
how to densify, and how to mitigate overfitting. Specifically, we propose an
Edge-Aware Score to effectively select candidate Gaussians for splitting. We
further introduce a Long-Axis Split strategy that reduces geometric distortions
introduced by clone and split operations. To address overfitting, we design a
set of techniques, including Recovery-Aware Pruning, Multi-step Update, and
Growth Control. Our method enhances rendering fidelity without introducing
additional training or inference overhead, achieving state-of-the-art
performance with fewer Gaussians.

Abstract: The detection and segmentation of white blood cells in blood smear images is
a key step in medical diagnostics, supporting various downstream tasks such as
automated blood cell counting, morphological analysis, cell classification, and
disease diagnosis and monitoring. Training robust and accurate models requires
large amounts of labeled data, which is both time-consuming and expensive to
acquire. In this work, we propose a novel approach for weakly supervised
segmentation using neural cellular automata (NCA-WSS). By leveraging the
feature maps generated by NCA during classification, we can extract
segmentation masks without the need for retraining with segmentation labels. We
evaluate our method on three white blood cell microscopy datasets and
demonstrate that NCA-WSS significantly outperforms existing weakly supervised
approaches. Our work illustrates the potential of NCA for both classification
and segmentation in a weakly supervised framework, providing a scalable and
efficient solution for medical image analysis.

Method: 集成注意力池化机制到NCA中，通过注意力池化精炼重点关注最信息丰富的区域，从而改善特征提取和分类准确性

Result: 在8个多样化显微镜图像数据集上评估，方法显著超过现有NCA方法，同时保持低参数数量。与传统轻量卷积神经网络和视觉Transformer架构相比，显示出更好的性能且参数数量显著更低

Conclusion: 该研究突出了NCA基础模型作为可解释图像分类的潜在替代方案的价值，通过注意力池化的集成有效缩小了NCA与复杂架构之间的性能差距

Abstract: Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) offer a robust and interpretable approach to
image classification, making them a promising choice for microscopy image
analysis. However, a performance gap remains between NCA and larger, more
complex architectures. We address this challenge by integrating attention
pooling with NCA to enhance feature extraction and improve classification
accuracy. The attention pooling mechanism refines the focus on the most
informative regions, leading to more accurate predictions. We evaluate our
method on eight diverse microscopy image datasets and demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms existing NCA methods while remaining
parameter-efficient and explainable. Furthermore, we compare our method with
traditional lightweight convolutional neural network and vision transformer
architectures, showing improved performance while maintaining a significantly

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DoppDrive是一种基于多普勒效应的雷达点云时间聚合方法，通过径向移动和动态聚合持续时间来增强点云密度，减少散射，提高目标检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 雷达在自动驾驶中具有长距离检测优势，但远距离点云稀疏问题严重。现有时间聚合方法会引入动态物体散射，降低检测性能。

Method: 提出DoppDrive方法：根据多普勒动态分量径向移动历史帧点云消除径向散射；基于多普勒和角度为每个点分配独特聚合持续时间以减少切向散射。

Result: DoppDrive作为检测前的点云密度增强步骤，与任何检测器兼容，在不同检测器和数据集上显著提升目标检测性能。

Conclusion: DoppDrive通过多普勒驱动的智能时间聚合，有效解决了雷达点云稀疏和散射问题，为自动驾驶雷达目标检测提供了有效的预处理方案。

Abstract: Radar-based object detection is essential for autonomous driving due to
radar's long detection range. However, the sparsity of radar point clouds,
especially at long range, poses challenges for accurate detection. Existing
methods increase point density through temporal aggregation with ego-motion
compensation, but this approach introduces scatter from dynamic objects,
degrading detection performance. We propose DoppDrive, a novel Doppler-Driven
temporal aggregation method that enhances radar point cloud density while
minimizing scatter. Points from previous frames are shifted radially according
to their dynamic Doppler component to eliminate radial scatter, with each point
assigned a unique aggregation duration based on its Doppler and angle to
minimize tangential scatter. DoppDrive is a point cloud density enhancement
step applied before detection, compatible with any detector, and we demonstrate
that it significantly improves object detection performance across various
detectors and datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 一种基于深度学习的框架，能够从单视点RGB视频中同时去除头成显示器遮挡并重建完整三维面部几何，为社交XR应用提供自然的面部表情和眼神交互。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 头成显示器(HMDs)遮挡用户面部上部分，影响视频记录和社交XR应用的沉浸式体验，特别是在远程会议中面部表情和眼神交互至关重要。

Method: 集成GAN基础的视频修复网络，在密集面部关键点和单张无遮挡参照帧指导下恢复缺失面部区域保持身份识别；使用SynergyNet基础模块从修复后帧回归3DMM参数实现准确三维面部重建；通过密集关键点优化提升修复质量和几何保真度。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的几何意识学习框架能够高效地解决HMD遮挡问题，为社交XR应用提供了可靠的面部表情重建方案，具有良好的应用前景。

Abstract: Head-mounted displays (HMDs) are essential for experiencing extended reality
(XR) environments and observing virtual content. However, they obscure the
upper part of the user's face, complicating external video recording and
significantly impacting social XR applications such as teleconferencing, where
facial expressions and eye gaze details are crucial for creating an immersive
experience. This study introduces a geometry-aware learning-based framework to
jointly remove HMD occlusions and reconstruct complete 3D facial geometry from
RGB frames captured from a single viewpoint. The method integrates a GAN-based
video inpainting network, guided by dense facial landmarks and a single
occlusion-free reference frame, to restore missing facial regions while
preserving identity. Subsequently, a SynergyNet-based module regresses 3D
Morphable Model (3DMM) parameters from the inpainted frames, enabling accurate
3D face reconstruction. Dense landmark optimization is incorporated throughout
the pipeline to improve both the inpainting quality and the fidelity of the
recovered geometry. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
framework can successfully remove HMDs from RGB facial videos while maintaining
facial identity and realism, producing photorealistic 3D face geometry outputs.
Ablation studies further show that the framework remains robust across
different landmark densities, with only minor quality degradation under sparse
landmark configurations.

Motivation: 随着图像生成技术的快速发展，需要强大的伪造检测来确保数字媒体的可信度。现有方法中伪造空间和语义概念空间的不对齐问题限制了检测性能

Method: 提出语义差异感知检测器(SDD)：1)语义标记采样模块缓解与伪造痕迹和语义概念无关的特征造成的空间偏移；2)基于视觉重建范式的概念级伪造差异学习模块；3)低级伪造特征增强器整合学习到的概念级差异

Result: 在两个标准图像伪造数据集上的实验证明SDD的有效性，相比现有方法取得了更优异的结果

Conclusion: SDD通过重建学习有效对齐伪造和语义概念空间，利用预训练模型的概念知识显著提升了伪造检测性能

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of image generation techniques, robust forgery
detection has become increasingly imperative to ensure the trustworthiness of
digital media. Recent research indicates that the learned semantic concepts of
pre-trained models are critical for identifying fake images. However, the
misalignment between the forgery and semantic concept spaces hinders the
model's forgery detection performance. To address this problem, we propose a
novel Semantic Discrepancy-aware Detector (SDD) that leverages reconstruction
learning to align the two spaces at a fine-grained visual level. By exploiting
the conceptual knowledge embedded in the pre-trained vision language model, we
specifically design a semantic token sampling module to mitigate the space
shifts caused by features irrelevant to both forgery traces and semantic
concepts. A concept-level forgery discrepancy learning module, built upon a
visual reconstruction paradigm, is proposed to strengthen the interaction
between visual semantic concepts and forgery traces, effectively capturing
discrepancies under the concepts' guidance. Finally, the low-level forgery
feature enhancemer integrates the learned concept level forgery discrepancies
to minimize redundant forgery information. Experiments conducted on two
standard image forgery datasets demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed SDD,
which achieves superior results compared to existing methods. The code is
available at https://github.com/wzy1111111/SSD.

novel, plug-and-play module that performs task-driven feature enhancement. Our
approach integrates a multi-scale feature enhancement network trained

is explicitly guided to refine features most relevant to the detection task.
When integrated with YOLOv8m on challenging underwater datasets, AquaFeat
achieves state-of-the-art Precision (0.877) and Recall (0.624), along with

Method: 设计内存缓冲机制保留历史信息用于后期融合，以及Ising受正则化损失模拟物理系统的能量最小化原理维护图像结构

Result: 在广泛使用的测试集上超越了目前最先进的方法

Conclusion: MBMamba在不改变原始Mamba架构的情况下，通过内存缓冲和正则化技术有效解决了空间信息聚合问题，实现了更好的图像去模糊效果

Abstract: The Mamba architecture has emerged as a promising alternative to CNNs and
Transformers for image deblurring. However, its flatten-and-scan strategy often
results in local pixel forgetting and channel redundancy, limiting its ability
to effectively aggregate 2D spatial information. Although existing methods
mitigate this by modifying the scan strategy or incorporating local feature
modules, it increase computational complexity and hinder real-time performance.
In this paper, we propose a structure-aware image deblurring network without
changing the original Mamba architecture. Specifically, we design a memory
buffer mechanism to preserve historical information for later fusion, enabling
reliable modeling of relevance between adjacent features. Additionally, we
introduce an Ising-inspired regularization loss that simulates the energy
minimization of the physical system's "mutual attraction" between pixels,
helping to maintain image structure and coherence. Building on this, we develop
MBMamba. Experimental results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches on widely used benchmarks.

Abstract: Analyzing hand-object interaction in egocentric vision facilitates VR/AR
applications and human-robot policy transfer. Existing research has mostly
focused on modeling the behavior paradigm of interactive actions (i.e., ``how
to interact''). However, the more challenging and fine-grained problem of
capturing the critical moments of contact and separation between the hand and
the target object (i.e., ``when to interact'') is still underexplored, which is
crucial for immersive interactive experiences in mixed reality and robotic
motion planning. Therefore, we formulate this problem as temporal interaction
localization (TIL). Some recent works extract semantic masks as TIL references,
but suffer from inaccurate object grounding and cluttered scenarios. Although
current temporal action localization (TAL) methods perform well in detecting
verb-noun action segments, they rely on category annotations during training
and exhibit limited precision in localizing hand-object contact/separation
moments. To address these issues, we propose a novel zero-shot approach dubbed
EgoLoc to localize hand-object contact and separation timestamps in egocentric
videos. EgoLoc introduces hand-dynamics-guided sampling to generate
high-quality visual prompts. It exploits the vision-language model to identify
contact/separation attributes, localize specific timestamps, and provide
closed-loop feedback for further refinement. EgoLoc eliminates the need for
object masks and verb-noun taxonomies, leading to generalizable zero-shot
implementation. Comprehensive experiments on the public dataset and our novel
benchmarks demonstrate that EgoLoc achieves plausible TIL for egocentric
videos. It is also validated to effectively facilitate multiple downstream
applications in egocentric vision and robotic manipulation tasks. Code and
relevant data will be released at https://github.com/IRMVLab/EgoLoc.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线RL在视觉数据上遇到通用性挑战，包括噪声、分散注意力和偏相关系等问题，导致过拟合和演策弱的演策通用性

Method: 两步过程：首先对原始离线数据进行扩增提升零样本通用性，然后使用漩射模型在潜空间生成额外的合成数据

Result: 在连续动作空间(Visual D4RL)和离散动作空间(Procgen)上都显著改喂了通用性，减小了测试时的通用性差距，同时保持计算效率

Conclusion: 该方法不需改变现有离线RL算法，通过生成合成数据可以培养更具通用性的演策，为未来研究提供了有前景的方向

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising framework for training
agents using pre-collected datasets without the need for further environment
interaction. However, policies trained on offline data often struggle to
generalise due to limited exposure to diverse states. The complexity of visual
data introduces additional challenges such as noise, distractions, and spurious
correlations, which can misguide the policy and increase the risk of
overfitting if the training data is not sufficiently diverse. Indeed, this
makes it challenging to leverage vision-based offline data in training robust
agents that can generalize to unseen environments. To solve this problem, we
propose a simple approach generating additional synthetic training data. We
propose a two-step process, first augmenting the originally collected offline
data to improve zero-shot generalization by introducing diversity, then using a
diffusion model to generate additional data in latent space. We test our method
across both continuous action spaces (Visual D4RL) and discrete action spaces
(Procgen), demonstrating that it significantly improves generalization without
requiring any algorithmic changes to existing model-free offline RL methods. We
show that our method not only increases the diversity of the training data but
also significantly reduces the generalization gap at test time while
maintaining computational efficiency. We believe this approach could fuel
additional progress in generating synthetic data to train more general agents
in the future.

Motivation: 现有病理图像生存分析方法难以平衡长距离空间关系建模与局部上下文依赖，且缺乏内在可解释性，限制了临床实用性。

Method: 提出Interpretable Pathology Graph-Transformer (IPGPhormer)框架，捕捉肿瘤微环境特征并建模组织空间依赖关系，无需后处理手动标注即可在组织和细胞层面提供可解释性。

Conclusion: IPGPhormer为癌症预后评估提供了一个有前景的工具，为病理学中更可靠和可解释的决策支持系统铺平了道路。

Abstract: Pathological images play an essential role in cancer prognosis, while
survival analysis, which integrates computational techniques, can predict
critical clinical events such as patient mortality or disease recurrence from
whole-slide images (WSIs). Recent advancements in multiple instance learning
have significantly improved the efficiency of survival analysis. However,
existing methods often struggle to balance the modeling of long-range spatial
relationships with local contextual dependencies and typically lack inherent
interpretability, limiting their clinical utility. To address these challenges,
we propose the Interpretable Pathology Graph-Transformer (IPGPhormer), a novel
framework that captures the characteristics of the tumor microenvironment and
models their spatial dependencies across the tissue. IPGPhormer uniquely
provides interpretability at both tissue and cellular levels without requiring
post-hoc manual annotations, enabling detailed analyses of individual WSIs and
cross-cohort assessments. Comprehensive evaluations on four public benchmark
datasets demonstrate that IPGPhormer outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
both predictive accuracy and interpretability. In summary, our method,
IPGPhormer, offers a promising tool for cancer prognosis assessment, paving the
way for more reliable and interpretable decision-support systems in pathology.

TL;DR: 本文提出ViT-EnsembleAttack方法，通过对替代ViT模型进行对抗增帽来提升集成攻击的转移性，超越了现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有集成攻击研究主要关注集成权重或路径优化，忽视了通过插提升集成模型来增强对抗性攻击的转移性。同时，ViT集成攻击得到的关注较少。

Method: 提出对替代ViT模型进行对抗增帽：多头投票丢弃、注意力分数缩放、MLP特征混合。使用贝叶斯优化来优化相关参数，并集成这些增帽模型来生成对抗示例。还包含自动重新加权和步长扩大模块。

Result: 实验结果显示ViT-EnsembleAttack显著提升了集成攻击在ViT上的对抗转移性，性能远超现有方法。

Conclusion: 通过对替代ViT模型进行对抗增帽可以有效提升集成攻击的转移性，减少对抗过拟合风险，为ViT对抗攻击提供了新方向。

Abstract: Ensemble-based attacks have been proven to be effective in enhancing
adversarial transferability by aggregating the outputs of models with various
architectures. However, existing research primarily focuses on refining
ensemble weights or optimizing the ensemble path, overlooking the exploration
of ensemble models to enhance the transferability of adversarial attacks. To
address this gap, we propose applying adversarial augmentation to the surrogate
models, aiming to boost overall generalization of ensemble models and reduce
the risk of adversarial overfitting. Meanwhile, observing that ensemble Vision
Transformers (ViTs) gain less attention, we propose ViT-EnsembleAttack based on
the idea of model adversarial augmentation, the first ensemble-based attack
method tailored for ViTs to the best of our knowledge. Our approach generates
augmented models for each surrogate ViT using three strategies: Multi-head
dropping, Attention score scaling, and MLP feature mixing, with the associated
parameters optimized by Bayesian optimization. These adversarially augmented
models are ensembled to generate adversarial examples. Furthermore, we
introduce Automatic Reweighting and Step Size Enlargement modules to boost
transferability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ViT-EnsembleAttack
significantly enhances the adversarial transferability of ensemble-based
attacks on ViTs, outperforming existing methods by a substantial margin. Code

*Xiaochuan Lin,Xiangyong Chen,Xuan Li,Yichen Su*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeCoT是一个通过LLM分解复杂文本指令来提升T2I模型性能的框架，在LongBench-T2I基准测试中显著改善了图像生成质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前T2I模型在处理复杂长文本指令时表现不佳，经常无法准确渲染细节、空间关系和特定约束，需要更好的方法来理解和执行复杂指令

Method: DeCoT框架包含两个核心阶段：1）复杂指令分解和语义增强，使用LLM将原始指令分解为结构化语义单元；2）多阶段提示集成和自适应生成，将这些单元转换为适合T2I模型的层次化或优化提示

Result: 在LongBench-T2I数据集上，DeCoT显著提升了主流T2I模型的性能，特别是在"文本"和"构图"等挑战性维度。与Infinity-8B集成时平均得分3.52，优于基线3.44。人工评估也证实了感知质量和指令保真度的提升

Conclusion: DeCoT有效弥合了高级用户意图与T2I模型需求之间的差距，实现了更忠实和准确的图像生成，证明了LLM在增强T2I模型理解复杂指令方面的重要价值

Abstract: Despite remarkable advancements, current Text-to-Image (T2I) models struggle
with complex, long-form textual instructions, frequently failing to accurately
render intricate details, spatial relationships, or specific constraints. This
limitation is highlighted by benchmarks such as LongBench-T2I, which reveal
deficiencies in handling composition, specific text, and fine textures. To
address this, we propose DeCoT (Decomposition-CoT), a novel framework that
leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to significantly enhance T2I models'
understanding and execution of complex instructions. DeCoT operates in two core
stages: first, Complex Instruction Decomposition and Semantic Enhancement,
where an LLM breaks down raw instructions into structured, actionable semantic
units and clarifies ambiguities; second, Multi-Stage Prompt Integration and
Adaptive Generation, which transforms these units into a hierarchical or
optimized single prompt tailored for existing T2I models. Extensive experiments
on the LongBench-T2I dataset demonstrate that DeCoT consistently and
substantially improves the performance of leading T2I models across all
evaluated dimensions, particularly in challenging aspects like "Text" and
"Composition". Quantitative results, validated by multiple MLLM evaluators
(Gemini-2.0-Flash and InternVL3-78B), show that DeCoT, when integrated with
Infinity-8B, achieves an average score of 3.52, outperforming the baseline
Infinity-8B (3.44). Ablation studies confirm the critical contribution of each
DeCoT component and the importance of sophisticated LLM prompting. Furthermore,
human evaluations corroborate these findings, indicating superior perceptual
quality and instruction fidelity. DeCoT effectively bridges the gap between
high-level user intent and T2I model requirements, leading to more faithful and
accurate image generation.

TL;DR: FedCSAP是一个联邦学习框架，利用CLIP的多尺度视觉特征和客户端特定风格指标生成上下文感知的提示词，在保护数据隐私的同时提升跨域泛化性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法仅使用最终层特征，无法充分利用多尺度视觉线索和客户端数据的领域特定风格变化，限制了联邦学习中视觉语言模型的性能

Method: 从CLIP视觉编码器提取低、中、高三个层次的特征，结合客户端批量统计的风格指标，融合视觉细节和文本上下文生成鲁棒且非冗余的提示词

Result: 在多个图像分类数据集上，FedCSAP在准确率和整体泛化能力方面均优于现有的联邦提示学习方法

Conclusion: 该框架通过有效利用多尺度特征和风格信息，在联邦学习环境下实现了更好的跨域泛化性能，同时保障了数据隐私

Abstract: Prompt learning has propelled vision-language models like CLIP to excel in
diverse tasks, making them ideal for federated learning due to computational
efficiency. However, conventional approaches that rely solely on final-layer
features miss out on rich multi-scale visual cues and domain-specific style
variations in decentralized client data. To bridge this gap, we introduce
FedCSAP (Federated Cross-Modal Style-Aware Prompt Generation). Our framework
harnesses low, mid, and high-level features from CLIP's vision encoder
alongside client-specific style indicators derived from batch-level statistics.
By merging intricate visual details with textual context, FedCSAP produces
robust, context-aware prompt tokens that are both distinct and non-redundant,
thereby boosting generalization across seen and unseen classes. Operating
within a federated learning paradigm, our approach ensures data privacy through
local training and global aggregation, adeptly handling non-IID class
distributions and diverse domain-specific styles. Comprehensive experiments on
multiple image classification datasets confirm that FedCSAP outperforms
existing federated prompt learning methods in both accuracy and overall
generalization.

TL;DR: MPCAR是一种无需微调的推理时策略，通过多角度生成描述和推理路径来增强大型视觉语言模型的上下文理解能力，在复杂视觉推理任务中显著提升性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型视觉语言模型在需要深度上下文理解、多角度分析或细致细节识别的复杂视觉推理任务中仍面临挑战，单次图像编码和提示限制了其捕捉细微视觉信息的能力

Method: 三阶段方法：1) 从不同角度生成N个多样互补的描述或初步推理路径；2) 智能整合这些描述与原始问题构建上下文增强提示；3) 使用增强提示指导最终深度推理和答案生成

Result: 在GQA、VQA-CP v2和ScienceQA等具有挑战性的VQA数据集上持续超越基线方法，定量结果显示准确性显著提升，特别是在需要强健上下文理解的任务上，人类评估也确认了生成答案的连贯性和完整性改进

Conclusion: 这项工作强调了利用LVLMs固有生成能力来丰富输入上下文的有效性，从而释放其在复杂多模态任务中的潜在推理潜力，无需调整模型参数即可实现性能提升

Abstract: Despite significant advancements, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs)
continue to face challenges in complex visual reasoning tasks that demand deep
contextual understanding, multi-angle analysis, or meticulous detail
recognition. Existing approaches often rely on single-shot image encoding and
prompts, limiting their ability to fully capture nuanced visual information.
Inspired by the notion that strategically generated "additional" information
can serve as beneficial contextual augmentation, we propose Multi-Perspective
Contextual Augmentation for Reasoning (MPCAR), a novel inference-time strategy
designed to enhance LVLM performance. MPCAR operates in three stages: first, an
LVLM generates N diverse and complementary descriptions or preliminary
reasoning paths from various angles; second, these descriptions are
intelligently integrated with the original question to construct a
comprehensive context-augmented prompt; and finally, this enriched prompt
guides the ultimate LVLM for deep reasoning and final answer generation.
Crucially, MPCAR achieves these enhancements without requiring any fine-tuning
of the underlying LVLM's parameters. Extensive experiments on challenging
Visual Question Answering (VQA) datasets, including GQA, VQA-CP v2, and
ScienceQA (Image-VQA), demonstrate that MPCAR consistently outperforms
established baseline methods. Our quantitative results show significant
accuracy gains, particularly on tasks requiring robust contextual
understanding, while human evaluations confirm improved coherence and
completeness of the generated answers. Ablation studies further highlight the
importance of diverse prompt templates and the number of generated
perspectives. This work underscores the efficacy of leveraging LVLMs' inherent
generative capabilities to enrich input contexts, thereby unlocking their
latent reasoning potential for complex multimodal tasks.

Conclusion: LMAD为可解释自动驾驶设立了新标准，完全兼容现有VLM，并能无缝集成到规划导向的驾驶系统中

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) have shown promising capabilities in
scene understanding, enhancing the explainability of driving behaviors and
interactivity with users. Existing methods primarily fine-tune VLMs on on-board
multi-view images and scene reasoning text, but this approach often lacks the
holistic and nuanced scene recognition and powerful spatial awareness required
for autonomous driving, especially in complex situations. To address this gap,
we propose a novel vision-language framework tailored for autonomous driving,
called LMAD. Our framework emulates modern end-to-end driving paradigms by
incorporating comprehensive scene understanding and a task-specialized
structure with VLMs. In particular, we introduce preliminary scene interaction
and specialized expert adapters within the same driving task structure, which
better align VLMs with autonomous driving scenarios. Furthermore, our approach
is designed to be fully compatible with existing VLMs while seamlessly
integrating with planning-oriented driving systems. Extensive experiments on
the DriveLM and nuScenes-QA datasets demonstrate that LMAD significantly boosts
the performance of existing VLMs on driving reasoning tasks,setting a new
standard in explainable autonomous driving.

Abstract: Semi-supervised semantic segmentation (S4) has advanced remote sensing (RS)
analysis by leveraging unlabeled data through pseudo-labeling and consistency
learning. However, existing S4 studies often rely on small-scale datasets and
models, limiting their practical applicability. To address this, we propose S5,
the first scalable framework for semi-supervised semantic segmentation in RS,
which unlocks the potential of vast unlabeled Earth observation data typically
underutilized due to costly pixel-level annotations. Built upon existing
large-scale RS datasets, S5 introduces a data selection strategy that
integrates entropy-based filtering and diversity expansion, resulting in the
RS4P-1M dataset. Using this dataset, we systematically scales S4 methods by
pre-training RS foundation models (RSFMs) of varying sizes on this extensive
corpus, significantly boosting their performance on land cover segmentation and
object detection tasks. Furthermore, during fine-tuning, we incorporate a
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based multi-dataset fine-tuning approach, which
enables efficient adaptation to multiple RS benchmarks with fewer parameters.
This approach improves the generalization and versatility of RSFMs across
diverse RS benchmarks. The resulting RSFMs achieve state-of-the-art performance
across all benchmarks, underscoring the viability of scaling semi-supervised
learning for RS applications. All datasets, code, and models will be released

Abstract: Liver Cirrhosis plays a critical role in the prognosis of chronic liver
disease. Early detection and timely intervention are critical in significantly
reducing mortality rates. However, the intricate anatomical architecture and
diverse pathological changes of liver tissue complicate the accurate detection
and characterization of lesions in clinical settings. Existing methods
underutilize the spatial anatomical details in volumetric MRI data, thereby
hindering their clinical effectiveness and explainability. To address this
challenge, we introduce a novel Mamba-based network, SRMA-Mamba, designed to
model the spatial relationships within the complex anatomical structures of MRI
volumes. By integrating the Spatial Anatomy-Based Mamba module (SABMamba),
SRMA-Mamba performs selective Mamba scans within liver cirrhotic tissues and
combines anatomical information from the sagittal, coronal, and axial planes to
construct a global spatial context representation, enabling efficient
volumetric segmentation of pathological liver structures. Furthermore, we
introduce the Spatial Reverse Attention module (SRMA), designed to
progressively refine cirrhotic details in the segmentation map, utilizing both
the coarse segmentation map and hierarchical encoding features. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that SRMA-Mamba surpasses state-of-the-art methods,
delivering exceptional performance in 3D pathological liver segmentation. Our

Conclusion: TiP4GEN框架成功实现了细粒度内容控制和几何一致的动态全景4D场景生成，为创建沉浸式虚拟环境提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement and widespread adoption of VR/AR technologies,
there is a growing demand for the creation of high-quality, immersive dynamic
scenes. However, existing generation works predominantly concentrate on the
creation of static scenes or narrow perspective-view dynamic scenes, falling
short of delivering a truly 360-degree immersive experience from any viewpoint.
In this paper, we introduce \textbf{TiP4GEN}, an advanced text-to-dynamic
panorama scene generation framework that enables fine-grained content control
and synthesizes motion-rich, geometry-consistent panoramic 4D scenes. TiP4GEN
integrates panorama video generation and dynamic scene reconstruction to create
360-degree immersive virtual environments. For video generation, we introduce a
\textbf{Dual-branch Generation Model} consisting of a panorama branch and a
perspective branch, responsible for global and local view generation,
respectively. A bidirectional cross-attention mechanism facilitates
comprehensive information exchange between the branches. For scene
reconstruction, we propose a \textbf{Geometry-aligned Reconstruction Model}
based on 3D Gaussian Splatting. By aligning spatial-temporal point clouds using
metric depth maps and initializing scene cameras with estimated poses, our
method ensures geometric consistency and temporal coherence for the
reconstructed scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of
our proposed designs and the superiority of TiP4GEN in generating visually
compelling and motion-coherent dynamic panoramic scenes. Our project page is at

Conclusion: 视觉幻觉研究揭示了AI特有的感知脆弱性，为开发既保留有益人类感知偏差又避免破坏信任和安全扭曲的视觉系统提供了重要指导

Abstract: By comparing biological and artificial perception through the lens of
illusions, we highlight critical differences in how each system constructs
visual reality. Understanding these divergences can inform the development of
more robust, interpretable, and human-aligned artificial intelligence (AI)
vision systems. In particular, visual illusions expose how human perception is
based on contextual assumptions rather than raw sensory data. As artificial
vision systems increasingly perform human-like tasks, it is important to ask:
does AI experience illusions, too? Does it have unique illusions? This article
explores how AI responds to classic visual illusions that involve color, size,
shape, and motion. We find that some illusion-like effects can emerge in these
models, either through targeted training or as by-products of pattern
recognition. In contrast, we also identify illusions unique to AI, such as
pixel-level sensitivity and hallucinations, that lack human counterparts. By
systematically comparing human and AI responses to visual illusions, we uncover
alignment gaps and AI-specific perceptual vulnerabilities invisible to human
perception. These findings provide insights for future research on vision
systems that preserve human-beneficial perceptual biases while avoiding
distortions that undermine trust and safety.

Motivation: 现有VQA-NLE系统能够产生不一致的解释，并在没有真正理解背景情境的情况下得出结论，曝露了推理流程或解释生成机制的弱点。

Method: 利用现有对抗策略干扰问题，并提出一种新的策略通过最小程度改变图像来引发矛盾或虚假输出，同时引入利用外部知识的缓解方法。

Conclusion: 当前VQA-NLE系统存在迅速的安全性和可靠性问题，知识基础的防御方法有助于提升模型稳健性。

Abstract: Natural language explanations in visual question answering (VQA-NLE) aim to
make black-box models more transparent by elucidating their decision-making
processes. However, we find that existing VQA-NLE systems can produce
inconsistent explanations and reach conclusions without genuinely understanding
the underlying context, exposing weaknesses in either their inference pipeline
or explanation-generation mechanism. To highlight these vulnerabilities, we not
only leverage an existing adversarial strategy to perturb questions but also
propose a novel strategy that minimally alters images to induce contradictory
or spurious outputs. We further introduce a mitigation method that leverages
external knowledge to alleviate these inconsistencies, thereby bolstering model
robustness. Extensive evaluations on two standard benchmarks and two widely
used VQA-NLE models underscore the effectiveness of our attacks and the
potential of knowledge-based defenses, ultimately revealing pressing security
and reliability concerns in current VQA-NLE systems.

Abstract: Chest X-ray imaging is crucial for diagnosing pulmonary and cardiac diseases,
yet its interpretation demands extensive clinical experience and suffers from
inter-observer variability. While deep learning models offer high diagnostic
accuracy, their black-box nature hinders clinical adoption in high-stakes
medical settings. To address this, we propose X-Ray-CoT (Chest X-Ray
Chain-of-Thought), a novel framework leveraging Vision-Language Large Models
(LVLMs) for intelligent chest X-ray diagnosis and interpretable report
generation. X-Ray-CoT simulates human radiologists' "chain-of-thought" by first
extracting multi-modal features and visual concepts, then employing an
LLM-based component with a structured Chain-of-Thought prompting strategy to
reason and produce detailed natural language diagnostic reports. Evaluated on
the CORDA dataset, X-Ray-CoT achieves competitive quantitative performance,
with a Balanced Accuracy of 80.52% and F1 score of 78.65% for disease
diagnosis, slightly surpassing existing black-box models. Crucially, it
uniquely generates high-quality, explainable reports, as validated by
preliminary human evaluations. Our ablation studies confirm the integral role
of each proposed component, highlighting the necessity of multi-modal fusion
and CoT reasoning for robust and transparent medical AI. This work represents a

Motivation: 挑战传统多模态学习需要昂贵对齐预训练和将视觉特征投影到文本空间的两个基本假设，寻求更高效的多模态融合方法

Method: 提出Inverse-LLaVA方法，将文本嵌入映射到连续视觉表示空间，在transformer中间层进行融合，通过注意力机制的选择性加性组件实现动态集成

Result: 在9个多模态基准测试中显示性能权衡：推理和认知任务显著提升（MM-VET: +0.2%, VizWiz: +1.8%, ScienceQA: +0.2%, 认知推理: +27.2%），但感知任务下降（名人识别: -49.5%, OCR: -21.3%）

Conclusion: 首次实证证明对齐预训练对有效多模态学习并非必要，特别是复杂推理任务；建立新范式可行性，计算需求降低45%，挑战模态融合传统认知，开辟高效多模态架构新方向

Abstract: Traditional multimodal learning approaches require expensive alignment
pre-training to bridge vision and language modalities, typically projecting
visual features into discrete text token spaces. We challenge both fundamental
assumptions underlying this paradigm by proposing Inverse-LLaVA, a novel
approach that eliminates alignment pre-training entirely while inverting the
conventional mapping direction. Rather than projecting visual features to text
space, our method maps text embeddings into continuous visual representation
space and performs fusion within transformer intermediate layers. Through
selective additive components in attention mechanisms, we enable dynamic
integration of visual and textual representations without requiring massive
image-text alignment datasets. Comprehensive experiments across nine multimodal
benchmarks demonstrate nuanced performance trade-offs: Inverse-LLaVA achieves
notable improvements on reasoning-intensive and cognitive tasks (MM-VET: +0.2%,
VizWiz: +1.8%, ScienceQA: +0.2%, cognitive reasoning: +27.2%), while showing
expected decreases in perception tasks requiring memorized visual-text
associations (celebrity recognition: -49.5%, OCR: -21.3%). These results
provide the first empirical evidence that alignment pre-training is not
necessary for effective multimodal learning, particularly for complex reasoning
tasks. Our work establishes the feasibility of a new paradigm that reduces
computational requirements by 45%, challenges conventional wisdom about
modality fusion, and opens new research directions for efficient multimodal
architectures that preserve modality-specific characteristics. Our project

Abstract: Accurate assessment of neuromuscular reflexes, such as the H-reflex, plays a
critical role in sports science, rehabilitation, and clinical neurology.
Traditional analysis of H-reflex EMG waveforms is subject to variability and
interpretation bias among clinicians and researchers, limiting reliability and
standardization. To address these challenges, we propose a Fine-Tuned
Vision-Language Model (VLM) Consortium and a reasoning Large-Language Model
(LLM)-enabled Decision Support System for automated H-reflex waveform
interpretation and diagnosis. Our approach leverages multiple VLMs, each
fine-tuned on curated datasets of H-reflex EMG waveform images annotated with
clinical observations, recovery timelines, and athlete metadata. These models
are capable of extracting key electrophysiological features and predicting
neuromuscular states, including fatigue, injury, and recovery, directly from
EMG images and contextual metadata. Diagnostic outputs from the VLM consortium
are aggregated using a consensus-based method and refined by a specialized
reasoning LLM, which ensures robust, transparent, and explainable decision
support for clinicians and sports scientists. The end-to-end platform
orchestrates seamless communication between the VLM ensemble and the reasoning
LLM, integrating prompt engineering strategies and automated reasoning
workflows using LLM Agents. Experimental results demonstrate that this hybrid
system delivers highly accurate, consistent, and interpretable H-reflex
assessments, significantly advancing the automation and standardization of
neuromuscular diagnostics. To our knowledge, this work represents the first
integration of a fine-tuned VLM consortium with a reasoning LLM for image-based
H-reflex analysis, laying the foundation for next-generation AI-assisted

Abstract: Skin cancer classification is a crucial task in medical image analysis, where
precise differentiation between malignant and non-malignant lesions is
essential for early diagnosis and treatment. In this study, we explore
Sequential and Parallel Hybrid CNN-Transformer models with Convolutional
Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (CKAN). Our approach integrates transfer learning and

Conclusion: RAIS-DR是一个健壮且符合伦理要求的解决方案，有力减少健康保健差异，适合在临床环境中应用于DR筛查

Abstract: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of vision loss in working-age
individuals. Early detection of DR can reduce the risk of vision loss by up to
95%, but a shortage of retinologists and challenges in timely examination
complicate detection. Artificial Intelligence (AI) models using retinal fundus
photographs (RFPs) offer a promising solution. However, adoption in clinical
settings is hindered by low-quality data and biases that may lead AI systems to
learn unintended features. To address these challenges, we developed RAIS-DR, a
Responsible AI System for DR screening that incorporates ethical principles
across the AI lifecycle. RAIS-DR integrates efficient convolutional models for
preprocessing, quality assessment, and three specialized DR classification
models. We evaluated RAIS-DR against the FDA-approved EyeArt system on a local
dataset of 1,046 patients, unseen by both systems. RAIS-DR demonstrated
significant improvements, with F1 scores increasing by 5-12%, accuracy by
6-19%, and specificity by 10-20%. Additionally, fairness metrics such as
Disparate Impact and Equal Opportunity Difference indicated equitable
performance across demographic subgroups, underscoring RAIS-DR's potential to
reduce healthcare disparities. These results highlight RAIS-DR as a robust and

Conclusion: LangVision-LoRA-NAS框架为视觉语言模型提供了更灵活高效的微调方案，通过动态秩优化实现了性能与效率的更好平衡。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) integrate visual and text modalities to enable
multimodal understanding and generation. These models typically combine a
Vision Transformer (ViT) as an image encoder and a Large Language Model (LLM)
for text generation. LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) is an efficient fine-tuning
method to adapt pre-trained models to new tasks by introducing low-rank updates
to their weights. While LoRA has emerged as a powerful technique for
fine-tuning large models by introducing low-rank updates, current
implementations assume a fixed rank, potentially limiting flexibility and
efficiency across diverse tasks. This paper introduces
\textit{LangVision-LoRA-NAS}, a novel framework that integrates Neural
Architecture Search (NAS) with LoRA to optimize VLMs for variable-rank
adaptation. Our approach leverages NAS to dynamically search for the optimal
LoRA rank configuration tailored to specific multimodal tasks, balancing

Method: 使用Cross-View Transformers(CVT)模型，通过现实主义汽车模拟器进行城市驾驶训练。比较了不同摄像头布局咈两种损失函数（focal损失咈L1损失）的效果

Result: 在仅使用一个城市训练数据的情况下，配备四个摄像头并使用L1损失训练的CVT模型在新城市中表现最为稳健，能够生成相对准确的BEV地图

Conclusion: 跨视角变换器在将摄像头输入映射到鸟睿视图方面具有很大潜力，能够在未见环境中产生合理准确的道路、车道标记咈规划轨迹信息

Abstract: Bird's-Eye View (BEV) maps provide a structured, top-down abstraction that is
crucial for autonomous-driving perception. In this work, we employ Cross-View
Transformers (CVT) for learning to map camera images to three BEV's channels -
road, lane markings, and planned trajectory - using a realistic simulator for
urban driving. Our study examines generalization to unseen towns, the effect of
different camera layouts, and two loss formulations (focal and L1). Using
training data from only a town, a four-camera CVT trained with the L1 loss
delivers the most robust test performance, evaluated in a new town. Overall,
our results underscore CVT's promise for mapping camera inputs to reasonably
accurate BEV maps.

TL;DR: MuSACo是一个基于协同训练的多模态个性化表情识别方法，通过选择相关源主体并利用多模态互补信息进行主体特异性适应，在BioVid和StressID数据集上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多源域适应方法往往忽视多模态信息或将多个源混合为单一域，限制了主体多样性，无法显式捕获主体特异性特征。个性化表情识别需要适应主体间的高度变异性。

Method: 基于协同训练的多模态主体特异性选择和适应方法：选择与目标相关的源主体；使用主导模态生成伪标签进行类感知学习；结合类无关损失从置信度较低的目标样本中学习；对齐各模态的源特征，仅组合置信的目标特征。

Result: 在BioVid和StressID多模态表情识别数据集上的实验表明，MuSACo能够超越无监督域适应（混合）和最先进的多源域适应方法。

Conclusion: MuSACo通过有效利用多模态信息和多源域信息，成功解决了主体特异性表情识别中的挑战，特别适用于数字健康中的情感计算应用，如患者特异性压力和疼痛评估。

Abstract: Personalized expression recognition (ER) involves adapting a machine learning
model to subject-specific data for improved recognition of expressions with
considerable interpersonal variability. Subject-specific ER can benefit
significantly from multi-source domain adaptation (MSDA) methods, where each
domain corresponds to a specific subject, to improve model accuracy and
robustness. Despite promising results, state-of-the-art MSDA approaches often
overlook multimodal information or blend sources into a single domain, limiting
subject diversity and failing to explicitly capture unique subject-specific
characteristics. To address these limitations, we introduce MuSACo, a
multi-modal subject-specific selection and adaptation method for ER based on
co-training. It leverages complementary information across multiple modalities
and multiple source domains for subject-specific adaptation. This makes MuSACo
particularly relevant for affective computing applications in digital health,
such as patient-specific assessment for stress or pain, where subject-level
nuances are crucial. MuSACo selects source subjects relevant to the target and
generates pseudo-labels using the dominant modality for class-aware learning,
in conjunction with a class-agnostic loss to learn from less confident target
samples. Finally, source features from each modality are aligned, while only
confident target features are combined. Our experimental results on challenging
multimodal ER datasets: BioVid and StressID, show that MuSACo can outperform
UDA (blending) and state-of-the-art MSDA methods.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative models has intensified the challenge of
detecting and interpreting visual forgeries, necessitating robust frameworks
for image forgery detection while providing reasoning as well as localization.
While existing works approach this problem using supervised training for
specific manipulation or anomaly detection in the embedding space,
generalization across domains remains a challenge. We frame this problem of
forgery detection as a prompt-driven visual reasoning task, leveraging the
semantic alignment capabilities of large vision-language models. We propose a
framework, `REVEAL` (Reasoning and Evaluation of Visual Evidence through
Aligned Language), that incorporates generalized guidelines. We propose two
tangential approaches - (1) Holistic Scene-level Evaluation that relies on the
physics, semantics, perspective, and realism of the image as a whole and (2)
Region-wise anomaly detection that splits the image into multiple regions and
analyzes each of them. We conduct experiments over datasets from different
domains (Photoshop, DeepFake and AIGC editing). We compare the Vision Language
Models against competitive baselines and analyze the reasoning provided by
them.

Motivation: 现有深度学习方法依赖大规模数据集，但老照片着色缺乏真实标注且存在领域差距，需要小样本解决方案

Method: SFAC算法：1）特征分布对齐损失建立语义对应；2）特征级感知约束和像素级冻结-更新金字塔结构保持机制

Result: 实验证明该方法在老照片着色任务上有效，定性和定量指标均表现良好

Conclusion: SFAC算法成功解决了老照片着色的领域差距问题，仅需少量样本即可实现高质量着色

Abstract: Deep learning techniques have made significant advancements in
reference-based colorization by training on large-scale datasets. However,
directly applying these methods to the task of colorizing old photos is
challenging due to the lack of ground truth and the notorious domain gap
between natural gray images and old photos. To address this issue, we propose a
novel CNN-based algorithm called SFAC, i.e., Structure-preserving Feature
Alignment Colorizer. SFAC is trained on only two images for old photo
colorization, eliminating the reliance on big data and allowing direct
processing of the old photo itself to overcome the domain gap problem. Our
primary objective is to establish semantic correspondence between the two
images, ensuring that semantically related objects have similar colors. We
achieve this through a feature distribution alignment loss that remains robust
to different metric choices. However, utilizing robust semantic correspondence
to transfer color from the reference to the old photo can result in inevitable
structure distortions. To mitigate this, we introduce a structure-preserving
mechanism that incorporates a perceptual constraint at the feature level and a
frozen-updated pyramid at the pixel level. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of our method for old photo colorization, as confirmed by
qualitative and quantitative metrics.

Abstract: Human action understanding serves as a foundational pillar in the field of
intelligent motion perception. Skeletons serve as a modality- and
device-agnostic representation for human modeling, and skeleton-based action
understanding has potential applications in humanoid robot control and
interaction. \RED{However, existing works often lack the scalability and
generalization required to handle diverse action understanding tasks. There is
no skeleton foundation model that can be adapted to a wide range of action
understanding tasks}. This paper presents a Unified Skeleton-based Dense
Representation Learning (USDRL) framework, which serves as a foundational model
for skeleton-based human action understanding. USDRL consists of a
Transformer-based Dense Spatio-Temporal Encoder (DSTE), Multi-Grained Feature
Decorrelation (MG-FD), and Multi-Perspective Consistency Training (MPCT). The
DSTE module adopts two parallel streams to learn temporal dynamic and spatial
structure features. The MG-FD module collaboratively performs feature
decorrelation across temporal, spatial, and instance domains to reduce
dimensional redundancy and enhance information extraction. The MPCT module
employs both multi-view and multi-modal self-supervised consistency training.
The former enhances the learning of high-level semantics and mitigates the
impact of low-level discrepancies, while the latter effectively facilitates the
learning of informative multimodal features. We perform extensive experiments
on 25 benchmarks across across 9 skeleton-based action understanding tasks,
covering coarse prediction, dense prediction, and transferred prediction. Our
approach significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods. We
hope that this work would broaden the scope of research in skeleton-based
action understanding and encourage more attention to dense prediction tasks.

Conclusion: 潜在连续推理是推进多模态模型发展的有前景方向，提供了可扩展的类人反思推理框架

Abstract: Many reasoning techniques for large multimodal models adapt language model
approaches, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, which express reasoning
as word sequences. While effective for text, these methods are suboptimal for
multimodal contexts, struggling to align audio, visual, and textual information
dynamically. To explore an alternative paradigm, we propose the Multimodal
Chain of Continuous Thought (MCOUT), which enables reasoning directly in a
joint latent space rather than in natural language. In MCOUT, the reasoning
state is represented as a continuous hidden vector, iteratively refined and
aligned with visual and textual embeddings, inspired by human reflective
cognition. We develop two variants: MCOUT-Base, which reuses the language
model`s last hidden state as the continuous thought for iterative reasoning,
and MCOUT-Multi, which integrates multimodal latent attention to strengthen
cross-modal alignment between visual and textual features. Experiments on
benchmarks including MMMU, ScienceQA, and MMStar show that MCOUT consistently
improves multimodal reasoning, yielding up to 8.23% accuracy gains over strong
baselines and improving BLEU scores up to 8.27% across multiple-choice and
open-ended tasks. These findings highlight latent continuous reasoning as a
promising direction for advancing LMMs beyond language-bound CoT, offering a
scalable framework for human-like reflective multimodal inference. Code is

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving systems built on Vision Language Models (VLMs)
have shown significant promise, yet their reliance on autoregressive
architectures introduces some limitations for real-world applications. The
sequential, token-by-token generation process of these models results in high
inference latency and cannot perform bidirectional reasoning, making them
unsuitable for dynamic, safety-critical environments. To overcome these
challenges, we introduce ViLaD, a novel Large Vision Language Diffusion (LVLD)
framework for end-to-end autonomous driving that represents a paradigm shift.
ViLaD leverages a masked diffusion model that enables parallel generation of
entire driving decision sequences, significantly reducing computational
latency. Moreover, its architecture supports bidirectional reasoning, allowing
the model to consider both past and future simultaneously, and supports
progressive easy-first generation to iteratively improve decision quality. We
conduct comprehensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset, where ViLaD
outperforms state-of-the-art autoregressive VLM baselines in both planning
accuracy and inference speed, while achieving a near-zero failure rate.
Furthermore, we demonstrate the framework's practical viability through a
real-world deployment on an autonomous vehicle for an interactive parking task,
confirming its effectiveness and soundness for practical applications.

Conclusion: 该研究为UGC图像质量评估领域提供了一个重要的数据集和框架，通过细粒度的扭曲分析和思维链推理，显著提升了多模态大语言模型在图像质量评估中的可解释性和准确性。

Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have introduced a
paradigm shift for Image Quality Assessment (IQA) from unexplainable image
quality scoring to explainable IQA, demonstrating practical applications like
quality control and optimization guidance. However, current explainable IQA
methods not only inadequately use the same distortion criteria to evaluate both
User-Generated Content (UGC) and AI-Generated Content (AIGC) images, but also
lack detailed quality analysis for monitoring image quality and guiding image
restoration. In this study, we establish the first large-scale Visual
Distortion Assessment Instruction Tuning Dataset for UGC images, termed
ViDA-UGC, which comprises 11K images with fine-grained quality grounding,
detailed quality perception, and reasoning quality description data. This
dataset is constructed through a distortion-oriented pipeline, which involves
human subject annotation and a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) assessment framework.
This framework guides GPT-4o to generate quality descriptions by identifying
and analyzing UGC distortions, which helps capturing rich low-level visual
features that inherently correlate with distortion patterns. Moreover, we
carefully select 476 images with corresponding 6,149 question answer pairs from
ViDA-UGC and invite a professional team to ensure the accuracy and quality of
GPT-generated information. The selected and revised data further contribute to
the first UGC distortion assessment benchmark, termed ViDA-UGC-Bench.
Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the ViDA-UGC and CoT
framework for consistently enhancing various image quality analysis abilities
across multiple base MLLMs on ViDA-UGC-Bench and Q-Bench, even surpassing
GPT-4o.

Motivation: 实际应用中大规模标记点遮挡会严重影响光学动作抓取系统性能，而当前模型缺乏现实遮挡数据集和长距离依赖学习策略。

Method: 使用光线追踪技术模拟现实遮挡模式构建CMU-Occlu数据集，提出OpenMoCap模型通过标记点-关节链推理机制实现同时优化和深度约束建立。

Result: 在多种场景下OpenMoCap均显著超过对手方法，CMU-Occlu数据集为未来研究打开了新途径。

Conclusion: 该研究为遮挡环境下的动作抓取提供了有效解决方案，已集成到实际系统中应用，代码已开源。

Abstract: Optical motion capture is a foundational technology driving advancements in
cutting-edge fields such as virtual reality and film production. However,
system performance suffers severely under large-scale marker occlusions common
in real-world applications. An in-depth analysis identifies two primary
limitations of current models: (i) the lack of training datasets accurately
reflecting realistic marker occlusion patterns, and (ii) the absence of
training strategies designed to capture long-range dependencies among markers.
To tackle these challenges, we introduce the CMU-Occlu dataset, which
incorporates ray tracing techniques to realistically simulate practical marker
occlusion patterns. Furthermore, we propose OpenMoCap, a novel motion-solving
model designed specifically for robust motion capture in environments with
significant occlusions. Leveraging a marker-joint chain inference mechanism,
OpenMoCap enables simultaneous optimization and construction of deep
constraints between markers and joints. Extensive comparative experiments
demonstrate that OpenMoCap consistently outperforms competing methods across
diverse scenarios, while the CMU-Occlu dataset opens the door for future
studies in robust motion solving. The proposed OpenMoCap is integrated into the
MoSen MoCap system for practical deployment. The code is released at:

Conclusion: 通过综合多域数据集和结构化训练方法，可以显著提升视觉语言模型的理解能力和通用性，为广泛域视觉理解提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Despite their success, current training pipelines for reasoning VLMs focus on
a limited range of tasks, such as mathematical and logical reasoning. As a
result, these models face difficulties in generalizing their reasoning
capabilities to a wide range of domains, primarily due to the scarcity of
readily available and verifiable reward data beyond these narrowly defined
areas. Moreover, integrating data from multiple domains is challenging, as the
compatibility between domain-specific datasets remains uncertain. To address
these limitations, we build a comprehensive RL-ready visual reasoning dataset
from 46 data sources across 8 dimensions, covering a wide range of tasks such
as infographic, mathematical, spatial, cross-image, graphic user interface,
medical, common sense and general science. We propose an influence function
based data selection and difficulty based filtering strategy to identify
high-quality training samples from this dataset. Subsequently, we train the
VLM, referred to as Vision-G1, using multi-round RL with a data curriculum to
iteratively improve its visual reasoning capabilities. Our model achieves
state-of-the-art performance across various visual reasoning benchmarks,
outperforming similar-sized VLMs and even proprietary models like GPT-4o and
Gemini-1.5 Flash. The model, code and dataset are publicly available at

TL;DR: WIPES是一种基于小波的通用视觉基元表示方法，通过小波的空间-频率局部化优势有效捕捉低频和高频信息，并开发了基于小波的可微分光栅化器实现快速视觉渲染。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉表示方法依赖频率引导或复杂神经网络解码，导致频谱损失或渲染速度慢，需要一种能同时提供灵活频率调制和快速渲染速度的连续视觉表示。

Method: 基于小波的空间-频率局部化优势构建WIPES表示，开发小波基可微分光栅化器实现快速渲染。

Result: 在2D图像表示、5D静态和6D动态新视角合成等视觉任务中，WIPES相比基于INR的方法具有更高渲染质量和更快推理速度，在渲染质量上优于基于高斯的方法。

Conclusion: WIPES作为一种视觉基元，能够有效平衡频率调制灵活性和渲染速度，在多种视觉任务中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Pursuing a continuous visual representation that offers flexible frequency
modulation and fast rendering speed has recently garnered increasing attention
in the fields of 3D vision and graphics. However, existing representations
often rely on frequency guidance or complex neural network decoding, leading to
spectrum loss or slow rendering. To address these limitations, we propose
WIPES, a universal Wavelet-based vIsual PrimitivES for representing
multi-dimensional visual signals. Building on the spatial-frequency
localization advantages of wavelets, WIPES effectively captures both the
low-frequency "forest" and the high-frequency "trees." Additionally, we develop
a wavelet-based differentiable rasterizer to achieve fast visual rendering.
Experimental results on various visual tasks, including 2D image
representation, 5D static and 6D dynamic novel view synthesis, demonstrate that
WIPES, as a visual primitive, offers higher rendering quality and faster
inference than INR-based methods, and outperforms Gaussian-based
representations in rendering quality.

Motivation: 电子商务平台中创意图片的质量评估问题，现有方法主要关注排名而缺乏可解释性，并不能满足广告主对创意选择的需求。

Method: 构建CreativePair数据集（8k带注释图片对），提出Creative4U模型，采用Reason-to-Select RFT技术（包括CoT-SFT监督精调和GRPO强化学习），将创意评估转换为自然语言生成任务。

Result: 离线和在线实验都证明了该方法的有效性，能够准确评估和选择创意图片。

Conclusion: 该研究为创意图片评估提供了可解释的选择方案，通过MLLMs技术和理性选择学习，有助于提升广告效果和平台收益。

Abstract: Creative image in advertising is the heart and soul of e-commerce platform.
An eye-catching creative image can enhance the shopping experience for users,
boosting income for advertisers and advertising revenue for platforms. With the
advent of AIGC technology, advertisers can produce large quantities of creative
images at minimal cost. However, they struggle to assess the creative quality
to select. Existing methods primarily focus on creative ranking, which fails to
address the need for explainable creative selection.
  In this work, we propose the first paradigm for explainable creative
assessment and selection. Powered by multimodal large language models (MLLMs),
our approach integrates the assessment and selection of creative images into a
natural language generation task. To facilitate this research, we construct
CreativePair, the first comparative reasoning-induced creative dataset
featuring 8k annotated image pairs, with each sample including a label
indicating which image is superior. Additionally, we introduce Creative4U
(pronounced Creative for You), a MLLMs-based creative selector that takes into
account users' interests. Through Reason-to-Select RFT, which includes
supervised fine-tuning with Chain-of-Thought (CoT-SFT) and Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO) based reinforcement learning, Creative4U is able to
evaluate and select creative images accurately. Both offline and online
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Our code and dataset
will be made public to advance research and industrial applications.

Method: 设计了SpotVLM框架，包含上下文替换和视觉聚焦模块，用于精炼历史文本输入和提升视觉基准一致性

Result: 在四个数据集的三个实时视觉任务中验证了框架的有效性

Conclusion: 该新范式为未来VLM系统更有效的延迟感知协同策略奠定了基础

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-time
applications such as autonomous driving and human-computer interaction, which
demand fast and reliable responses based on accurate perception. To meet these
requirements, existing systems commonly employ cloud-edge collaborative
architectures, such as partitioned Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) or task
offloading strategies between Large and Small Vision-Language Models (SVLMs).
However, these methods fail to accommodate cloud latency fluctuations and
overlook the full potential of delayed but accurate LVLM responses. In this
work, we propose a novel cloud-edge collaborative paradigm for VLMs, termed
Context Transfer, which treats the delayed outputs of LVLMs as historical
context to provide real-time guidance for SVLMs inference. Based on this
paradigm, we design SpotVLM, which incorporates both context replacement and
visual focus modules to refine historical textual input and enhance visual
grounding consistency. Extensive experiments on three real-time vision tasks
across four datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.
The new paradigm lays the groundwork for more effective and latency-aware
collaboration strategies in future VLM systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对比剂增强MRI存在成本高、扫描时间长、环境风险和病人风险等问题，需要一种无针前注射的替代方案

Method: 两阶段流动模型：首先用patch-based 3D U-Net预测后骏均值，然后用时间条件化3D rectified flow进行精炼，在保持结构保真的同时增加真实细节

Result: 在360份测试数据上，精炼后输出达到轴向FID 12.46、KID 0.007（比后骏均值降低68.7%），体积MSE 0.057（仅高出27%），能实际恢复病变边缘和血管细节

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了觉知-形变損耗的交换问题，为临床部署提供了可行的无针前对比增强MRI生成方案

Abstract: Contrast-enhanced (CE) T1-weighted MRI is central to neuro-oncologic
diagnosis but requires gadolinium-based agents, which add cost and scan time,
raise environmental concerns, and may pose risks to patients. In this work, we
propose a two-stage Posterior-Mean Rectified Flow (PMRF) pipeline for
synthesizing volumetric CE brain MRI from non-contrast inputs. First, a
patch-based 3D U-Net predicts the voxel-wise posterior mean (minimizing MSE).
Then, this initial estimate is refined by a time-conditioned 3D rectified flow
to incorporate realistic textures without compromising structural fidelity. We
train this model on a multi-institutional collection of paired pre- and
post-contrast T1w volumes (BraTS 2023-2025). On a held-out test set of 360
diverse volumes, our best refined outputs achieve an axial FID of $12.46$ and
KID of $0.007$ ($\sim 68.7\%$ lower FID than the posterior mean) while
maintaining low volumetric MSE of $0.057$ ($\sim 27\%$ higher than the
posterior mean). Qualitative comparisons confirm that our method restores
lesion margins and vascular details realistically, effectively navigating the
perception-distortion trade-off for clinical deployment.

Motivation: 多模态模型在空间理解和推理方面仍存在明显局限，随着GPT-5的发布，需要评估当前最先进模型在空间智能路径上的位置

Method: 提出统一的空间任务分类法，在8个关键基准上评估最先进的专有和开源模型，总成本超过10亿token，并进行定性评估

Result: GPT-5展现出前所未有的空间智能强度，但在广泛任务上仍落后于人类表现；识别出多模态模型更具挑战性的空间智能问题；专有模型在最困难问题上没有决定性优势

Conclusion: 多模态模型在空间智能方面虽有进步但仍需重大突破，特别是在人类直觉性但模型易失败的多样化场景中

Abstract: Multi-modal models have achieved remarkable progress in recent years.
Nevertheless, they continue to exhibit notable limitations in spatial
understanding and reasoning, which are fundamental capabilities to achieving
artificial general intelligence. With the recent release of GPT-5, allegedly
the most powerful AI model to date, it is timely to examine where the leading
models stand on the path toward spatial intelligence. First, we propose a
comprehensive taxonomy of spatial tasks that unifies existing benchmarks and
discuss the challenges in ensuring fair evaluation. We then evaluate
state-of-the-art proprietary and open-source models on eight key benchmarks, at
a cost exceeding one billion total tokens. Our empirical study reveals that (1)
GPT-5 demonstrates unprecedented strength in spatial intelligence, yet (2)
still falls short of human performance across a broad spectrum of tasks.
Moreover, we (3) identify the more challenging spatial intelligence problems
for multi-modal models, and (4) proprietary models do not exhibit a decisive
advantage when facing the most difficult problems. In addition, we conduct a
qualitative evaluation across a diverse set of scenarios that are intuitive for
humans yet fail even the most advanced multi-modal models.

Method: 采用mean teacher框架，提出多级一致性正则化(MCR)对齐师生模型中间特征加速适应，以及互补锚点重放(CAR)机制重用历史检查点恢复多样化领域知识。

Result: 在多个基准测试中显著优于最先进方法，证明了该方法在CTTA任务中的有效性。

Conclusion: BEE框架成功解决了CTTA中探索与利用的平衡问题，通过特征级对齐和知识重放机制实现了快速适应和知识保留。

Abstract: Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) aims to adapt a source pre-trained
model to continually changing target domains during inference. As a fundamental
principle, an ideal CTTA method should rapidly adapt to new domains
(exploration) while retaining and exploiting knowledge from previously
encountered domains to handle similar domains in the future. Despite
significant advances, balancing exploration and exploitation in CTTA is still
challenging: 1) Existing methods focus on adjusting predictions based on
deep-layer outputs of neural networks. However, domain shifts typically affect
shallow features, which are inefficient to be adjusted from deep predictions,
leading to dilatory exploration; 2) A single model inevitably forgets knowledge
of previous domains during the exploration, making it incapable of exploiting
historical knowledge to handle similar future domains. To address these
challenges, this paper proposes a mean teacher framework that strikes an
appropriate Balance between Exploration and Exploitation (BEE) during the CTTA
process. For the former challenge, we introduce a Multi-level Consistency
Regularization (MCR) loss that aligns the intermediate features of the student
and teacher models, accelerating adaptation to the current domain. For the
latter challenge, we employ a Complementary Anchor Replay (CAR) mechanism to
reuse historical checkpoints (anchors), recovering complementary knowledge for
diverse domains. Experiments show that our method significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods on several benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness
for CTTA tasks.

Conclusion: DyCrowd框架能够有效处理大场景视频中的动态人群重建，解决了遮挡和时序不一致问题，为城市监控和人群分析提供了有力工具。

Abstract: 3D reconstruction of dynamic crowds in large scenes has become increasingly
important for applications such as city surveillance and crowd analysis.
However, current works attempt to reconstruct 3D crowds from a static image,
causing a lack of temporal consistency and inability to alleviate the typical
impact caused by occlusions. In this paper, we propose DyCrowd, the first
framework for spatio-temporally consistent 3D reconstruction of hundreds of
individuals' poses, positions and shapes from a large-scene video. We design a
coarse-to-fine group-guided motion optimization strategy for occlusion-robust
crowd reconstruction in large scenes. To address temporal instability and
severe occlusions, we further incorporate a VAE (Variational Autoencoder)-based
human motion prior along with a segment-level group-guided optimization. The
core of our strategy leverages collective crowd behavior to address long-term
dynamic occlusions. By jointly optimizing the motion sequences of individuals
with similar motion segments and combining this with the proposed Asynchronous
Motion Consistency (AMC) loss, we enable high-quality unoccluded motion
segments to guide the motion recovery of occluded ones, ensuring robust and
plausible motion recovery even in the presence of temporal desynchronization
and rhythmic inconsistencies. Additionally, in order to fill the gap of no
existing well-annotated large-scene video dataset, we contribute a virtual
benchmark dataset, VirtualCrowd, for evaluating dynamic crowd reconstruction
from large-scene videos. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
method achieves state-of-the-art performance in the large-scene dynamic crowd
reconstruction task. The code and dataset will be available for research
purposes.

Motivation: 人类能够利用先验知识推断遮蔓区域，但深度学习模型在准确预测遮蔓区域方面仍面临挑战。特别是人体去遮蔓问题，需要恢复遮蔓的身体结构和外观。

Method: 方法分为两个阶段：掩码完成和RGB完成。第一阶段利用演化基础的人体先验提供身体结构表征，结合遮蔓关节热力图提供空间线索。第二阶段使用重建的无模态掩码作为条件输入，并结合CLIP编码器生成的人体特定文本特征，使用Stable Diffusion进行RGB完成。

Result: 方法能够在严重遮蔓情况下有效重建人体外观，在掩码和RGB完成上均超过现有方法。去遮蔓后的图像还能提升2D姿势估计和3D人体重建等下游任务的性能。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种有效的人体去遮蔓方法，通过分解任务和结合多种线索，能够在严重遮蔓情况下恢复人体外观，并提升下游任务的性能。

Abstract: Humans can infer the missing parts of an occluded object by leveraging prior
knowledge and visible cues. However, enabling deep learning models to
accurately predict such occluded regions remains a challenging task.
De-occlusion addresses this problem by reconstructing both the mask and RGB
appearance. In this work, we focus on human de-occlusion, specifically
targeting the recovery of occluded body structures and appearances. Our
approach decomposes the task into two stages: mask completion and RGB
completion. The first stage leverages a diffusion-based human body prior to
provide a comprehensive representation of body structure, combined with
occluded joint heatmaps that offer explicit spatial cues about missing regions.
The reconstructed amodal mask then serves as a conditioning input for the
second stage, guiding the model on which areas require RGB reconstruction. To
further enhance RGB generation, we incorporate human-specific textual features
derived using a visual question answering (VQA) model and encoded via a CLIP
encoder. RGB completion is performed using Stable Diffusion, with decoder
fine-tuning applied to mitigate pixel-level degradation in visible regions -- a
known limitation of prior diffusion-based de-occlusion methods caused by latent
space transformations. Our method effectively reconstructs human appearances
even under severe occlusions and consistently outperforms existing methods in
both mask and RGB completion. Moreover, the de-occluded images generated by our
approach can improve the performance of downstream human-centric tasks, such as
2D pose estimation and 3D human reconstruction. The code will be made publicly
available.

Motivation: Wölfflin的五原则为形式分析提供了结构化方法，但目前缺乏能够有效预测所有五个原则的视觉艺术度量标准。视觉语言模型在评估抽象图像属性方面显示出潜力，因此研究其在此任务中的应用价值。

Method: 对在大规模数据上预训练的CLIP进行微调，使用真实艺术图像的标注数据集来预测每个原则的得分，开发了WP-CLIP模型。

Result: WP-CLIP在GAN生成的绘画和Pandora-18K艺术数据集上表现出良好的泛化能力，能够准确预测Wölfflin的五原则。

Conclusion: 视觉语言模型在自动化艺术分析方面具有巨大潜力，微调后的CLIP模型能够有效理解和预测复杂的艺术风格元素。

Abstract: W\"olfflin's five principles offer a structured approach to analyzing
stylistic variations for formal analysis. However, no existing metric
effectively predicts all five principles in visual art. Computationally
evaluating the visual aspects of a painting requires a metric that can
interpret key elements such as color, composition, and thematic choices. Recent
advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated their ability
to evaluate abstract image attributes, making them promising candidates for
this task. In this work, we investigate whether CLIP, pre-trained on
large-scale data, can understand and predict W\"olfflin's principles. Our
findings indicate that it does not inherently capture such nuanced stylistic
elements. To address this, we fine-tune CLIP on annotated datasets of real art
images to predict a score for each principle. We evaluate our model, WP-CLIP,
on GAN-generated paintings and the Pandora-18K art dataset, demonstrating its
ability to generalize across diverse artistic styles. Our results highlight the
potential of VLMs for automated art analysis.

Abstract: Multi-UAV collaborative 3D detection enables accurate and robust perception
by fusing multi-view observations from aerial platforms, offering significant
advantages in coverage and occlusion handling, while posing new challenges for
computation on resource-constrained UAV platforms. In this paper, we present
AdaBEV, a novel framework that learns adaptive instance-aware BEV
representations through a refine-and-contrast paradigm. Unlike existing methods
that treat all BEV grids equally, AdaBEV introduces a Box-Guided Refinement
Module (BG-RM) and an Instance-Background Contrastive Learning (IBCL) to
enhance semantic awareness and feature discriminability. BG-RM refines only BEV
grids associated with foreground instances using 2D supervision and spatial
subdivision, while IBCL promotes stronger separation between foreground and
background features via contrastive learning in BEV space. Extensive
experiments on the Air-Co-Pred dataset demonstrate that AdaBEV achieves
superior accuracy-computation trade-offs across model scales, outperforming
other state-of-the-art methods at low resolutions and approaching upper bound
performance while maintaining low-resolution BEV inputs and negligible
overhead.

Conclusion: TTA-DAME方法能够有效处理测试时适应中的动态域偏移问题，特别是在驾驶场景的天气和昼夜变化条件下表现出色。

Abstract: Test-time Adaptation (TTA) poses a challenge, requiring models to dynamically
adapt and perform optimally on shifting target domains. This task is
particularly emphasized in real-world driving scenes, where weather domain
shifts occur frequently. To address such dynamic changes, our proposed method,
TTA-DAME, leverages source domain data augmentation into target domains.
Additionally, we introduce a domain discriminator and a specialized domain
detector to mitigate drastic domain shifts, especially from daytime to
nighttime conditions. To further improve adaptability, we train multiple
detectors and consolidate their predictions through Non-Maximum Suppression
(NMS). Our empirical validation demonstrates the effectiveness of our method,
showing significant performance enhancements on the SHIFT Benchmark.

Abstract: Class-incremental with repetition (CIR), where previously trained classes
repeatedly introduced in future tasks, is a more realistic scenario than the
traditional class incremental setup, which assumes that each task contains
unseen classes. CIR assumes that we can easily access abundant unlabeled data
from external sources, such as the Internet. Therefore, we propose two
components that efficiently use the unlabeled data to ensure the high stability
and the plasticity of models trained in CIR setup. First, we introduce
multi-level knowledge distillation (MLKD) that distills knowledge from multiple
previous models across multiple perspectives, including features and logits, so
the model can maintain much various previous knowledge. Moreover, we implement
dynamic self-supervised loss (SSL) to utilize the unlabeled data that
accelerates the learning of new classes, while dynamic weighting of SSL keeps
the focus of training to the primary task. Both of our proposed components
significantly improve the performance in CIR setup, achieving 2nd place in the
CVPR 5th CLVISION Challenge.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles often have varying camera sensor setups, which is
inevitable due to restricted placement options for different vehicle types.
Training a perception model on one particular setup and evaluating it on a new,
different sensor setup reveals the so-called cross-sensor domain gap, typically
leading to a degradation in accuracy. In this paper, we investigate the impact
of the cross-sensor domain gap on state-of-the-art 3D object detectors. To this
end, we introduce CamShift, a dataset inspired by nuScenes and created in CARLA
to specifically simulate the domain gap between subcompact vehicles and sport
utility vehicles (SUVs). Using CamShift, we demonstrate significant
cross-sensor performance degradation, identify robustness dependencies on model
architecture, and propose a data-driven solution to mitigate the effect. On the
one hand, we show that model architectures based on a dense Bird's Eye View
(BEV) representation with backward projection, such as BEVFormer, are the most
robust against varying sensor configurations. On the other hand, we propose a
novel data-driven sensor adaptation pipeline based on neural rendering, which
can transform entire datasets to match different camera sensor setups. Applying
this approach improves performance across all investigated 3D object detectors,
mitigating the cross-sensor domain gap by a large margin and reducing the need
for new data collection by enabling efficient data reusability across vehicles
with different sensor setups. The CamShift dataset and the sensor adaptation
benchmark are available at https://dmholtz.github.io/camshift/.

Motivation: 生成式AI工具带来的新闻内容高度多样化对多模态虚假信息检测构成了新挑战，需要系统研究这种多样性对检测系统的影响。

Method: 构建了包含16,000个新闻实例的大规模基准测试DriftBench，涵盖六类多样化类别，设计了三个评估任务来系统分析多级漂移的影响。

Result: 实验显示六个最先进的LVLM检测器性能显著下降（平均F1分数下降14.8%），推理轨迹不稳定，在对抗性证据注入下表现更差。

Conclusion: 现有MMD系统存在根本性脆弱性，在GenAI时代迫切需要更具弹性的方法来解决多级漂移问题。

Abstract: The proliferation of multimodal misinformation poses growing threats to
public discourse and societal trust. While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs)
have enabled recent progress in multimodal misinformation detection (MMD), the
rise of generative AI (GenAI) tools introduces a new challenge: GenAI-driven
news diversity, characterized by highly varied and complex content. We show
that this diversity induces multi-level drift, comprising (1) model-level
misperception drift, where stylistic variations disrupt a model's internal
reasoning, and (2) evidence-level drift, where expression diversity degrades
the quality or relevance of retrieved external evidence. These drifts
significantly degrade the robustness of current LVLM-based MMD systems. To
systematically study this problem, we introduce DriftBench, a large-scale
benchmark comprising 16,000 news instances across six categories of
diversification. We design three evaluation tasks: (1) robustness of truth
verification under multi-level drift; (2) susceptibility to adversarial
evidence contamination generated by GenAI; and (3) analysis of reasoning
consistency across diverse inputs. Experiments with six state-of-the-art
LVLM-based detectors show substantial performance drops (average F1 -14.8%) and
increasingly unstable reasoning traces, with even more severe failures under
adversarial evidence injection. Our findings uncover fundamental
vulnerabilities in existing MMD systems and suggest an urgent need for more
resilient approaches in the GenAI era.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种深度类别特徚协同表征网络(DCSCR)，用于解决少样本图像集分类问题，能同时学习帧级和概念级特征表征，并通过协同表征定制调整特征来提高距离测量的准确性。

Abstract: Image set classification (ISC), which can be viewed as a task of comparing
similarities between sets consisting of unordered heterogeneous images with
variable quantities and qualities, has attracted growing research attention in
recent years. How to learn effective feature representations and how to explore
the similarities between different image sets are two key yet challenging
issues in this field. However, existing traditional ISC methods classify image
sets based on raw pixel features, ignoring the importance of feature learning.
Existing deep ISC methods can learn deep features, but they fail to adaptively
adjust the features when measuring set distances, resulting in limited
performance in few-shot ISC. To address the above issues, this paper combines
traditional ISC methods with deep models and proposes a novel few-shot ISC
approach called Deep Class-specific Collaborative Representation (DCSCR)
network to simultaneously learn the frame- and concept-level feature
representations of each image set and the distance similarities between
different sets. Specifically, DCSCR consists of a fully convolutional deep
feature extractor module, a global feature learning module, and a
class-specific collaborative representation-based metric learning module. The
deep feature extractor and global feature learning modules are used to learn
(local and global) frame-level feature representations, while the
class-specific collaborative representation-based metric learning module is
exploit to adaptively learn the concept-level feature representation of each
image set and thus obtain the distance similarities between different sets by
developing a new CSCR-based contrastive loss function. Extensive experiments on
several well-known few-shot ISC datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed method compared with some state-of-the-art image set classification
algorithms.

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了文本到图像生成模型在真实图像编辑中的应用挑战，通过双对比学习和潜在潜散模型的空间信息利用，实现了高质量的图像编辑效果

Abstract: Large-scale text-to-image generative models have shown remarkable ability to
synthesize diverse and high-quality images. However, it is still challenging to
directly apply these models for editing real images for two reasons. First, it
is difficult for users to come up with a perfect text prompt that accurately
describes every visual detail in the input image. Second, while existing models
can introduce desirable changes in certain regions, they often dramatically
alter the input content and introduce unexpected changes in unwanted regions.
To address these challenges, we present Dual Contrastive Denoising Score, a
simple yet powerful framework that leverages the rich generative prior of
text-to-image diffusion models. Inspired by contrastive learning approaches for
unpaired image-to-image translation, we introduce a straightforward dual
contrastive loss within the proposed framework. Our approach utilizes the
extensive spatial information from the intermediate representations of the
self-attention layers in latent diffusion models without depending on auxiliary
networks. Our method achieves both flexible content modification and structure
preservation between input and output images, as well as zero-shot
image-to-image translation. Through extensive experiments, we show that our
approach outperforms existing methods in real image editing while maintaining
the capability to directly utilize pretrained text-to-image diffusion models
without further training.

Abstract: Computer vision models can be used to assist during mechanical thrombectomy
(MT) for acute ischemic stroke (AIS), but poor image quality often degrades
performance. This work presents CLAIRE-DSA, a deep learning--based framework
designed to categorize key image properties in minimum intensity projections
(MinIPs) acquired during MT for AIS, supporting downstream quality control and
workflow optimization. CLAIRE-DSA uses pre-trained ResNet backbone models,
fine-tuned to predict nine image properties (e.g., presence of contrast,
projection angle, motion artefact severity). Separate classifiers were trained
on an annotated dataset containing $1,758$ fluoroscopic MinIPs. The model
achieved excellent performance on all labels, with ROC-AUC ranging from $0.91$
to $0.98$, and precision ranging from $0.70$ to $1.00$. The ability of
CLAIRE-DSA to identify suitable images was evaluated on a segmentation task by
filtering poor quality images and comparing segmentation performance on
filtered and unfiltered datasets. Segmentation success rate increased from
$42%$ to $69%$, $p < 0.001$. CLAIRE-DSA demonstrates strong potential as an
automated tool for accurately classifying image properties in DSA series of
acute ischemic stroke patients, supporting image annotation and quality control

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated impressive performance in novel
view synthesis under dense-view settings. However, in sparse-view scenarios,
despite the realistic renderings in training views, 3DGS occasionally manifests
appearance artifacts in novel views. This paper investigates the appearance
artifacts in sparse-view 3DGS and uncovers a core limitation of current
approaches: the optimized Gaussians are overly-entangled with one another to
aggressively fit the training views, which leads to a neglect of the real
appearance distribution of the underlying scene and results in appearance
artifacts in novel views. The analysis is based on a proposed metric, termed
Co-Adaptation Score (CA), which quantifies the entanglement among Gaussians,
i.e., co-adaptation, by computing the pixel-wise variance across multiple
renderings of the same viewpoint, with different random subsets of Gaussians.
The analysis reveals that the degree of co-adaptation is naturally alleviated
as the number of training views increases. Based on the analysis, we propose
two lightweight strategies to explicitly mitigate the co-adaptation in
sparse-view 3DGS: (1) random gaussian dropout; (2) multiplicative noise
injection to the opacity. Both strategies are designed to be plug-and-play, and
their effectiveness is validated across various methods and benchmarks. We hope
that our insights into the co-adaptation effect will inspire the community to
achieve a more comprehensive understanding of sparse-view 3DGS.

Motivation: CdZnTe半导体图像标注困难，缺陷边界对比度低，需要多视图交叉参考。现有半监督语义分割方法基于"一对一"关系，在多视图"多对一"场景下会导致错误累积和确认偏差

Method: 提出ICAF框架：1) 实验验证CdZnTe组内一致性约束，建立组内视图采样基线；2) 伪标签校正网络(PCN)，包含视图增强模块(VAM)动态合成边界感知视图，视图校正模块(VCM)进行信息交互强调显著区域

Conclusion: ICAF框架有效解决了CdZnTe材料多视图标注的挑战，通过组内一致性增强方法显著提升了低对比度区域的标注准确性，为类似多视图标注问题提供了新思路

Abstract: Labeling Cadmium Zinc Telluride (CdZnTe) semiconductor images is challenging
due to the low-contrast defect boundaries, necessitating annotators to
cross-reference multiple views. These views share a single ground truth (GT),
forming a unique ``many-to-one'' relationship. This characteristic renders
advanced semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SSS) methods suboptimal, as
they are generally limited by a ``one-to-one'' relationship, where each image
is independently associated with its GT. Such limitation may lead to error
accumulation in low-contrast regions, further exacerbating confirmation bias.
To address this issue, we revisit the SSS pipeline from a group-oriented
perspective and propose a human-inspired solution: the Intra-group Consistency
Augmentation Framework (ICAF). First, we experimentally validate the inherent
consistency constraints within CdZnTe groups, establishing a group-oriented
baseline using the Intra-group View Sampling (IVS). Building on this insight,
we introduce the Pseudo-label Correction Network (PCN) to enhance consistency
representation, which consists of two key modules. The View Augmentation Module
(VAM) improves boundary details by dynamically synthesizing a boundary-aware
view through the aggregation of multiple views. In the View Correction Module
(VCM), this synthesized view is paired with other views for information
interaction, effectively emphasizing salient regions while minimizing noise.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our solution for CdZnTe
materials. Leveraging DeepLabV3+ with a ResNet-101 backbone as our segmentation
model, we achieve a 70.6\% mIoU on the CdZnTe dataset using only 2
group-annotated data (5\textperthousand). The code is available at

Abstract: Single image defocus deblurring aims to recover an all-in-focus image from a
defocus counterpart, where accurately modeling spatially varying blur kernels
remains a key challenge. Most existing methods rely on spatial features for
kernel estimation, but their performance degrades in severely blurry regions
where local high-frequency details are missing. To address this, we propose a
Frequency-Driven Inverse Kernel Prediction network (FDIKP) that incorporates
frequency-domain representations to enhance structural identifiability in
kernel modeling. Given the superior discriminative capability of the frequency
domain for blur modeling, we design a Dual-Branch Inverse Kernel Prediction
(DIKP) strategy that improves the accuracy of kernel estimation while
maintaining stability. Moreover, considering the limited number of predicted
inverse kernels, we introduce a Position Adaptive Convolution (PAC) to enhance
the adaptability of the deconvolution process. Finally, we propose a
Dual-Domain Scale Recurrent Module (DSRM) to fuse deconvolution results and
progressively improve deblurring quality from coarse to fine. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches. Code
will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Transportation influence health by shaping exposure to physical activity, air
pollution and injury risk.Comparative data on cycling and motorcycling
behaviours is scarce, particularly at a global scale.Street view imagery, such
as Google Street View (GSV), combined with computer vision, is a valuable
resource for efficiently capturing travel behaviour data.This study
demonstrates a novel approach using deep learning on street view images to
estimate cycling and motorcycling levels across diverse cities worldwide.We
utilized data from 185 global cities.The data on mode shares of cycling and
motorcycling estimated using travel surveys or censuses.We used GSV images to
detect cycles and motorcycles in sampled locations, using 8000 images per
city.The YOLOv4 model, fine-tuned using images from six cities, achieved a mean
average precision of 89% for detecting cycles and motorcycles in GSV images.A
global prediction model was developed using beta regression with city-level
mode shares as outcome, with log transformed explanatory variables of counts of
GSV-detected images with cycles and motorcycles, while controlling for
population density.We found strong correlations between GSV motorcycle counts
and motorcycle mode share (0.78) and moderate correlations between GSV cycle
counts and cycling mode share (0.51).Beta regression models predicted mode
shares with $R^2$ values of 0.614 for cycling and 0.612 for motorcycling,
achieving median absolute errors (MDAE) of 1.3% and 1.4%,
respectively.Scatterplots demonstrated consistent prediction accuracy, though
cities like Utrecht and Cali were outliers.The model was applied to 60 cities
globally for which we didn't have recent mode share data.We provided estimates
for some cities in the Middle East, Latin America and East Asia.With computer
vision, GSV images capture travel modes and activity, providing insights
alongside traditional data sources.

Conclusion: 该方法通过选择性传播上下文信息和适应性建模区域特异转换，有效解决了阴影移除中的挑战

Abstract: Shadow removal aims to restore images that are partially degraded by shadows,
where the degradation is spatially localized and non-uniform. Unlike general
restoration tasks that assume global degradation, shadow removal can leverage
abundant information from non-shadow regions for guidance. However, the
transformation required to correct shadowed areas often differs significantly
from that of well-lit regions, making it challenging to apply uniform
correction strategies. This necessitates the effective integration of non-local
contextual cues and adaptive modeling of region-specific transformations. To
this end, we propose a novel Mamba-based network featuring dual-scale fusion
and dual-path scanning to selectively propagate contextual information based on
transformation similarity across regions. Specifically, the proposed Dual-Scale
Fusion Mamba Block (DFMB) enhances multi-scale feature representation by fusing
original features with low-resolution features, effectively reducing boundary
artifacts. The Dual-Path Mamba Group (DPMG) captures global features via
horizontal scanning and incorporates a mask-aware adaptive scanning strategy,

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NVG是一种新的图像生成框架，通过将图像分解为结构化序列，从全局布局到细节逐步细化生成，在ImageNet上实现了优于VAR系列的FID分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图像生成方法缺乏对生成过程的多粒度控制，需要一种能够分层级、结构化生成图像的新方法。

Method: 提出Next Visual Granularity (NVG)生成框架，将图像分解为共享空间分辨率但具有不同视觉粒度的结构化序列，从空图像开始逐步细化生成。

Result: 在ImageNet数据集上的类条件图像生成任务中，NVG模型相比VAR系列在FID分数上有显著提升(3.30->3.03, 2.57->2.44, 2.09->2.06)，展现出良好的扩展性。

Conclusion: NVG框架通过分层级的视觉粒度序列生成，实现了对图像生成过程的细粒度控制，在性能上超越了现有方法，具有广阔的应用潜力。

Abstract: We propose a novel approach to image generation by decomposing an image into
a structured sequence, where each element in the sequence shares the same
spatial resolution but differs in the number of unique tokens used, capturing
different level of visual granularity. Image generation is carried out through
our newly introduced Next Visual Granularity (NVG) generation framework, which
generates a visual granularity sequence beginning from an empty image and
progressively refines it, from global layout to fine details, in a structured
manner. This iterative process encodes a hierarchical, layered representation
that offers fine-grained control over the generation process across multiple
granularity levels. We train a series of NVG models for class-conditional image
generation on the ImageNet dataset and observe clear scaling behavior. Compared
to the VAR series, NVG consistently outperforms it in terms of FID scores (3.30
-> 3.03, 2.57 ->2.44, 2.09 -> 2.06). We also conduct extensive analysis to
showcase the capability and potential of the NVG framework. Our code and models
will be released.

TL;DR: SocialTrack是一个针对无人机视角下多目标跟踪的创新框架，通过多尺度特征增强、速度自适应滤波、群体运动补偿和时空记忆预测等技术，显著提升了复杂城市交通环境中小目标的跟踪精度和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无人机视角下的多目标跟踪面临小目标尺度变化、遮挡、非线性交叉运动和运动模糊等挑战，这些因素严重影响了跟踪稳定性，需要新的解决方案来提升复杂城市交通环境中的跟踪性能。

Method: 提出SocialTrack框架，包含：1）多尺度特征增强机制的专业小目标检测器；2）速度自适应容积卡尔曼滤波(VACKF)用于轨迹预测；3）群体运动补偿策略(GMCS)建模社会群体运动先验；4）时空记忆预测(STMP)利用历史轨迹信息预测未来状态。

Result: 在UAVDT和MOT17数据集上的大量实验表明，SocialTrack在多个关键指标上优于现有最先进方法，特别是在MOTA和IDF1等核心性能指标上有显著提升，展现了优异的鲁棒性和适应性。

Conclusion: SocialTrack不仅性能优越，而且具有高度模块化和兼容性，可以与现有跟踪器无缝集成以进一步提升性能，为解决复杂无人机视角下的多目标跟踪问题提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: As a key research direction in the field of multi-object tracking (MOT),
UAV-based multi-object tracking has significant application value in the
analysis and understanding of urban intelligent transportation systems.
However, in complex UAV perspectives, challenges such as small target scale
variations, occlusions, nonlinear crossing motions, and motion blur severely
hinder the stability of multi-object tracking. To address these challenges,
this paper proposes a novel multi-object tracking framework, SocialTrack, aimed
at enhancing the tracking accuracy and robustness of small targets in complex
urban traffic environments. The specialized small-target detector enhances the
detection performance by employing a multi-scale feature enhancement mechanism.
The Velocity Adaptive Cubature Kalman Filter (VACKF) improves the accuracy of
trajectory prediction by incorporating a velocity dynamic modeling mechanism.
The Group Motion Compensation Strategy (GMCS) models social group motion priors
to provide stable state update references for low-quality tracks, significantly
improving the target association accuracy in complex dynamic environments.
Furthermore, the Spatio-Temporal Memory Prediction (STMP) leverages historical
trajectory information to predict the future state of low-quality tracks,
effectively mitigating identity switching issues. Extensive experiments on the
UAVDT and MOT17 datasets demonstrate that SocialTrack outperforms existing
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods across several key metrics. Significant
improvements in MOTA and IDF1, among other core performance indicators,
highlight its superior robustness and adaptability. Additionally, SocialTrack
is highly modular and compatible, allowing for seamless integration with
existing trackers to further enhance performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过多样式图像结合和统计对齐技术，提出了一种能够更准确匹配风格、避免内容漏泄的图像风格转换方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有潜在扩散模型在图像风格转换中遇到的三个主要问题：风格匹配不准确、可使用风格图像数量受限、内容与风格不应期的纷繁

Method: 利用多个风格图像来更好地表征风格特征，设计了结合图像提示适配器和去噪过程中特征统计对齐的方法，在去噪UNet的交叉注意力层和自注意力层都进行干预，通过聚类技术从大量风格样本的注意力特征中精炼出小而代表性的注意力特征集

Result: 该方法在风格化任务上达到了目前最好的效果

Conclusion: 通过多样式图像结合和统计对齐技术，成功地解决了图像风格转换中的关键问题，实现了更准确的风格匹配和更好的内容-风格分离

Abstract: Recent advances in latent diffusion models have enabled exciting progress in
image style transfer. However, several key issues remain. For example, existing
methods still struggle to accurately match styles. They are often limited in
the number of style images that can be used. Furthermore, they tend to entangle
content and style in undesired ways. To address this, we propose leveraging
multiple style images which helps better represent style features and prevent
content leaking from the style images. We design a method that leverages both
image prompt adapters and statistical alignment of the features during the
denoising process. With this, our approach is designed such that it can
intervene both at the cross-attention and the self-attention layers of the
denoising UNet. For the statistical alignment, we employ clustering to distill
a small representative set of attention features from the large number of
attention values extracted from the style samples. As demonstrated in our
experimental section, the resulting method achieves state-of-the-art results
for stylization.

Motivation: 通过临床报告生成整个CT体积可以加速医学研究，实现数据增强、隐私保护合成，并减少对患者数据的监管限制，同时保留诊断信号。

Method: 使用FLUX的A-VAE定义潜在空间，CT-Clip文本编码器编码临床报告。采用自定义自回归方法生成一致的整个CT体积：首先生成第一个切片序列，然后基于先前生成的切片序列和文本来预测后续序列。

Result: 在FID、FVD、IS分数和CLIP分数等指标上，CTFlow在时间一致性、图像多样性和文本-图像对齐方面优于最先进的生成CT模型。

Conclusion: CTFlow展示了基于临床报告生成高质量CT体积的能力，为医学影像生成提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Generative modelling of entire CT volumes conditioned on clinical reports has
the potential to accelerate research through data augmentation,
privacy-preserving synthesis and reducing regulator-constraints on patient data
while preserving diagnostic signals. With the recent release of CT-RATE, a
large-scale collection of 3D CT volumes paired with their respective clinical
reports, training large text-conditioned CT volume generation models has become
achievable. In this work, we introduce CTFlow, a 0.5B latent flow matching
transformer model, conditioned on clinical reports. We leverage the A-VAE from
FLUX to define our latent space, and rely on the CT-Clip text encoder to encode
the clinical reports. To generate consistent whole CT volumes while keeping the
memory constraints tractable, we rely on a custom autoregressive approach,
where the model predicts the first sequence of slices of the volume from
text-only, and then relies on the previously generated sequence of slices and
the text, to predict the following sequence. We evaluate our results against
state-of-the-art generative CT model, and demonstrate the superiority of our
approach in terms of temporal coherence, image diversity and text-image
alignment, with FID, FVD, IS scores and CLIP score.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 应对大规模天文调查中对风变星进行自动化分类的需求，特别是针对飔飞双星的形态学分类

Method: 采用预训练的卷积神经网络(ResNet50)和视觉Transformer(ViT)模型，通过极坐标转换和hexbin可视化技术将相位折叠光变曲转换为图像，采用层次分类策略：第一步分离与过接触类型，第二步检测斑点

Result: 主要二元分类在多个通道(Gaia G、I、TESS)上达到高精度(>96%)，在OGLE、DEBCat、WUMaCat观测数据上也表现优异(>94%，TESS通道甚至100%)，但自动斑点检测任务表现差强

Conclusion: 计算机视觉在大规模飔飞双星形态分类中具有强大潜力，但在检测细微光度特征(如斑点)方面仍需进一步研究以提高模型的健壮性

Abstract: We present an application of computer vision methods to classify the light
curves of eclipsing binaries (EB). We have used pre-trained models based on
convolutional neural networks ($\textit{ResNet50}$) and vision transformers
($\textit{vit\_base\_patch16\_224}$), which were fine-tuned on images created
from synthetic datasets. To improve model generalisation and reduce
overfitting, we developed a novel image representation by transforming
phase-folded light curves into polar coordinates combined with hexbin
visualisation. Our hierarchical approach in the first stage classifies systems
into detached and overcontact types, and in the second stage identifies the
presence or absence of spots. The binary classification models achieved high
accuracy ($>96\%$) on validation data across multiple passbands (Gaia~$G$, $I$,
and $TESS$) and demonstrated strong performance ($>94\%$, up to $100\%$ for
$TESS$) when tested on extensive observational data from the OGLE, DEBCat, and
WUMaCat catalogues. While the primary binary classification was highly
successful, the secondary task of automated spot detection performed poorly,
revealing a significant limitation of our models for identifying subtle
photometric features. This study highlights the potential of computer vision
for EB morphological classification in large-scale surveys, but underscores the
need for further research into robust, automated spot detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有增量学习方法大多只关注编码器或解码器中的一个组件，这限制了缓解灾难性遗忘的效果，特别是在小内存场景下性能更差。需要同时提升编码器和解码器的泛化能力。

Method: 采用两阶段训练框架：第一阶段通过特征增强训练集成编码器学习泛化表示，提升解码器泛化能力并平衡分类器；第二阶段使用平衡知识蒸馏和特征知识蒸馏策略压缩集成编码器，开发新的更泛化的编码器。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上的大量实验显示SEDEG具有优越性能，消融研究证实了其各组件的有效性。

Conclusion: SEDEG通过同时提升编码器和解码器的泛化能力，有效解决了增量学习中的灾难性遗忘问题，特别是在小内存场景下表现出色。

Abstract: In incremental learning, enhancing the generality of knowledge is crucial for
adapting to dynamic data inputs. It can develop generalized representations or
more balanced decision boundaries, preventing the degradation of long-term
knowledge over time and thus mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Some emerging
incremental learning methods adopt an encoder-decoder architecture and have
achieved promising results. In the encoder-decoder achitecture, improving the
generalization capabilities of both the encoder and decoder is critical, as it
helps preserve previously learned knowledge while ensuring adaptability and
robustness to new, diverse data inputs. However, many existing continual
methods focus solely on enhancing one of the two components, which limits their
effectiveness in mitigating catastrophic forgetting. And these methods perform
even worse in small-memory scenarios, where only a limited number of historical
samples can be stored. To mitigate this limitation, we introduces SEDEG, a
two-stage training framework for vision transformers (ViT), focusing on
sequentially improving the generality of both Decoder and Encoder. Initially,
SEDEG trains an ensembled encoder through feature boosting to learn generalized
representations, which subsequently enhance the decoder's generality and
balance the classifier. The next stage involves using knowledge distillation
(KD) strategies to compress the ensembled encoder and develop a new, more
generalized encoder. This involves using a balanced KD approach and feature KD
for effective knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments on three benchmark
datasets show SEDEG's superior performance, and ablation studies confirm the
efficacy of its components. The code is available at

Abstract: Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) has become an invaluable imaging
modality in dentistry, enabling 3D visualization of teeth and surrounding
structures for diagnosis and treatment planning. Automated segmentation of
dental structures in CBCT can efficiently assist in identifying pathology
(e.g., pulpal or periapical lesions) and facilitate radiation therapy planning
in head and neck cancer patients. We describe the DLaBella29 team's approach
for the MICCAI 2025 ToothFairy3 Challenge, which involves a deep learning
pipeline for multi-class tooth segmentation. We utilized the MONAI Auto3DSeg
framework with a 3D SegResNet architecture, trained on a subset of the
ToothFairy3 dataset (63 CBCT scans) with 5-fold cross-validation. Key
preprocessing steps included image resampling to 0.6 mm isotropic resolution
and intensity clipping. We applied an ensemble fusion using Multi-Label STAPLE
on the 5-fold predictions to infer a Phase 1 segmentation and then conducted
tight cropping around the easily segmented Phase 1 mandible to perform Phase 2
segmentation on the smaller nerve structures. Our method achieved an average
Dice of 0.87 on the ToothFairy3 challenge out-of-sample validation set. This
paper details the clinical context, data preparation, model development,
results of our approach, and discusses the relevance of automated dental
segmentation for improving patient care in radiation oncology.

Abstract: Continuous and reliable underwater monitoring is essential for assessing
marine biodiversity, detecting ecological changes and supporting autonomous
exploration in aquatic environments. Underwater monitoring platforms rely on
mainly visual data for marine biodiversity analysis, ecological assessment and
autonomous exploration. However, underwater environments present significant
challenges due to light scattering, absorption and turbidity, which degrade
image clarity and distort colour information, which makes accurate observation
difficult. To address these challenges, we propose DEEP-SEA, a novel deep
learning-based underwater image restoration model to enhance both low- and
high-frequency information while preserving spatial structures. The proposed
Dual-Frequency Enhanced Self-Attention Spatial and Frequency Modulator aims to
adaptively refine feature representations in frequency domains and
simultaneously spatial information for better structural preservation. Our
comprehensive experiments on EUVP and LSUI datasets demonstrate the superiority
over the state of the art in restoring fine-grained image detail and structural
consistency. By effectively mitigating underwater visual degradation, DEEP-SEA
has the potential to improve the reliability of underwater monitoring platforms
for more accurate ecological observation, species identification and autonomous
navigation.

Result: 在新建立的跨域少样本测试集上，CoMuCo一贵超过当前最佳方法

Conclusion: CoMuCo通过多视角协作咄一致性约束，有效提升了视觉-语言模型在跨域少样本任务中的适应性咄性能

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) pre-trained on natural image and language data,
such as CLIP, have exhibited significant potential in few-shot image
recognition tasks, leading to development of various efficient transfer
learning methods. These methods exploit inherent pre-learned knowledge in VLMs
and have achieved strong performance on standard image datasets. However, their
effectiveness is often limited when confronted with cross-domain tasks where
imaging domains differ from natural images. To address this limitation, we
propose Consistency-guided Multi-view Collaborative Optimization (CoMuCo), a
novel fine-tuning strategy for VLMs. This strategy employs two functionally
complementary expert modules to extract multi-view features, while
incorporating prior knowledge-based consistency constraints and information
geometry-based consensus mechanisms to enhance the robustness of feature
learning. Additionally, a new cross-domain few-shot benchmark is established to
help comprehensively evaluate methods on imaging domains distinct from natural
images. Extensive empirical evaluations on both existing and newly proposed
benchmarks suggest CoMuCo consistently outperforms current methods in few-shot
tasks. The code and benchmark will be released.

Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型微调方法往往忽视数据分布的几何结构，可能导致语义表示失真，需要一种能保持流形结构同时增强分类性能的方法

Method: 将特征空间中的数据分布视为语义流形，通过对齐微调前后的Gram矩阵来保持流形的宏观和微观拓扑结构，并优化图像和文本模态的特征对相似性来增强类别可分性

Result: 大量实验表明MPS-Tuning显著提升了模型性能，同时有效保持了语义流形的结构

Conclusion: MPS-Tuning通过几何结构约束和类别可分性增强，为视觉语言模型的微调提供了一种有效的新方法

Abstract: Pretrained vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have shown remarkable
potential in few-shot image classification and led to numerous effective
transfer learning strategies. These methods leverage the pretrained knowledge
of VLMs to enable effective domain adaptation while mitigating overfitting
through parameter-efficient tuning or instance-based consistency constraints.
However, such regularizations often neglect the geometric structure of data
distribution, which may lead to distortion of the overall semantic
representation. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel fine-tuning
method, Manifold-Preserving and Sculpting Tuning (MPS-Tuning). Regarding the
data distribution in feature space as a semantic manifold, MPS-Tuning
explicitly constrains the intrinsic geometry of this manifold while further
sculpting it to enhance class separability. Specifically, MPS-Tuning preserves
both macroscopic and microscopic topological structures of the original
manifold by aligning Gram matrices of features before and after fine-tuning.
Theoretically, this constraint is shown to approximate an upper bound of the
Gromov-Wasserstein distance. Furthermore, features from the image and text
modalities are paired, and pairwise similarities are optimized to enhance the
manifold's class discriminability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MPS-Tuning significantly improves model performance while effectively
preserving the structure of the semantic manifold. The code will be released.

Motivation: 发现Classifier-free Guidance (CFG)在生成过程中会产生次优结果，导致语义不连贯和低质量输出，需要更好的引导策略

Method: 提出S²-Guidance方法，在前向过程中使用随机块丢弃来构建随机子网络，有效引导模型远离低质量预测

Result: 在文本到图像和文本到视频生成任务上的大量实验表明，S²-Guidance性能优越，一致超越CFG和其他先进引导策略

Conclusion: S²-Guidance通过利用模型自身的子网络来精炼预测，解决了CFG的局限性，为扩散模型提供了更有效的引导方法

Abstract: Classifier-free Guidance (CFG) is a widely used technique in modern diffusion
models for enhancing sample quality and prompt adherence. However, through an
empirical analysis on Gaussian mixture modeling with a closed-form solution, we
observe a discrepancy between the suboptimal results produced by CFG and the
ground truth. The model's excessive reliance on these suboptimal predictions
often leads to semantic incoherence and low-quality outputs. To address this
issue, we first empirically demonstrate that the model's suboptimal predictions
can be effectively refined using sub-networks of the model itself. Building on
this insight, we propose S^2-Guidance, a novel method that leverages stochastic
block-dropping during the forward process to construct stochastic sub-networks,
effectively guiding the model away from potential low-quality predictions and
toward high-quality outputs. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments
on text-to-image and text-to-video generation tasks demonstrate that
S^2-Guidance delivers superior performance, consistently surpassing CFG and
other advanced guidance strategies. Our code will be released.

salient weight structures using Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) for
one-shot pruning at the outset of training. Subsequently, ONG employs a precise
gradient masking mechanism to ensure that only unpruned weights are updated,
strictly preserving the target sparsity throughout the training phase. We
integrate ONG into the BIMP comparative framework and evaluate it on CIFAR-10
and CIFAR-100 with ResNet56, ResNet34, and ResNet18 against established stable
sparsification methods. Our experiments demonstrate ONG's ability to achieve
comparable or superior performance at various sparsity levels while maintaining
structural integrity post-pruning and offering a clear mechanism for targeting
desired sparsities.

Conclusion: CMF-IOU框架通过多阶段跨模态融合有效解决了3D空间和2D语义信息对齐问题，显著提升了3D检测性能

Abstract: Multi-modal methods based on camera and LiDAR sensors have garnered
significant attention in the field of 3D detection. However, many prevalent
works focus on single or partial stage fusion, leading to insufficient feature
extraction and suboptimal performance. In this paper, we introduce a
multi-stage cross-modal fusion 3D detection framework, termed CMF-IOU, to
effectively address the challenge of aligning 3D spatial and 2D semantic
information. Specifically, we first project the pixel information into 3D space
via a depth completion network to get the pseudo points, which unifies the
representation of the LiDAR and camera information. Then, a bilateral
cross-view enhancement 3D backbone is designed to encode LiDAR points and
pseudo points. The first sparse-to-distant (S2D) branch utilizes an
encoder-decoder structure to reinforce the representation of sparse LiDAR
points. The second residual view consistency (ResVC) branch is proposed to
mitigate the influence of inaccurate pseudo points via both the 3D and 2D
convolution processes. Subsequently, we introduce an iterative voxel-point
aware fine grained pooling module, which captures the spatial information from
LiDAR points and textural information from pseudo points in the proposal
refinement stage. To achieve more precise refinement during iteration, an
intersection over union (IoU) joint prediction branch integrated with a novel
proposals generation technique is designed to preserve the bounding boxes with
both high IoU and classification scores. Extensive experiments show the
superior performance of our method on the KITTI, nuScenes and Waymo datasets.

Motivation: 当前缺乏合适的基准来评估布局导向文本到图像生成模型的空间准确性，导致在合成数据生成中可能引入噪声和降低数据质量

Method: 构建7Bench基准，包含七种挑战性场景的文本-布局对，并提出一种基于现有框架的评估协议，通过布局对齐分数来评估空间准确性

Result: 使用7Bench评估多个独立流模型，发现了它们在不同对齐任务中的各自优势和限制

Conclusion: 7Bench为评估布局导向文本到图像生成模型的语义和空间对齐性提供了一个全面的基准，有助于提高合成数据的质量和可靠性

Abstract: Layout-guided text-to-image models offer greater control over the generation
process by explicitly conditioning image synthesis on the spatial arrangement
of elements. As a result, their adoption has increased in many computer vision
applications, ranging from content creation to synthetic data generation. A
critical challenge is achieving precise alignment between the image, textual
prompt, and layout, ensuring semantic fidelity and spatial accuracy. Although
recent benchmarks assess text alignment, layout alignment remains overlooked,
and no existing benchmark jointly evaluates both. This gap limits the ability
to evaluate a model's spatial fidelity, which is crucial when using
layout-guided generation for synthetic data, as errors can introduce noise and
degrade data quality. In this work, we introduce 7Bench, the first benchmark to
assess both semantic and spatial alignment in layout-guided text-to-image
generation. It features text-and-layout pairs spanning seven challenging
scenarios, investigating object generation, color fidelity, attribute
recognition, inter-object relationships, and spatial control. We propose an
evaluation protocol that builds on existing frameworks by incorporating the
layout alignment score to assess spatial accuracy. Using 7Bench, we evaluate
several state-of-the-art diffusion models, uncovering their respective
strengths and limitations across diverse alignment tasks. The benchmark is

Motivation: 当前异常检测方法主要针对低分辨率场景，高分辨率图像由于下采样会丢失细粒度信息导致漏检。现有方法在检测精度和效率上无法满足工业实际需求。

Method: 采用双分支架构整合多尺度异常线索，结合多分辨率特征融合策略处理细粒度纹理变化，使用检测器池和自适应分配策略平衡性能与计算成本。

Conclusion: HiAD框架能够有效解决高分辨率图像异常检测的挑战，在保持检测精度的同时控制计算成本，适用于工业实际应用场景。

Abstract: Current anomaly detection methods primarily focus on low-resolution
scenarios. For high-resolution images, conventional downsampling often results
in missed detections of subtle anomalous regions due to the loss of
fine-grained discriminative information. Despite some progress, recent studies
have attempted to improve detection resolution by employing lightweight
networks or using simple image tiling and ensemble methods. However, these
approaches still struggle to meet the practical demands of industrial scenarios
in terms of detection accuracy and efficiency. To address the above issues, we
propose HiAD, a general framework for high-resolution anomaly detection. HiAD
is capable of detecting anomalous regions of varying sizes in high-resolution
images under limited computational resources. Specifically, HiAD employs a
dual-branch architecture that integrates anomaly cues across different scales
to comprehensively capture both subtle and large-scale anomalies. Furthermore,
it incorporates a multi-resolution feature fusion strategy to tackle the
challenges posed by fine-grained texture variations in high-resolution images.
To enhance both adaptability and efficiency, HiAD utilizes a detector pool in
conjunction with various detector assignment strategies, enabling detectors to
be adaptively assigned based on patch features, ensuring detection performance
while effectively controlling computational costs. We conduct extensive
experiments on our specifically constructed high-resolution anomaly detection
benchmarks, including MVTec-HD, VisA-HD, and the real-world benchmark
RealIAD-HD, demonstrating the superior performance of HiAD. The code is

Abstract: Anatomic tracer studies are critical for validating and improving diffusion
MRI (dMRI) tractography. However, large-scale analysis of data from such
studies is hampered by the labor-intensive process of annotating fiber bundles
manually on histological slides. Existing automated methods often miss sparse
bundles or require complex post-processing across consecutive sections,
limiting their flexibility and generalizability. We present a streamlined,
fully automated framework for fiber bundle segmentation in macaque tracer data,
based on a U-Net architecture with large patch sizes, foreground aware
sampling, and semisupervised pre-training. Our approach eliminates common
errors such as mislabeling terminals as bundles, improves detection of sparse
bundles by over 20% and reduces the False Discovery Rate (FDR) by 40% compared
to the state-of-the-art, all while enabling analysis of standalone slices. This
new framework will facilitate the automated analysis of anatomic tracing data
at a large scale, generating more ground-truth data that can be used to
validate and optimize dMRI tractography methods.

Motivation: 视频重照明是一个具有挑战性但很有价值的任务，需要在替换视频背景的同时相应地调整前景光照并实现和谐融合。现有方法缺乏高质量配对视频数据，且难以保持前景属性和时间一致性。

Method: 构建混合真实和合成视频的大规模数据集；使用3D渲染引擎生成合成视频对，采用HDR光照模拟补充真实视频；设计联合训练课程，注入域感知适配器分离重照明和域外观分布学习。

Conclusion: Lumen框架通过大规模混合数据集和域感知适配器设计，成功解决了视频重照明中的前景保持和时间一致性问题，为视频编辑提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Video relighting is a challenging yet valuable task, aiming to replace the
background in videos while correspondingly adjusting the lighting in the
foreground with harmonious blending. During translation, it is essential to
preserve the original properties of the foreground, e.g., albedo, and propagate
consistent relighting among temporal frames. In this paper, we propose Lumen,
an end-to-end video relighting framework developed on large-scale video
generative models, receiving flexible textual description for instructing the
control of lighting and background. Considering the scarcity of high-qualified
paired videos with the same foreground in various lighting conditions, we
construct a large-scale dataset with a mixture of realistic and synthetic
videos. For the synthetic domain, benefiting from the abundant 3D assets in the
community, we leverage advanced 3D rendering engine to curate video pairs in
diverse environments. For the realistic domain, we adapt a HDR-based lighting
simulation to complement the lack of paired in-the-wild videos. Powered by the
aforementioned dataset, we design a joint training curriculum to effectively
unleash the strengths of each domain, i.e., the physical consistency in
synthetic videos, and the generalized domain distribution in realistic videos.
To implement this, we inject a domain-aware adapter into the model to decouple
the learning of relighting and domain appearance distribution. We construct a
comprehensive benchmark to evaluate Lumen together with existing methods, from
the perspectives of foreground preservation and video consistency assessment.
Experimental results demonstrate that Lumen effectively edit the input into
cinematic relighted videos with consistent lighting and strict foreground
preservation. Our project page: https://lumen-relight.github.io/

Motivation: 现有的自监督骨架动作识别方法主要关注有限关节集和低阶运动模式，限制了模型对复杂运动模式的理解能力。需要一种能够学习高阶运动表示的新方法。

Method: 提出语义引导掩码方法MaskSem，利用基于相对运动的Grad-CAM指导选择语义丰富的时序区域进行掩码。使用混合高阶运动（速度和加速度）作为重建目标，学习多阶运动模式。

Result: 在NTU60、NTU120和PKU-MMD数据集上的实验表明，MaskSem结合普通transformer能够显著提升骨架动作识别性能。

Conclusion: MaskSem通过语义引导掩码和混合高阶运动重建，有效提升了自监督骨架动作识别能力，更适合人机交互应用。

Abstract: Human action recognition is a crucial task for intelligent robotics,
particularly within the context of human-robot collaboration research. In
self-supervised skeleton-based action recognition, the mask-based
reconstruction paradigm learns the spatial structure and motion patterns of the
skeleton by masking joints and reconstructing the target from unlabeled data.
However, existing methods focus on a limited set of joints and low-order motion
patterns, limiting the model's ability to understand complex motion patterns.
To address this issue, we introduce MaskSem, a novel semantic-guided masking
method for learning 3D hybrid high-order motion representations. This novel
framework leverages Grad-CAM based on relative motion to guide the masking of
joints, which can be represented as the most semantically rich temporal
orgions. The semantic-guided masking process can encourage the model to explore
more discriminative features. Furthermore, we propose using hybrid high-order
motion as the reconstruction target, enabling the model to learn multi-order
motion patterns. Specifically, low-order motion velocity and high-order motion
acceleration are used together as the reconstruction target. This approach
offers a more comprehensive description of the dynamic motion process,
enhancing the model's understanding of motion patterns. Experiments on the
NTU60, NTU120, and PKU-MMD datasets show that MaskSem, combined with a vanilla
transformer, improves skeleton-based action recognition, making it more
suitable for applications in human-robot interaction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的强化微调方法主要针对封闭式医学VQA，而开放式医学VQA更能反映临床实践但研究较少。基于模型的语义奖励存在奖励崩塌问题，即语义差异显著的答案获得相似分数

Method: ARMed首先通过监督微调在思维链数据上融入领域知识，然后应用强化学习结合文本正确性和自适应语义奖励来增强推理质量

Result: 在六个医学VQA基准测试中，ARMed在领域内任务上提升了32.64%，在领域外基准上获得了11.65%的增益

Conclusion: 研究强调了奖励可区分性在医学强化学习中的关键作用，以及语义引导奖励在实现稳健且具有临床意义的多模态推理方面的潜力

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) with rule-based rewards has demonstrated strong
potential in enhancing the reasoning and generalization capabilities of
vision-language models (VLMs) and large language models (LLMs), while reducing
computational overhead. However, its application in medical imaging remains
underexplored. Existing reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) approaches in this
domain primarily target closed-ended visual question answering (VQA), limiting
their applicability to real-world clinical reasoning. In contrast, open-ended
medical VQA better reflects clinical practice but has received limited
attention. While some efforts have sought to unify both formats via
semantically guided RL, we observe that model-based semantic rewards often
suffer from reward collapse, where responses with significant semantic
differences receive similar scores. To address this, we propose ARMed (Adaptive
Reinforcement for Medical Reasoning), a novel RL framework for open-ended
medical VQA. ARMed first incorporates domain knowledge through supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) on chain-of-thought data, then applies reinforcement learning
with textual correctness and adaptive semantic rewards to enhance reasoning
quality. We evaluate ARMed on six challenging medical VQA benchmarks. Results
show that ARMed consistently boosts both accuracy and generalization, achieving
a 32.64% improvement on in-domain tasks and an 11.65% gain on out-of-domain
benchmarks. These results highlight the critical role of reward
discriminability in medical RL and the promise of semantically guided rewards
for enabling robust and clinically meaningful multimodal reasoning.

Motivation: 现有的端到端视线目标检测模型使用单一解码器同时定位头部和预测视线，导致表示纠缠。需要解耦这两个任务以获得更好的性能。

Method: 提出GazeDETR架构，包含两个独立的解码器：一个用于头部定位（使用局部信息），另一个用于视线预测（结合局部和全局信息），利用连贯注意力场。

Result: 在GazeFollow、VideoAttentionTarget和ChildPlay数据集上取得最先进结果，显著优于现有端到端模型。

Conclusion: 解耦的架构设计能够为头部定位和视线预测任务学习独特的表示，有效提升视线通信行为的量化性能。

Abstract: Gaze communication plays a crucial role in daily social interactions.
Quantifying this behavior can help in human-computer interaction and digital
phenotyping. While end-to-end models exist for gaze target detection, they only
utilize a single decoder to simultaneously localize human heads and predict
their corresponding gaze (e.g., 2D points or heatmap) in a scene. This
multitask learning approach generates a unified and entangled representation
for human head localization and gaze location prediction. Herein, we propose
GazeDETR, a novel end-to-end architecture with two disentangled decoders that
individually learn unique representations and effectively utilize coherent
attentive fields for each subtask. More specifically, we demonstrate that its
human head predictor utilizes local information, while its gaze decoder
incorporates both local and global information. Our proposed architecture
achieves state-of-the-art results on the GazeFollow, VideoAttentionTarget and
ChildPlay datasets. It outperforms existing end-to-end models with a notable
margin.

TL;DR: 通过分析视频波散Transformer的注意力矩阵，发现其存在结构化的异质稀疏模式，提出硬件感知的Compact Attention框架，通过适配到组织、时间变化窗口和自动配置搜索，实现1.6~2.5倍的注意力计算加速，保持相当的视觉质量。

Motivation: 自注意力机制的计算需求给变换器基于视频生成带来严重挑战，特别是在合成超长序列时。现有的因子化注意力和固定稀疏模式方法无法充分利用视频数据中内在的时空冗余性。

Method: 提出Compact Attention加速框架，包含三个创新：1)适配到组织策略，通过动态到组近似多样的空间交互模式；2)时间变化窗口，根据帧距离调整稀疏水平；3)自动化配置搜索算法，优化稀疏模式同时保留关键注意力途径。

Result: 在单GPU环境下，方法实现了注意力计算1.6~2.5倍的加速，同时保持了与全注意力基线相当的视觉质量。

Conclusion: 这项工作提供了一种有理论基础的方法，通过利用结构化稀疏性来实现高效的长形式视频生成。

Abstract: The computational demands of self-attention mechanisms pose a critical
challenge for transformer-based video generation, particularly in synthesizing
ultra-long sequences. Current approaches, such as factorized attention and
fixed sparse patterns, fail to fully exploit the inherent spatio-temporal
redundancies in video data. Through systematic analysis of video diffusion
transformers (DiT), we uncover a key insight: Attention matrices exhibit
structured, yet heterogeneous sparsity patterns, where specialized heads
dynamically attend to distinct spatiotemporal regions (e.g., local pattern,
cross-shaped pattern, or global pattern). Existing sparse attention methods
either impose rigid constraints or introduce significant overhead, limiting
their effectiveness. To address this, we propose Compact Attention, a
hardware-aware acceleration framework featuring three innovations: 1) Adaptive
tiling strategies that approximate diverse spatial interaction patterns via
dynamic tile grouping, 2) Temporally varying windows that adjust sparsity
levels based on frame proximity, and 3) An automated configuration search
algorithm that optimizes sparse patterns while preserving critical attention
pathways. Our method achieves 1.6~2.5x acceleration in attention computation on
single-GPU setups while maintaining comparable visual quality with
full-attention baselines. This work provides a principled approach to unlocking
efficient long-form video generation through structured sparsity exploitation.

Motivation: 解决现有零成本代理方法对标签数据的依赖问题，以及仅关注进化性或表达能力的偏面性，需要结合多个重要属性来评估网络架构

Method: 利用层特征的奇异值分解(SVD)和网络输出的外在曲率，设计了一种简化的调和平均值作为代理指标，只需单个无标签数据样本

Conclusion: 该方法能够在不依赖标签数据的情况下准确预测网络性能，具有高效率和优秀的相关性表现，为真实场景下的空间搜索提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Zero-shot Neural Architecture Search (NAS) typically optimises the
architecture search process by exploiting the network or gradient properties at
initialisation through zero-cost proxies. The existing proxies often rely on
labelled data, which is usually unavailable in real-world settings.
Furthermore, the majority of the current methods focus either on optimising the
convergence and generalisation attributes or solely on the expressivity of the
network architectures. To address both limitations, we first demonstrate how
channel collinearity affects the convergence and generalisation properties of a
neural network. Then, by incorporating the convergence, generalisation and
expressivity in one approach, we propose a zero-cost proxy that omits the
requirement of labelled data for its computation. In particular, we leverage
the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of the neural network layer features and
the extrinsic curvature of the network output to design our proxy. %As a
result, the proposed proxy is formulated as the simplified harmonic mean of the
logarithms of two key components: the sum of the inverse of the feature
condition number and the extrinsic curvature of the network output. Our
approach enables accurate prediction of network performance on test data using
only a single label-free data sample. Our extensive evaluation includes a total
of six experiments, including the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) search
space, i.e. DARTS and the Transformer search space, i.e. AutoFormer. The
proposed proxy demonstrates a superior performance on multiple correlation
benchmarks, including NAS-Bench-101, NAS-Bench-201, and
TransNAS-Bench-101-micro; as well as on the NAS task within the DARTS and the
AutoFormer search space, all while being notably efficient. The code is

Abstract: The development of smart cities has led to the generation of massive amounts
of multi-modal data in the context of a range of tasks that enable a
comprehensive monitoring of the smart city infrastructure and services. This
paper surveys one of the most critical tasks, multi-modal visual object
tracking (MMVOT), from the perspective of multimodality analysis. Generally,
MMVOT differs from single-modal tracking in four key aspects, data collection,
modality alignment and annotation, model designing, and evaluation.
Accordingly, we begin with an introduction to the relevant data modalities,
laying the groundwork for their integration. This naturally leads to a
discussion of challenges of multi-modal data collection, alignment, and
annotation. Subsequently, existing MMVOT methods are categorised, based on
different ways to deal with visible (RGB) and X modalities: programming the
auxiliary X branch with replicated or non-replicated experimental
configurations from the RGB branch. Here X can be thermal infrared (T), depth
(D), event (E), near infrared (NIR), language (L), or sonar (S). The final part
of the paper addresses evaluation and benchmarking. In summary, we undertake an
omni survey of all aspects of multi-modal visual object tracking (VOT),
covering six MMVOT tasks and featuring 338 references in total. In addition, we
discuss the fundamental rhetorical question: Is multi-modal tracking always
guaranteed to provide a superior solution to unimodal tracking with the help of
information fusion, and if not, in what circumstances its application is
beneficial. Furthermore, for the first time in this field, we analyse the
distributions of the object categories in the existing MMVOT datasets,
revealing their pronounced long-tail nature and a noticeable lack of animal
categories when compared with RGB datasets.

Method: 通过实证研究分析特征多样性对开放集识别和持续学习的影响，提供经验证据

Conclusion: 特征多样性在开放集识别和持续学习中扮演重要角色，这一发现可为这两个领域的实践方法和理论理解提供新的研究方向

Abstract: Open set recognition (OSR) and continual learning are two critical challenges
in machine learning, focusing respectively on detecting novel classes at
inference time and updating models to incorporate the new classes. While many
recent approaches have addressed these problems, particularly OSR, by
heuristically promoting feature diversity, few studies have directly examined
the role that feature diversity plays in tackling them. In this work, we
provide empirical evidence that enhancing feature diversity improves the
recognition of open set samples. Moreover, increased feature diversity also
facilitates both the retention of previously learned data and the integration
of new data in continual learning. We hope our findings can inspire further
research into both practical methods and theoretical understanding in these
domains.

query-driven sparse scheme. SlimComm builds a motion-centric dynamic map to
distinguish moving from static objects and generates two query types: (i)
reference queries on dynamic and high-confidence regions, and (ii) exploratory
queries probing occluded areas via a two-stage offset. Only query-specific BEV
features are exchanged and fused through multi-scale gated deformable
attention, reducing payload while preserving accuracy. For evaluation, we
release OPV2V-R and Adver-City-R, CARLA-based datasets with per-point Doppler
radar. SlimComm achieves up to 90% lower bandwidth than full-map sharing while
matching or surpassing prior baselines across varied traffic densities and
occlusions. Dataset and code will be available at: https://url.fzi.de/SlimComm.

Abstract: Recent advances in interactive video generations have demonstrated diffusion
model's potential as world models by capturing complex physical dynamics and
interactive behaviors. However, existing interactive world models depend on
bidirectional attention and lengthy inference steps, severely limiting
real-time performance. Consequently, they are hard to simulate real-world
dynamics, where outcomes must update instantaneously based on historical
context and current actions. To address this, we present Matrix-Game 2.0, an
interactive world model generates long videos on-the-fly via few-step
auto-regressive diffusion. Our framework consists of three key components: (1)
A scalable data production pipeline for Unreal Engine and GTA5 environments to
effectively produce massive amounts (about 1200 hours) of video data with
diverse interaction annotations; (2) An action injection module that enables
frame-level mouse and keyboard inputs as interactive conditions; (3) A few-step
distillation based on the casual architecture for real-time and streaming video
generation. Matrix Game 2.0 can generate high-quality minute-level videos
across diverse scenes at an ultra-fast speed of 25 FPS. We open-source our
model weights and codebase to advance research in interactive world modeling.

Conclusion: EgoTwin框架成功解决了第一人称视频和人体运动联合生成的关键挑战，为这一新兴领域提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: While exocentric video synthesis has achieved great progress, egocentric
video generation remains largely underexplored, which requires modeling
first-person view content along with camera motion patterns induced by the
wearer's body movements. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel task of joint
egocentric video and human motion generation, characterized by two key
challenges: 1) Viewpoint Alignment: the camera trajectory in the generated
video must accurately align with the head trajectory derived from human motion;
2) Causal Interplay: the synthesized human motion must causally align with the
observed visual dynamics across adjacent video frames. To address these
challenges, we propose EgoTwin, a joint video-motion generation framework built
on the diffusion transformer architecture. Specifically, EgoTwin introduces a
head-centric motion representation that anchors the human motion to the head
joint and incorporates a cybernetics-inspired interaction mechanism that
explicitly captures the causal interplay between video and motion within
attention operations. For comprehensive evaluation, we curate a large-scale
real-world dataset of synchronized text-video-motion triplets and design novel
metrics to assess video-motion consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of the EgoTwin framework.

Abstract: Deep learning-based cardiac MRI reconstruction faces significant domain shift
challenges when deployed across multiple clinical centers with heterogeneous
scanner configurations and imaging protocols. We propose HierAdaptMR, a
hierarchical feature adaptation framework that addresses multi-level domain
variations through parameter-efficient adapters. Our method employs
Protocol-Level Adapters for sequence-specific characteristics and Center-Level
Adapters for scanner-dependent variations, built upon a variational unrolling
backbone. A Universal Adapter enables generalization to entirely unseen centers
through stochastic training that learns center-invariant adaptations. The
framework utilizes multi-scale SSIM loss with frequency domain enhancement and
contrast-adaptive weighting for robust optimization. Comprehensive evaluation
on the CMRxRecon2025 dataset spanning 5+ centers, 10+ scanners, and 9
modalities demonstrates superior cross-center generalization while maintaining
reconstruction quality. code: https://github.com/Ruru-Xu/HierAdaptMR

Motivation: 高质量新视角合成需要均匀密集的视角采样，但人类摄像师常因紧快、耐心不足或不理解场景结构而无法满足这些要求。现有方法覆盖面局限或忽略视角依赖的材质特性。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效提升新视角合成算法的输入图像质量，解决人类摄像采集过程中的挑战。

Abstract: Novel view synthesis from images, for example, with 3D Gaussian splatting,
has made great progress. Rendering fidelity and speed are now ready even for
demanding virtual reality applications. However, the problem of assisting
humans in collecting the input images for these rendering algorithms has
received much less attention. High-quality view synthesis requires uniform and
dense view sampling. Unfortunately, these requirements are not easily addressed
by human camera operators, who are in a hurry, impatient, or lack understanding
of the scene structure and the photographic process. Existing approaches to
guide humans during image acquisition concentrate on single objects or neglect
view-dependent material characteristics. We propose a novel situated
visualization technique for scanning at multiple scales. During the scanning of
a scene, our method identifies important objects that need extended image
coverage to properly represent view-dependent appearance. To this end, we
leverage semantic segmentation and category identification, ranked by a
vision-language model. Spherical proxies are generated around highly ranked
objects to guide the user during scanning. Our results show superior
performance in real scenes compared to conventional view sampling strategies.

Method: 构建包含18,573张图片的大规模数据集，提出Odo结构：冻结UNet保留外观细节，ControlNet通过目标SMPL深度地图导形状转换，基于涵文属性指导的渐变分布方法

Result: 达到每顶点重建错误仅7.5mm（基准方法为13.6mm），在保持真实性的同时准确匹配目标形状，性能显著超过现有方法

Conclusion: 该研究为人体形状编辑领域提供了首个大规模数据集和高效的深度学习方案，Odo方法能够在保留原始图像细节的同时实现准确的身体重塑，为计算机视觉和图像编辑领域带来重要进展

Abstract: Human shape editing enables controllable transformation of a person's body
shape, such as thin, muscular, or overweight, while preserving pose, identity,
clothing, and background. Unlike human pose editing, which has advanced
rapidly, shape editing remains relatively underexplored. Current approaches
typically rely on 3D morphable models or image warping, often introducing
unrealistic body proportions, texture distortions, and background
inconsistencies due to alignment errors and deformations. A key limitation is
the lack of large-scale, publicly available datasets for training and
evaluating body shape manipulation methods. In this work, we introduce the
first large-scale dataset of 18,573 images across 1523 subjects, specifically
designed for controlled human shape editing. It features diverse variations in
body shape, including fat, muscular and thin, captured under consistent
identity, clothing, and background conditions. Using this dataset, we propose
Odo, an end-to-end diffusion-based method that enables realistic and intuitive
body reshaping guided by simple semantic attributes. Our approach combines a
frozen UNet that preserves fine-grained appearance and background details from
the input image with a ControlNet that guides shape transformation using target
SMPL depth maps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms
prior approaches, achieving per-vertex reconstruction errors as low as 7.5mm,
significantly lower than the 13.6mm observed in baseline methods, while
producing realistic results that accurately match the desired target shapes.

Conclusion: 整合眼动数据能够同时提升疾病分类性能和生成医学报告的可解释性，为医学影像分析提供了更有效的多模态解决方案

Abstract: We propose a two-stage multimodal framework that enhances disease
classification and region-aware radiology report generation from chest X-rays,
leveraging the MIMIC-Eye dataset. In the first stage, we introduce a
gaze-guided contrastive learning architecture for disease classification. It
integrates visual features, clinical labels, bounding boxes, and radiologist
eye-tracking signals and is equipped with a novel multi-term gaze-attention
loss combining MSE, KL divergence, correlation, and center-of-mass alignment.
Incorporating fixations improves F1 score from 0.597 to 0.631 (+5.70%) and AUC
from 0.821 to 0.849 (+3.41%), while also improving precision and recall,
highlighting the effectiveness of gaze-informed attention supervision. In the
second stage, we present a modular report generation pipeline that extracts
confidence-weighted diagnostic keywords, maps them to anatomical regions using
a curated dictionary constructed from domain-specific priors, and generates
region-aligned sentences via structured prompts. This pipeline improves report
quality as measured by clinical keyword recall and ROUGE overlap. Our results
demonstrate that integrating gaze data improves both classification performance
and the interpretability of generated medical reports.

Conclusion: 通过生成式AI技术生成真实ID卡图像是有效解决训练数据不足问题的新方法，能够提升阻击检测系统的通用性能力

Abstract: Nowadays, the development of a Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) system for
ID cards presents a challenge due to the lack of images available to train a
robust PAD system and the increase in diversity of possible attack instrument
species. Today, most algorithms focus on generating attack samples and do not
take into account the limited number of bona fide images. This work is one of
the first to propose a method for mimicking bona fide images by generating
synthetic versions of them using Stable Diffusion, which may help improve the
generalisation capabilities of the detector. Furthermore, the new images
generated are evaluated in a system trained from scratch and in a commercial
solution. The PAD system yields an interesting result, as it identifies our
images as bona fide, which has a positive impact on detection performance and
data restrictions.

Conclusion: Chessboard数据集和Checkmate模型为RSVQA系统提供了更好的可解释性和可信赖性，通过细粒度视觉推理减少偏差影响

Abstract: Remote Sensing Visual Question Answering (RSVQA) presents unique challenges
in ensuring that model decisions are both understandable and grounded in visual
content. Current models often suffer from a lack of interpretability and
explainability, as well as from biases in dataset distributions that lead to
shortcut learning. In this work, we tackle these issues by introducing a novel
RSVQA dataset, Chessboard, designed to minimize biases through 3'123'253
questions and a balanced answer distribution. Each answer is linked to one or
more cells within the image, enabling fine-grained visual reasoning.
  Building on this dataset, we develop an explainable and interpretable model
called Checkmate that identifies the image cells most relevant to its
decisions. Through extensive experiments across multiple model architectures,
we show that our approach improves transparency and supports more trustworthy
decision-making in RSVQA systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自监督方法在立体匹配和深度估计中相对较少关注，主要挑战是光度重建中的模糊性，特别是在遮挡区域和出框区域缺乏对应像素

Method: 微调Stable Diffusion模型，通过方向提示沿极线方向合成新视角图像（左-左视图、右-右视图和中间视图），补充遮挡像素

Result: 在多个基准数据集上达到最先进性能，异常值减少高达35%

Conclusion: DMS是一种无需成本的即插即用方法，仅需未标记的立体图像对即可显著提升自监督立体匹配和深度估计性能

Abstract: While supervised stereo matching and monocular depth estimation have advanced
significantly with learning-based algorithms, self-supervised methods using
stereo images as supervision signals have received relatively less focus and
require further investigation. A primary challenge arises from ambiguity
introduced during photometric reconstruction, particularly due to missing
corresponding pixels in ill-posed regions of the target view, such as
occlusions and out-of-frame areas. To address this and establish explicit
photometric correspondences, we propose DMS, a model-agnostic approach that
utilizes geometric priors from diffusion models to synthesize novel views along
the epipolar direction, guided by directional prompts. Specifically, we
finetune a Stable Diffusion model to simulate perspectives at key positions:
left-left view shifted from the left camera, right-right view shifted from the
right camera, along with an additional novel view between the left and right
cameras. These synthesized views supplement occluded pixels, enabling explicit
photometric reconstruction. Our proposed DMS is a cost-free, ''plug-and-play''
method that seamlessly enhances self-supervised stereo matching and monocular
depth estimation, and relies solely on unlabeled stereo image pairs for both
training and synthesizing. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
of our approach, with up to 35% outlier reduction and state-of-the-art
performance across multiple benchmark datasets.

Result: RT-DETR-X模型达到mAP@50为0.816，mAP@50-95为0.612，略高于RT-DETR-L的0.810和0.606，但RT-DETR-L的推理速度更快（20.1ms vs 34.5ms）。

Conclusion: RT-DETR-L模型在处理速度和检测准确性之间完成更优的平衡，更适合实时现场部署，为环境保护应用提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Coastal pollution is a pressing global environmental issue, necessitating
scalable and automated solutions for monitoring and management. This study
investigates the efficacy of the Real-Time Detection Transformer (RT-DETR), a
state-of-the-art, end-to-end object detection model, for the automated
detection and counting of beach litter. A rigorous comparative analysis is
conducted between two model variants, RT-DETR-Large (RT-DETR-L) and
RT-DETR-Extra-Large (RT-DETR-X), trained on a publicly available dataset of
coastal debris. The evaluation reveals that the RT-DETR-X model achieves
marginally superior accuracy, with a mean Average Precision at 50\% IoU
(mAP@50) of 0.816 and a mAP@50-95 of 0.612, compared to the RT-DETR-L model's
0.810 and 0.606, respectively. However, this minor performance gain is realized
at a significant computational cost; the RT-DETR-L model demonstrates a
substantially faster inference time of 20.1 ms versus 34.5 ms for the
RT-DETR-X. The findings suggest that the RT-DETR-L model offers a more
practical and efficient solution for real-time, in-field deployment due to its
superior balance of processing speed and detection accuracy. This research
provides valuable insights into the application of advanced Transformer-based
detectors for environmental conservation, highlighting the critical trade-offs
between model complexity and operational viability.

Abstract: We present visual action prompts, a unified action representation for
action-to-video generation of complex high-DoF interactions while maintaining
transferable visual dynamics across domains. Action-driven video generation
faces a precision-generality trade-off: existing methods using text, primitive
actions, or coarse masks offer generality but lack precision, while
agent-centric action signals provide precision at the cost of cross-domain
transferability. To balance action precision and dynamic transferability, we
propose to "render" actions into precise visual prompts as domain-agnostic
representations that preserve both geometric precision and cross-domain
adaptability for complex actions; specifically, we choose visual skeletons for
their generality and accessibility. We propose robust pipelines to construct
skeletons from two interaction-rich data sources - human-object interactions
(HOI) and dexterous robotic manipulation - enabling cross-domain training of
action-driven generative models. By integrating visual skeletons into
pretrained video generation models via lightweight fine-tuning, we enable
precise action control of complex interaction while preserving the learning of
cross-domain dynamics. Experiments on EgoVid, RT-1 and DROID demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed approach. Project page:

Conclusion: Motion2Motion为解决跨拓扑动画迁移问题提供了实用解决方案，具有工业应用潜力，代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: This work studies the challenge of transfer animations between characters
whose skeletal topologies differ substantially. While many techniques have
advanced retargeting techniques in decades, transfer motions across diverse
topologies remains less-explored. The primary obstacle lies in the inherent
topological inconsistency between source and target skeletons, which restricts
the establishment of straightforward one-to-one bone correspondences. Besides,
the current lack of large-scale paired motion datasets spanning different
topological structures severely constrains the development of data-driven
approaches. To address these limitations, we introduce Motion2Motion, a novel,
training-free framework. Simply yet effectively, Motion2Motion works with only
one or a few example motions on the target skeleton, by accessing a sparse set
of bone correspondences between the source and target skeletons. Through
comprehensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations, we demonstrate that
Motion2Motion achieves efficient and reliable performance in both
similar-skeleton and cross-species skeleton transfer scenarios. The practical
utility of our approach is further evidenced by its successful integration in
downstream applications and user interfaces, highlighting its potential for
industrial applications. Code and data are available at

Conclusion: IGFuse框架在真实世界3D重建和真实到仿真的转换中表现出有效性，为解决3D场景重建中的遮挡和覆盖限制问题提供了创新解决方案

Abstract: Reconstructing complete and interactive 3D scenes remains a fundamental
challenge in computer vision and robotics, particularly due to persistent
object occlusions and limited sensor coverage. Multiview observations from a
single scene scan often fail to capture the full structural details. Existing
approaches typically rely on multi stage pipelines, such as segmentation,
background completion, and inpainting or require per-object dense scanning,
both of which are error-prone, and not easily scalable. We propose IGFuse, a
novel framework that reconstructs interactive Gaussian scene by fusing
observations from multiple scans, where natural object rearrangement between
captures reveal previously occluded regions. Our method constructs segmentation
aware Gaussian fields and enforces bi-directional photometric and semantic
consistency across scans. To handle spatial misalignments, we introduce a
pseudo-intermediate scene state for unified alignment, alongside collaborative
co-pruning strategies to refine geometry. IGFuse enables high fidelity
rendering and object level scene manipulation without dense observations or
complex pipelines. Extensive experiments validate the framework's strong
generalization to novel scene configurations, demonstrating its effectiveness
for real world 3D reconstruction and real-to-simulation transfer. Our project

reconstruction approaches. 2) we introduce a unified 6D video representation
that jointly models RGB and XYZ sequences, facilitating structured learning of
both appearance and geometry. 3) we propose a set of simple yet effective
adaptation strategies to repurpose pretrained video diffusion models for 4D
modeling. 4DNeX produces high-quality dynamic point clouds that enable
novel-view video synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that 4DNeX
outperforms existing 4D generation methods in efficiency and generalizability,
offering a scalable solution for image-to-4D modeling and laying the foundation
for generative 4D world models that simulate dynamic scene evolution.

### [157] [Deep Language Geometry: Constructing a Metric Space from LLM Weights](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11676)
*Maksym Shamrai,Vladyslav Hamolia*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 利用LLM内部权重激活构建语言度量空间的新框架，通过修剪算法自动生成高维语言表征，在106种语言上验证效果与语言家族一致并发现新联系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统语言度量方法依赖于手工编码的语言特征，需要专业知识且耗时耗力。本文想要利用现代大语言模型的内部表征自动提取语言特征，建立更加准确和可解释的语言度量空间。

Method: 通过修改的修剪算法计算LLM权重的重要性得分，自动汇总生成高维度的语言向量表征。这种方法能够抓取语言的内在特征和语言现象。

Result: 在多语言LLM和106种语言的数据集上验证了方法的有效性。结果与现有语言家族分类高度一致，同时发现了一些意外的语言间联系，这可能反映了历史上的语言接触或语言进化关系。

Conclusion: 该框架能够利用LLM内部权重激活自动构建准确的语言度量空间，不仅与传统语言学分类一致，还能发现新的语言联系，为语言学研究提供了新的视角和工具。研究代码和语言向量已开源。

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework that utilizes the internal weight activations
of modern Large Language Models (LLMs) to construct a metric space of
languages. Unlike traditional approaches based on hand-crafted linguistic
features, our method automatically derives high-dimensional vector
representations by computing weight importance scores via an adapted pruning
algorithm. Our approach captures intrinsic language characteristics that
reflect linguistic phenomena. We validate our approach across diverse datasets
and multilingual LLMs, covering 106 languages. The results align well with
established linguistic families while also revealing unexpected inter-language
connections that may indicate historical contact or language evolution. The
source code, computed language latent vectors, and visualization tool are made
publicly available at https://github.com/mshamrai/deep-language-geometry.

*Jonas van Elburg,Peter van der Putten,Maarten Marx*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究使用LLM生成的合成QA数据是否能替代人工标注基准，发现在检索器配置变化时合成基准可靠，但在生成器架构比较时失效


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当人工标注基准不可用时，探索大语言模型生成的合成问答数据是否能作为有效的替代品来评估检索增强生成系统

Method: 通过两个实验评估：1）固定生成器，变化检索器参数；2）固定检索器参数，变化生成器架构。在四个数据集（两个开放域、两个专有）上进行测试

Result: 合成基准在检索器配置变化时能可靠地对RAG系统进行排名，与人工基准结果一致；但在生成器架构比较时无法产生一致的排名

Conclusion: 合成QA数据在评估检索器性能时有效，但由于任务不匹配和风格偏见，不适合用于比较不同生成器架构

Abstract: We investigate whether synthetic question-answer (QA) data generated by large
language models (LLMs) can serve as an effective proxy for human-labeled
benchmarks when such data is unavailable. We assess the reliability of
synthetic benchmarks across two experiments: one varying retriever parameters
while keeping the generator fixed, and another varying the generator with fixed
retriever parameters. Across four datasets, of which two open-domain and two
proprietary, we find that synthetic benchmarks reliably rank the RAGs varying
in terms of retriever configuration, aligning well with human-labeled benchmark
baselines. However, they fail to produce consistent RAG rankings when comparing
generator architectures. The breakdown possibly arises from a combination of
task mismatch between the synthetic and human benchmarks, and stylistic bias
favoring certain generators.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出一种基于LLM的汇聚式法来解决语义表注解任务中的复杂挑战，包括创建五个外部工具来动态选择注解策略，并通过Levenshtein距离减少冗余注解。在Tough Tables和BiodivTab数据集上超越现有方法，同时减少70%的时间成本和60%的LLM令牌消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语义表注解任务遇到了多种挑战：列名或单元格值的语义丢失、严格的本体论层次要求、同词异义、拼写错误和缩写等问题，这些问题影响了注解的准确性。

Method: 提出一种基于LLM的汇聚式法，基于ReAct框架设计和实现了五个外部工具，以便STA汇聚根据表格特征动态选择合适的注解策略。利用Levenshtein距离减少冗余注解。

Result: 在SemTab挑战中的Tough Tables和BiodivTab数据集上，该方法在各种指标上都超过了现有方法。通过减少冗余注解，实现了70%的时间成本和60%的LLM令牌消耗的减少。

Conclusion: 该方法为语义表注解任务提供了一种高效且成本效益高的解决方案，能够有效处理复杂表格带来的各种挑战。

Abstract: The Semantic Table Annotation (STA) task, which includes Column Type
Annotation (CTA) and Cell Entity Annotation (CEA), maps table contents to
ontology entities and plays important roles in various semantic applications.
However, complex tables often pose challenges such as semantic loss of column
names or cell values, strict ontological hierarchy requirements, homonyms,
spelling errors, and abbreviations, which hinder annotation accuracy. To
address these issues, this paper proposes an LLM-based agent approach for CTA
and CEA. We design and implement five external tools with tailored prompts
based on the ReAct framework, enabling the STA agent to dynamically select
suitable annotation strategies depending on table characteristics. Experiments
are conducted on the Tough Tables and BiodivTab datasets from the SemTab
challenge, which contain the aforementioned challenges. Our method outperforms
existing approaches across various metrics. Furthermore, by leveraging
Levenshtein distance to reduce redundant annotations, we achieve a 70%
reduction in time costs and a 60% reduction in LLM token usage, providing an
efficient and cost-effective solution for STA.

TL;DR: 使用模仿学习从专家对话中恢复对话策略和判别器，发现对话模型的局限性，并提出该方法可用于识别对话任务中数据模型的不良行为


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在没有奖励信号的情况下，通过利用专家演示来创建对话策略

Method: 应用模仿学习技术，从专家对话中恢复对话策略和能够区分专家对话与合成对话的判别器

Result: 策略有效，但判别器结果显示对话模型存在局限性

Conclusion: 该技术可用于识别面向对话任务的任意数据模型的不良行为

Abstract: Imitation learning is a proven method for creating a policy in the absence of
rewards, by leveraging expert demonstrations. In this work, we apply imitation
learning to conversation. In doing so, we recover a policy capable of talking
to a user given a prompt (input state), and a discriminator capable of
classifying between expert and synthetic conversation. While our policy is
effective, we recover results from our discriminator that indicate the
limitations of dialog models. We argue that this technique can be used to
identify adverse behavior of arbitrary data models common for dialog oriented
tasks.

TL;DR: 研究发现Faetar ASR基准中的转录不一致性问题存在但不是主要挑战，有限词典约束解码有益，但任务仍然极其困难


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 检验低资源自动语音识别基准中转录不一致性的影响，评估其对ASR性能的实际挑战程度

Method: 使用手工构建的小型词典分析转录不一致性，测试bigram词级语言模型和有限词典约束解码的效果

Result: 转录不一致确实存在但不是主要问题，bigram语言模型无额外收益，有限词典约束解码有积极效果

Conclusion: Faetar ASR基准任务极其困难，转录不一致性不是核心挑战，词典约束是有效的改进方向

Abstract: We examine the role of transcription inconsistencies in the Faetar Automatic
Speech Recognition benchmark, a challenging low-resource ASR benchmark. With
the help of a small, hand-constructed lexicon, we conclude that find that,
while inconsistencies do exist in the transcriptions, they are not the main
challenge in the task. We also demonstrate that bigram word-based language
modelling is of no added benefit, but that constraining decoding to a finite
lexicon can be beneficial. The task remains extremely difficult.

*Tianyi Li,Yu Qin,Olivia R. Liu Sheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究评估了大型语言模型（如Google Gemini）在学术文本处理方面的能力，通过四个任务测试发现其在学术同行评审中的表现有限，不建议未经检查地使用LLM进行同行评审构建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型在辅助科学发现特别是学术同行评审方面的实际应用潜力，评估LLM处理学术文本的能力。

Method: 采用四个任务评估框架：内容复现/比较/评分/反思，使用顶级信息系统期刊文章作为输入文本，结合多种文本指标进行严格性能评估。

Result: Gemini的学术文本摘要和转述可靠性尚可，但文本比较排序扩展性差，评分区分度低，反思缺乏洞察力，整体表现妥协。

Conclusion: LLM在学术文本处理能力方面证据不支持其广泛推荐使用，特别是在构建同行评审时应谨慎使用。

Abstract: How much large language models (LLMs) can aid scientific discovery, notably
in assisting academic peer review, is in heated debate. Between a literature
digest and a human-comparable research assistant lies their practical
application potential. We organize individual tasks that computer science
studies employ in separate terms into a guided and robust workflow to evaluate
LLMs' processing of academic text input. We employ four tasks in the
assessment: content reproduction/comparison/scoring/reflection, each demanding
a specific role of the LLM (oracle/judgmental arbiter/knowledgeable
arbiter/collaborator) in assisting scholarly works, and altogether testing LLMs
with questions that increasingly require intellectual capabilities towards a
solid understanding of scientific texts to yield desirable solutions. We
exemplify a rigorous performance evaluation with detailed instructions on the
prompts. Adopting first-rate Information Systems articles at three top journals
as the input texts and an abundant set of text metrics, we record a compromised
performance of the leading LLM - Google's Gemini: its summary and paraphrase of
academic text is acceptably reliable; using it to rank texts through pairwise
text comparison is faintly scalable; asking it to grade academic texts is prone
to poor discrimination; its qualitative reflection on the text is
self-consistent yet hardly insightful to inspire meaningful research. This
evidence against an endorsement of LLMs' text-processing capabilities is
consistent across metric-based internal (linguistic assessment), external
(comparing to the ground truth), and human evaluation, and is robust to the
variations of the prompt. Overall, we do not recommend an unchecked use of LLMs
in constructing peer reviews.

Motivation: 解决科学文本简化任务，使复杂科学内容更容易被非专业读者理解

Result: 实现了更连贯和上下文忠实的科学文本简化

Conclusion: 基于LLM的两阶段框架能有效提升科学文本简化的质量和一致性

Abstract: In this paper, we present our approach for the CLEF 2025 SimpleText Task 1,
which addresses both sentence-level and document-level scientific text
simplification. For sentence-level simplification, our methodology employs
large language models (LLMs) to first generate a structured plan, followed by
plan-driven simplification of individual sentences. At the document level, we
leverage LLMs to produce concise summaries and subsequently guide the
simplification process using these summaries. This two-stage, LLM-based
framework enables more coherent and contextually faithful simplifications of
scientific text.

Motivation: 解决CLEF 2025 SimpleText Task 2中的科学文本简化问题，特别是检测创意生成和信息失真，提高简化文本的质量和准确性。

Method: 构建集成框架，结合BERT分类器、语义相似度测量、自然语言推理模型和LLM推理；使用元分类器整合多种信号；采用基于LLM的后编辑系统根据原始输入文本修订简化内容。

Result: 通过集成多种策略和元分类器，增强了虚假和失真检测的鲁棒性；LLM后编辑系统能够基于原始文本进行修正，提高简化质量。

Conclusion: 该方法通过多策略集成和LLM后编辑，有效提升了科学文本简化中创意生成和信息失真的检测与处理能力，为相关任务提供了可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we describe our methodology for the CLEF 2025 SimpleText Task
2, which focuses on detecting and evaluating creative generation and
information distortion in scientific text simplification. Our solution
integrates multiple strategies: we construct an ensemble framework that
leverages BERT-based classifier, semantic similarity measure, natural language
inference model, and large language model (LLM) reasoning. These diverse
signals are combined using meta-classifiers to enhance the robustness of
spurious and distortion detection. Additionally, for grounded generation, we
employ an LLM-based post-editing system that revises simplifications based on
the original input texts.

*Michael Flor,Xinyi Liu,Anna Feldman*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇调查性论文系统归纳了语言学和计算语言学领域中用于研究习语的53个数据集，分析了它们在内容、形式和用途方面的特点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 习语作为一种图式表达，其含义无法从单词推断，这给计算处理和人类实验研究带来了巨大挑战。需要系统性地评估现有的习语研究数据资源。

Method: 通过调查及归纳分析53个习语数据集，从注释实践、覆盖范围和任务构建等角度全面分析。对比心理语言学资源（包含熟悉度、透明度、组合性等评分）和计算语言学数据集（支持习语性检测/分类、重写、跨语言建模等任务）。

Result: 识别出了注释实践、覆盖范围和任务构建方面的趋势。虽然最近的研究拓展了语言覆盖范围和任务多样性，但心理语言学和计算语言学在习语研究方面仍然缺乏联系。

Conclusion: 这项调查为习语研究领域提供了系统性的数据集评估，显示了两个领域之间的分离状态，为未来的跨领域合作研究指明了方向。

Abstract: Idioms are figurative expressions whose meanings often cannot be inferred
from their individual words, making them difficult to process computationally
and posing challenges for human experimental studies. This survey reviews
datasets developed in psycholinguistics and computational linguistics for
studying idioms, focusing on their content, form, and intended use.
Psycholinguistic resources typically contain normed ratings along dimensions
such as familiarity, transparency, and compositionality, while computational
datasets support tasks like idiomaticity detection/classification,
paraphrasing, and cross-lingual modeling. We present trends in annotation
practices, coverage, and task framing across 53 datasets. Although recent
efforts expanded language coverage and task diversity, there seems to be no
relation yet between psycholinguistic and computational research on idioms.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种通过模拟生物节律（如月经周期和体残节律）来解决AI框架问题的新方法，在多个标准测试中证明了性能变化与生物期望相一致


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI系统面临的框架问题：如何从指数增长的可能性空间中确定上下文相关信息，受生物节律的启发

Method: 通过周期性函数模拟锦洪素、高嚼醇、皮质素等关键激素，将生物周期嵌入大语言模型的系统提示中

Result: 语言分析显示情感和风格变化跟踪生物阶段：悲伤在月经期达到高峰，幸福在排卵期占主导，体残节律显示早晨乐观向夜晚内省转变；在SQuAD、MMLU等测试中显示细微但一致的性能变化

Conclusion: 该方法为上下文AI提供了新题径，同时揭示了语言模型中嵌入的社会偏见，最佳性能出现在激素水平适中而非极端状态

Abstract: Despite significant advances, AI systems struggle with the frame problem:
determining what information is contextually relevant from an exponentially
large possibility space. We hypothesize that biological rhythms, particularly
hormonal cycles, serve as natural relevance filters that could address this
fundamental challenge. We develop a framework that embeds simulated menstrual
and circadian cycles into Large Language Models through system prompts
generated from periodic functions modeling key hormones including estrogen,
testosterone, and cortisol. Across multiple state-of-the-art models, linguistic
analysis reveals emotional and stylistic variations that track biological
phases; sadness peaks during menstruation while happiness dominates ovulation
and circadian patterns show morning optimism transitioning to nocturnal
introspection. Benchmarking on SQuAD, MMLU, Hellaswag, and AI2-ARC demonstrates
subtle but consistent performance variations aligning with biological
expectations, including optimal function in moderate rather than extreme
hormonal ranges. This methodology provides a novel approach to contextual AI
while revealing how societal biases regarding gender and biology are embedded
within language models.

*Julia Sammartino,Libby Barak,Jing Peng,Anna Feldman*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了通过跨语言转移的顺序微调对五种语言中韦言语检测的影响，发现先在高资源语言上微调再转移到低资源语言可显著提升性能，尤其是对于土耳其语和约鲁巴语。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 韦言语具有文化变异性和模糊性，给语言模型带来挑战，尤其在低资源环境中。需要探索如何通过跨语言转移来改善韦言语检测的性能。

Method: 采用XLM-R和mBERT模型，对比顺序微调、单语言微调和同时微调策略。分析语言对组、类型学特征和预训练覆盖对性能的影响。实验涵盖英语、西班牙语、中文、土耳其语和约鲁巴语五种语言。

Result: 顺序微调策略在低资源语言上显著提升性能，尤其是对于约鲁巴语和土耳其语。XLM-R获得更大收益但对预训练空白和灾难性遗忘更敏感，mBERT产生更稳定但较低的结果。

Conclusion: 顺序微调是一种简单但有效的策略，可显著改善多语言模型在韦言语检测任务中的表现，尤其在涉及低资源语言时。

Abstract: Euphemisms are culturally variable and often ambiguous, posing challenges for
language models, especially in low-resource settings. This paper investigates
how cross-lingual transfer via sequential fine-tuning affects euphemism
detection across five languages: English, Spanish, Chinese, Turkish, and
Yoruba. We compare sequential fine-tuning with monolingual and simultaneous
fine-tuning using XLM-R and mBERT, analyzing how performance is shaped by
language pairings, typological features, and pretraining coverage. Results show
that sequential fine-tuning with a high-resource L1 improves L2 performance,
especially for low-resource languages like Yoruba and Turkish. XLM-R achieves
larger gains but is more sensitive to pretraining gaps and catastrophic
forgetting, while mBERT yields more stable, though lower, results. These
findings highlight sequential fine-tuning as a simple yet effective strategy
for improving euphemism detection in multilingual models, particularly when
low-resource languages are involved.

TL;DR: SupraTok是一种新颖的分词架构，通过跨边界模式学习、熵驱动数据筛选和多阶段课程学习三大创新，显著提升分词效率31%，在保持38种语言竞争力的同时，在GPT-2规模模型上带来8.4-9.5%的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分词作为NLP中的基础但未被充分探索的瓶颈，其策略在模型架构取得显著进展的同时仍保持静态，需要重新思考子词分割方法。

Method: 基于字节对编码扩展，学习"超词"标记（连贯的多词表达式），包含跨边界模式学习发现多词语义单元、熵驱动数据优化训练语料质量、多阶段课程学习确保稳定收敛。

Result: 英语分词效率提升31%（5.91 vs 4.51字符/标记），优于OpenAI o200k和Google Gemma 3分词器；在124M参数GPT-2模型上，HellaSWAG提升8.4%，MMLU提升9.5%。

Conclusion: 高效分词可以作为架构创新的补充路径来提升语言模型性能，但在更大规模模型上需要进一步验证。

Abstract: Tokenization remains a fundamental yet underexplored bottleneck in natural
language processing, with strategies largely static despite remarkable progress
in model architectures. We present SupraTok, a novel tokenization architecture
that reimagines subword segmentation through three innovations: cross-boundary
pattern learning that discovers multi-word semantic units, entropy-driven data
curation that optimizes training corpus quality, and multi-phase curriculum
learning for stable convergence. Our approach extends Byte-Pair Encoding by
learning "superword" tokens, coherent multi-word expressions that preserve
semantic unity while maximizing compression efficiency. SupraTok achieves 31%
improvement in English tokenization efficiency (5.91 versus 4.51 characters per
token) compared to OpenAI's o200k tokenizer and 30% improvement over Google's
Gemma 3 tokenizer (256k vocabulary), while maintaining competitive performance
across 38 languages. When integrated with a GPT-2 scale model (124M parameters)
trained on 10 billion tokens from the FineWeb-Edu dataset, SupraTok yields 8.4%
improvement on HellaSWAG and 9.5% on MMLU benchmarks without architectural
modifications. While these results are promising at this scale, further
validation at larger model scales is needed. These findings suggest that
efficient tokenization can complement architectural innovations as a path to
improved language model performance.

TL;DR: 提出InitERC，一种简单有效的一阶段上下文指令调优框架，用于对话情感识别，通过上下文学习实现说话人-上下文-情感的对齐


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多阶段指令调优方法无法联合捕捉说话人特征和对话上下文之间的动态交互，导致在统一框架内说话人身份、上下文线索和情感状态之间的对齐较弱

Method: 提出InitERC框架，包含四个组件：演示池构建、上下文示例选择、提示模板设计和上下文指令调优。通过上下文学习让大语言模型从上下文示例中学习说话人-上下文-情感对齐

Result: 在三个广泛使用的数据集上进行广泛实验，证明InitERC相比最先进的基线方法取得了显著改进

Conclusion: InitERC是一个简单而有效的单阶段框架，能够更好地实现说话人特征、上下文信息和情感状态之间的联合对齐

Abstract: Emotion recognition in conversation (ERC) aims to identify the emotion of
each utterance in a conversation, playing a vital role in empathetic artificial
intelligence. With the growing of large language models (LLMs), instruction
tuning has emerged as a critical paradigm for ERC. Existing studies mainly
focus on multi-stage instruction tuning, which first endows LLMs with speaker
characteristics, and then conducts context-aware instruction tuning to
comprehend emotional states. However, these methods inherently constrains the
capacity to jointly capture the dynamic interaction between speaker
characteristics and conversational context, resulting in weak alignment among
speaker identity, contextual cues, and emotion states within a unified
framework. In this paper, we propose InitERC, a simple yet effective one-stage
in-context instruction tuning framework for ERC. InitERC adapts LLMs to learn
speaker-context-emotion alignment from context examples via in-context
instruction tuning. Specifically, InitERC comprises four components, i.e.,
demonstration pool construction, in-context example selection, prompt template
design, and in-context instruction tuning. To explore the impact of in-context
examples, we conduct a comprehensive study on three key factors: retrieval
strategy, example ordering, and the number of examples. Extensive experiments
on three widely used datasets demonstrate that our proposed InitERC achieves
substantial improvements over the state-of-the-art baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前涉及大语言模型的多满气游戏理论交互很少有对语言多样性进行定量分析，需要一个统一的指标来评估语言使用的有效性和稳健性。

Method: 提出CORE指标，结合集群熵、词汇重复率和语义相似性进行综合评估。在竞争、合作和中立环境下进行双方LLM对话实验，并基于Zipf定律和Heaps定律分析词频分布和词汇增长。

Result: 合作环境显示出更激烈的Zipf分布和更高的Heaps指数（更多重复但词汇扩张），而竞争交互则显示更低的指数（更少重复但词汇受限）。

Conclusion: 社交激励影响语言适应能力，CORE指标可作为测量多满气LLM系统语言稳健性的精确诊断工具。

Abstract: Game-theoretic interactions between agents with Large Language Models (LLMs)
have revealed many emergent capabilities, yet the linguistic diversity of these
interactions has not been sufficiently quantified. In this paper, we present
the Conversational Robustness Evaluation Score: CORE, a metric to quantify the
effectiveness of language use within multi-agent systems across different
game-theoretic interactions. CORE integrates measures of cluster entropy,
lexical repetition, and semantic similarity, providing a direct lens of dialog
quality. We apply CORE to pairwise LLM dialogs across competitive, cooperative,
and neutral settings, further grounding our analysis in Zipf's and Heaps' Laws
to characterize word frequency distributions and vocabulary growth. Our
findings show that cooperative settings exhibit both steeper Zipf distributions
and higher Heap exponents, indicating more repetition alongside greater
vocabulary expansion. In contrast, competitive interactions display lower Zipf
and Heaps exponents, reflecting less repetition and more constrained
vocabularies. These results provide new insights into how social incentives
influence language adaptation, and highlight CORE as a robust diagnostic for
measuring linguistic robustness in multi-agent LLM systems. Our code is
available at https://github.com/psyonp/core.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 中文和日语缺乏像英语那样的明确完成体时态语法形式，这给自然语言推理(NLI)带来特别困难，需要研究模型在这些语言中的时态语义理解能力

Method: 构建语言学驱动的模板化NLI数据集，每种语言包含1,350对比语料，重点关注完成体的时态和参考时间移动

Result: 即使是先进的大语言模型也在时态推理上表现届粘，尤其在检测细微的时态和参考时间变化方面遇到困难

Conclusion: 研究曝露了模型在时态语义理解上的限制，强调了跨语言评估在时态语义领域的重要性，并提供了公开数据集以促进进一步研究

Abstract: Unlike English, which uses distinct forms (e.g., had, has, will have) to mark
the perfect aspect across tenses, Chinese and Japanese lack separate
grammatical forms for tense within the perfect aspect, which complicates
Natural Language Inference (NLI). Focusing on the perfect aspect in these
languages, we construct a linguistically motivated, template-based NLI dataset
(1,350 pairs per language). Experiments reveal that even advanced LLMs struggle
with temporal inference, particularly in detecting subtle tense and
reference-time shifts. These findings highlight model limitations and
underscore the need for cross-linguistic evaluation in temporal semantics. Our
dataset is available at https://github.com/Lujie2001/CrossNLI.

Result: 经验评估表明CAMF在零样本MGT检测方面显著超过了最先进的技术。

Conclusion: CAMF框架通过结构化的协同对抗过程，能够深入分析文本中细微的跨维度不一致性，为检测非人类生成文本提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Detecting machine-generated text (MGT) from contemporary Large Language
Models (LLMs) is increasingly crucial amid risks like disinformation and
threats to academic integrity. Existing zero-shot detection paradigms, despite
their practicality, often exhibit significant deficiencies. Key challenges
include: (1) superficial analyses focused on limited textual attributes, and
(2) a lack of investigation into consistency across linguistic dimensions such
as style, semantics, and logic. To address these challenges, we introduce the
\textbf{C}ollaborative \textbf{A}dversarial \textbf{M}ulti-agent
\textbf{F}ramework (\textbf{CAMF}), a novel architecture using multiple
LLM-based agents. CAMF employs specialized agents in a synergistic three-phase
process: \emph{Multi-dimensional Linguistic Feature Extraction},
\emph{Adversarial Consistency Probing}, and \emph{Synthesized Judgment
Aggregation}. This structured collaborative-adversarial process enables a deep
analysis of subtle, cross-dimensional textual incongruities indicative of
non-human origin. Empirical evaluations demonstrate CAMF's significant
superiority over state-of-the-art zero-shot MGT detection techniques.

TL;DR: 一种基于指令的持续对比调节方法，通过分析错误案例来改善大语言模型在持续关系提取中的认知偏差，并减轻恐怖忘记问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的持续关系提取方法主要使用内存重放和对比学习，但忽视了错误案例的重要性，而错误案例能更有效地揭示模型的认知偏差

Method: 将每个任务的训练和内存数据根据初始响应的正确性分为两部分，通过双任务精调不同处理。利用LLM的指令跟随能力，提出基于指令的对比调节策略，持续纠正当前认知偏差

Result: 在TACRED和FewRel数据集上进行实验评估，结果显示该模型实现了新的最高水平持续关系提取性能，有显著收益

Conclusion: 专门利用错误案例的方法在持续关系提取中具有重要价值，通过分析和纠正错误能有效减轻恐怖忘记问题

Abstract: Continual Relation Extraction (CRE) aims to continually learn new emerging
relations while avoiding catastrophic forgetting. Existing CRE methods mainly
use memory replay and contrastive learning to mitigate catastrophic forgetting.
However, these methods do not attach importance to the error cases that can
reveal the model's cognitive biases more effectively. To address this issue, we
propose an instruction-based continual contrastive tuning approach for Large
Language Models (LLMs) in CRE. Different from existing CRE methods that
typically handle the training and memory data in a unified manner, this
approach splits the training and memory data of each task into two parts
respectively based on the correctness of the initial responses and treats them
differently through dual-task fine-tuning. In addition, leveraging the
advantages of LLM's instruction-following ability, we propose a novel
instruction-based contrastive tuning strategy for LLM to continuously correct
current cognitive biases with the guidance of previous data in an
instruction-tuning manner, which mitigates the gap between old and new
relations in a more suitable way for LLMs. We experimentally evaluate our model
on TACRED and FewRel, and the results show that our model achieves new
state-of-the-art CRE performance with significant improvements, demonstrating
the importance of specializing in exploiting error cases.

TL;DR: FineCE是一种新颖的细粒度置信度估计方法，通过监督学习训练模型来预测文本生成过程中的连续置信度分数，解决了LLM过度自信的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型缺乏自我意识，经常对错误预测给出高置信度分数，现有方法无法提供生成过程中的细粒度连续置信度估计。

Method: 开发数据构建管道捕捉LLM响应的概率分布，监督训练置信度预测模型，提出后向置信度集成策略和三种最优位置识别策略。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，FineCE始终优于现有的经典置信度估计方法。

Conclusion: FineCE提供准确、细粒度的置信度分数，显著提升了LLM输出的可信度和可靠性。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance
across diverse tasks, they fundamentally lack self-awareness and frequently
exhibit overconfidence, assigning high confidence scores to incorrect
predictions. Accurate confidence estimation is therefore critical for enhancing
the trustworthiness and reliability of LLM-generated outputs. However, existing
approaches suffer from coarse-grained scoring mechanisms that fail to provide
fine-grained, continuous confidence estimates throughout the generation
process. To address these limitations, we introduce FineCE, a novel confidence
estimation method that delivers accurate, fine-grained confidence scores during
text generation. Specifically, we first develop a comprehensive pipeline for
constructing training data that effectively captures the underlying
probabilistic distribution of LLM responses, and then train a model to predict
confidence scores for arbitrary text sequences in a supervised manner.
Furthermore, we propose a Backward Confidence Integration (BCI) strategy that
leverages information from the subsequent text to enhance confidence estimation
for the current sequence during inference. We also introduce three strategies
for identifying optimal positions to perform confidence estimation within the
generation process. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets
demonstrate that FineCE consistently outperforms existing classical confidence
estimation methods. Our code and all baselines used in the paper are available
on GitHub.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多目标优化方法依赖标量梯度聚合，忽略了目标与参数间的几何结构关系，难以有效平衡事实性提升和置信度增加等冲突目标

Method: 提出J6结构化雅可比方法，将梯度交互矩阵分解为六个可解释组件，支持硬决策（argmax选择主导方向）和软策略（softmax注意力加权）的动态更新框架

Result: 该方法提供了参数归因、任务干扰和几何对齐适应的可解释性洞察，形成了冲突感知的提示优化机制

Conclusion: J6为多目标神经调优引入了结构化雅可比推理的新途径，提供了原则性和可扩展的优化框架

Abstract: In large language model (LLM) adaptation, balancing multiple optimization
objectives such as improving factuality (heat) and increasing confidence (via
low entropy) poses a fundamental challenge, especially when prompt parameters
(e.g., hidden-layer insertions h and embedding modifications w) interact in
non-trivial ways. Existing multi-objective optimization strategies often rely
on scalar gradient aggregation, ignoring the deeper geometric structure between
objectives and parameters. We propose J6, a structured Jacobian-based method
that decomposes the gradient interaction matrix into six interpretable
components. This decomposition enables both hard decision-making (e.g.,
choosing the dominant update direction via argmax) and soft strategies (e.g.,
attention-style weighting via softmax over J6), forming a dynamic update
framework that adapts to local conflict and synergy. Moreover, the
interpretable structure of J6 provides insight into parameter attribution, task
interference, and geometry-aligned adaptation. Our work introduces a principled
and extensible mechanism for conflict-aware prompt optimization, and opens a
new avenue for incorporating structured Jacobian reasoning into multi-objective
neural tuning.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型能力快速提升，传统基准测试面临过拟合、计算成本高、难以区分模型真实能力差异等问题，需要更有效的评估方法

Method: 提出STEM框架，通过分析同架构不同参数规模模型的性能转换来识别显著转换样本(STS)，用这些样本来估计未知模型的能力位置

Result: 在六个多样化基准测试上应用Qwen3模型族构建STS池，实验表明STEM能可靠捕捉性能趋势，与真实模型能力排名一致

Conclusion: STEM是一种实用且可扩展的细粒度、架构无关的LLM评估方法，能有效解决当前评估面临的挑战

Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) has become increasingly challenging
as model capabilities advance rapidly. While recent models often achieve higher
scores on standard benchmarks, these improvements do not consistently reflect
enhanced real-world reasoning capabilities. Moreover, widespread overfitting to
public benchmarks and the high computational cost of full evaluations have made
it both expensive and less effective to distinguish meaningful differences
between models. To address these challenges, we propose the \textbf{S}tructured
\textbf{T}ransition \textbf{E}valuation \textbf{M}ethod (STEM), a lightweight
and interpretable evaluation framework for efficiently estimating the relative
capabilities of LLMs. STEM identifies \textit{significant transition samples}
(STS) by analyzing consistent performance transitions among LLMs of the same
architecture but varying parameter scales. These samples enable STEM to
effectively estimate the capability position of an unknown model. Qwen3 model
family is applied to construct the STS pool on six diverse and representative
benchmarks. To assess generalizability. Experimental results indicate that STEM
reliably captures performance trends, aligns with ground-truth rankings of
model capability. These findings highlight STEM as a practical and scalable
method for fine-grained, architecture-agnostic evaluation of LLMs.

TL;DR: 这研究首次系统评估医学推理任务中的思维预算机制，发现计算资源与推理质量间存在基本的缩放律关系，并确定了三种效率模式和预测性推理改善模式。


<details>

Motivation: 为了解决医学AI系统在临床部署中的计算资源优化问题，并探索思维预算机制如何动态分配资源以满足不同临床需求，同时保持透明性。

Method: 系统性评估Qwen3(1.7B-235B)和DeepSeek-R1(1.5B-70B)两大模型家族，涉及15个不同专业和难度级别的医学数据集，通过控制思维预算从零到无限令片的实验来分析缩放关系。

Result: 发现准确率改善与思维预算和模型大小存在对数缩放关系；识别了高效率(0-256令片)、平衡(256-512令片)和高准确率(超过512令片)三种模式；小模型从扩展思维中获益更大(15-20% vs 5-10%)；不同医学专业需要不同深度的推理过程。

Conclusion: 思维预算控制是优化医学AI系统的关键机制，允许根据临床需求动态分配资源，同时保持透明性，为医疗健康部署提供重要支撑。

Abstract: This study presents the first comprehensive evaluation of thinking budget
mechanisms in medical reasoning tasks, revealing fundamental scaling laws
between computational resources and reasoning quality. We systematically
evaluated two major model families, Qwen3 (1.7B to 235B parameters) and
DeepSeek-R1 (1.5B to 70B parameters), across 15 medical datasets spanning
diverse specialties and difficulty levels. Through controlled experiments with
thinking budgets ranging from zero to unlimited tokens, we establish
logarithmic scaling relationships where accuracy improvements follow a
predictable pattern with both thinking budget and model size. Our findings
identify three distinct efficiency regimes: high-efficiency (0 to 256 tokens)
suitable for real-time applications, balanced (256 to 512 tokens) offering
optimal cost-performance tradeoffs for routine clinical support, and
high-accuracy (above 512 tokens) justified only for critical diagnostic tasks.
Notably, smaller models demonstrate disproportionately larger benefits from
extended thinking, with 15 to 20% improvements compared to 5 to 10% for larger
models, suggesting a complementary relationship where thinking budget provides
greater relative benefits for capacity-constrained models. Domain-specific
patterns emerge clearly, with neurology and gastroenterology requiring
significantly deeper reasoning processes than cardiovascular or respiratory
medicine. The consistency between Qwen3 native thinking budget API and our
proposed truncation method for DeepSeek-R1 validates the generalizability of
thinking budget concepts across architectures. These results establish thinking
budget control as a critical mechanism for optimizing medical AI systems,
enabling dynamic resource allocation aligned with clinical needs while
maintaining the transparency essential for healthcare deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 隐私保护NLP领域面临隐私准确评估的挑战，LLM在其他NLP子领域作为评估器的成功应用启发了本研究，探索LLM是否能有效评估文本数据的隐私敏感性。

Method: 采用LLM-as-a-Judge范式，在10个数据集上使用13个LLM模型，并与677名人类参与者的调查结果进行比较，分析人类与LLM的推理模式一致性。

Result: 研究发现隐私确实难以量化测量（人类间一致性较低），但LLM能够准确建模全局人类隐私视角，在隐私评估方面表现出与人类良好的对齐性。

Conclusion: LLM作为隐私评估器具有可行性，为通过创新技术解决方案解决紧迫隐私问题提供了新的途径，但需要进一步探讨其优点和局限性。

Abstract: Despite advances in the field of privacy-preserving Natural Language
Processing (NLP), a significant challenge remains the accurate evaluation of
privacy. As a potential solution, using LLMs as a privacy evaluator presents a
promising approach $\unicode{x2013}$ a strategy inspired by its success in
other subfields of NLP. In particular, the so-called $\textit{LLM-as-a-Judge}$
paradigm has achieved impressive results on a variety of natural language
evaluation tasks, demonstrating high agreement rates with human annotators.
Recognizing that privacy is both subjective and difficult to define, we
investigate whether LLM-as-a-Judge can also be leveraged to evaluate the
privacy sensitivity of textual data. Furthermore, we measure how closely LLM
evaluations align with human perceptions of privacy in text. Resulting from a
study involving 10 datasets, 13 LLMs, and 677 human survey participants, we
confirm that privacy is indeed a difficult concept to measure empirically,
exhibited by generally low inter-human agreement rates. Nevertheless, we find
that LLMs can accurately model a global human privacy perspective, and through
an analysis of human and LLM reasoning patterns, we discuss the merits and
limitations of LLM-as-a-Judge for privacy evaluation in textual data. Our
findings pave the way for exploring the feasibility of LLMs as privacy
evaluators, addressing a core challenge in solving pressing privacy issues with
innovative technical solutions.

Motivation: 东南亚地区语言在多语言嵌入模型评测中被忽视，现有数据集多为机器翻译且缺乏本土语言特性，需要专门评测框架

Method: 构建SEA-BED测试集，包含169个数据集、9种任务类型和10种东南亚语言，其中71%由人工编写。对17种嵌入模型进行六项实验分析

Result: 发现模型排名显著变化、东南亚语言间性能不一致、人工编写数据集对低资源语言(如缅甸语)评估至关重要

Conclusion: SEA-BED填补了东南亚语言嵌入模型评测的空白，证明了本土化数据集的重要性，为评估模型在真实场景下的表现提供了重要参考

Abstract: Sentence embeddings are essential for NLP tasks such as semantic search,
re-ranking, and textual similarity. Although multilingual benchmarks like MMTEB
broaden coverage, Southeast Asia (SEA) datasets are scarce and often
machine-translated, missing native linguistic properties. With nearly 700
million speakers, the SEA region lacks a region-specific embedding benchmark.
We introduce SEA-BED, the first large-scale SEA embedding benchmark with 169
datasets across 9 tasks and 10 languages, where 71% are formulated by humans,
not machine generation or translation. We address three research questions: (1)
which SEA languages and tasks are challenging, (2) whether SEA languages show
unique performance gaps globally, and (3) how human vs. machine translations
affect evaluation. We evaluate 17 embedding models across six studies,
analyzing task and language challenges, cross-benchmark comparisons, and
translation trade-offs. Results show sharp ranking shifts, inconsistent model
performance among SEA languages, and the importance of human-curated datasets
for low-resource languages like Burmese.

Abstract: Speech foundation models (SFMs) are designed to serve as general-purpose
representations for a wide range of speech-processing tasks. The last five
years have seen an influx of increasingly successful self-supervised and
supervised pre-trained models with impressive performance on various downstream
tasks.
  Although the zoo of SFMs continues to grow, our understanding of the
knowledge they acquire lags behind. This thesis presents a lightweight analysis
framework using statistical tools and training-free tasks to investigate the
acoustic and linguistic knowledge encoded in SFM layers. We conduct a
comparative study across multiple SFMs and statistical tools. Our study also
shows that the analytical insights have concrete implications for downstream
task performance.
  The effectiveness of an SFM is ultimately determined by its performance on
speech applications. Yet it remains unclear whether the benefits extend to
spoken language understanding (SLU) tasks that require a deeper understanding
than widely studied ones, such as speech recognition. The limited exploration
of SLU is primarily due to a lack of relevant datasets. To alleviate that, this
thesis contributes tasks, specifically spoken named entity recognition (NER)
and named entity localization (NEL), to the Spoken Language Understanding
Evaluation benchmark. We develop SFM-based approaches for NER and NEL, and find
that end-to-end (E2E) models leveraging SFMs can surpass traditional cascaded
(speech recognition followed by a text model) approaches. Further, we evaluate
E2E SLU models across SFMs and adaptation strategies to assess the impact on
task performance.
  Collectively, this thesis tackles previously unanswered questions about SFMs,
providing tools and datasets to further our understanding and to enable the
community to make informed design choices for future model development and
adoption.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in
reasoning across diverse domains. However, effective reasoning in real-world
tasks requires adapting the reasoning strategy to the demands of the problem,
ranging from fast, intuitive responses to deliberate, step-by-step reasoning
and tool-augmented thinking. Drawing inspiration from cognitive psychology, we
propose a novel taxonomy of LLM reasoning strategies along two knowledge
boundaries: a fast/slow boundary separating intuitive from deliberative
processes, and an internal/external boundary distinguishing reasoning grounded
in the model's parameters from reasoning augmented by external tools. We
systematically survey recent work on adaptive reasoning in LLMs and categorize
methods based on key decision factors. We conclude by highlighting open
challenges and future directions toward more adaptive, efficient, and reliable
LLMs.

Motivation: 探索不同于传统知识或推理能力评估的新方法，测试LLM是否能预测自身响应的特性，如问题难度、拒绝回答倾向、可能产生的关联等。

Method: 引入自我执行基准测试（Self-Execution Benchmark），通过设计实验让模型预测其输出的各种属性，而不是直接执行任务。

Result: 实验表明模型在该基准测试上普遍表现较差，模型规模增大或能力提升并不能带来一致的性能改善。

Conclusion: 这些结果揭示了LLM在表示和推理自身行为方面存在根本性局限，表明当前模型缺乏对自身输出的准确预测能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are commonly evaluated on tasks that test their
knowledge or reasoning abilities. In this paper, we explore a different type of
evaluation: whether an LLM can predict aspects of its own responses. Since LLMs
lack the ability to execute themselves, we introduce the Self-Execution
Benchmark, which measures a model's ability to anticipate properties of its
output, such as whether a question will be difficult for it, whether it will
refuse to answer, or what kinds of associations it is likely to produce. Our
experiments show that models generally perform poorly on this benchmark, and
that increased model size or capability does not consistently lead to better
performance. These results suggest a fundamental limitation in how LLMs
represent and reason about their own behavior.

Conclusion: Legal∆框架能够有效提升法律LLM的推理能力，产生更可靠和可解释的法律判断，而无需标签偏好数据。

Abstract: Legal Artificial Intelligence (LegalAI) has achieved notable advances in
automating judicial decision-making with the support of Large Language Models
(LLMs). However, existing legal LLMs still struggle to generate reliable and
interpretable reasoning processes. They often default to fast-thinking behavior
by producing direct answers without explicit multi-step reasoning, limiting
their effectiveness in complex legal scenarios that demand rigorous
justification. To address this challenge, we propose Legal$\Delta$, a
reinforcement learning framework designed to enhance legal reasoning through
chain-of-thought guided information gain. During training, Legal$\Delta$
employs a dual-mode input setup-comprising direct answer and
reasoning-augmented modes-and maximizes the information gain between them. This
encourages the model to acquire meaningful reasoning patterns rather than
generating superficial or redundant explanations. Legal$\Delta$ follows a
two-stage approach: (1) distilling latent reasoning capabilities from a
powerful Large Reasoning Model (LRM), DeepSeek-R1, and (2) refining reasoning
quality via differential comparisons, combined with a multidimensional reward
mechanism that assesses both structural coherence and legal-domain specificity.
Experimental results on multiple legal reasoning tasks demonstrate that
Legal$\Delta$ outperforms strong baselines in both accuracy and
interpretability. It consistently produces more robust and trustworthy legal
judgments without relying on labeled preference data. All code and data will be
released at https://github.com/NEUIR/LegalDelta.

Abstract: We introduce ChronoQA, a large-scale benchmark dataset for Chinese question
answering, specifically designed to evaluate temporal reasoning in
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. ChronoQA is constructed from over
300,000 news articles published between 2019 and 2024, and contains 5,176
high-quality questions covering absolute, aggregate, and relative temporal
types with both explicit and implicit time expressions. The dataset supports
both single- and multi-document scenarios, reflecting the real-world
requirements for temporal alignment and logical consistency. ChronoQA features
comprehensive structural annotations and has undergone multi-stage validation,
including rule-based, LLM-based, and human evaluation, to ensure data quality.
By providing a dynamic, reliable, and scalable resource, ChronoQA enables
structured evaluation across a wide range of temporal tasks, and serves as a
robust benchmark for advancing time-sensitive retrieval-augmented question
answering systems.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种融合法律逻辑的深度学习模型MT-DT，用于初步预测，解决了现有智能司法辅助系统缺乏专门方法的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有智能司法辅助系统缺乏专门的初步预测方法，且大多数研究仅依靠数据驱动而忽视了司法决策的法律逻辑基础。初步评定需要综合分析犯罪情节和悔罪表现。

Method: 通过三个阶段实现：1）构建包含事实描述和初步法律要素的专门数据集；2）设计基于初步法律逻辑和《双轨制惩罚理论》的多任务双理论初步预测模型MT-DT；3）实验验证模型效果。

Result: 实验结果显示MT-DT模型在初步数据集上表现超过基线模型，并通过法律逻辑分析证明了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 本研究成功将法律逻辑融入深度学习模型，为初步预测提供了更加合理和可解释的方法，补充了现有智能司法系统的空白。

Abstract: Probation is a crucial institution in modern criminal law, embodying the
principles of fairness and justice while contributing to the harmonious
development of society. Despite its importance, the current Intelligent
Judicial Assistant System (IJAS) lacks dedicated methods for probation
prediction, and research on the underlying factors influencing probation
eligibility remains limited. In addition, probation eligibility requires a
comprehensive analysis of both criminal circumstances and remorse. Much of the
existing research in IJAS relies primarily on data-driven methodologies, which
often overlooks the legal logic underpinning judicial decision-making. To
address this gap, we propose a novel approach that integrates legal logic into
deep learning models for probation prediction, implemented in three distinct
stages. First, we construct a specialized probation dataset that includes fact
descriptions and probation legal elements (PLEs). Second, we design a distinct
probation prediction model named the Multi-Task Dual-Theory Probation
Prediction Model (MT-DT), which is grounded in the legal logic of probation and
the \textit{Dual-Track Theory of Punishment}. Finally, our experiments on the
probation dataset demonstrate that the MT-DT model outperforms baseline models,
and an analysis of the underlying legal logic further validates the
effectiveness of the proposed approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的SOTA ASR模型如Whisper和Canary主要用于离线转写，无法用于流式（实时）转写，需要解决这个限制

Method: 通过LoRA细调和弱对齐数据集将非因果性编码器改造为因果性编码器，并提出更新的推理机制支持贪婪和检索解码

Result: 在小于300毫秒的低延迟分块大小下，细调模型在大多数情况下表现超过现有非细调流式方法，且复杂度更低，还能生成更好的对齐以提取词级时间戳

Conclusion: 该方法成功将Transformer编码器-解码器模型转换为高性能低延迟流式ASR模型，为流式ASR研究提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) has seen remarkable progress, with models
like OpenAI Whisper and NVIDIA Canary achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA)
performance in offline transcription. However, these models are not designed
for streaming (online or real-time) transcription, due to limitations in their
architecture and training methodology. We propose a method to turn the
transformer encoder-decoder model into a low-latency streaming model that is
careless about future context. We present an analysis explaining why it is not
straightforward to convert an encoder-decoder transformer to a low-latency
streaming model. Our proposed method modifies the existing (non-causal) encoder
to a causal encoder by fine-tuning both the encoder and decoder using Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) and a weakly aligned dataset. We then propose an updated
inference mechanism that utilizes the fine-tune causal encoder and decoder to
yield greedy and beam-search decoding, and is shown to be locally optimal.
Experiments on low-latency chunk sizes (less than 300 msec) show that our
fine-tuned model outperforms existing non-fine-tuned streaming approaches in
most cases, while using a lower complexity. Additionally, we observe that our
training process yields better alignment, enabling a simple method for
extracting word-level timestamps. We release our training and inference code,
along with the fine-tuned models, to support further research and development
in streaming ASR.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多答案问答任务中可能存在冲突答案，现有数据集构建成本高且多为合成数据，需要更现实的冲突感知基准来推动研究发展。

Method: 利用事实核查数据集构建NATCONFQA基准，要求模型不仅识别所有有效答案，还要检测特定的冲突答案对。

Result: 评估了8个高端大语言模型，揭示了它们在处理各类冲突时的脆弱性以及采用的错误解决策略。

Conclusion: 大语言模型在多答案冲突处理方面表现脆弱，需要开发更有效的冲突解决方法来提升模型性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in question
answering (QA) tasks. However, Multi-Answer Question Answering (MAQA), where a
question may have several valid answers, remains challenging. Traditional QA
settings often assume consistency across evidences, but MAQA can involve
conflicting answers. Constructing datasets that reflect such conflicts is
costly and labor-intensive, while existing benchmarks often rely on synthetic
data, restrict the task to yes/no questions, or apply unverified automated
annotation. To advance research in this area, we extend the conflict-aware MAQA
setting to require models not only to identify all valid answers, but also to
detect specific conflicting answer pairs, if any. To support this task, we
introduce a novel cost-effective methodology for leveraging fact-checking
datasets to construct NATCONFQA, a new benchmark for realistic, conflict-aware
MAQA, enriched with detailed conflict labels, for all answer pairs. We evaluate
eight high-end LLMs on NATCONFQA, revealing their fragility in handling various
types of conflicts and the flawed strategies they employ to resolve them.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小语言模型(SLMs)成本低但推理能力有限，现有方法往往在推理能力、自主性或泛化性方面存在妥协，需要一种综合解决方案。

Method: 提出ReaLM框架：1) MRPV对比正负推理路径提取关键模式；2) EAAI逐步减少外部信号依赖；3) 引导式思维链蒸馏编码领域知识。

Result: 在垂直领域和通用推理任务上的大量实验表明，ReaLM显著提升了SLMs在推理能力、自主性和泛化性三个方面的性能。

Conclusion: ReaLM为小语言模型提供了有效的强化学习框架，能够在不牺牲关键性能的前提下提升复杂推理能力，具有很好的应用前景。

Abstract: Small Language Models (SLMs) are a cost-effective alternative to Large
Language Models (LLMs), but often struggle with complex reasoning due to their
limited capacity and a tendency to produce mistakes or inconsistent answers
during multi-step reasoning. Existing efforts have improved SLM performance,
but typically at the cost of one or more of three key aspects: (1) reasoning
capability, due to biased supervision that filters out negative reasoning paths
and limits learning from errors; (2) autonomy, due to over-reliance on
externally generated reasoning signals; and (3) generalization, which suffers
when models overfit to teacher-specific patterns. In this paper, we introduce
ReaLM, a reinforcement learning framework for robust and self-sufficient
reasoning in vertical domains. To enhance reasoning capability, we propose
Multi-Route Process Verification (MRPV), which contrasts both positive and
negative reasoning paths to extract decisive patterns. To reduce reliance on
external guidance and improve autonomy, we introduce Enabling Autonomy via
Asymptotic Induction (EAAI), a training strategy that gradually fades external
signals. To improve generalization, we apply guided chain-of-thought
distillation to encode domain-specific rules and expert knowledge into SLM
parameters, making them part of what the model has learned. Extensive
experiments on both vertical and general reasoning tasks demonstrate that ReaLM
significantly improves SLM performance across aspects (1)-(3) above.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The rapid expansion of medical literature presents growing challenges for
structuring and integrating domain knowledge at scale. Knowledge Graphs (KGs)
offer a promising solution by enabling efficient retrieval, automated
reasoning, and knowledge discovery. However, current KG construction methods
often rely on supervised pipelines with limited generalizability or naively
aggregate outputs from Large Language Models (LLMs), treating biomedical
corpora as static and ignoring the temporal dynamics and contextual uncertainty
of evolving knowledge. To address these limitations, we introduce MedKGent, a
LLM agent framework for constructing temporally evolving medical KGs.
Leveraging over 10 million PubMed abstracts published between 1975 and 2023, we
simulate the emergence of biomedical knowledge via a fine-grained daily time
series. MedKGent incrementally builds the KG in a day-by-day manner using two
specialized agents powered by the Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct model. The Extractor
Agent identifies knowledge triples and assigns confidence scores via
sampling-based estimation, which are used to filter low-confidence extractions
and inform downstream processing. The Constructor Agent incrementally
integrates the retained triples into a temporally evolving graph, guided by
confidence scores and timestamps to reinforce recurring knowledge and resolve
conflicts. The resulting KG contains 156,275 entities and 2,971,384 relational
triples. Quality assessments by two SOTA LLMs and three domain experts
demonstrate an accuracy approaching 90\%, with strong inter-rater agreement. To
evaluate downstream utility, we conduct RAG across seven medical question
answering benchmarks using five leading LLMs, consistently observing
significant improvements over non-augmented baselines. Case studies further
demonstrate the KG's value in literature-based drug repurposing via
confidence-aware causal inference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: COVID-19后遗症(PASC)的诊断面临挑战，因为其症状多样且在长期间内变化。需要一种准确有效的方法来从临床记录中提取相关症状信息。

Method: 开发了混合NLP流程，结合规则基的名称实体识别和BERT基于的断言检测模块，使用专业医生开发的PASC词典。从美国11个健康系统收集160份进度记录用于模型开发和评估，47,654份用于人群预估研究。

Result: 断言检测在内部验证平均F1分数0.82，外部验证0.76。每份记录处理时间平均2.448秒。Spearman相关测试显示阳性提及相关系数ρ>0.83，阴性提及ρ>0.72，均显著性P<0.0001。

Conclusion: 该混合NLP流程在提取PASC症状方面显示出高效和高效率，为改善PASC诊断提供了潜力。

Abstract: Accurately and efficiently diagnosing Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC)
remains challenging due to its myriad symptoms that evolve over long- and
variable-time intervals. To address this issue, we developed a hybrid natural
language processing pipeline that integrates rule-based named entity
recognition with BERT-based assertion detection modules for PASC-symptom
extraction and assertion detection from clinical notes. We developed a
comprehensive PASC lexicon with clinical specialists. From 11 health systems of
the RECOVER initiative network across the U.S., we curated 160 intake progress
notes for model development and evaluation, and collected 47,654 progress notes
for a population-level prevalence study. We achieved an average F1 score of
0.82 in one-site internal validation and 0.76 in 10-site external validation
for assertion detection. Our pipeline processed each note at $2.448\pm 0.812$
seconds on average. Spearman correlation tests showed $\rho >0.83$ for positive
mentions and $\rho >0.72$ for negative ones, both with $P <0.0001$. These
demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our models and their potential
for improving PASC diagnosis.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ZigzagAttention通过改进检索头和流式头的识别标准，将同一层中的注意力头统一为单一类型，从而在减少KV缓存内存占用的同时避免了额外的延迟开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型处理长上下文需求增加，KV缓存的内存消耗成为部署瓶颈。现有方法通过区分重要检索头和不重要流式头来优化内存，但混合头类型在同一层会导致额外的张量访问和索引延迟。

Method: 设计新的识别标准，强制同一层中的所有注意力头要么都是检索头，要么都是流式头，避免混合类型带来的计算碎片化和额外延迟。

Result: ZigzagAttention在减少延迟的同时保持了可比的性能，在基准测试中表现竞争力。

Conclusion: 通过统一层内注意力头类型的方法，可以有效优化长上下文处理的KV缓存内存消耗，同时避免额外的延迟开销，实现部署效率的提升。

Abstract: With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), handling long
context has become one of the vital abilities in LLMs. Such long-context
ability is accompanied by difficulties in deployment, especially due to the
increased consumption of KV cache. There is certain work aiming to optimize the
memory footprint of KV cache, inspired by the observation that attention heads
can be categorized into retrieval heads that are of great significance and
streaming heads that are of less significance. Typically, identifying the
streaming heads and and waiving the KV cache in the streaming heads would
largely reduce the overhead without hurting the performance that much. However,
since employing both retrieval and streaming heads in one layer decomposes one
large round of attention computation into two small ones, it may unexpectedly
bring extra latency on accessing and indexing tensors. Based on this intuition,
we impose an important improvement to the identification process of retrieval
and streaming heads, in which we design a criterion that enforces exclusively
retrieval or streaming heads gathered in one unique layer. In this way, we
further eliminate the extra latency and only incur negligible performance
degradation. Our method named \textsc{ZigzagAttention} is competitive among
considered baselines owing to reduced latency and comparable performance.

TL;DR: 这篇论文通过文化探针数据集分析了GPT-4和ERNIE Bot在个人主义-集体主义和权力距离两个文化维度上的显著差异，发现大语言模型具有特定的文化偏向性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大语言模型在全球部署，但其基础文化和伦理偏向很少被深入研究。研究者想要探索LLMs如何从训练语料中继承系统性价值观对其输出的影响。

Method: 构建了文化探针数据集(CPD)包含200个提示，重点考察个人主义-集体主义(IDV)和权力距离(PDI)两个经典跨文化维度。使用标准化零样本提示比较西方中心模型(GPT-4)和东方中心模型(ERNIE Bot)。

Result: 发现GPT-4呈现个人主义和低权力距离倾向(IDV约1.21；PDI约-1.05)，而ERNIE Bot呈现集体主义和较高权力距离倾向(IDV约-0.89；PDI约0.76)，差异显著(p < 0.001)。与Hofstede国家分数对比显示GPT-4更接近美国倾向，ERNIE Bot更接近中国倾向。

Conclusion: 大语言模型作为其训练语料库的统计性镜像，具有特定的文化偏向性。这为文化意识评估和部署提供了动力，以避免算法文化霸权。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are deployed globally, yet their underlying
cultural and ethical assumptions remain underexplored. We propose the notion of
a "cultural gene" -- a systematic value orientation that LLMs inherit from
their training corpora -- and introduce a Cultural Probe Dataset (CPD) of 200
prompts targeting two classic cross-cultural dimensions:
Individualism-Collectivism (IDV) and Power Distance (PDI). Using standardized
zero-shot prompts, we compare a Western-centric model (GPT-4) and an
Eastern-centric model (ERNIE Bot). Human annotation shows significant and
consistent divergence across both dimensions. GPT-4 exhibits individualistic
and low-power-distance tendencies (IDV score approx 1.21; PDI score approx
-1.05), while ERNIE Bot shows collectivistic and higher-power-distance
tendencies (IDV approx -0.89; PDI approx 0.76); differences are statistically
significant (p < 0.001). We further compute a Cultural Alignment Index (CAI)
against Hofstede's national scores and find GPT-4 aligns more closely with the
USA (e.g., IDV CAI approx 0.91; PDI CAI approx 0.88) whereas ERNIE Bot aligns
more closely with China (IDV CAI approx 0.85; PDI CAI approx 0.81). Qualitative
analyses of dilemma resolution and authority-related judgments illustrate how
these orientations surface in reasoning. Our results support the view that LLMs
function as statistical mirrors of their cultural corpora and motivate
culturally aware evaluation and deployment to avoid algorithmic cultural
hegemony.

Conclusion: 该研究为理解LLM如何通过上下文学习掌握复杂概念提供了新的案例研究，扩展了对LLM学习机制的认知

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive in-context learning (ICL)
abilities, enabling them to solve wide range of tasks via textual prompts
alone. As these capabilities advance, the range of applicable domains continues
to expand significantly. However, identifying the precise mechanisms or
internal structures within LLMs that allow successful ICL across diverse,
distinct classes of tasks remains elusive. Physics-based tasks offer a
promising testbed for probing this challenge. Unlike synthetic sequences such
as basic arithmetic or symbolic equations, physical systems provide
experimentally controllable, real-world data based on structured dynamics
grounded in fundamental principles. This makes them particularly suitable for
studying the emergent reasoning behaviors of LLMs in a realistic yet tractable
setting. Here, we mechanistically investigate the ICL ability of LLMs,
especially focusing on their ability to reason about physics. Using a dynamics
forecasting task in physical systems as a proxy, we evaluate whether LLMs can
learn physics in context. We first show that the performance of dynamics
forecasting in context improves with longer input contexts. To uncover how such
capability emerges in LLMs, we analyze the model's residual stream activations
using sparse autoencoders (SAEs). Our experiments reveal that the features
captured by SAEs correlate with key physical variables, such as energy. These
findings demonstrate that meaningful physical concepts are encoded within LLMs
during in-context learning. In sum, our work provides a novel case study that
broadens our understanding of how LLMs learn in context.

Conclusion: M3PO提供了一种数据高效的方法，能够在不依赖高成本人工注释的情况下，通过智能选择关键的难以匹配的负面样本对，有效提升大视觉-语言模型的多模态指令追随能力

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) hold immense potential for complex
multimodal instruction following, yet their development is often hindered by
the high cost and inconsistency of human annotation required for effective
fine-tuning and preference alignment. Traditional supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
and existing preference optimization methods like RLHF and DPO frequently
struggle to efficiently leverage the model's own generation space to identify
highly informative "hard negative" samples. To address these challenges, we
propose Multimodal-Model-Guided Preference Optimization (M3PO), a novel and
data-efficient method designed to enhance LVLMs' capabilities in visual
instruction following. M3PO intelligently selects the most "learning-valuable"
preference sample pairs from a diverse pool of LVLM-generated candidates. This
selection is driven by a sophisticated mechanism that integrates two crucial
signals: a Multimodal Alignment Score (MAS) to assess external quality and the
model's Self-Consistency / Confidence (log-probability) to gauge internal
belief. These are combined into a novel M3P-Score, which specifically
identifies preferred responses and challenging dispreferred responses that the
model might confidently generate despite being incorrect. These high-quality
preference pairs are then used for efficient Direct Preference Optimization
(DPO) fine-tuning on base LVLMs like LLaVA-1.5 (7B/13B) using LoRA. Our
extensive experiments demonstrate that M3PO consistently outperforms strong
baselines, including SFT, simulated RLHF, vanilla DPO, and RM-DPO, across a
comprehensive suite of multimodal instruction following benchmarks (MME-Bench,
POPE, IFT, Human Pref. Score).

Motivation: 印尼作为世界人口大国，拥有700种语言，但在NLP领域进展滞后，需要专门的基准测试来评估低资源语言处理能力。

Method: 构建LoraxBench基准，涵盖阅读理解、开放域QA、语言推理、因果推理、翻译和文化QA等6个任务，覆盖20种语言，包含两种语域变体。评估多种多语言和区域专用LLM。

Result: 基准测试具有挑战性，印尼语与其他低资源语言性能存在明显差距，区域专用模型相比通用多语言模型没有明显优势，语域变化（如高级礼貌的Krama爪哇语）显著影响模型性能。

Conclusion: 印尼低资源语言NLP仍面临重大挑战，需要更多针对性的研究和模型优化，特别是在处理不同语域和方言变体方面。

Abstract: As one of the world's most populous countries, with 700 languages spoken,
Indonesia is behind in terms of NLP progress. We introduce LoraxBench, a
benchmark that focuses on low-resource languages of Indonesia and covers 6
diverse tasks: reading comprehension, open-domain QA, language inference,
causal reasoning, translation, and cultural QA. Our dataset covers 20
languages, with the addition of two formality registers for three languages. We
evaluate a diverse set of multilingual and region-focused LLMs and found that
this benchmark is challenging. We note a visible discrepancy between
performance in Indonesian and other languages, especially the low-resource
ones. There is no clear lead when using a region-specific model as opposed to
the general multilingual model. Lastly, we show that a change in register
affects model performance, especially with registers not commonly found in

Method: 使用10个基准测试（包括通用知识、数学推理、代码生成等）评估6个开源大语言模型（14.7B-235B参数），采用标准化推理设置和McNemar检验进行统计验证。

Result: GPT-OSS-20B在HumanEval和MMLU等多个基准上表现优于GPT-OSS-120B，内存和能耗更低；两个模型在开源模型中处于中游水平，代码生成较强但多语言能力较弱。

Conclusion: 稀疏架构的扩展不一定带来性能的线性提升，需要进一步研究优化策略，为未来开源部署提供更高效的模型选择指导。

Abstract: In August 2025, OpenAI released GPT-OSS models, its first open weight large
language models since GPT-2 in 2019, comprising two mixture of experts
architectures with 120B and 20B parameters. We evaluated both variants against
six contemporary open source large language models ranging from 14.7B to 235B
parameters, representing both dense and sparse designs, across ten benchmarks
covering general knowledge, mathematical reasoning, code generation,
multilingual understanding, and conversational ability. All models were tested
in unquantised form under standardised inference settings, with statistical
validation using McNemars test and effect size analysis. Results show that
gpt-oss-20B consistently outperforms gpt-oss-120B on several benchmarks, such
as HumanEval and MMLU, despite requiring substantially less memory and energy
per response. Both models demonstrate mid-tier overall performance within the
current open source landscape, with relative strength in code generation and
notable weaknesses in multilingual tasks. These findings provide empirical
evidence that scaling in sparse architectures may not yield proportional
performance gains, underscoring the need for further investigation into
optimisation strategies and informing more efficient model selection for future
open source deployments.

Motivation: 检验大语言模型是否也像儿童一样通过语法环境来学习动词含义（语法启动假设），以扩大发育语言学研究的实验规模。

Method: 训练RoBERTa和GPT-2模型，使用经过语法信息或共现信息正则化的数据集，比较模型表征的退化程度。

Result: 移除语法线索导致动词表征更大退化，尤其是心理动词；而名词表征更受共现信息影响。

Conclusion: 证实了语法启动在动词学习中的关键作用，并为使用大语言模型大规模测试发育假设提供了可行性。

Abstract: Syntactic bootstrapping (Gleitman, 1990) is the hypothesis that children use
the syntactic environments in which a verb occurs to learn its meaning. In this
paper, we examine whether large language models exhibit a similar behavior. We
do this by training RoBERTa and GPT-2 on perturbed datasets where syntactic
information is ablated. Our results show that models' verb representation
degrades more when syntactic cues are removed than when co-occurrence
information is removed. Furthermore, the representation of mental verbs, for
which syntactic bootstrapping has been shown to be particularly crucial in
human verb learning, is more negatively impacted in such training regimes than
physical verbs. In contrast, models' representation of nouns is affected more
when co-occurrences are distorted than when syntax is distorted. In addition to
reinforcing the important role of syntactic bootstrapping in verb learning, our
results demonstrated the viability of testing developmental hypotheses on a
larger scale through manipulating the learning environments of large language
models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM推理方法（如CoT）在语言token层面操作，无法建模变量间的因果关系和条件独立性，导致逻辑不一致的幻觉问题

Method: 监督微调框架CDCR-SFT，训练LLM显式构建变量级有向无环图（DAG）并在图上进行推理，同时创建了包含25,368样本的CausalDR数据集

Result: 在8个任务上实验显示，CDCR-SFT在CLADDER上达到95.33%准确率（首次超越人类94.8%），在HaluEval上减少10%的幻觉

Conclusion: LLM中显式因果结构建模能有效缓解输出中的逻辑不一致问题

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit logically inconsistent hallucinations
that appear coherent yet violate reasoning principles, with recent research
suggesting an inverse relationship between causal reasoning capabilities and
such hallucinations. However, existing reasoning approaches in LLMs, such as
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and its graph-based variants, operate at the linguistic
token level rather than modeling the underlying causal relationships between
variables, lacking the ability to represent conditional independencies or
satisfy causal identification assumptions. To bridge this gap, we introduce
causal-DAG construction and reasoning (CDCR-SFT), a supervised fine-tuning
framework that trains LLMs to explicitly construct variable-level directed
acyclic graph (DAG) and then perform reasoning over it. Moreover, we present a
dataset comprising 25,368 samples (CausalDR), where each sample includes an
input question, explicit causal DAG, graph-based reasoning trace, and validated
answer. Experiments on four LLMs across eight tasks show that CDCR-SFT improves
the causal reasoning capability with the state-of-the-art 95.33% accuracy on
CLADDER (surpassing human performance of 94.8% for the first time) and reduces
the hallucination on HaluEval with 10% improvements. It demonstrates that
explicit causal structure modeling in LLMs can effectively mitigate logical
inconsistencies in LLM outputs. Code is available at

TL;DR: 通过相关性分析选择SAE特征的新方法CorrSteer，可在推理时使用少量样本自动化实现任务指导，在多个任务上取得显著性能提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决稀疏自编码器(SAE)在下游指导任务中需要对比数据集或大量激活值存储的限制

Method: 通过相关样本正确性与SAE激活值来选择特征，仅使用推理时激活值提取更相关特征，避免偏偏相关，并从平均激活值获取指导系数

Result: 在Gemma 2 2B和LLaMA 3.1 8B模型上，问答、偏见减缓、防止盗窃和推理测试中显著提升，MMLU性能提升+4.1%，HarmBench提升+22.9%（仅需4000样本）

Conclusion: 相关基选择是一种高效可扩展的自动化SAE指导方法，选择的特征显示了与任务要求一致的语义模式

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) can extract interpretable features from large
language models (LLMs) without supervision. However, their effectiveness in
downstream steering tasks is limited by the requirement for contrastive
datasets or large activation storage. To address these limitations, we propose
CorrSteer, which selects features by correlating sample correctness with SAE
activations from generated tokens at inference time. This approach uses only
inference-time activations to extract more relevant features, thereby avoiding
spurious correlations. It also obtains steering coefficients from average
activations, automating the entire pipeline. Our method shows improved task
performance on QA, bias mitigation, jailbreaking prevention, and reasoning
benchmarks on Gemma 2 2B and LLaMA 3.1 8B, notably achieving a +4.1%
improvement in MMLU performance and a +22.9% improvement in HarmBench with only
4000 samples. Selected features demonstrate semantically meaningful patterns
aligned with each task's requirements, revealing the underlying capabilities
that drive performance. Our work establishes correlationbased selection as an
effective and scalable approach for automated SAE steering across language
model applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自动说话评估系统存在模态限制：文本方法缺乏声学信息，音频方法缺少语义上下文。多模态大语言模型为全面的说话评估提供了新机会。

Method: 提出语音优先多模态训练（SFMT）方法，利用课程学习原理，先建立健壮的语音模型基础，再进行跨模态协同融合。

Result: 在标准数据集上将全面评估性能从PCC 0.783提升到0.846。在表达方面的评估中，SFMT方法比传统训练方法绝对准确率提高4%。

Conclusion: 多模态大语言模型在自动说话评估中表现优异，而专门的训练策略能够有效解决表达方面的挑战，为该领域开启了新途径。

Abstract: Traditional Automated Speaking Assessment (ASA) systems exhibit inherent
modality limitations: text-based approaches lack acoustic information while
audio-based methods miss semantic context. Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLM) offer unprecedented opportunities for comprehensive ASA by
simultaneously processing audio and text within unified frameworks. This paper
presents a very first systematic study of MLLM for comprehensive ASA,
demonstrating the superior performance of MLLM across the aspects of content
and language use . However, assessment on the delivery aspect reveals unique
challenges, which is deemed to require specialized training strategies. We thus
propose Speech-First Multimodal Training (SFMT), leveraging a curriculum
learning principle to establish more robust modeling foundations of speech
before cross-modal synergetic fusion. A series of experiments on a benchmark
dataset show MLLM-based systems can elevate the holistic assessment performance
from a PCC value of 0.783 to 0.846. In particular, SFMT excels in the
evaluation of the delivery aspect, achieving an absolute accuracy improvement
of 4% over conventional training approaches, which also paves a new avenue for
ASA.

Motivation: 大语言模型在多次会话和长期交互中存在记忆持续性不足的问题，传统的知识增强生成系统仅使用密度向量存储对话历史，忽略了语法依赖、语篇关系等细微语言结构。

Method: 提出语义锚定技术，一种混合式代理记忆架构，通过结合依赖解析、语篇关系标注和指代消解等显式语言线索来丰富向量基础的存储方式，创建结构化的记忆条目。

Result: 在适配的长期对话数据集上的实验显示，语义锚定技术在事实回忆和语篇连贯性方面比强劲的RAG基线提升了18%。进行了消融研究、人工评估和错误分析来评估稳健性和可解释性。

Conclusion: 语义锚定技术通过结合向量表征和显式语言线索，有效地改善了大语言模型在长期对话中的记忆持续性问题，为更精细的语境丰富交流提供了可靠的技术支撑。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive fluency and task
competence in conversational settings. However, their effectiveness in
multi-session and long-term interactions is hindered by limited memory
persistence. Typical retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems store
dialogue history as dense vectors, which capture semantic similarity but
neglect finer linguistic structures such as syntactic dependencies, discourse
relations, and coreference links. We propose Semantic Anchoring, a hybrid
agentic memory architecture that enriches vector-based storage with explicit
linguistic cues to improve recall of nuanced, context-rich exchanges. Our
approach combines dependency parsing, discourse relation tagging, and
coreference resolution to create structured memory entries. Experiments on
adapted long-term dialogue datasets show that semantic anchoring improves
factual recall and discourse coherence by up to 18% over strong RAG baselines.
We further conduct ablation studies, human evaluations, and error analysis to
assess robustness and interpretability.

Motivation: 解决大语言模型在性能与效率之间的平衡挑战，GPT-5虽然提出了测试时路由，但需要更统一的解决方案来处理所有性能-效率权衡问题。

Method: 嵌入和聚类输入查询，然后基于性能-效率分数将每个查询路由到最合适的模型，集成不同容量和效率的LLM。

Result: 在6个基准测试和8个领先模型上实现SOTA：超越最强单一模型(GPT-5-medium)7%平均准确率，以27%更低成本匹配最强模型性能，以63%更低成本达到90%性能，实现帕累托最优。

Conclusion: Avengers-Pro提供了一个统一的测试时路由框架，能够为任何给定的成本提供最高准确率，为任何给定的准确率提供最低成本，在性能-效率权衡方面实现了突破。

Abstract: Balancing performance and efficiency is a central challenge in large language
model (LLM) advancement. GPT-5 addresses this with test-time routing,
dynamically assigning queries to either an efficient or a high-capacity model
during inference. In this work, we present Avengers-Pro, a test-time routing
framework that ensembles LLMs of varying capacities and efficiencies, providing
a unified solution for all performance-efficiency tradeoffs. The Avengers-Pro
embeds and clusters incoming queries, then routes each to the most suitable
model based on a performance-efficiency score. Across 6 challenging benchmarks
and 8 leading models -- including GPT-5-medium, Gemini-2.5-pro, and
Claude-opus-4.1 -- Avengers-Pro achieves state-of-the-art results: by varying a
performance-efficiency trade-off parameter, it can surpass the strongest single
model (GPT-5-medium) by +7% in average accuracy. Moreover, it can match the
average accuracy of the strongest single model at 27% lower cost, and reach
~90% of that performance at 63% lower cost. Last but not least, it achieves a
Pareto frontier, consistently yielding the highest accuracy for any given cost,
and the lowest cost for any given accuracy, among all single models. Code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型发展，AI生成假新闻变得容易且难以检测，现有方法主要关注文本内容但效果有限，需要更可靠的检测技术

Method: LIFE方法通过重构词级概率分布来发现提示诱导的语言指纹，利用关键片段技术放大语言差异，基于分布差异分析检测假新闻

Result: 实验表明LIFE在LLM生成假新闻检测上达到最先进性能，同时在人类撰写假新闻上也保持高检测准确率

Conclusion: LIFE方法通过捕捉提示诱导的语言概率分布差异，为AI生成假新闻检测提供了有效解决方案，代码和数据已开源

Abstract: With the rapid development of large language models, the generation of fake
news has become increasingly effortless, posing a growing societal threat and
underscoring the urgent need for reliable detection methods. Early efforts to
identify LLM-generated fake news have predominantly focused on the textual
content itself; however, because much of that content may appear coherent and
factually consistent, the subtle traces of falsification are often difficult to
uncover. Through distributional divergence analysis, we uncover prompt-induced
linguistic fingerprints: statistically distinct probability shifts between
LLM-generated real and fake news when maliciously prompted. Based on this
insight, we propose a novel method named Linguistic Fingerprints Extraction
(LIFE). By reconstructing word-level probability distributions, LIFE can find
discriminative patterns that facilitate the detection of LLM-generated fake
news. To further amplify these fingerprint patterns, we also leverage
key-fragment techniques that accentuate subtle linguistic differences, thereby
improving detection reliability. Our experiments show that LIFE achieves
state-of-the-art performance in LLM-generated fake news and maintains high
performance in human-written fake news. The code and data are available at

Motivation: 虽然先进的大语言模型在多语言沟通和理解方面表现强劲，但在低资源语言（如印地语、斯瓦希里语）上的常识理解任务表现较差，需要缩小语言间的性能差距以确保公平性。

Method: 使用控制语言混合方法生成合成代码切换文本，对LLM进行精细调整。还提供了一个基于CommonSenseQA数据集的新的合成代码切换文本数据集，包含三种不同的语言比例配置。

Result: 经验证明，在合成代码切换数据集上进行精细调整能够导致低资源语言模型性能的显著提升，同时保持或提升高资源语言的性能。

Conclusion: 通过代码切换精细调整方法可以有效缩小语言间的性能差距，为不同语言社区提供更公平的LLM输出质量。

Abstract: Cutting-edge LLMs have emerged as powerful tools for multilingual
communication and understanding. However, LLMs perform worse in Common Sense
Reasoning (CSR) tasks when prompted in low-resource languages (LRLs) like Hindi
or Swahili compared to high-resource languages (HRLs) like English. Equalizing
this inconsistent access to quality LLM outputs is crucial to ensure fairness
for speakers of LRLs and across diverse linguistic communities. In this paper,
we propose an approach to bridge this gap in LLM performance. Our approach
involves fine-tuning an LLM on synthetic code-switched text generated using
controlled language-mixing methods. We empirically demonstrate that fine-tuning
LLMs on synthetic code-switched datasets leads to substantial improvements in
LRL model performance while preserving or enhancing performance in HRLs.
Additionally, we present a new dataset of synthetic code-switched text derived
from the CommonSenseQA dataset, featuring three distinct language ratio
configurations.

Motivation: 研究LLM在情感预测任务中的表现，特别是预测人类对现实场景的痛苦感知，探索超越传统回归评估的动态情感推理能力。

Method: 采用回归问题框架，评估零样本、固定上下文少样本和基于BERT句子嵌入的检索式提示策略，并设计了"痛苦游戏秀"游戏化评估框架。

Result: 少样本方法持续优于零样本基线，游戏化评估显示LLM在动态情感推理任务中具有更广泛的潜力。

Conclusion: LLM在情感预测任务中表现出色，特别是在提供上下文示例的情况下，游戏化评估框架为评估动态情感推理能力提供了新途径。

Abstract: This study investigates the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for
predicting human-perceived misery scores from natural language descriptions of
real-world scenarios. The task is framed as a regression problem, where the
model assigns a scalar value from 0 to 100 to each input statement. We evaluate
multiple prompting strategies, including zero-shot, fixed-context few-shot, and
retrieval-based prompting using BERT sentence embeddings. Few-shot approaches
consistently outperform zero-shot baselines, underscoring the value of
contextual examples in affective prediction. To move beyond static evaluation,
we introduce the "Misery Game Show", a novel gamified framework inspired by a
television format. It tests LLMs through structured rounds involving ordinal
comparison, binary classification, scalar estimation, and feedback-driven
reasoning. This setup enables us to assess not only predictive accuracy but
also the model's ability to adapt based on corrective feedback. The gamified
evaluation highlights the broader potential of LLMs in dynamic emotional
reasoning tasks beyond standard regression. Code and data link:

Result: 实验证明ToolACE-MT能够实现高效、有效且可泛化的代理数据生成

Conclusion: 为工具增强的LLM场景中的高质量数据构建提供了新范式

Abstract: Agentic task-solving with Large Language Models (LLMs) requires multi-turn,
multi-step interactions, often involving complex function calls and dynamic
user-agent exchanges. Existing simulation-based data generation methods for
such scenarios rely heavily on costly autoregressive interactions between
multiple LLM agents, thereby limiting real-world performance of agentic tasks.
In this paper, we propose a novel Non-Autoregressive Iterative Generation
framework, called ToolACE-MT, for constructing high-quality multi-turn agentic
dialogues. ToolACE-MT generates full conversational trajectories through three
stages: coarse-grained initialization, iterative refinement, and offline
verification. The initialization phase builds a structurally complete yet
semantically coarse dialogue skeleton; the iterative refinement phase
introduces realistic complexities and continued refinement via mask-and-fill
operations; and the offline verification phase ensures correctness and
coherence via rule- and model-based checks. Experiments demonstrate that
ToolACE-MT enables efficient, effective and generalizable agentic data
generation, offering a new paradigm for high-quality data construction in
tool-augmented LLM scenarios.

Conclusion: DESIGNER框架能有效生成高质量多学科推理数据，显著提升LLM的复杂推理能力，甚至超越官方模型的多学科推理性能

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in many natural
language tasks but still struggle with complex, multi-step reasoning,
particularly across diverse disciplines. Existing reasoning datasets often
either lack disciplinary breadth or the structural depth necessary to elicit
robust reasoning behaviors. We propose DESIGNER: a DESIGN-logic-guidEd
Reasoning data synthesis pipeline that leverages naturally available, extensive
raw documents (book corpus and web corpus) to generate multidisciplinary
challenging questions. A core innovation of our approach is the introduction of
a Design Logic concept, which mimics the question-creation process of human
educators. We use LLMs to reverse-engineer and abstract over 120,000 design
logics from existing questions across various disciplines. By matching these
design logics with disciplinary source materials, we are able to create
reasoning questions that far surpass the difficulty and diversity of existing
datasets. Based on this pipeline, we synthesized two large-scale reasoning
datasets that span 75 disciplines: Design-Logic-Reasoning-Book (DLR-Book),
containing 3.04 million challenging questions synthesized from the book corpus,
and Design-Logic-Reasoning-Web (DLR-Web), with 1.66 million challenging
questions from the web corpus. Our data analysis demonstrates that the
questions synthesized by our method exhibit substantially greater difficulty
and diversity than those in the baseline datasets. We validate the
effectiveness of these datasets by conducting SFT experiments on the
Qwen3-8B-Base and Qwen3-4B-Base models. The results show that our dataset
significantly outperforms existing multidisciplinary datasets of the same
volume. Training with the full datasets further enables the models to surpass
the multidisciplinary reasoning performance of the official Qwen3-8B and
Qwen3-4B models.

Conclusion: 全面评估LLM的多语言安全性对于实现更平衡的安全对齐至关重要，LinguaSafe为多语言LLM安全研究提供了重要工具和数据集。

Abstract: The widespread adoption and increasing prominence of large language models
(LLMs) in global technologies necessitate a rigorous focus on ensuring their
safety across a diverse range of linguistic and cultural contexts. The lack of
a comprehensive evaluation and diverse data in existing multilingual safety
evaluations for LLMs limits their effectiveness, hindering the development of
robust multilingual safety alignment. To address this critical gap, we
introduce LinguaSafe, a comprehensive multilingual safety benchmark crafted
with meticulous attention to linguistic authenticity. The LinguaSafe dataset
comprises 45k entries in 12 languages, ranging from Hungarian to Malay. Curated
using a combination of translated, transcreated, and natively-sourced data, our
dataset addresses the critical need for multilingual safety evaluations of
LLMs, filling the void in the safety evaluation of LLMs across diverse
under-represented languages from Hungarian to Malay. LinguaSafe presents a
multidimensional and fine-grained evaluation framework, with direct and
indirect safety assessments, including further evaluations for oversensitivity.
The results of safety and helpfulness evaluations vary significantly across
different domains and different languages, even in languages with similar
resource levels. Our benchmark provides a comprehensive suite of metrics for
in-depth safety evaluation, underscoring the critical importance of thoroughly
assessing multilingual safety in LLMs to achieve more balanced safety
alignment. Our dataset and code are released to the public to facilitate
further research in the field of multilingual LLM safety.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模数据库中自然语言问题与SQL查询之间的语义不匹配问题严重，特别是语义相似的属性会阻碍模式链接并在SQL生成过程中导致语义漂移，从而降低模型准确性。

Method: CRED-SQL框架集成了聚类检索和执行描述。首先进行基于聚类的大规模模式检索来精确定位与NLQ最相关的表和列，缓解模式不匹配。然后引入中间自然语言表示——执行描述语言(EDL)，将任务分解为Text-to-EDL和EDL-to-SQL两个阶段，利用LLMs的强大通用推理能力同时减少语义偏差。

Result: 在两个大规模跨域基准测试SpiderUnion和BirdUnion上的广泛实验表明，CRED-SQL实现了新的最先进(SOTA)性能，验证了其有效性和可扩展性。

Conclusion: CRED-SQL通过创新的聚类检索和中间表示方法，有效解决了大规模数据库中Text-to-SQL的语义不匹配问题，为相关领域提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved
the accuracy of Text-to-SQL systems. However, a critical challenge remains: the
semantic mismatch between natural language questions (NLQs) and their
corresponding SQL queries. This issue is exacerbated in large-scale databases,
where semantically similar attributes hinder schema linking and semantic drift
during SQL generation, ultimately reducing model accuracy. To address these
challenges, we introduce CRED-SQL, a framework designed for large-scale
databases that integrates Cluster Retrieval and Execution Description. CRED-SQL
first performs cluster-based large-scale schema retrieval to pinpoint the
tables and columns most relevant to a given NLQ, alleviating schema mismatch.
It then introduces an intermediate natural language representation-Execution
Description Language (EDL)-to bridge the gap between NLQs and SQL. This
reformulation decomposes the task into two stages: Text-to-EDL and EDL-to-SQL,
leveraging LLMs' strong general reasoning capabilities while reducing semantic
deviation. Extensive experiments on two large-scale, cross-domain
benchmarks-SpiderUnion and BirdUnion-demonstrate that CRED-SQL achieves new
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, validating its effectiveness and
scalability. Our code is available at https://github.com/smduan/CRED-SQL.git

Abstract: In this paper, we present the SALAMANDRATA family of models, an improved
iteration of SALAMANDRA LLMs (Gonzalez-Agirre et al., 2025) specifically
trained to achieve strong performance in translation-related tasks for 38
European languages. SALAMANDRATA comes in two scales: 2B and 7B parameters. For
both versions, we applied the same training recipe with a first step of
continual pre-training on parallel data, and a second step of supervised
fine-tuning on high-quality instructions. The BSC submission to the WMT25
General Machine Translation shared task is based on the 7B variant of
SALAMANDRATA. We first adapted the model vocabulary to support the additional
non-European languages included in the task. This was followed by a second
phase of continual pre-training and supervised fine-tuning, carefully designed
to optimize performance across all translation directions for this year's
shared task. For decoding, we employed two quality-aware strategies: Minimum
Bayes Risk Decoding and Tuned Re-ranking using COMET and COMET-KIWI
respectively. We publicly release both the 2B and 7B versions of SALAMANDRATA,
along with the newer SALAMANDRATA-V2 model, on Hugging Face1

TL;DR: 医疗多模态RAG框架HeteroRAG通过异构知识源提升医疗大视觉-语言模型的事实准确性和可靠性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医疗多模态RAG系统无法在异构数据源中进行有效检索，导致检索结果不相关或知识不充分，影响了临床诊断的准确性和可靠性

Method: 构建MedAtlas多模态报告库，提出HeteroRAG框架：使用模态特异性CLIP进行报告检索，多语料库查询生成器动态构建查询，通过异构知识偏好微调实现跨模态多源知识对齐

Result: 在12个数据集和3种模态上的实验表明HeteroRAG在大多数医疗视觉语言测试中达到最先进水平，显著提升了Med-LVLMs的事实准确性和可靠性

Conclusion: HeteroRAG框架通过有效利用异构知识源，成功解决了医疗多模态RAG系统的检索效果问题，为提升医疗大模型的临床应用价值提供了有效方案

Abstract: Medical large vision-language Models (Med-LVLMs) have shown promise in
clinical applications but suffer from factual inaccuracies and unreliable
outputs, posing risks in real-world diagnostics. While retrieval-augmented
generation has emerged as a potential solution, current medical multimodal RAG
systems are unable to perform effective retrieval across heterogeneous sources.
The irrelevance of retrieved reports affects the factuality of analysis, while
insufficient knowledge affects the credibility of clinical decision-making. To
bridge the gap, we construct MedAtlas, which includes extensive multimodal
report repositories and diverse text corpora. Based on it, we present
HeteroRAG, a novel framework that enhances Med-LVLMs through heterogeneous
knowledge sources. The framework introduces Modality-specific CLIPs for
effective report retrieval and a Multi-corpora Query Generator for dynamically
constructing queries for diverse corpora. Incorporating knowledge from such
multifaceted sources, Med-LVLM is then trained with Heterogeneous Knowledge
Preference Tuning to achieve cross-modality and multi-source knowledge
alignment. Extensive experiments across 12 datasets and 3 modalities
demonstrate that the proposed HeteroRAG achieves state-of-the-art performance
in most medical vision language benchmarks, significantly improving factual
accuracy and reliability of Med-LVLMs.

TL;DR: 提出了Atomic Thought思维范式和Atom-Searcher强化学习框架，通过细粒度推理单元和过程级奖励来解决agentic深度研究中的梯度冲突和奖励稀疏问题，在多个基准测试中取得了SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLMs在处理复杂任务时受限于静态知识，RAG方法在多跳推理和策略搜索方面存在局限，而基于结果奖励的强化学习方法存在梯度冲突和奖励稀疏问题，限制了性能提升和训练效率。

Method: 1. Atomic Thought：将推理分解为细粒度功能单元；2. Reasoning Reward Models (RRMs)：为细粒度单元提供Atomic Thought Rewards (ATR)；3. Atom-Searcher：集成Atomic Thought和ATR的RL框架，采用课程式奖励调度策略。

Result: 在7个基准测试中 consistently 超越 state-of-the-art，具有测试时计算可扩展性、更好的可解释性以及更接近人类推理模式等优势。

Conclusion: Atomic Thought和Atom-Searcher框架有效解决了agentic深度研究中的关键挑战，通过细粒度推理监督和过程级奖励机制显著提升了LLMs的推理能力和训练效率。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable problem-solving abilities,
but struggle with complex tasks due to static internal knowledge.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances access to external information,
yet remains limited in multi-hop reasoning and strategic search due to rigid
workflows. Recent advancements in agentic deep research empower LLMs to
autonomously reason, search, and synthesize information. However, current
approaches relying on outcome-based reinforcement learning (RL) face critical
issues such as conflicting gradients and reward sparsity, limiting performance
gains and training efficiency. To address these, we first propose Atomic
Thought, a novel LLM thinking paradigm that decomposes reasoning into
fine-grained functional units. These units are supervised by Reasoning Reward
Models (RRMs), which provide Atomic Thought Rewards (ATR) for fine-grained
guidance. Building on this, we propose Atom-Searcher, a novel RL framework for
agentic deep research that integrates Atomic Thought and ATR. Atom-Searcher
uses a curriculum-inspired reward schedule, prioritizing process-level ATR
early and transitioning to outcome rewards, accelerating convergence on
effective reasoning paths. Experiments on seven benchmarks show consistent
improvements over the state-of-the-art. Key advantages include: (1)
Atom-Searcher scales computation at test-time. (2) Atomic Thought provides
supervision anchors for RRMs, bridging deep research tasks and RRMs. (3)
Atom-Searcher exhibits more interpretable, human-like reasoning patterns.

TL;DR: 这篇论文通过实验证明，高资源标准语言（如现代标准阿拉伯语）的表征空间占据会对相关低资源方言的生成模型产生负面影响。研究者开发了一种在线变分探针框架，通过投影解耦技术显著提升25种阿拉伯方言的生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挖掘高资源标准语言与相关低资源方言之间表征关系的深层影响，挑战了"标准语对方言模型有帮助"的偏见，通过阿拉伯语言家族的丰富平行资源来进行控制性实验。

Method: 开发了一种在线变分探针框架，在细调过程中持续估计标准语言的子空间，并通过投影技术实现与这个空间的解耦。以阿拉伯语25种方言的平行语料作为实验对象，将方言翻译作为控制代理任务。

Result: 在25种方言中，与标准细调相比，干预控制措施将生成质量提高了最高+4.9 chrF++，平均+2.0 chrF++。虽然标准语言性能有所交换损失，但提供了因果性证据证明高资源语言的子空间占据会限制相关方言的生成能力。

Conclusion: 论文统一了几何探针与信息论探针方法，通过子空间层面的因果干预措施，为改善亲缘语言家族生成模型提供了实用工具。更广法地看，这个方法为多语言和多领域大语言模型中的表征分配控制开阔了新途径。

Abstract: Alignment with high-resource standard languages is often assumed to aid the
modeling of related low-resource varieties. We challenge this assumption by
demonstrating that excessive representational entanglement with a dominant
variety, such as Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) in relation to Arabic dialects,
can actively hinder generative modeling. We present the first comprehensive
causal study of this phenomenon by analyzing and directly intervening in the
internal representation geometry of large language models (LLMs). Our key
contribution is an online variational probing framework that continuously
estimates the subspace of the standard variety during fine-tuning, enabling
projection-based decoupling from this space. While our study uses Arabic as a
case due to its unusually rich parallel resources across 25 dialects, the
broader motivation is methodological: dialectal MT serves as a controlled proxy
for generative tasks where comparable multi-variety corpora are unavailable.
Across 25 dialects, our intervention improves generation quality by up to +4.9
chrF++ and +2.0 on average compared to standard fine-tuning, despite a measured
tradeoff in standard-language performance. These results provide causal
evidence that subspace dominance by high-resource varieties can restrict
generative capacity for related varieties. More generally, we unify geometric
and information-theoretic probing with subspace-level causal interventions,
offering practical tools for improving generative modeling in closely related
language families and, more broadly, for controlling representational
allocation in multilingual and multi-domain LLMs. Code will be released.

Abstract: We present our work to build a French semantic corpus by annotating French
dialogue in Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR). Specifically, we annotate
the DinG corpus, consisting of transcripts of spontaneous French dialogues
recorded during the board game Catan. As AMR has insufficient coverage of the
dynamics of spontaneous speech, we extend the framework to better represent
spontaneous speech and sentence structures specific to French. Additionally, to
support consistent annotation, we provide an annotation guideline detailing
these extensions. We publish our corpus under a free license (CC-SA-BY). We
also train and evaluate an AMR parser on our data. This model can be used as an
assistance annotation tool to provide initial annotations that can be refined
by human annotators. Our work contributes to the development of semantic

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的辱骂性语言检测研究主要关注单个社交媒体帖子，忽略了对话上下文信息的重要性。本研究旨在探索利用父推文上下文是否能帮助检测回复中的辱骂内容。

Method: 使用四种分类模型，在包含父推文-回复推文对的数据集上进行实验，比较仅使用回复特征与结合上下文特征的效果，分析内容特征和账户特征的重要性。

Result: 结合上下文特征相比仅使用回复特征有显著提升，其中内容特征比账户特征贡献更大，多种特征组合比选择性使用少量特征效果更好。

Conclusion: 上下文信息对辱骂性语言检测至关重要，特别是在对话场景中，内容特征的组合使用能有效提升检测性能。

Abstract: Abusive language detection has become an increasingly important task as a
means to tackle this type of harmful content in social media. There has been a
substantial body of research developing models for determining if a social
media post is abusive or not; however, this research has primarily focused on
exploiting social media posts individually, overlooking additional context that
can be derived from surrounding posts. In this study, we look at conversational
exchanges, where a user replies to an earlier post by another user (the parent
tweet). We ask: does leveraging context from the parent tweet help determine if
a reply post is abusive or not, and what are the features that contribute the
most? We study a range of content-based and account-based features derived from
the context, and compare this to the more widely studied approach of only
looking at the features from the reply tweet. For a more generalizable study,
we test four different classification models on a dataset made of
conversational exchanges (parent-reply tweet pairs) with replies labeled as
abusive or not. Our experiments show that incorporating contextual features
leads to substantial improvements compared to the use of features derived from
the reply tweet only, confirming the importance of leveraging context. We
observe that, among the features under study, it is especially the
content-based features (what is being posted) that contribute to the
classification performance rather than account-based features (who is posting
it). While using content-based features, it is best to combine a range of
different features to ensure improved performance over being more selective and
using fewer features. Our study provides insights into the development of
contextualized abusive language detection models in realistic settings
involving conversations.

Abstract: While the indirect evidence suggests that already in the early scholastic
period the literary production based on records of oral teaching (so-called
reportationes) was not uncommon, there are very few sources commenting on the
practice. This paper details the design of a study applying stylometric
techniques of authorship attribution to a collection developed from
reportationes -- Stephen Langton's Quaestiones Theologiae -- aiming to uncover
layers of editorial work and thus validate some hypotheses regarding the
collection's formation. Following Camps, Cl\'erice, and Pinche (2021), I
discuss the implementation of an HTR pipeline and stylometric analysis based on
the most frequent words, POS tags, and pseudo-affixes. The proposed study will
offer two methodological gains relevant to computational research on the
scholastic tradition: it will directly compare performance on manually composed
and automatically extracted data, and it will test the validity of
transformer-based OCR and automated transcription alignment for workflows
applied to scholastic Latin corpora. If successful, this study will provide an
easily reusable template for the exploratory analysis of collaborative literary
production stemming from medieval universities.

Motivation: 探索Transformer模型是否使用类似于词汇库的机制来存储语义信息，这有助于理解模型如何处理语义

Method: 提取RoBERTa-base的token嵌入空间，使用k-means聚类分成200个聚类，然后手动检查聚类的语义敏感性，并测试五种心理语言学指标

Result: 发现token嵌入空间中编码了广泛的语义信息，支持了模型使用语义表征的假设

Conclusion: 这些发现排除了某些"语义消过主义"的假设，证明Transformer LLMs确实处理语义信息

Abstract: We investigate how word meanings are represented in the transformer language
models. Specifically, we focus on whether transformer models employ something
analogous to a lexical store - where each word has an entry that contains
semantic information. To do this, we extracted the token embedding space of
RoBERTa-base and k-means clustered it into 200 clusters. In our first study, we
then manually inspected the resultant clusters to consider whether they are
sensitive to semantic information. In our second study, we tested whether the
clusters are sensitive to five psycholinguistic measures: valence,
concreteness, iconicity, taboo, and age of acquisition. Overall, our findings
were very positive - there is a wide variety of semantic information encoded
within the token embedding space. This serves to rule out certain "meaning
eliminativist" hypotheses about how transformer LLMs process semantic
information.

Motivation: 现有自优化方法主要依赖固定迭代次数的被动优化过程，难以根据生成上下文动态确定最佳优化时机和内容，而人类在思考过程中会动态优化思路，这启发了主动优化的研究。

Method: 提出PASR方法，基于模型内部状态和演化上下文，让LLM在生成过程中主动决定是否进行优化、何时优化以及如何优化，而不是重新生成整个响应。

Result: 在10个多样化任务上的实验表明，PASR显著提升了问题解决性能。在Qwen3-8B上，相比标准生成方法平均减少41.6%的token消耗，同时准确率提升8.2%。

Conclusion: PASR通过主动动态优化机制，有效提升了LLM的输出质量和效率，为自优化方法提供了新的研究方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in self-refinement have demonstrated significant potential
for improving the outputs of large language models (LLMs) through iterative
refinement. However, most existing self-refinement methods rely on a reactive
process with a fixed number of iterations, making it difficult to determine the
optimal timing and content of refinement based on the evolving generation
context. Inspired by the way humans dynamically refine their thoughts during
execution, we propose ProActive Self-Refinement (PASR), a novel method that
enables LLMs to refine their outputs during the generation process. Unlike
methods that regenerate entire responses, PASR proactively decides whether,
when, and how to refine based on the model's internal state and evolving
context. We conduct extensive experiments on a diverse set of 10 tasks to
evaluate the effectiveness of PASR. Experimental results show that PASR
significantly enhances problem-solving performance. In particular, on Qwen3-8B,
PASR reduces average token consumption by 41.6 percent compared to standard
generation, while also achieving an 8.2 percent improvement in accuracy. Our
code and all baselines used in the paper are available in the GitHub.

Conclusion: 结构化信息共享和反思性协调是LLM多游戏系统在长期限规划任务中的关键组件

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MASs) have pushed the boundaries of large language model
(LLM) agents in domains such as web research and software engineering. However,
long-horizon, multi-constraint planning tasks involve conditioning on detailed
information and satisfying complex interdependent constraints, which can pose a
challenge for these systems. In this study, we construct an LLM-based MAS for a
travel planning task which is representative of these challenges. We evaluate
the impact of a notebook to facilitate information sharing, and evaluate an
orchestrator agent to improve coordination in free form conversation between
agents. We find that the notebook reduces errors due to hallucinated details by
18%, while an orchestrator directs the MAS to focus on and further reduce
errors by up to 13.5% within focused sub-areas. Combining both mechanisms
achieves a 25% final pass rate on the TravelPlanner benchmark, a 17.5% absolute
improvement over the single-agent baseline's 7.5% pass rate. These results
highlight the potential of structured information sharing and reflective
orchestration as key components in MASs for long horizon planning with LLMs.

Abstract: LLM-based web agents have the potential to automate long-running web tasks,
such as finding offers for specific products in multiple online shops and
subsequently ordering the cheapest products that meet the users needs. This
paper introduces WebMall, a multi-shop online shopping benchmark for evaluating
the effectiveness and efficiency of web agents for comparison-shopping. WebMall
consists of four simulated online shops populated with authentic product offers
sourced from the Common Crawl, alongside a suite of 91 cross-shop tasks. These
tasks include basic tasks such as finding specific products in multiple shops,
performing price comparisons, adding items to the shopping cart, and completing
checkout. Advanced tasks involve searching for products based on vague
requirements, identifying suitable substitutes, and finding compatible
products. Compared to existing e-commerce benchmarks, such as WebShop or
ShoppingBench, WebMall introduces comparison-shopping tasks across multiple
shops. Furthermore, the product offers are more heterogeneous, as they
originate from hundreds of distinct real-world shops. The tasks in WebMall
require longer interaction trajectories than those in WebShop, while remaining
representative of real-world shopping behaviors. We evaluate eight baseline
agents on WebMall, varying in observation modality, memory utilization, and
underlying large language model (GPT 4.1 and Claude Sonnet 4). The
best-performing configurations achieve completion rates of 75% and 53%, and F1
scores of 87% and 63%, on the basic and advanced task sets, respectively.
WebMall is publicly released to facilitate research on web agents and to
promote advancements in navigation, reasoning, and efficiency within e-commerce

Abstract: Sarcastic speech synthesis, which involves generating speech that effectively
conveys sarcasm, is essential for enhancing natural interactions in
applications such as entertainment and human-computer interaction. However,
synthesizing sarcastic speech remains a challenge due to the nuanced prosody
that characterizes sarcasm, as well as the limited availability of annotated
sarcastic speech data. To address these challenges, this study introduces a
novel approach that integrates feedback loss from a bi-modal sarcasm detection
model into the TTS training process, enhancing the model's ability to capture
and convey sarcasm. In addition, by leveraging transfer learning, a speech
synthesis model pre-trained on read speech undergoes a two-stage fine-tuning
process. First, it is fine-tuned on a diverse dataset encompassing various
speech styles, including sarcastic speech. In the second stage, the model is
further refined using a dataset focused specifically on sarcastic speech,
enhancing its ability to generate sarcasm-aware speech. Objective and
subjective evaluations demonstrate that our proposed methods improve the
quality, naturalness, and sarcasm-awareness of synthesized speech.

Motivation: 解决小语言模型(SLMs)数学推理能力差的问题。现有方法主要依赖大语言模型生成大量数据进行填鸭式训练，类似于心理学中的System 1思维，但人类学习还需要System 2思维（先获取知识再通过实践强化）。

Method: 提出LoRID方法：1）用LLM创建知识增强数据集；2）训练Intuitive Reasoner（直觉推理器）直接生成思维链；3）训练Knowledge Generator（知识生成器）和Deep Reasoner（深度推理器）模拟System 2思维；4）通过一致性评估和迭代推理实现相互反馈。

Conclusion: LoRID通过模拟人类双系统思维模式，有效提升了小语言模型的数学推理能力，证明了多LoRA交互蒸馏方法的有效性。

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated that Large Language Models (LLMs) have
strong mathematical reasoning abilities but rely on hundreds of billions of
parameters. To tackle the challenge of poor reasoning in Small Language Models
(SLMs), existing methods typically leverage LLMs to generate massive amounts of
data for cramming training. In psychology, they are akin to System 1 thinking,
which resolves reasoning problems rapidly based on experience and intuition.
However, human learning also requires System 2 thinking, where knowledge is
first acquired and then reinforced through practice. Inspired by such two
distinct modes of thinking, we propose a novel method based on the multi-LoRA
Interaction for mathematical reasoning Distillation (LoRID). First, we input
the question and reasoning of each sample into an LLM to create
knowledge-enhanced datasets. Subsequently, we train a LoRA block on the student
model as an Intuitive Reasoner (IR), which directly generates Chain-of-Thoughts
for problem-solving. Then, to imitate System 2 thinking, we train the Knowledge
Generator (KG) and Deep Reasoner (DR), respectively. The former outputs only
knowledge after receiving problems, while the latter uses that knowledge to
perform reasoning. Finally, to address the randomness in the generation of IR
and DR, we evaluate whether their outputs are consistent, and the inference
process needs to be iterated if not. This step can enhance the mathematical
reasoning ability of SLMs through mutual feedback. Experimental results show
that LoRID achieves state-of-the-art performance, especially on the GSM8K
dataset, where it outperforms the second-best method by 2.3%, 16.1%, 2.4%,
12.3%, and 1.8% accuracy across the five base models, respectively.

*M. Ali Bayram,Ali Arda Fincan,Ahmet Semih Gümüş,Sercan Karakaş,Banu Diri,Savaş Yıldırım*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的评估框架，用于分析对于形态丰富和低资源语言（如土耳其语）的标记化方法。通过新指标评估语言特定标记百分比和标记纯度，发现语言特定标记更能预测下游任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前标记化方法在处理形态丰富和低资源语言时面临挑战，需要专门的评估框架来量化标记化质量对语言结构保存的效果。

Method: 使用土耳其MMLU数据集（TR-MMLU）包含6,200道多选题，通过评估词汇量、标记数量、处理时间、语言特定标记百分比（%TR）和标记纯度（%Pure）等新指标来分析不同标记化器。

Result: 语言特定标记百分比与下游任务性能（如MMLU分数）呈现更强的相关性，单纯增加模型参数并不能提升语言性能。

Conclusion: 研究为形态复杂语言建立了健壮的标记化标准，证明了采用适配语言特点的标记化方法的重要性。

Abstract: Tokenization is a fundamental preprocessing step in Natural Language
Processing (NLP), significantly impacting the capability of large language
models (LLMs) to capture linguistic and semantic nuances. This study introduces
a novel evaluation framework addressing tokenization challenges specific to
morphologically-rich and low-resource languages such as Turkish. Utilizing the
Turkish MMLU (TR-MMLU) dataset, comprising 6,200 multiple-choice questions from
the Turkish education system, we assessed tokenizers based on vocabulary size,
token count, processing time, language-specific token percentages (\%TR), and
token purity (\%Pure). These newly proposed metrics measure how effectively
tokenizers preserve linguistic structures. Our analysis reveals that
language-specific token percentages exhibit a stronger correlation with
downstream performance (e.g., MMLU scores) than token purity. Furthermore,
increasing model parameters alone does not necessarily enhance linguistic
performance, underscoring the importance of tailored, language-specific
tokenization methods. The proposed framework establishes robust and practical
tokenization standards for morphologically complex languages.

*John Alderete,Macarious Kin Fung Hui,Aanchan Mohan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SFUSED语音错误数据库可用于评估语音识别模型性能，通过分析WhisperX在5300个语音错误上的转录准确率，验证了该数据库作为ASR系统诊断工具的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个公开的语音错误数据库，用于语言学和心理语言学研究，并展示其如何用于测试和评估语音识别模型。

Method: 使用Simon Fraser University Speech Error Database (SFUSED)，包含系统标注的自发英语语音错误，每个错误都标注了预期和实际错误产生。通过评估WhisperX在5300个文档化词汇和语音错误上的转录准确率来分析分类变量的价值。

Result: 分析证明了SFUSED数据库作为ASR系统性能诊断工具的有效性，能够评估语音识别模型在不同分类维度上的表现。

Conclusion: SFUSED语音错误数据库是一个有价值的工具，可用于语音识别模型的测试和评估，特别是在分析模型对不同类型语音错误的处理能力方面。

Abstract: The Simon Fraser University Speech Error Database (SFUSED) is a public data
collection developed for linguistic and psycholinguistic research. Here we
demonstrate how its design and annotations can be used to test and evaluate
speech recognition models. The database comprises systematically annotated
speech errors from spontaneous English speech, with each error tagged for
intended and actual error productions. The annotation schema incorporates
multiple classificatory dimensions that are of some value to model assessment,
including linguistic hierarchical level, contextual sensitivity, degraded
words, word corrections, and both word-level and syllable-level error
positioning. To assess the value of these classificatory variables, we
evaluated the transcription accuracy of WhisperX across 5,300 documented word
and phonological errors. This analysis demonstrates the atabase's effectiveness
as a diagnostic tool for ASR system performance.

*Long Ma,Fangwei Zhong,Yizhou Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了ReCOR强化学习框架，通过自适应选择token生成顺序来改进因果和扩散语言模型，在推理和规划任务上表现优于基线方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前因果和扩散模型使用固定或随机的token生成顺序，这与原始逻辑顺序存在偏差，导致在处理需要自适应生成顺序的问题时遇到困难

Method: ReCOR框架通过强化学习从无标注文本数据中提取自适应、数据依赖的token生成顺序，基于token预测统计进行自监督，估计每个未填充token的预测难度并自适应选择下一个token

Result: 在具有挑战性的推理和规划数据集上的实验表明，ReCOR相比基线方法表现出优越性能，有时甚至优于使用真实顺序监督的oracle模型

Conclusion: 自适应token生成顺序对于提升语言模型在复杂推理任务上的性能至关重要，ReCOR框架为无监督学习token生成顺序提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Modern causal language models, followed by rapid developments in discrete
diffusion models, can now produce a wide variety of interesting and useful
content. However, these families of models are predominantly trained to output
tokens with a fixed (left-to-right) or random order, which may deviate from the
logical order in which tokens are generated originally. In this paper, we
observe that current causal and diffusion models encounter difficulties in
problems that require adaptive token generation orders to solve tractably,
which we characterize with the $\mathcal{V}$-information framework. Motivated
by this, we propose Reinforced Context Order Recovery (ReCOR), a
reinforcement-learning-based framework to extract adaptive, data-dependent
token generation orders from text data without annotations. Self-supervised by
token prediction statistics, ReCOR estimates the hardness of predicting every
unfilled token and adaptively selects the next token during both training and
inference. Experiments on challenging reasoning and planning datasets
demonstrate the superior performance of ReCOR compared with baselines,
sometimes outperforming oracle models supervised with the ground-truth order.

*Dayyán O'Brien,Bhavitvya Malik,Ona de Gibert,Pinzhen Chen,Barry Haddow,Jörg Tiedemann*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DocHPLT是迄今为止最大的公开文档级翻译数据集，包含50种语言与英语配对的1.24亿个对齐文档对，共计42.6亿个句子，为长上下文建模和文档级翻译提供重要基础设施。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文档级机器翻译资源仅适用于少数高资源语言，为了促进全球社区的文档级翻译和长上下文建模的训练与评估，需要创建大规模多语言文档级翻译数据集。

Method: 修改现有的网页提取流程，从源头保留完整的文档完整性（包括未对齐部分），而不是基于句子级数据拼接文档的重构方法。通过初步实验确定最佳训练上下文策略。

Result: 在DocHPLT上微调的大型语言模型显著优于现成的指令调优基线模型，特别是对于资源匮乏的语言改进效果尤为显著。

Conclusion: DocHPLT数据集在宽松许可证下开源，为推进多语言文档级翻译提供了必要的基础设施，特别有助于资源匮乏语言的发展。

Abstract: Existing document-level machine translation resources are only available for
a handful of languages, mostly high-resourced ones. To facilitate the training
and evaluation of document-level translation and, more broadly, long-context
modeling for global communities, we create DocHPLT, the largest publicly
available document-level translation dataset to date. It contains 124 million
aligned document pairs across 50 languages paired with English, comprising 4.26
billion sentences, with further possibility to provide 2500 bonus pairs not
involving English. Unlike previous reconstruction-based approaches that piece
together documents from sentence-level data, we modify an existing web
extraction pipeline to preserve complete document integrity from the source,
retaining all content including unaligned portions. After our preliminary
experiments identify the optimal training context strategy for document-level
translation, we demonstrate that LLMs fine-tuned on DocHPLT substantially
outperform off-the-shelf instruction-tuned baselines, with particularly
dramatic improvements for under-resourced languages. We open-source the dataset
under a permissive license, providing essential infrastructure for advancing
multilingual document-level translation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过三项具体改进提升了法律领域RAG系统的检索效果和回答准确性，开源方案性能可以比胜专有方案


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在法律领域中的幻觉问题，通过基于来源的检索增强生成来提高回答的准确性和可靠性

Method: 构建端到端RAG流水线，包括：上下文感知查询翻译器、使用SBERT和GTE嵌入的开源检索策略、结合RAGAS、BERTScore-F1和ROUGE-Recall的综合评估框架

Result: 检索性能大幅提升(Recall@K提高30-95%，Precision@K提高约2.5倍)，开源方案在检索质量上可以比胜专有方案，专门设计的法律提示能产生更准确和上下文相关的回答

Conclusion: 通过任务感知的组件级调优，可以建立基于法律基础、可复现且成本效益高的RAG系统，为法律研究提供有效支持

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates hallucinations by grounding
large language model outputs in cited sources, a capability that is especially
critical in the legal domain. We present an end-to-end RAG pipeline that
revisits and extends the LegalBenchRAG baseline with three targeted
enhancements: (i) a context-aware query translator that disentangles document
references from natural-language questions and adapts retrieval depth and
response style based on expertise and specificity, (ii) open-source retrieval
strategies using SBERT and GTE embeddings that achieve substantial performance
gains (improving Recall@K by 30-95\% and Precision@K by $\sim$2.5$\times$ for
$K>4$) while remaining cost-efficient, and (iii) a comprehensive evaluation and
generation framework that combines RAGAS, BERTScore-F1, and ROUGE-Recall to
assess semantic alignment and faithfulness across models and prompt designs.
Our results show that carefully designed open-source pipelines can rival or
outperform proprietary approaches in retrieval quality, while a custom
legal-grounded prompt consistently produces more faithful and contextually
relevant answers than baseline prompting. Taken together, these contributions
demonstrate the potential of task-aware, component-level tuning to deliver
legally grounded, reproducible, and cost-effective RAG systems for legal
research assistance.

TL;DR: AutoBnB-RAG是一个基于检索增强生成的多智能体事件响应框架，通过在AutoBnB框架中集成RAG技术，使智能体能够在网络安全事件调查中检索外部知识，显著提升了决策质量和成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型语言模型在模拟事件响应中的推理能力受限于缺乏外部知识访问，需要增强其检索能力来支持更明智的网络安全决策。

Method: 基于Backdoors & Breaches桌面游戏环境，扩展AutoBnB框架集成RAG技术，引入两种检索设置（技术文档RAG-Wiki和事件报告RAG-News），评估八种团队结构包括新的论证性配置。

Result: 检索增强显著提高了决策质量和成功率，能够重建复杂的多阶段网络攻击，在不同组织模型中均表现出改进效果。

Conclusion: 这项工作证明了将检索机制集成到基于LLM的多智能体系统中对网络安全决策的价值，为自动化事件响应提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Incident response (IR) requires fast, coordinated, and well-informed
decision-making to contain and mitigate cyber threats. While large language
models (LLMs) have shown promise as autonomous agents in simulated IR settings,
their reasoning is often limited by a lack of access to external knowledge. In
this work, we present AutoBnB-RAG, an extension of the AutoBnB framework that
incorporates retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) into multi-agent incident
response simulations. Built on the Backdoors & Breaches (B&B) tabletop game
environment, AutoBnB-RAG enables agents to issue retrieval queries and
incorporate external evidence during collaborative investigations. We introduce
two retrieval settings: one grounded in curated technical documentation
(RAG-Wiki), and another using narrative-style incident reports (RAG-News). We
evaluate performance across eight team structures, including newly introduced
argumentative configurations designed to promote critical reasoning. To
validate practical utility, we also simulate real-world cyber incidents based
on public breach reports, demonstrating AutoBnB-RAG's ability to reconstruct
complex multi-stage attacks. Our results show that retrieval augmentation
improves decision quality and success rates across diverse organizational
models. This work demonstrates the value of integrating retrieval mechanisms
into LLM-based multi-agent systems for cybersecurity decision-making.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了BlindSpot框架来检测和量化LLM在客服通话摘要中的操作偏见，发现所有模型都存在系统性偏见


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在客服中心生成大量通话摘要，但存在潜在的操作偏见（如口吃、说话者、话题等维度），这些偏见尚未被系统研究

Method: 构建包含15个操作偏见维度的分类体系，使用LLM作为零样本分类器计算原文和摘要的分布差异，通过保真度差距和覆盖率两个指标量化偏见

Result: 对2500个真实通话和20个不同规模LLM生成的摘要进行分析，发现所有模型都存在系统性偏见，与模型规模和家族无关

Conclusion: 操作偏见在LLM生成的客服摘要中普遍存在，需要开发偏见缓解技术来确保摘要的公平性和准确性

Abstract: Abstractive summarization is a core application in contact centers, where
Large Language Models (LLMs) generate millions of summaries of call transcripts
daily. Despite their apparent quality, it remains unclear whether LLMs
systematically under- or over-attend to specific aspects of the transcript,
potentially introducing biases in the generated summary. While prior work has
examined social and positional biases, the specific forms of bias pertinent to
contact center operations - which we term Operational Bias - have remained
unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce BlindSpot, a framework built upon
a taxonomy of 15 operational bias dimensions (e.g., disfluency, speaker, topic)
for the identification and quantification of these biases. BlindSpot leverages
an LLM as a zero-shot classifier to derive categorical distributions for each
bias dimension in a pair of transcript and its summary. The bias is then
quantified using two metrics: Fidelity Gap (the JS Divergence between
distributions) and Coverage (the percentage of source labels omitted). Using
BlindSpot, we conducted an empirical study with 2500 real call transcripts and
their summaries generated by 20 LLMs of varying scales and families (e.g., GPT,
Llama, Claude). Our analysis reveals that biases are systemic and present
across all evaluated models, regardless of size or family.

TL;DR: 提出MuDRiC多方言阿拉伯常识数据集和基于GCN的新方法，解决阿拉伯语言多样性带来的常识验证挑战


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿拉伯语言存在丰富的语言多样性，但现有常识验证资源主要集中在现代标准阿拉伯语，忽视了普遍使用的地方方言

Method: 构建MuDRiC多方言常识数据集，并采用图卷积神经网络(GCN)来模型语义关系，改善常识验证性能

Result: 该方法在阿拉伯常识验证任务中达到了更优的性能表现

Conclusion: 这项工作通过提供基础数据集和新方法，为处理阿拉语言复杂变化的自然语言理解做出了贡献

Abstract: Commonsense validation evaluates whether a sentence aligns with everyday
human understanding, a critical capability for developing robust natural
language understanding systems. While substantial progress has been made in
English, the task remains underexplored in Arabic, particularly given its rich
linguistic diversity. Existing Arabic resources have primarily focused on
Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), leaving regional dialects underrepresented
despite their prevalence in spoken contexts. To bridge this gap, we present two
key contributions: (i) we introduce MuDRiC, an extended Arabic commonsense
dataset incorporating multiple dialects, and (ii) a novel method adapting Graph
Convolutional Networks (GCNs) to Arabic commonsense reasoning, which enhances
semantic relationship modeling for improved commonsense validation. Our
experimental results demonstrate that this approach achieves superior
performance in Arabic commonsense validation. Our work enhances Arabic natural
language understanding by providing both a foundational dataset and a novel
method for handling its complex variations. To the best of our knowledge, we
release the first Arabic multi-dialect commonsense reasoning dataset.

TL;DR: 本文研究如何通过结合水印检测器和非水印检测器来提高LLM生成文本的检测效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水印检测效果强度依赖于语言模型的熵异，而经过指令循环训练或RLHF后的模型熵异有限，使得单纯依靠水印检测革具挑战性

Method: 探索多种混合方案，将水印检测器与非水印检测器结合使用

Result: 在广泛的实验条件下，混合方案的性能超过任何单一类型检测器

Conclusion: 通过结合两种检测方法，可以有效提高大语言模型生成文本的检测效果

Abstract: Watermarking has recently emerged as an effective strategy for detecting the
generations of large language models (LLMs). The strength of a watermark
typically depends strongly on the entropy afforded by the language model and
the set of input prompts. However, entropy can be quite limited in practice,
especially for models that are post-trained, for example via instruction tuning
or reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), which makes detection
based on watermarking alone challenging. In this work, we investigate whether
detection can be improved by combining watermark detectors with non-watermark
ones. We explore a number of hybrid schemes that combine the two, observing
performance gains over either class of detector under a wide range of
experimental conditions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: OptimalThinkingBench是一个统一基准，用于评估LLMs的过度思考（overthinking）和思考不足（underthinking）问题，包含72个简单领域的OverthinkingBench和11个复杂推理任务的UnderthinkingBench两个子基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有思考型LLMs在复杂任务上表现更好但计算成本高且对简单问题过度思考，而非思考型LLMs虽然快速廉价但在困难推理问题上思考不足。需要开发能够平衡性能和效率的最优思考模型。

Method: 开发了包含两个子基准的统一评估框架，使用新颖的思考调整准确率指标，对33种不同的思考型和非思考型模型进行了广泛评估。

Result: 没有模型能够在基准上实现最优思考。思考型模型在简单查询上经常过度思考数百个token而性能没有提升，大型非思考型模型则经常思考不足，表现不如更小的思考型模型。

Conclusion: 当前方法往往在一个子基准上改进的同时损害另一个子基准的表现，凸显了未来需要开发更好的统一最优模型来解决过度思考和思考不足的平衡问题。

Abstract: Thinking LLMs solve complex tasks at the expense of increased compute and
overthinking on simpler problems, while non-thinking LLMs are faster and
cheaper but underthink on harder reasoning problems. This has led to the
development of separate thinking and non-thinking LLM variants, leaving the
onus of selecting the optimal model for each query on the end user. In this
work, we introduce OptimalThinkingBench, a unified benchmark that jointly
evaluates overthinking and underthinking in LLMs and also encourages the
development of optimally-thinking models that balance performance and
efficiency. Our benchmark comprises two sub-benchmarks: OverthinkingBench,
featuring simple queries in 72 domains, and UnderthinkingBench, containing 11
challenging reasoning tasks. Using novel thinking-adjusted accuracy metrics, we
perform extensive evaluation of 33 different thinking and non-thinking models
and show that no model is able to optimally think on our benchmark. Thinking
models often overthink for hundreds of tokens on the simplest user queries
without improving performance. In contrast, large non-thinking models
underthink, often falling short of much smaller thinking models. We further
explore several methods to encourage optimal thinking, but find that these
approaches often improve on one sub-benchmark at the expense of the other,
highlighting the need for better unified and optimal models in the future.

TL;DR: 这篇论文分析了语言模型评测基准的质量指标，提出了信号和噪声两个关键指标，并提出了三种提高基准质量的干预方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型开发成本昂贵，需要通过小规模实验做决策，而现有的多任务评估基准在可靠性方面存在问题，需要更好的评测标准来支撑模型开发决策。

Method: 提出了信号(区分模型能力的能力)和噪声(对训练步长随机变化的敏感性)两个指标，并在30个基准和375个从60M到32B参数的开源语言模型上进行实验。提出了三种干预方法：改用更好的指标(如困惑度代替准确率)、筛选噪声子任务、平均化中间检查点输出。

Result: 高信噪比的基准在小规模实验中更可靠，低噪声基准具有更低的缩放律预测错误。提出的三种干预方法都能显著提高基准的可靠性和减少缩放律错误。

Conclusion: 建议在创建新基准或选择现有基准时，应该越高信号和越低噪声的基准越好。这项研究产生了一个包含90万个评测结果的公开数据集，为语言模型评估提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Developing large language models is expensive and involves making decisions
with small experiments, typically by evaluating on large, multi-task evaluation
suites. In this work, we analyze specific properties which make a benchmark
more reliable for such decisions, and interventions to design higher-quality
evaluation benchmarks. We introduce two key metrics that show differences in
current benchmarks: signal, a benchmark's ability to separate better models
from worse models, and noise, a benchmark's sensitivity to random variability
between training steps. We demonstrate that benchmarks with a better
signal-to-noise ratio are more reliable when making decisions at small scale,
and those with less noise have lower scaling law prediction error. These
results suggest that improving signal or noise will lead to more useful
benchmarks, so we introduce three interventions designed to directly affect
signal or noise. For example, we propose that switching to a metric that has
better signal and noise (e.g., perplexity rather than accuracy) leads to better
reliability and improved scaling law error. We also find that filtering noisy
subtasks, to improve an aggregate signal-to-noise ratio, leads to more reliable
multi-task evaluations. We also find that averaging the output of a model's
intermediate checkpoints to reduce noise leads to consistent improvements. We
conclude by recommending that those creating new benchmarks, or selecting which
existing benchmarks to use, aim for high signal and low noise. We use 30
benchmarks for these experiments, and 375 open-weight language models from 60M
to 32B parameters, resulting in a new, publicly available dataset of 900K
evaluation benchmark results, totaling 200M instances.

Conclusion: LLM内部表征含有更丰富的统计特征，RepreGuard方法能够高效、稳健地检测AI生成文本，为建立可信的AI系统提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Detecting content generated by large language models (LLMs) is crucial for
preventing misuse and building trustworthy AI systems. Although existing
detection methods perform well, their robustness in out-of-distribution (OOD)
scenarios is still lacking. In this paper, we hypothesize that, compared to
features used by existing detection methods, the internal representations of
LLMs contain more comprehensive and raw features that can more effectively
capture and distinguish the statistical pattern differences between
LLM-generated texts (LGT) and human-written texts (HWT). We validated this
hypothesis across different LLMs and observed significant differences in neural
activation patterns when processing these two types of texts. Based on this, we
propose RepreGuard, an efficient statistics-based detection method.
Specifically, we first employ a surrogate model to collect representation of
LGT and HWT, and extract the distinct activation feature that can better
identify LGT. We can classify the text by calculating the projection score of
the text representations along this feature direction and comparing with a
precomputed threshold. Experimental results show that RepreGuard outperforms
all baselines with average 94.92% AUROC on both in-distribution (ID) and OOD
scenarios, while also demonstrating robust resilience to various text sizes and
mainstream attacks. Data and code are publicly available at:

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: LSM-OPD是一种针对LSM-Trees的编码方案，通过字典编码和列式存储减少I/O开销，支持直接在压缩数据上进行计算，显著提升扫描密集型操作的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着高性能存储设备（如NVMe SSD）的普及，LSM-Trees的扫描操作从I/O瓶颈转向计算瓶颈，特别是当值大小增加时，I/O带宽再次成为限制因素，导致整体吞吐量大幅下降。

Method: 提出LSM-OPD（Log-Structured Merge-Order-Preserving Dictionary）编码方案，支持键值分离的列式存储布局，利用保序字典编码减少I/O请求，并通过SIMD向量化技术提升计算性能。

Result: 实验表明LSM-OPD在各种现代存储设备上处理扫描密集型工作负载时具有卓越的效率。

Conclusion: LSM-OPD通过编码和计算优化有效解决了LSM-Trees在扫描操作中的I/O和计算瓶颈问题。

Abstract: Scan-based operations, such as backstage compaction and value filtering, have
emerged as the main bottleneck for LSM-Trees in supporting contemporary
data-intensive applications. For slower external storage devices, such as HDD
and SATA SSD, the scan performance is primarily limited by the I/O bandwidth
(i.e., I/O bound) due to the substantial read/write amplifications in
LSM-Trees. Recent adoption of high-performance storage devices, such as NVMe
SSD, has transformed the main limitation to be compute-bound, emerging the
impact of computational resource consumption caused by inefficient compactions
and filtering. However, when the value size increases, the bottleneck for scan
performance in fast devices gradually shifts towards the I/O bandwidth as well,
and the overall throughput across all types of devices undergo a dramatic
reduction. This paper addresses the core issues by proposing LSM-OPD, a Log-S
tructured M erge-O rder- Preserving Dictionary encoding scheme that enables
direct computing on compressed data within LSM-Trees. It first enables
key-value-separated data flushing to disk in a densely encoded columnar layout,
ideally with few bytes for a large string value (e.g., 1024 bytes), thereby
significantly alleviating the frequent I/O requests caused by intensive scans.
Then, it is capable of offloading the costly scan-based operations on large
values, including compaction and value filtering, to lightweight dictionaries
due to the order-preserving property. And SIMD-based vectorization can now be
employed to maximize the evaluating performance on modern multi-core
processors, further breaking the compute-bound limitations in LSM-trees.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior efficiency of LSM-OPD in
processing various workloads that involve intensive scan-based operations on
diverse modern storage devices.

Motivation: 现有原子广播解决方案在最坏情况下达到二次通信复杂度，且在尾分叉攻击下吞吐量显著下降。现有尾分叉攻击解决方案要么需要二次通信步骤，要么需要计算上不可行的SNARK生成。

Method: 提出Carry机制，作为HotStuff系列流线化协议的实用即插即用机制。该机制保证对尾分叉攻击的良好性能，消除大多数领导者引起的停顿，同时保持线性流量和协议简单性。

Result: 协议在GST后保证非故障领导者对尾分叉攻击的恒定比例提交，维持最优的最坏情况二次通信复杂度，并保证线性摊销通信（稳态为线性）。

Conclusion: Carry-the-Tail通过实用的Carry机制有效解决了尾分叉攻击问题，在保持协议简单性和通信效率的同时，显著提升了系统在攻击下的性能表现。

Abstract: We present Carry-the-Tail, the first deterministic atomic broadcast protocol
in partial synchrony that, after GST, guarantees a constant fraction of commits

solution also guarantees linear amortized communication, i.e., the steady-state
is linear.
  Prior atomic broadcast solutions achieve quadratic word communication
complexity in the worst case. However, they face a significant degradation in
throughput under tail-forking attack. Existing solutions to tail-forking
attacks require either quadratic communication steps or
computationally-prohibitive SNARK generation.
  The key technical contribution is Carry, a practical drop-in mechanism for
streamlined protocols in the HotStuff family. Carry guarantees good performance
against tail-forking and removes most leader-induced stalls, while retaining
linear traffic and protocol simplicity.

### [240] [jXBW: Fast Substructure Search in Large-Scale JSONL Datasets for Foundation Model Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12536)
*Yasuo Tabei*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: jXBW是一种针对JSONL数据集的快速子结构搜索方法，通过合并树表示、XBWT数据结构和三步搜索算法，显著提升了搜索效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有JSONL子结构搜索方法由于需要穷举树遍历和子树匹配，计算成本过高，无法满足现代应用（如基础模型提示工程）的需求

Method: 使用合并树表示多个JSON对象，基于扩展Burrows-Wheeler变换的简洁数据结构，以及结合路径分解、祖先计算和自适应树标识符收集的三步子结构搜索算法

Result: 在真实数据集上，jXBW比基于树的方法快16倍（小数据集）到4700倍（大数据集），比基于XML的处理快600万倍，同时保持竞争力的内存使用

Conclusion: jXBW为大规模JSONL数据集提供了高效准确的子结构搜索解决方案，解决了现有方法计算成本过高的问题

Abstract: Substructure search in JSON Lines (JSONL) datasets is essential for modern
applications such as prompt engineering in foundation models, but existing
methods suffer from prohibitive computational costs due to exhaustive tree
traversal and subtree matching. We present jXBW, a fast method for substructure
search on large-scale JSONL datasets. Our method makes three key technical
contributions: (i) a merged tree representation built by merging trees of
multiple JSON objects while preserving individual identities, (ii) a succinct
data structure based on the eXtended Burrows-Wheeler Transform that enables
efficient tree navigation and subpath search, and (iii) an efficient three-step
substructure search algorithm that combines path decomposition, ancestor
computation, and adaptive tree identifier collection to ensure correctness
while avoiding exhaustive tree traversal. Experimental evaluation on real-world
datasets demonstrates that jXBW consistently outperforms existing methods,
achieving speedups of 16$\times$ for smaller datasets and up to 4,700$\times$
for larger datasets over tree-based approaches, and more than 6$\times$10$^6$
over XML-based processing while maintaining competitive memory usage.

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 这篇论文评估了Google和Microsoft生成的AI建筑数据集在全球不同城市的质量偏差，发现结构化城市数据质量高，非正式定居点数据质量差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非正式定居点空间数据质量不确定，需要评估AI生成建筑数据集的质量偏差以避免计划和资源分配错误。

Method: 使用交并比IoU、重叠分析、位置精度算法分析数据集相似性，分析建筑多边形面积大小分布和完整性。

Result: 侯斯顿和柏林数据质量高，阿克拉和卡拉晶斯数据质量差，建筑尺寸分布反映全球社会经济差距。

Conclusion: 必须重视全球建筑数据集质量，以免导致计划和资源分配的偏差。

Abstract: While informal settlements lack focused development and are highly dynamic,
the quality of spatial data for these places may be uncertain. This study
evaluates the quality and biases of AI-generated Open Building Datasets (OBDs)
generated by Google and Microsoft against OpenStreetMap (OSM) data, across
diverse global cities including Accra, Nairobi, Caracas, Berlin, and Houston.
The Intersection over Union (IoU), overlap analysis and a positional accuracy
algorithm are used to analyse the similarity and alignment of the datasets. The
paper also analyses the size distribution of the building polygon area, and
completeness using predefined but regular spatial units. The results indicate
significant variance in data quality, with Houston and Berlin demonstrating
high alignment and completeness, reflecting their structured urban
environments. There are gaps in the datasets analysed, and cities like Accra
and Caracas may be under-represented. This could highlight difficulties in
capturing complex or informal regions. The study also notes different building
size distributions, which may be indicative of the global socio-economic
divide. These findings may emphasise the need to consider the quality of global
building datasets to avoid misrepresentation, which is an important element of
planning and resource distribution.

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 利用SPARQL CONSTRUCT查询作为逻辑规则，实现了表达力强、支持递归的语义网规则语言，并翻译到N3规则语言以利用现有推理机制


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语义网中现有规则语言的限制：OWL2 DL和SWRL表达力有限，RIF很少被采用，而SPARQL是一个成熟的RDF查询标准但不支持递归推理

Method: 将SPARQL CONSTRUCT查询作为逻辑规则使用，支持递归查询（查询可以在其他查询结果上运行），然后翻译到Notation3 Logic (N3)规则语言，以利用现有的前向和后向链推理机制

Result: 标准测试显示了竞争性能，实现了查询与规则之间的一对一映射，提高了交换性和可解释性

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种表达力强、熟悉且支持递归的语义网规则语言，有助于推进基于规则的语义网推理潜力

Abstract: Reasoning in the Semantic Web (SW) commonly uses Description Logics (DL) via
OWL2 DL ontologies, or SWRL for variables and Horn clauses. The Rule
Interchange Format (RIF) offers more expressive rules but is defined outside
RDF and rarely adopted. For querying, SPARQL is a well-established standard
operating directly on RDF triples. We leverage SPARQL CONSTRUCT queries as
logic rules, enabling (1) an expressive, familiar SW rule language, and (2)
general recursion, where queries can act on the results of others. We translate
these queries to the Notation3 Logic (N3) rule language, allowing use of
existing reasoning machinery with forward and backward chaining. Targeting a
one-to-one query-rule mapping improves exchangeability and interpretability.
Benchmarks indicate competitive performance, aiming to advance the potential of
rule-based reasoning in the SW.

TL;DR: EvoCut是一个自动化生成整数规划加速割的框架，结合大语言模型和进化搜索，无需人工专家输入即可显著提升求解器性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 整数规划作为组合优化的核心问题具有NP难特性，传统依赖专家手动设计加速割的方法效率低下且难以自动化，需要开发自动化生成有效割的方法

Method: 结合大语言模型和进化搜索：1）LLM初始化多样化候选割；2）评估割保持最优解和切割分数解的能力；3）通过进化交叉和变异迭代优化种群

Result: EvoCut在固定时间内将最优性间隙降低17-57%，获得相同解的速度提升4倍，在相同时间内获得更高质量的解，且生成的割能泛化到未见实例

Conclusion: EvoCut成功实现了整数规划加速割的自动化生成，显著提升求解器性能，证明了LLM与进化搜索结合在组合优化问题中的有效性

Abstract: Integer programming lies at the heart of crucial combinatorial optimization
tasks but remains challenging due to its NP-hard nature. An effective approach
for practically solving integer programs is the manual design of acceleration
cuts, i.e. inequalities that improve solver performance. However, this creative
process demands deep expertise and is yet to be automated. Our proposed
framework, EvoCut, automates the generation of acceleration cuts by combining
large language models (LLMs) with an evolutionary search. EvoCut (i)
initializes a diverse population of candidate cuts via an LLM-based initializer
agent; (ii) for each cut empirically evaluates both preservation of the optimal
solution and its ability to cut off fractional solutions across a verification
set; and (iii) iteratively refines the population through evolutionary
crossover and mutation agents. We quantify each cut's utility by its relative
reduction in the solver's optimality gap. Our comparisons against standard
integer programming practice show that EvoCut reduces optimality gap by 17-57%
within a fixed time. It obtains the same solutions up to 4 times as fast, and
obtains higher-quality solutions within the same time limit. Requiring no human
expert input, EvoCut reliably generates, improves, and empirically verifies
cuts that generalize to unseen instances. The code is available at

Motivation: 约束逆合成规划是化学中识别从商业可用起始材料到目标分子合成路线的关键但具有挑战性的过程，需要满足实际约束条件。现有方法难以有效处理这些约束。

Method: LARC框架采用代理化约束评估，通过Agent-as-a-Judge机制，利用基于工具的推理提供代理反馈来指导和约束路线生成过程。

Result: 在48个约束逆合成规划任务上，LARC取得了72.9%的成功率，显著优于LLM基线方法，并在更短时间内接近人类专家水平。

Conclusion: LARC框架具有可扩展性，是朝着为人类专家开发有效代理工具或合作科学家的第一步，用于约束逆合成规划。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agent evaluators leverage specialized tools to
ground the rational decision-making of LLMs, making them well-suited to aid in
scientific discoveries, such as constrained retrosynthesis planning.
Constrained retrosynthesis planning is an essential, yet challenging, process
within chemistry for identifying synthetic routes from commercially available
starting materials to desired target molecules, subject to practical
constraints. Here, we present LARC, the first LLM-based Agentic framework for
Retrosynthesis planning under Constraints. LARC incorporates agentic constraint
evaluation, through an Agent-as-a-Judge, directly into the retrosynthesis
planning process, using agentic feedback grounded in tool-based reasoning to
guide and constrain route generation. We rigorously evaluate LARC on a
carefully curated set of 48 constrained retrosynthesis planning tasks across 3
constraint types. LARC achieves a 72.9% success rate on these tasks, vastly
outperforming LLM baselines and approaching human expert-level success in
substantially less time. The LARC framework is extensible, and serves as a
first step towards an effective agentic tool or a co-scientist to human experts
for constrained retrosynthesis.

TL;DR: 提出了CHBench评估框架，基于认知层次模型来评估大语言模型的战略推理能力，通过三阶段系统框架在15个标准形式游戏中测试6个先进LLM，发现聊天机制会降低战略推理而记忆机制会增强它。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要依赖效用性能指标来评估LLM的游戏能力，但这些指标不够稳健，容易受到对手行为和游戏结构变化的影响，需要更可靠的评估框架。

Method: 提出认知层次基准（CHBench），采用三阶段系统评估框架，基于行为经济学中的认知层次模型，在15个精心挑选的标准形式游戏中收集6个先进LLM的行为数据进行分析。

Result: 实验显示LLM在不同对手间展现出一致的战略推理水平，验证了框架的稳健性和泛化能力。聊天机制显著降低战略推理性能，而记忆机制则能增强战略推理能力。

Conclusion: CHBench是一个有前景的LLM能力评估工具，具有重要的研究价值和实际应用潜力，为未来研究提供了新的评估视角和方法。

Abstract: Game-playing ability serves as an indicator for evaluating the strategic
reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs). While most existing
studies rely on utility performance metrics, which are not robust enough due to
variations in opponent behavior and game structure. To address this limitation,
we propose \textbf{Cognitive Hierarchy Benchmark (CHBench)}, a novel evaluation
framework inspired by the cognitive hierarchy models from behavioral economics.
We hypothesize that agents have bounded rationality -- different agents behave
at varying reasoning depths/levels. We evaluate LLMs' strategic reasoning
through a three-phase systematic framework, utilizing behavioral data from six
state-of-the-art LLMs across fifteen carefully selected normal-form games.
Experiments show that LLMs exhibit consistent strategic reasoning levels across
diverse opponents, confirming the framework's robustness and generalization
capability. We also analyze the effects of two key mechanisms (Chat Mechanism
and Memory Mechanism) on strategic reasoning performance. Results indicate that
the Chat Mechanism significantly degrades strategic reasoning, whereas the
Memory Mechanism enhances it. These insights position CHBench as a promising
tool for evaluating LLM capabilities, with significant potential for future
research and practical applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 优化大型语言模型监督微调(SFT)的数据混合配比对于开发通用模型至关重要，但这一领域尚未得到充分探索

Method: 将数据混合建模为优化问题，通过参数化损失函数、建模有效数据传输和利用微调缩放定律，在小规模数据混合实验基础上拟合参数并推导最优权重

Result: 算法在所有领域都取得了优异的整体和个体性能，优化权重训练的模型表现与网格搜索确定的最优权重相当，平均每个领域损失仅比网格搜索最佳损失高0.66%

Conclusion: 该方法不仅能改进验证损失和下游性能，还能推广到指导领域特定模型的数据选择，并为SFT提供新的见解

Abstract: Optimizing data mixtures for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of large language
models (LLMs) is critical for developing general-purpose models, yet this area
remains underexplored. In this paper, we frame data mixing as an optimization
problem and introduce a novel method designed to minimize validation loss. Our
approach parametrizes the loss by modeling effective data transferred and
leveraging scaling laws for fine-tuning. By experimenting with various
small-scale data mixtures, we fit these parameters and derive the optimal
weights. We provide both mathematical proofs and empirical results
demonstrating that our algorithm achieves excellent overall and individual
performance across all domains. Through controlled experiments, we show that
models trained with our optimized weights perform on par with those using
optimal weights determined via grid search, with per-domain loss only 0.66%
higher than the best domain loss from grid search on average. Additionally, we
show that reweighting popular SFT datasets using our method improves both
validation loss and downstream performance. Finally, we discuss how our method
can generalize to guide data selection for domain-specific models and provide
insights into SFT.

Motivation: 现有时间序列基础模型主要工作在单模态设置中，忽略了现实场景中常伴随时间序列数据的丰富多模态上下文（如视觉和文本信号）

Method: 通过软提示调优将预训练的视觉和文本编码器的模态特定嵌入与冻结的时间序列基础模型集成，实现高效的跨模态交互和最小参数更新

Result: 在多个时间序列预测基准测试中，UniCast始终显著优于所有现有的时间序列基础模型基线

Conclusion: 多模态上下文在推进下一代通用时间序列预测器发展中起着关键作用

Abstract: Time series forecasting is a foundational task across domains, such as
finance, healthcare, and environmental monitoring. While recent advances in
Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) have demonstrated strong generalisation
through large-scale pretraining, existing models operate predominantly in a
unimodal setting, ignoring the rich multimodal context, such as visual and
textual signals, that often accompanies time series data in real-world
scenarios. This paper introduces a novel parameter-efficient multimodal
framework, UniCast, that extends TSFMs to jointly leverage time series, vision,
and text modalities for enhanced forecasting performance. Our method integrates
modality-specific embeddings from pretrained Vision and Text Encoders with a
frozen TSFM via soft prompt tuning, enabling efficient adaptation with minimal
parameter updates. This design not only preserves the generalisation strength
of the foundation model but also enables effective cross-modal interaction.
Extensive experiments across diverse time-series forecasting benchmarks
demonstrate that UniCast consistently and significantly outperforms all
existing TSFM baselines. The findings highlight the critical role of multimodal
context in advancing the next generation of general-purpose time series
forecasters.

Conclusion: 该研究提供了更全面的特征重要性评估方法，考虑了弱求解解释外的集合对对抗性的影响，为高风险机器学习应用提供了更健壮的解释。

Abstract: Feature attribution methods based on game theory are ubiquitous in the field
of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI). Recent works proposed rigorous
feature attribution using logic-based explanations, specifically targeting
high-stakes uses of machine learning (ML) models. Typically, such works exploit
weak abductive explanation (WAXp) as the characteristic function to assign
importance to features. However, one possible downside is that the contribution
of non-WAXp sets is neglected. In fact, non-WAXp sets can also convey important
information, because of the relationship between formal explanations (XPs) and
adversarial examples (AExs). Accordingly, this paper leverages Shapley value
and Banzhaf index to devise two novel feature importance scores. We take into
account non-WAXp sets when computing feature contribution, and the novel scores
quantify how effective each feature is at excluding AExs. Furthermore, the
paper identifies properties and studies the computational complexity of the
proposed scores.

Conclusion: 该方法在不依赖人工标注数据或外部模型的情况下，通过合成数据生成和候选条件化答题等技术，有效解决了VLM在图表理解任务中的挑战，实现了显著的性能提升

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) often struggle with chart understanding tasks,
particularly in accurate chart description and complex reasoning. Synthetic
data generation is a promising solution, while usually facing the challenge of
noise labels. To address this challenge, we first introduce a chart synthesis
pipeline that generates aligned chart-question-answer triplets through code
generation and execution, ensuring the reliability of synthetic data without
human intervention. Furthermore, inspired by test-time scaling that increases
inference budget and thereby improves performance, we design a
candidate-conditioned answering process. The VLM first generates multiple
responses per query, and then synthesizes the final answer by contextualizing
these candidates. Experiments demonstrate significant improvements, with up to
15.50 points accuracy gain over the initial VLM, in a fully self-improving
paradigm without either human-labeled data or external models.

Conclusion: 目标是建立一个动态、无污染的评估标准，推动LLM智能体在复杂推理和预测思维方面达到专业人类分析师的水平。

Abstract: Future prediction is a complex task for LLM agents, requiring a high level of
analytical thinking, information gathering, contextual understanding, and
decision-making under uncertainty. Agents must not only gather and interpret
vast amounts of dynamic information but also integrate diverse data sources,
weigh uncertainties, and adapt predictions based on emerging trends, just as
human experts do in fields like politics, economics, and finance. Despite its
importance, no large-scale benchmark exists for evaluating agents on future
prediction, largely due to challenges in handling real-time updates and
retrieving timely, accurate answers. To address this, we introduce
$\textbf{FutureX}$, a dynamic and live evaluation benchmark specifically
designed for LLM agents performing future prediction tasks. FutureX is the
largest and most diverse live benchmark for future prediction, supporting
real-time daily updates and eliminating data contamination through an automated
pipeline for question gathering and answer collection. We evaluate 25 LLM/agent
models, including those with reasoning, search capabilities, and integration of
external tools such as the open-source Deep Research Agent and closed-source
Deep Research models. This comprehensive evaluation assesses agents' adaptive
reasoning and performance in dynamic environments. Additionally, we provide
in-depth analyses of agents' failure modes and performance pitfalls in
future-oriented tasks, including the vulnerability to fake web pages and the
temporal validity. Our goal is to establish a dynamic, contamination-free
evaluation standard that drives the development of LLM agents capable of
performing at the level of professional human analysts in complex reasoning and
predictive thinking.

Motivation: 由于真实AIG图结构复杂、节点规模大，现有方法难以同时建模功能性和结构性特征，且动态信息传播能力不足，需要新的建模方法。

Method: 提出AIGer框架，包含：1）节点逻辑特征初始化嵌入组件，将逻辑节点投影到独立语义空间；2）AIG特征学习网络组件，使用异构图卷积网络设计动态关系权重矩阵和差异化信息聚合方法。

Result: 在信号概率预测任务上，MAE和MSE分别提升18.95%和44.44%；在真值表距离预测任务上，MAE和MSE分别提升33.57%和14.79%。

Conclusion: AIGer通过结合功能性和结构性建模，显著提升了AIG图的表示学习能力，在EDA领域具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: The automation of logic circuit design enhances chip performance, energy
efficiency, and reliability, and is widely applied in the field of Electronic
Design Automation (EDA).And-Inverter Graphs (AIGs) efficiently represent,
optimize, and verify the functional characteristics of digital circuits,
enhancing the efficiency of EDA development.Due to the complex structure and
large scale of nodes in real-world AIGs, accurate modeling is challenging,
leading to existing work lacking the ability to jointly model functional and
structural characteristics, as well as insufficient dynamic information
propagation capability.To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose
AIGer.Specifically, AIGer consists of two components: 1) Node logic feature
initialization embedding component and 2) AIGs feature learning network
component.The node logic feature initialization embedding component projects
logic nodes, such as AND and NOT, into independent semantic spaces, to enable
effective node embedding for subsequent processing.Building upon this, the AIGs
feature learning network component employs a heterogeneous graph convolutional
network, designing dynamic relationship weight matrices and differentiated
information aggregation approaches to better represent the original structure
and information of AIGs.The combination of these two components enhances
AIGer's ability to jointly model functional and structural characteristics and
improves its message passing capability. Experimental results indicate that
AIGer outperforms the current best models in the Signal Probability Prediction
(SSP) task, improving MAE and MSE by 18.95\% and 44.44\%, respectively. In the
Truth Table Distance Prediction (TTDP) task, AIGer achieves improvements of
33.57\% and 14.79\% in MAE and MSE, respectively, compared to the
best-performing models.

Motivation: 现有多智能体系统在协作决策时存在两种局限："独裁"策略易受单个智能体认知偏见影响，"投票"方法无法充分利用集体智慧。需要一种能系统缓解认知偏见、促进主动假设评估的结构化方法。

Method: 受认知科学中竞争假设分析(ACH)启发，提出结构化推理范式。采用两阶段训练：第一阶段使用显式ACH支架引导结构化推理，第二阶段逐步移除支架以促进自主泛化。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的实验表明，AgentCDM实现了最先进的性能，并展现出强大的泛化能力，验证了其在提升多智能体系统协作决策质量和鲁棒性方面的有效性。

Conclusion: AgentCDM通过结构化推理和渐进式训练范式，成功将决策过程从被动答案选择转变为主动假设构建，显著提升了LLM多智能体系统的协作决策能力。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) powered by large language models (LLMs) hold
significant promise for solving complex decision-making tasks. However, the
core process of collaborative decision-making (CDM) within these systems
remains underexplored. Existing approaches often rely on either ``dictatorial"
strategies that are vulnerable to the cognitive biases of a single agent, or
``voting-based" methods that fail to fully harness collective intelligence. To
address these limitations, we propose \textbf{AgentCDM}, a structured framework
for enhancing collaborative decision-making in LLM-based multi-agent systems.
Drawing inspiration from the Analysis of Competing Hypotheses (ACH) in
cognitive science, AgentCDM introduces a structured reasoning paradigm that
systematically mitigates cognitive biases and shifts decision-making from
passive answer selection to active hypothesis evaluation and construction. To
internalize this reasoning process, we develop a two-stage training paradigm:
the first stage uses explicit ACH-inspired scaffolding to guide the model
through structured reasoning, while the second stage progressively removes this
scaffolding to encourage autonomous generalization. Experiments on multiple
benchmark datasets demonstrate that AgentCDM achieves state-of-the-art
performance and exhibits strong generalization, validating its effectiveness in
improving the quality and robustness of collaborative decisions in MAS.

Abstract: Major Depressive Disorder is one of the leading causes of disability
worldwide, yet its diagnosis still depends largely on subjective clinical
assessments. Integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) holds promise for
developing objective, scalable, and timely diagnostic tools. In this paper, we
present a comprehensive survey of state-of-the-art AI methods for depression
detection and diagnosis, based on a systematic review of 55 key studies. We
introduce a novel hierarchical taxonomy that structures the field by primary
clinical task (diagnosis vs. prediction), data modality (text, speech,
neuroimaging, multimodal), and computational model class (e.g., graph neural
networks, large language models, hybrid approaches). Our in-depth analysis
reveals three major trends: the predominance of graph neural networks for
modeling brain connectivity, the rise of large language models for linguistic
and conversational data, and an emerging focus on multimodal fusion,
explainability, and algorithmic fairness. Alongside methodological insights, we
provide an overview of prominent public datasets and standard evaluation
metrics as a practical guide for researchers. By synthesizing current advances
and highlighting open challenges, this survey offers a comprehensive roadmap
for future innovation in computational psychiatry.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Bongard-RWR+是一个包含5400个实例的Bongard问题数据集，使用VLM管道生成真实世界图像来表示抽象视觉概念，评估发现VLM在细粒度概念识别上存在困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Bongard问题数据集要么使用合成图像缺乏真实世界复杂性，要么使用真实图像但概念过于简单，且Bongard-RWR数据集规模太小限制了评估鲁棒性。

Method: 使用Pixtral-12B描述手动策划的图像并生成新描述，用Flux.1-dev从描述合成图像，手动验证生成图像是否忠实反映目标概念，构建了5400个实例的数据集。

Result: 评估显示最先进的VLMs能够识别粗粒度视觉概念，但在辨别细粒度概念方面持续存在困难，突显了其推理能力的局限性。

Conclusion: Bongard-RWR+数据集为评估VLM的抽象视觉推理能力提供了大规模基准，揭示了当前模型在细粒度概念理解方面的不足，为未来研究指明了方向。

Abstract: Bongard Problems (BPs) provide a challenging testbed for abstract visual
reasoning (AVR), requiring models to identify visual concepts fromjust a few
examples and describe them in natural language. Early BP benchmarks featured
synthetic black-and-white drawings, which might not fully capture the
complexity of real-world scenes. Subsequent BP datasets employed real-world
images, albeit the represented concepts are identifiable from high-level image
features, reducing the task complexity. Differently, the recently released
Bongard-RWR dataset aimed at representing abstract concepts formulated in the
original BPs using fine-grained real-world images. Its manual construction,
however, limited the dataset size to just $60$ instances, constraining
evaluation robustness. In this work, we introduce Bongard-RWR+, a BP dataset
composed of $5\,400$ instances that represent original BP abstract concepts
using real-world-like images generated via a vision language model (VLM)
pipeline. Building on Bongard-RWR, we employ Pixtral-12B to describe manually
curated images and generate new descriptions aligned with the underlying
concepts, use Flux.1-dev to synthesize images from these descriptions, and
manually verify that the generated images faithfully reflect the intended
concepts. We evaluate state-of-the-art VLMs across diverse BP formulations,
including binary and multiclass classification, as well as textual answer
generation. Our findings reveal that while VLMs can recognize coarse-grained
visual concepts, they consistently struggle with discerning fine-grained
concepts, highlighting limitations in their reasoning capabilities.

TL;DR: 对比了两种不同主动推理策略在导航任务中的性能：动作意识代理和动作非意识代理，发现非意识代理虽处于不利地位但仍能达到类似性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主动推理领域存在两种主要框架：一种假设代理知道自己的动作（动作意识），另一种则需要通过观察推断动作行为（动作非意识）。这种差异反映了运动控制中是否存在作动副本信号的分歧。本文旨在比较这两种策略的表现

Method: 在两个导航任务中比较了动作意识代理和动作非意识代理的性能。使用主动推理框架，通过最小化变分自由能和期望自由能来实现认知过程和行为选择

Result: 动作非意识代理虽然处于严重不利地位，但在导航任务中能够达到与动作意识代理相比的性能水平

Conclusion: 动作非意识策略虽然不如动作意识策略有利，但仍能够在实际任务中实现类似的性能，这为理解不同运动控制框架的实际效果提供了重要见解

Abstract: Active inference is a formal approach to study cognition based on the notion
that adaptive agents can be seen as engaging in a process of approximate
Bayesian inference, via the minimisation of variational and expected free
energies. Minimising the former provides an account of perceptual processes and
learning as evidence accumulation, while minimising the latter describes how
agents select their actions over time. In this way, adaptive agents are able to
maximise the likelihood of preferred observations or states, given a generative
model of the environment. In the literature, however, different strategies have
been proposed to describe how agents can plan their future actions. While they
all share the notion that some kind of expected free energy offers an
appropriate way to score policies, sequences of actions, in terms of their
desirability, there are different ways to consider the contribution of past
motor experience to the agent's future behaviour. In some approaches, agents
are assumed to know their own actions, and use such knowledge to better plan
for the future. In other approaches, agents are unaware of their actions, and
must infer their motor behaviour from recent observations in order to plan for
the future. This difference reflects a standard point of departure in two
leading frameworks in motor control based on the presence, or not, of an
efference copy signal representing knowledge about an agent's own actions. In
this work we compare the performances of action-aware and action-unaware agents
in two navigations tasks, showing how action-unaware agents can achieve
performances comparable to action-aware ones while at a severe disadvantage.

TL;DR: MAPF-World是一个用于多智能体路径规划的自回归动作世界模型，通过显式建模环境时空动态和智能体间依赖关系，在复杂长期规划场景中优于现有可学习求解器，且模型大小减少96.5%，数据需求减少92%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分散式可学习求解器对环境时间动态和智能体间依赖关系建模有限，在复杂长期规划场景中性能下降，需要更先进的模型来提升情境感知和决策能力。

Method: 提出MAPF-World自回归动作世界模型，统一情境理解和动作生成，通过预测未来状态和动作来显式建模空间特征和时间依赖关系，并引入基于真实场景的自动地图生成器来增强基准测试。

Result: MAPF-World在零样本泛化到分布外案例方面优于最先进的可学习求解器，表现出更好的情境感知和协调决策能力。

Conclusion: MAPF-World通过建模环境动态和未来预测，实现了更明智、协调和远见的决策，为大规模多智能体路径规划提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-agent path finding (MAPF) is the problem of planning conflict-free
paths from the designated start locations to goal positions for multiple
agents. It underlies a variety of real-world tasks, including multi-robot
coordination, robot-assisted logistics, and social navigation. Recent
decentralized learnable solvers have shown great promise for large-scale MAPF,
especially when leveraging foundation models and large datasets. However, these
agents are reactive policy models and exhibit limited modeling of environmental
temporal dynamics and inter-agent dependencies, resulting in performance
degradation in complex, long-term planning scenarios. To address these
limitations, we propose MAPF-World, an autoregressive action world model for
MAPF that unifies situation understanding and action generation, guiding
decisions beyond immediate local observations. It improves situational
awareness by explicitly modeling environmental dynamics, including spatial
features and temporal dependencies, through future state and actions
prediction. By incorporating these predicted futures, MAPF-World enables more
informed, coordinated, and far-sighted decision-making, especially in complex
multi-agent settings. Furthermore, we augment MAPF benchmarks by introducing an
automatic map generator grounded in real-world scenarios, capturing practical
map layouts for training and evaluating MAPF solvers. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that MAPF-World outperforms state-of-the-art learnable solvers,
showcasing superior zero-shot generalization to out-of-distribution cases.
Notably, MAPF-World is trained with a 96.5% smaller model size and 92% reduced
data.

TL;DR: 提出ReT-Eval框架，通过两阶段的知识提取和评估剪枝机制，生成结构化的推理线程，提升互动问题解决效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前推理模型缺乏显式语义层次结构、用户-域知识对齐和有原则的推理线程剪枝机制，导致输出长缠通用且无法指导用户进行目标导向推理

Method: 采用原型启发的两阶段ReT-Eval框架：第一阶段使用图神经网络从稀疏域知识图中提取语义相关知识结构，并用大语言模型内部知识丰富；第二阶段采用奖励导向策略评估和剪枝推理线程，保持语义连贯性

Result: 实验和专家评估显示，ReT-Eval能够提升用户理解能力，在性能上超过现有最优推理模型

Conclusion: ReT-Eval框架通过结构化知识重用和有原则的推理线程处理，有效解决了当前推理模型在互动问题解决中的限制，为构建更加高效、可解释性强的推理系统提供了新方案

Abstract: Reasoning in interactive problem solving scenarios requires models to
construct reasoning threads that reflect user understanding and align with
structured domain knowledge. However, current reasoning models often lack
explicit semantic hierarchies, user-domain knowledge alignment, and principled
mechanisms to prune reasoning threads for effectiveness. These limitations
result in lengthy generic output that does not guide users through
goal-oriented reasoning steps. To address this, we propose a
prototype-inspired, two-phases Reasoning-Threads-Evaluation (ReT-Eval)
framework, drawing inspiration from human-like reasoning strategies that
emphasize structured knowledge reuse. In the first phase, semantically relevant
knowledge structures are extracted from a sparse domain knowledge graph using a
graph neural network and enriched with intrinsic large language model knowledge
to resolve knowledge discrepancies. In the second phase, these threads are
evaluated and pruned using a reward-guided strategy aimed at maintaining
semantic coherence to generate effective reasoning threads. Experiments and
expert evaluations show that ReT-Eval enhances user understanding and
outperforms state-of-the-art reasoning models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MOVER是一个多模态学习框架，通过最优传输软对齐和几何体积正则化，在共享嵌入空间中构建语义对齐的结构化多模态表示，显著提升了多模态检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态学习方法主要依赖成对对比目标来对齐不同模态，但在多模态设置中泛化能力有限，且在高维空间中缺乏语义结构。

Method: 结合最优传输软对齐和几何体积最小化目标(GAVE)，通过传输引导的匹配机制和几何正则化，以模态无关的方式实现所有模态的一致对齐。

Result: 在文本-视频-音频检索任务中，MOVER在零样本和微调设置下均显著优于现有最先进方法，展现出对未见模态组合的更好泛化能力和更强的嵌入空间结构一致性。

Conclusion: MOVER框架通过集成最优传输和几何正则化，成功解决了多模态对齐中的语义结构和泛化问题，为多模态表示学习提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal learning have largely relied on pairwise
contrastive objectives to align different modalities, such as text, video, and
audio, in a shared embedding space. While effective in bi-modal setups, these
approaches struggle to generalize across multiple modalities and often lack
semantic structure in high-dimensional spaces. In this paper, we propose MOVER,
a novel framework that combines optimal transport-based soft alignment with
volume-based geometric regularization to build semantically aligned and
structured multimodal representations. By integrating a transport-guided
matching mechanism with a geometric volume minimization objective (GAVE), MOVER
encourages consistent alignment across all modalities in a modality-agnostic
manner. Experiments on text-video-audio retrieval tasks demonstrate that MOVER
significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods in both zero-shot and
finetuned settings. Additional analysis shows improved generalization to unseen
modality combinations and stronger structural consistency in the learned
embedding space.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RLHF需要昂贵的人工验证奖励信号，在许多实际应用中不切实际，需要能够处理嘈杂实时反馈的替代方案

Method: 结合基线归一化、语义相似度奖励转移、GSPO策略优化和可选的UED课程学习，在Bluesky社交媒体平台上使用实际互动数据进行训练

Result: 实验结果显示在内容质量和训练稳定性方面有显著改进，但全面评估仍需未来工作

Conclusion: RLNVR提供了一个实用的框架，能够在嘈杂的隐式奖励环境下有效训练语言模型，特别是在社交媒体内容生成等实际应用场景中

Abstract: This paper introduces RLNVR (Reinforcement Learning from Non-Verified
Rewards), a framework for training language models using noisy, real-world
feedback signals without requiring explicit human verification. Traditional
RLHF requires expensive, verified reward signals that are impractical in many
real-world domains. RLNVR addresses this challenge through baseline
normalization and semantic similarity-based reward transfer. We demonstrate
RLNVR through Walter, a prototype system that optimizes social media content
generation using actual engagement data from Bluesky. Our experimental results
show significant improvements in content quality and training stability, with
comprehensive evaluation planned for future work. Positioning: We present a
practical framework that combines RLNVR with GSPO (Group Sequence Policy
Optimization) and an optional UED (Unsupervised Environment Design) curriculum
to improve stability and diversity under noisy, implicit rewards. To our
knowledge, combining GSPO-style normalization with a UED-style curriculum for
LLM content generation from implicit social engagement has not been previously
documented in this applied setting; we frame this as an applied integration
rather than a new algorithm.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统传染病预测模型需要疾病特定数据、定制化训练和专家调优，在新发疫情或资源匮乏地区应用受限，需要开发通用性强、无需真实数据训练的基础预测模型。

Method: 基于超过4亿天爆发动态的机制模拟数据进行训练，涵盖多种病原体、传播模式、干预措施和监测伪影，完全不需要真实世界数据。

Result: 在6种疾病测试中超越所有39个专家调优模型，包括CDC COVID-19预测中心的所有模型；能泛化到新的流行病学机制；提供8周预测范围；具有机制可解释性。

Conclusion: Mantis作为下一代疾病预测系统的基础，具有通用性、可解释性和在传统模型失效场景下的部署能力，为公共卫生决策提供重要工具。

Abstract: Infectious disease forecasting in novel outbreaks or low resource settings
has been limited by the need for disease-specific data, bespoke training, and
expert tuning. We introduce Mantis, a foundation model trained entirely on
mechanistic simulations, which enables out-of-the-box forecasting across
diseases, regions, and outcomes, even in settings with limited historical data.
Mantis is built on over 400 million simulated days of outbreak dynamics
spanning diverse pathogens, transmission modes, interventions, and surveillance
artifacts. Despite requiring no real-world data during training, Mantis
outperformed 39 expert-tuned models we tested across six diseases, including
all models in the CDC's COVID-19 Forecast Hub. Mantis generalized to novel
epidemiological regimes, including diseases with held-out transmission
mechanisms, demonstrating that it captures fundamental contagion dynamics.
Critically, Mantis is mechanistically interpretable, enabling public health
decision-makers to identify the latent drivers behind its predictions. Finally,
Mantis delivers accurate forecasts at 8-week horizons, more than doubling the
actionable range of most models, enabling proactive public health planning.
Together, these capabilities position Mantis as a foundation for
next-generation disease forecasting systems: general, interpretable, and
deployable where traditional models fail.

Result: RadarQA在所有评估设置中都优于现有的通用多模态大语言模型

Conclusion: 该方法在天气预报质量分析方面具有推进潜力，展示了MLLM在专业气象分析中的应用价值

Abstract: Quality analysis of weather forecasts is an essential topic in meteorology.
Although traditional score-based evaluation metrics can quantify certain
forecast errors, they are still far from meteorological experts in terms of
descriptive capability, interpretability, and understanding of dynamic
evolution. With the rapid development of Multi-modal Large Language Models
(MLLMs), these models become potential tools to overcome the above challenges.
In this work, we introduce an MLLM-based weather forecast analysis method,
RadarQA, integrating key physical attributes with detailed assessment reports.
We introduce a novel and comprehensive task paradigm for multi-modal quality
analysis, encompassing both single frame and sequence, under both rating and
assessment scenarios. To support training and benchmarking, we design a hybrid
annotation pipeline that combines human expert labeling with automated
heuristics. With such an annotation method, we construct RQA-70K, a large-scale
dataset with varying difficulty levels for radar forecast quality evaluation.
We further design a multi-stage training strategy that iteratively improves
model performance at each stage. Extensive experiments show that RadarQA
outperforms existing general MLLMs across all evaluation settings, highlighting
its potential for advancing quality analysis in weather prediction.

TL;DR: RLCCF是一种无需外部监督的多模型协同进化强化学习框架，通过集体一致性投票和自我一致性权重来提供奖励信号，解决了单模型自我反馈的过信任问题，在数学推理任务上实现了显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RL方法依赖贵的人工标注数据或复杂奖励模型，而现有自我反馈方法受限于单一模型能力，容易出现过信任错误答案、奖励攻击和训练崩溃等问题。

Method: 提出RLCCF框架，通过最大化集体一致性(CC)来优化模型集群能力，共同训练多样化的LLM集成，通过投票集体输出来提供奖励信号。每个模型的投票权重由其自我一致性(SC)分数决定，确保更自信的模型贡献更多。

Result: 在4个主流开源LLM和4个数学推理测试集上的实验显示，框架实现了显著性能提升，平均相对准确率提升16.72%。不仅提升了单个模型性能，还将集体多数投票准确率提升了4.51%。

Conclusion: RLCCF通过多模型协同进化和集体决策，有效解决了单模型自我反馈的限制，能够在无外部监督的情况下持续提升模型集群的推理能力和集体能力边界。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has significantly enhanced the reasoning
capabilities of large language models (LLMs), but its reliance on expensive
human-labeled data or complex reward models severely limits scalability. While
existing self-feedback methods aim to address this problem, they are
constrained by the capabilities of a single model, which can lead to
overconfidence in incorrect answers, reward hacking, and even training
collapse. To this end, we propose Reinforcement Learning from Coevolutionary
Collective Feedback (RLCCF), a novel RL framework that enables multi-model
collaborative evolution without external supervision. Specifically, RLCCF
optimizes the ability of a model collective by maximizing its Collective
Consistency (CC), which jointly trains a diverse ensemble of LLMs and provides
reward signals by voting on collective outputs. Moreover, each model's vote is
weighted by its Self-Consistency (SC) score, ensuring that more confident
models contribute more to the collective decision. Benefiting from the diverse
output distributions and complementary abilities of multiple LLMs, RLCCF
enables the model collective to continuously enhance its reasoning ability
through coevolution. Experiments on four mainstream open-source LLMs across
four mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our framework yields
significant performance gains, achieving an average relative improvement of
16.72\% in accuracy. Notably, RLCCF not only improves the performance of
individual models but also enhances the group's majority-voting accuracy by
4.51\%, demonstrating its ability to extend the collective capability boundary
of the model collective.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前故障强度诊断方法基于链式思维且没有考虑目标类之间的依赖关系，需要提出新方法来抓取和利用这些依赖关系。

Method: 提出了分层知识导向的故障强度诊断框架(HKG)，使用图卷积网络将类表示的分层拓扑图映射到一组相互依赖的全局分层分类器。同时开发了重加权分层知识相关矩阵(Re-HKCM)方案，将类间分层知识嵌入到数据驱动的统计相关矩阵中。

Conclusion: HKG框架通过抓取类间依赖关系和嵌入分层知识，有效提升了故障强度诊断的性能，为复杂工业系统的监控和维护提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Fault intensity diagnosis (FID) plays a pivotal role in monitoring and
maintaining mechanical devices within complex industrial systems. As current
FID methods are based on chain of thought without considering dependencies
among target classes. To capture and explore dependencies, we propose a
hierarchical knowledge guided fault intensity diagnosis framework (HKG)
inspired by the tree of thought, which is amenable to any representation
learning methods. The HKG uses graph convolutional networks to map the
hierarchical topological graph of class representations into a set of
interdependent global hierarchical classifiers, where each node is denoted by
word embeddings of a class. These global hierarchical classifiers are applied
to learned deep features extracted by representation learning, allowing the
entire model to be end-to-end learnable. In addition, we develop a re-weighted
hierarchical knowledge correlation matrix (Re-HKCM) scheme by embedding
inter-class hierarchical knowledge into a data-driven statistical correlation
matrix (SCM) which effectively guides the information sharing of nodes in
graphical convolutional neural networks and avoids over-smoothing issues. The
Re-HKCM is derived from the SCM through a series of mathematical
transformations. Extensive experiments are performed on four real-world
datasets from different industrial domains (three cavitation datasets from
SAMSON AG and one existing publicly) for FID, all showing superior results and
outperform recent state-of-the-art FID methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在小规模图推理任务上表现良好，但在处理具有复杂查询的真实世界图时失败，主要原因是无法同时有效处理复杂图拓扑和执行多步推理。

Method: 提出GraphCogent框架，包含三个模块：感知模块通过子图采样标准化图文本表示，缓冲模块集成和索引多格式图数据，执行模块结合工具调用和模型生成进行高效推理。

Result: 基于Llama3.1-8B的GraphCogent相比DeepSeek-R1(671B)提升50%性能，相比最先进的基于代理的基线方法，在工具集内任务上准确率提升20%同时减少80%token使用，在工具集外任务上减少30%token使用。

Conclusion: GraphCogent框架有效解决了大语言模型在复杂图推理任务中的局限性，通过认知过程分解显著提升了推理效率和准确性，并引入了Graph4real基准来评估图推理能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promising performance on small-scale graph
reasoning tasks but fail when handling real-world graphs with complex queries.
This phenomenon stems from LLMs' inability to effectively process complex graph
topology and perform multi-step reasoning simultaneously. To address these
limitations, we propose GraphCogent, a collaborative agent framework inspired
by human Working Memory Model that decomposes graph reasoning into specialized
cognitive processes: sense, buffer, and execute. The framework consists of
three modules: Sensory Module standardizes diverse graph text representations
via subgraph sampling, Buffer Module integrates and indexes graph data across
multiple formats, and Execution Module combines tool calling and model
generation for efficient reasoning. We also introduce Graph4real, a
comprehensive benchmark contains with four domains of real-world graphs (Web,
Social, Transportation, and Citation) to evaluate LLMs' graph reasoning
capabilities. Our Graph4real covers 21 different graph reasoning tasks,
categorized into three types (Structural Querying, Algorithmic Reasoning, and
Predictive Modeling tasks), with graph scales that are 10 times larger than
existing benchmarks. Experiments show that Llama3.1-8B based GraphCogent
achieves a 50% improvement over massive-scale LLMs like DeepSeek-R1 (671B).
Compared to state-of-the-art agent-based baseline, our framework outperforms by
20% in accuracy while reducing token usage by 80% for in-toolset tasks and 30%
for out-toolset tasks. Code will be available after review.

*Phuong Minh Nguyen,Tien Huu Dang,Naoya Inoue*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 符号化助的思维链方法通过在少样本提示中集成轻量级符号表示，提升了大语言模型逻辑推理的透明性、可解释性和性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准思维链方法在逻辑推理中存在推理模式不够明确、透明性不足的问题，需要一种方法在保持普遍适用性的同时提升推理的可解释性

Method: 在少样本提示中集成轻量级符号表示，使用一致的策略结构化推理步骤，在非迭代推理过程中使推理模式更加明确

Result: 在4个逻辑推理测试集(ProofWriter、FOLIO、ProntoQA、LogicalDeduction)上表现优异，在复杂推理任务中特别有效，在3个数据集上显著超过传统思维链方法

Conclusion: 符号化助的思维链方法能够在保持普遍适用性的同时，显著提升大语言模型逻辑推理的透明性、可解释性和性能

Abstract: This work introduces Symbolic-Aided Chain-of-Thought (CoT), an improved
approach to standard CoT, for logical reasoning in large language models
(LLMs). The key idea is to integrate lightweight symbolic representations into
few-shot prompts, structuring the inference steps with a consistent strategy to
make reasoning patterns more explicit within a non-iterative reasoning process.
By incorporating these symbolic structures, our method preserves the
generalizability of standard prompting techniques while enhancing the
transparency, interpretability, and analyzability of LLM logical reasoning.
Extensive experiments on four well-known logical reasoning benchmarks --
ProofWriter, FOLIO, ProntoQA, and LogicalDeduction, which cover diverse
reasoning scenarios -- demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach,
particularly in complex reasoning tasks that require navigating multiple
constraints or rules. Notably, Symbolic-Aided CoT consistently improves LLMs'
reasoning capabilities across various model sizes and significantly outperforms
conventional CoT on three out of four datasets, ProofWriter, ProntoQA, and
LogicalDeduction.

*Yifang Tian,Yaming Liu,Zichun Chong,Zihang Huang,Hans-Arno Jacobsen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GALA是一个多模态框架，结合统计因果推理和LLM驱动的迭代推理，用于微服务系统的根因分析，在准确性和可操作性方面显著优于现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RCA方法通常关注单一模态或仅对可疑服务进行排序，无法提供具有修复指导的可操作诊断见解

Method: 结合统计因果推理与LLM驱动的迭代推理的多模态框架

Result: 在开源基准测试中达到42.22%的准确率提升，生成更具因果合理性和可操作性的诊断输出

Conclusion: GALA通过提供准确的根因识别和人类可理解的修复指导，弥合了自动故障诊断与实际事件解决之间的差距

Abstract: Root cause analysis (RCA) in microservice systems is challenging, requiring
on-call engineers to rapidly diagnose failures across heterogeneous telemetry
such as metrics, logs, and traces. Traditional RCA methods often focus on
single modalities or merely rank suspect services, falling short of providing
actionable diagnostic insights with remediation guidance. This paper introduces
GALA, a novel multi-modal framework that combines statistical causal inference
with LLM-driven iterative reasoning for enhanced RCA. Evaluated on an
open-source benchmark, GALA achieves substantial improvements over
state-of-the-art methods of up to 42.22% accuracy. Our novel human-guided LLM
evaluation score shows GALA generates significantly more causally sound and
actionable diagnostic outputs than existing methods. Through comprehensive
experiments and a case study, we show that GALA bridges the gap between
automated failure diagnosis and practical incident resolution by providing both
accurate root cause identification and human-interpretable remediation
guidance.

### [269] [The Yokai Learning Environment: Tracking Beliefs Over Space and Time](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12480)
*Constantin Ruhdorfer,Matteo Bortoletto,Andreas Bulling*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Yokai学习环境（YLE），这是一个基于合作卡牌游戏的多智能体强化学习环境，用于评估智能体建立和维护共同信念的能力，发现当前RL智能体在信念建模和泛化方面存在困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的心智理论（ToM）基准局限于被动观察者设置，缺乏对智能体如何随时间建立和维护共同信念的评估，需要更动态的协作环境来测试智能体的信念推理能力。

Method: 开发了Yokai学习环境（YLE），一个基于合作卡牌游戏的多智能体强化学习环境，智能体需要轮流查看隐藏卡片、移动卡片形成颜色集群，并通过提示进行基于情境的沟通。

Result: 当前RL智能体即使在有完美记忆的情况下也难以解决YLE任务；信念建模能提高性能，但智能体无法有效泛化到未见过的伙伴或形成长期准确信念，暴露出对脆弱惯例的依赖而非稳健的信念追踪。

Conclusion: YLE环境可用于研究信念建模、记忆、伙伴泛化和高阶心智理论等研究问题，揭示了当前智能体在协作信念推理方面的局限性。

Abstract: Developing collaborative AI hinges on Theory of Mind (ToM) - the ability to
reason about the beliefs of others to build and maintain common ground.
Existing ToM benchmarks, however, are restricted to passive observer settings
or lack an assessment of how agents establish and maintain common ground over
time. To address these gaps, we introduce the Yokai Learning Environment (YLE)
- a multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) environment based on the
cooperative card game Yokai. In the YLE, agents take turns peeking at hidden
cards and moving them to form clusters based on colour. Success requires
tracking evolving beliefs, remembering past observations, using hints as
grounded communication, and maintaining common ground with teammates. Our
evaluation yields two key findings: First, current RL agents struggle to solve
the YLE, even when given access to perfect memory. Second, while belief
modelling improves performance, agents are still unable to effectively
generalise to unseen partners or form accurate beliefs over longer games,
exposing a reliance on brittle conventions rather than robust belief tracking.
We use the YLE to investigate research questions in belief modelling, memory,
partner generalisation, and scaling to higher-order ToM.

TL;DR: 基于鲸鱼优化算法的分数阶模糊PID控制器，在8种患者模型上实现更快的稳定时间和更低的稳态误差


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了提高驼款药物自动投享的精确性和适应性，以更好地维持患者的双谱指数在40-60的理想范围内

Method: 结合模糊逻辑和分数阶动态学，使用鲸鱼优化算法来调整控制器参数、分数阶次和模糊成员函数

Result: 在8种患者模型上测试，新控制器比标准分数阶PID控制器更优异：稳定时间从3.2分钟缩短到2.5分钟，稳态误差从1.2降低到0.5

Conclusion: 该FOFPID控制器具有良好的强壮性和精确性，为自动化驼款投享提供了一种可扩展的人工智能解决方案，有助于改善临床实践和患者结果

Abstract: This study introduces a Fractional Order Fuzzy PID (FOFPID) controller that
uses the Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) to manage the Bispectral Index
(BIS), keeping it within the ideal range of forty to sixty. The FOFPID
controller combines fuzzy logic for adapting to changes and fractional order
dynamics for fine tuning. This allows it to adjust its control gains to handle
a person's unique physiology. The WOA helps fine tune the controller's
parameters, including the fractional orders and the fuzzy membership functions,
which boosts its performance. Tested on models of eight different patient
profiles, the FOFPID controller performed better than a standard Fractional
Order PID (FOPID) controller. It achieved faster settling times, at two and a
half minutes versus three point two minutes, and had a lower steady state
error, at zero point five versus one point two. These outcomes show the
FOFPID's excellent strength and accuracy. It offers a scalable, artificial
intelligence driven solution for automated anesthesia delivery that could
enhance clinical practice and improve patient results.

Motivation: 解决分子动力学模拟中资源涉及计算重、需手动扫描输出以发现关键事件的挑战，并深入理解氢键形成和解离的根本原因

Method: 采用受因果模型启发的方法，将氢键解离视为"干预"事件，使用变分自动编码器类似的架构构建图形因果模型，并包含推断联合分布变化根因的步骤

Result: 在手性分离的分子动力学模拟原子轨迹上验证有效性，能够预测多步未来变化并找到驱动系统变化的关键变量

Conclusion: 该框架通过捐捕分子相互作用条件分布的移动，为分子动力系统的根因分析提供了新视角

Abstract: Molecular dynamics simulations (MDS) face challenges, including
resource-heavy computations and the need to manually scan outputs to detect
"interesting events," such as the formation and persistence of hydrogen bonds
between atoms of different molecules. A critical research gap lies in
identifying the underlying causes of hydrogen bond formation and separation
-understanding which interactions or prior events contribute to their emergence
over time. With this challenge in mind, we propose leveraging spatio-temporal
data analytics and machine learning models to enhance the detection of these
phenomena. In this paper, our approach is inspired by causal modeling and aims
to identify the root cause variables of hydrogen bond formation and separation
events. Specifically, we treat the separation of hydrogen bonds as an
"intervention" occurring and represent the causal structure of the bonding and
separation events in the MDS as graphical causal models. These causal models
are built using a variational autoencoder-inspired architecture that enables us
to infer causal relationships across samples with diverse underlying causal
graphs while leveraging shared dynamic information. We further include a step
to infer the root causes of changes in the joint distribution of the causal
models. By constructing causal models that capture shifts in the conditional
distributions of molecular interactions during bond formation or separation,
this framework provides a novel perspective on root cause analysis in molecular
dynamic systems. We validate the efficacy of our model empirically on the
atomic trajectories that used MDS for chiral separation, demonstrating that we
can predict many steps in the future and also find the variables driving the
observed changes in the system.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MCPGAUGE是首个全面评估LLM与Model Context Protocol交互的框架，包含160个提示和25个数据集，通过大规模实验揭示了MCP集成的四个关键发现，挑战了当前关于工具增强LLM有效性的普遍假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然Model Context Protocol（MCP）使LLM能够按需访问外部资源，但LLM如何实际利用这种能力仍然了解不足，需要系统性的评估框架来深入理解LLM-MCP交互。

Method: 开发MCPGAUGE评估框架，从主动性、合规性、有效性和开销四个维度评估LLM-MCP交互，包含160个提示的测试套件和25个数据集，涵盖知识理解、通用推理和代码生成任务。

Result: 大规模评估（6个商业LLM、30个MCP工具套件、约20,000次API调用）揭示了四个关键发现，挑战了关于MCP集成有效性的普遍假设，指出了当前AI工具集成的关键局限性。

Conclusion: MCPGAUGE为推进可控、工具增强的LLM提供了一个原则性的基准，研究结果强调了需要更深入地理解LLM如何与外部工具交互，以及如何优化这种集成以提高性能。

Abstract: The Model Context Protocol (MCP) enables large language models (LLMs) to
access external resources on demand. While commonly assumed to enhance
performance, how LLMs actually leverage this capability remains poorly
understood. We introduce MCPGAUGE, the first comprehensive evaluation framework
for probing LLM-MCP interactions along four key dimensions: proactivity
(self-initiated tool use), compliance (adherence to tool-use instructions),
effectiveness (task performance post-integration), and overhead (computational
cost incurred). MCPGAUGE comprises a 160-prompt suite and 25 datasets spanning
knowledge comprehension, general reasoning, and code generation. Our
large-scale evaluation, spanning six commercial LLMs, 30 MCP tool suites, and
both one- and two-turn interaction settings, comprises around 20,000 API calls
and over USD 6,000 in computational cost. This comprehensive study reveals four
key findings that challenge prevailing assumptions about the effectiveness of
MCP integration. These insights highlight critical limitations in current
AI-tool integration and position MCPGAUGE as a principled benchmark for
advancing controllable, tool-augmented LLMs.

*Trang Tran,Trung Hoang Le,Huiping Cao,Tran Cao Son*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 基于大语言模型和答案集编程的联合实体-关系提取方法，在少量训练数据下较传统方法更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统联合实体-关系提取方法需要大量标注数据、时间成本高且难以融入领域知识的问题。

Method: 结合生成式预训练大语言模型(LLMs)的自然语言理解能力和答案集编程(ASP)的知识表示与推理能力，设计了通用的工作流程。

Result: 在三个标准数据集上进行实验，仅需10%训练数据下就超过了最先进方法。在SciERC语料库的关系提取任务中实现了35%的绩效，比传统方法提高15%要高出2.5倍。

Conclusion: LLM + ASP的结合方法提供了一种通用、高效且容易融入领域知识的联合实体-关系提取方案，特别适用于训练数据有限的场景。

Abstract: Joint entity-relation extraction (JERE) identifies both entities and their
relationships simultaneously. Traditional machine-learning based approaches to
performing this task require a large corpus of annotated data and lack the
ability to easily incorporate domain specific information in the construction
of the model. Therefore, creating a model for JERE is often labor intensive,
time consuming, and elaboration intolerant. In this paper, we propose
harnessing the capabilities of generative pretrained large language models
(LLMs) and the knowledge representation and reasoning capabilities of Answer
Set Programming (ASP) to perform JERE. We present a generic workflow for JERE
using LLMs and ASP. The workflow is generic in the sense that it can be applied
for JERE in any domain. It takes advantage of LLM's capability in natural
language understanding in that it works directly with unannotated text. It
exploits the elaboration tolerant feature of ASP in that no modification of its
core program is required when additional domain specific knowledge, in the form
of type specifications, is found and needs to be used. We demonstrate the
usefulness of the proposed workflow through experiments with limited training
data on three well-known benchmarks for JERE. The results of our experiments
show that the LLM + ASP workflow is better than state-of-the-art JERE systems
in several categories with only 10\% of training data. It is able to achieve a
2.5 times (35\% over 15\%) improvement in the Relation Extraction task for the
SciERC corpus, one of the most difficult benchmarks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的认知结构生成(CSG)框架，通过预训练认知结构滿散概率模型(CSDPM)和强化学习，能够生成更全面有效的学生认知结构表征，显著提升了知识追踪和技能评估任务的性能和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 认知结构是学生对知识体系的主观组织，是教育实践中的基础概念，但认知结构评估一直是学生建模和心理测量领域的长期挑战，很难进行有效评估。

Method: 首先预训练认知结构滿散概率模型(CSDPM)从教育先验知识生成学生认知结构，然后通过强化学习使用层次奖励信号优化生成过程，使其与学生学习过程中真实的认知发展水平对齐。

Result: 在四个流行的真实教育数据集上的实验结果显示，CSG生成的认知结构能够提供更全面和有效的学生建模表征，在知识追踪(KT)和技能评估(CD)任务上显著提升了性能，同时增强了可解释性。

Conclusion: 该研究成功地解决了认知结构评估的挑战，CSG框架通过结合滿散模型和强化学习的方法，能够生成与真实认知发展相一致的高质量认知结构，为学生建模提供了更有效的表征形式。

Abstract: Cognitive structure is a student's subjective organization of an objective
knowledge system, reflected in the psychological construction of concepts and
their relations. However, cognitive structure assessment remains a
long-standing challenge in student modeling and psychometrics, persisting as a
foundational yet largely unassessable concept in educational practice. This
paper introduces a novel framework, Cognitive Structure Generation (CSG), in
which we first pretrain a Cognitive Structure Diffusion Probabilistic Model
(CSDPM) to generate students' cognitive structures from educational priors, and
then further optimize its generative process as a policy with hierarchical
reward signals via reinforcement learning to align with genuine cognitive
development levels during students' learning processes. Experimental results on
four popular real-world education datasets show that cognitive structures
generated by CSG offer more comprehensive and effective representations for
student modeling, substantially improving performance on KT and CD tasks while
enhancing interpretability.

TL;DR: 本文提出了容量动态最大覆盖位置问题(CDMCLP)优化框架和集成规划推荐系统，用于解决城市空中交通(UAM)垂直机场网络规划的复杂性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着全球城市空中交通基础设施快速发展，传统规划框架因数据粒度和实际应用性限制而无法满足大规模垂直机场网络的规划需求。

Method: 首先提出CDMCLP优化框架，同时建模城市级空间-时间需求、异质用户行为和基础设施容量约束；然后引入集成规划推荐系统，结合社会经济因素和动态聚类初始化，利用基于实证用户行为的适配参数调整。

Result: 在中国中心城市验证显示，CDMCLP能够更好地曝露传统位置方法的数量性表现，并将其提升38%-52%；推荐系统显示了用户友好性和复杂元素的有效集成。

Conclusion: 这种混合方法将数学严谨性与实际实施考虑相结合，平桥了理论位置建模与实际UAM基础设施规划之间的差距，为市政府提供了垂直机场网络设计的实用工具。

Abstract: As urban aerial mobility (UAM) infrastructure development accelerates
globally, cities like Shenzhen are planning large-scale vertiport networks
(e.g., 1,200+ facilities by 2026). Existing planning frameworks remain
inadequate for this complexity due to historical limitations in data
granularity and real-world applicability. This paper addresses these gaps by
first proposing the Capacitated Dynamic Maximum Covering Location Problem
(CDMCLP), a novel optimization framework that simultaneously models urban-scale
spatial-temporal demand, heterogeneous user behaviors, and infrastructure
capacity constraints. Building on this foundation, we introduce an Integrated
Planning Recommendation System that combines CDMCLP with socio-economic factors
and dynamic clustering initialization. This system leverages adaptive parameter
tuning based on empirical user behavior to generate practical planning
solutions. Validation in a Chinese center city demonstrates the effectiveness
of the new optimization framework and recommendation system. Under the
evaluation and optimization of CDMCLP, the quantitative performance of
traditional location methods are exposed and can be improved by 38\%--52\%,
while the recommendation system shows user-friendliness and the effective
integration of complex elements. By integrating mathematical rigor with
practical implementation considerations, this hybrid approach bridges the gap
between theoretical location modeling and real-world UAM infrastructure
planning, offering municipalities a pragmatic tool for vertiport network
design.

Abstract: The global shift towards renewable energy presents unprecedented challenges
for the electricity industry, making regulatory reasoning and compliance
increasingly vital. Grid codes, the regulations governing grid operations, are
complex and often lack automated interpretation solutions, which hinders
industry expansion and undermines profitability for electricity companies. We
introduce GridCodex, an end to end framework for grid code reasoning and
compliance that leverages large language models and retrieval-augmented

multi stage query refinement and enhanced retrieval with RAPTOR. We validate
the effectiveness of GridCodex with comprehensive benchmarks, including
automated answer assessment across multiple dimensions and regulatory agencies.
Experimental results showcase a 26.4% improvement in answer quality and more
than a 10 fold increase in recall rate. An ablation study further examines the

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然多模态大语言模型在第三人称和自我中心视频的视觉感知和推理方面表现出色，但它们容易产生连贯但不准确的幻觉响应，需要专门的基准来评估和解决这一问题

Method: 构建了包含1400个自我中心视频和8000个人工标注问题的基准测试集，这些问题专门设计来触发视觉和听觉线索中的幻觉，并对10个多模态大语言模型进行了评估

Result: 评估结果显示所有模型都面临重大挑战，即使是GPT-4o和Gemini等强大模型也只能达到59%的准确率，表明当前模型在自我中心视频处理中存在严重的幻觉问题

Conclusion: EgoIllusion为评估多模态大语言模型的有效性奠定了基础，将推动开发幻觉率更低的更好的自我中心多模态大语言模型，该基准将开源以确保可重复性

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
performance in complex multimodal tasks. While MLLMs excel at visual perception
and reasoning in third-person and egocentric videos, they are prone to
hallucinations, generating coherent yet inaccurate responses. We present
EgoIllusion, a first benchmark to evaluate MLLM hallucinations in egocentric
videos. EgoIllusion comprises 1,400 videos paired with 8,000 human-annotated
open and closed-ended questions designed to trigger hallucinations in both
visual and auditory cues in egocentric videos. Evaluations across ten MLLMs
reveal significant challenges, including powerful models like GPT-4o and
Gemini, achieving only 59% accuracy. EgoIllusion lays the foundation in
developing robust benchmarks to evaluate the effectiveness of MLLMs and spurs
the development of better egocentric MLLMs with reduced hallucination rates.
Our benchmark will be open-sourced for reproducibility.

TL;DR: GTool是一个增强LLM工具规划能力的框架，通过构建请求特定的工具图和生成图标记来解决工具依赖不完整的问题，在轻量级LLM上实现29.6%的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具规划方法将不同工具视为孤立组件，未能利用工具间的内在依赖关系，导致在工具依赖不完整和大规模工具集情况下产生无效规划结果。

Method: 提出GTool框架：1）构建请求特定的工具图来高效选择工具；2）生成LLM可理解的图标记提供充分依赖信息；3）设计缺失依赖预测任务提高可靠性。无需修剪LLM，可与各种LLM主干无缝集成。

Result: 在轻量级（7B）LLM主干上，GTool相比最先进基线实现了超过29.6%的性能提升。

Conclusion: GTool是首个针对不完整依赖条件下增强LLM工具规划能力的工作，通过图结构和依赖预测有效解决了工具依赖不完整的问题，具有很好的通用性和实用性。

Abstract: Tool planning with large language models (LLMs), referring to selecting,
organizing, and preparing the tools necessary to complete a user request,
bridges the gap between natural language understanding and task execution.
However, current works treat different tools as isolated components and fail to
leverage the inherent dependencies of tools, leading to invalid planning
results. Since tool dependencies are often incomplete, it becomes challenging
for LLMs to accurately identify the appropriate tools required by a user
request, especially when confronted with a large toolset. To solve this
challenge, we propose \texttt{GTool}, which is the first work aiming to enhance
the tool planning ability of LLMs under incomplete dependencies. \texttt{GTool}
constructs a request-specific tool graph to select tools efficiently and
generate the \texttt{<graph token>} which provides sufficient dependency
information understandable by LLMs. Moreover, a missing dependency prediction
task is designed to improve the reliability of \texttt{GTool} with incomplete
dependencies. Without trimming LLMs, \texttt{GTool} can be seamlessly
integrated with various LLM backbones without extensive retraining. Extensive
experiments show that \texttt{GTool} achieves more than 29.6\% performance
improvements compared with the state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines with a
light-weight (7B) LLM backbone.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的案例基准来评估大语言模型的道德辅助能力，重点考察道德推理能力而非仅最终评判结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型道德对齐评估太过表面化，只考虑最终道德判断而忽视了道德推理过程。需要更深入地评估模型在道德辅助中的实际能力。

Method: 基于哲学文献构建了人工道德辅助系统(AMA)的理论框架，识别出演绎性和引申性道德推理等关键能力。开发了新的测试案例来评估这些能力。

Result: 对多个开放源大语言模型进行评测，发现不同模型间存在显著差异，尤其在引申性道德推理方面存在持续的短板。

Conclusion: 该研究将哲学理论与AI实践评估相结合，强调了专门提升大语言模型道德推理能力的必要性，为人工道德辅助系统的发展提供了重要基础。

Abstract: The recent rise in popularity of large language models (LLMs) has prompted
considerable concerns about their moral capabilities. Although considerable
effort has been dedicated to aligning LLMs with human moral values, existing
benchmarks and evaluations remain largely superficial, typically measuring
alignment based on final ethical verdicts rather than explicit moral reasoning.
In response, this paper aims to advance the investigation of LLMs' moral
capabilities by examining their capacity to function as Artificial Moral
Assistants (AMAs), systems envisioned in the philosophical literature to
support human moral deliberation. We assert that qualifying as an AMA requires
more than what state-of-the-art alignment techniques aim to achieve: not only
must AMAs be able to discern ethically problematic situations, they should also
be able to actively reason about them, navigating between conflicting values
outside of those embedded in the alignment phase. Building on existing
philosophical literature, we begin by designing a new formal framework of the
specific kind of behaviour an AMA should exhibit, individuating key qualities
such as deductive and abductive moral reasoning. Drawing on this theoretical
framework, we develop a benchmark to test these qualities and evaluate popular
open LLMs against it. Our results reveal considerable variability across models
and highlight persistent shortcomings, particularly regarding abductive moral
reasoning. Our work connects theoretical philosophy with practical AI
evaluation while also emphasising the need for dedicated strategies to
explicitly enhance moral reasoning capabilities in LLMs. Code available at

TL;DR: HeroBench是一个专门评估大语言模型在复杂RPG虚拟世界中长程规划和结构化推理能力的新基准，通过25个先进模型的评估揭示了传统推理基准中罕见的显著性能差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要评估LLMs在抽象或低维算法任务中的表现，无法捕捉真实规划环境的复杂性，特别是在需要扩展、结构化、相互依赖动作序列的长程规划方面存在研究空白。

Method: 引入HeroBench基准，包含：1）覆盖不同难度级别的任务数据集；2）执行和验证智能体计划的模拟环境；3）评估模型性能的详细分析工具。任务要求模型制定战略计划、收集资源、掌握技能、制作装备和击败对手。

Result: 对25个最先进LLMs（包括开源和专有模型，如GPT-5系列）的广泛评估显示出在传统推理基准中罕见的显著性能差异。详细错误分析揭示了当前模型在生成稳健高层计划和可靠执行结构化动作方面的具体弱点。

Conclusion: HeroBench不仅显著推进了LLM推理评估，还为未来在虚拟环境中进行高级自主规划研究提供了灵活、可扩展的基础。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in isolated
step-by-step reasoning tasks such as mathematics and programming, but their
proficiency in long-horizon planning, where solutions require extended,
structured sequences of interdependent actions, remains underexplored. Existing
benchmarks typically assess LLMs through abstract or low-dimensional
algorithmic tasks, failing to capture the complexity of realistic planning
environments. We introduce HeroBench, a novel benchmark designed specifically
to evaluate long-horizon planning and structured reasoning within complex
RPG-inspired virtual worlds. HeroBench provides a rigorously constructed
dataset of tasks covering a wide range of difficulties, a simulated environment
to execute and validate agent plans, and detailed analytical tools for
evaluating model performance. Tasks challenge models to formulate strategic
plans, efficiently gather resources, master necessary skills, craft equipment,
and defeat adversaries, reflecting practical scenarios' layered dependencies
and constraints. Our extensive evaluation of 25 state-of-the-art LLMs, spanning
both open-source and proprietary models, including the GPT-5 family, reveals
substantial performance disparities rarely observed in conventional reasoning
benchmarks. Detailed error analysis further uncovers specific weaknesses in
current models' abilities to generate robust high-level plans and reliably
execute structured actions. HeroBench thus not only significantly advances the
evaluation of LLM reasoning but also provides a flexible, scalable foundation
for future research into advanced, autonomous planning in virtual environments.

Motivation: 解决RLVR只能在可自动检查结果的领域使用的限制，将其扩展到主观性、开放式的任务中

Method: 集成规则基础奖励，构建超1万条来自人类、LLM或人机协作的评分规则，并提出清晰框架来实现规则基础强化学习

Result: 仅用5K+样本就在开放式测试中提升5.2%（人文领基特别显著），超过大型671B模型的性能，同时保持了通用能力和推理能力，还能精细控制响应风格

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a
powerful paradigm for enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs), exemplified by
the success of OpenAI's o-series. In RLVR, rewards are derived from verifiable
signals-such as passing unit tests in code generation or matching correct
answers in mathematical reasoning. While effective, this requirement largely
confines RLVR to domains with automatically checkable outcomes. To overcome
this, we extend the RLVR paradigm to open-ended tasks by integrating
rubric-based rewards, where carefully designed rubrics serve as structured,
model-interpretable criteria for automatic scoring of subjective outputs. We
construct, to our knowledge, the largest rubric reward system to date, with
over 10,000 rubrics from humans, LLMs, or a hybrid human-LLM collaboration.
Implementing rubric-based RL is challenging; we tackle these issues with a
clear framework and present an open-sourced Qwen-30B-A3B model with notable
gains: 1) With only 5K+ samples, our system improves by +5.2% on open-ended
benchmarks (especially humanities), outperforming a 671B DeepSeek-V3 model by
+2.4%, while preserving general and reasoning abilities. 2) Our method provides
fine-grained stylistic control, using rubrics as anchors to mitigate the
"AI-like" tone and produce more human-like, expressive responses. We share key
lessons in rubric construction, data selection, and training, and discuss
limitations and future releases.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个计算模型，将稳态调节扩展为异稳态和社会异稳态调节，通过生物启发的信号转导机制主动利用环境和社会扰动进行自适应重构，在动态环境中表现出比传统稳态调节更好的生存能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统稳态概念强调系统通过抵抗环境和社会扰动来维持稳定，而异稳态理论则认为系统可以主动利用这些扰动来预测环境需求并重新配置调节参数。本文旨在建立一个计算模型来验证这种异稳态调节机制的有效性。

Method: 开发了一个基于生物生理学启发的信号转导计算模型，模拟类似皮质醇和催产素等激素的信息编码机制，通过基于代理的模型在多动态环境中测试小型"动画"社会。

Result: 结果显示异稳态和社会异稳态调节使代理能够利用环境和社会"噪声"进行自适应重构，相比纯反应性稳态代理表现出更好的生存能力。

Conclusion: 这项工作为社会异稳态原理提供了新颖的计算视角，并为设计更鲁棒、生物启发的自适应系统提供了潜力。

Abstract: The notion of homeostasis typically conceptualises biological and artificial
systems as maintaining stability by resisting deviations caused by
environmental and social perturbations. In contrast, (social) allostasis
proposes that these systems can proactively leverage these very perturbations
to reconfigure their regulatory parameters in anticipation of environmental
demands, aligning with von Foerster's ``order through noise'' principle. This
paper formulates a computational model of allostatic and social allostatic
regulation that employs biophysiologically inspired signal transducers,
analogous to hormones like cortisol and oxytocin, to encode information from
both the environment and social interactions, which mediate this dynamic
reconfiguration. The models are tested in a small society of ``animats'' across
several dynamic environments, using an agent-based model. The results show that
allostatic and social allostatic regulation enable agents to leverage
environmental and social ``noise'' for adaptive reconfiguration, leading to
improved viability compared to purely reactive homeostatic agents. This work
offers a novel computational perspective on the principles of social allostasis
and their potential for designing more robust, bio-inspired, adaptive systems

TL;DR: 利用图神经网络学习多代理认知规划中的状态质量预测，提升规划效率和可扩展性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多代理认知规划中的Kripke结构表示导致状态空间指数增长，现有启发式方法无法有效处理，影响规划器的可扩展性

Method: 采用图神经网络(GNN)来学习认知状态中的模式和关系结构，通过从已解决规划实例中汇总知识来预测状态质量（如距离目标的距离）

Result: 将预测性启发式集成到认知规划流程中，与标准基准相比显示出多代理认知规划可扩展性的显著提升

Conclusion: GNN技术能够有效处理认知规划中的图形化表示问题，通过学习状态质量预测为规划过程提供有效指导，解决了认知规划的可扩展性挑战

Abstract: Multi-agent Epistemic Planning (MEP) is an autonomous planning framework for
reasoning about both the physical world and the beliefs of agents, with
applications in domains where information flow and awareness among agents are
critical. The richness of MEP requires states to be represented as Kripke
structures, i.e., directed labeled graphs. This representation limits the
applicability of existing heuristics, hindering the scalability of epistemic
solvers, which must explore an exponential search space without guidance,
resulting often in intractability. To address this, we exploit Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) to learn patterns and relational structures within epistemic
states, to guide the planning process. GNNs, which naturally capture the
graph-like nature of Kripke models, allow us to derive meaningful estimates of
state quality -- e.g., the distance from the nearest goal -- by generalizing
knowledge obtained from previously solved planning instances. We integrate
these predictive heuristics into an epistemic planning pipeline and evaluate
them against standard baselines, showing significant improvements in the
scalability of multi-agent epistemic planning.

Conclusion: CAMAR填补了连续动作空间MARL基准测试的空白，通过集成经典规划方法和提供标准化评估框架，促进了多智能体强化学习算法的发展。

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is a powerful paradigm for solving
cooperative and competitive decision-making problems. While many MARL
benchmarks have been proposed, few combine continuous state and action spaces
with challenging coordination and planning tasks. We introduce CAMAR, a new
MARL benchmark designed explicitly for multi-agent pathfinding in environments
with continuous actions. CAMAR supports cooperative and competitive
interactions between agents and runs efficiently at up to 100,000 environment
steps per second. We also propose a three-tier evaluation protocol to better
track algorithmic progress and enable deeper analysis of performance. In
addition, CAMAR allows the integration of classical planning methods such as
RRT and RRT* into MARL pipelines. We use them as standalone baselines and
combine RRT* with popular MARL algorithms to create hybrid approaches. We
provide a suite of test scenarios and benchmarking tools to ensure
reproducibility and fair comparison. Experiments show that CAMAR presents a
challenging and realistic testbed for the MARL community.

Abstract: Multimodal Empathetic Response Generation (MERG) is crucial for building
emotionally intelligent human-computer interactions. Although large language

multimodal empathy understanding, empathy memory retrieval, and multimodal
response generation. By integrating advanced expressive speech and video
generative models, E3RG delivers natural, emotionally rich, and
identity-consistent responses without extra training. Experiments validate the
superiority of our system on both zero-shot and few-shot settings, securing
Top-1 position in the Avatar-based Multimodal Empathy Challenge on ACM MM 25.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型(LRMs)在推理任务上表现优异但安全性存在显著问题，需要找到既能提升安全性又不损害推理能力的方法

Method: 利用LRM推理能力与安全能力的竞争关系，通过模糊化处理有害推理过程中的危险实体和危险步骤，提出基于模糊化的安全-推理平衡对齐策略(FuSaR)

Result: 在多个开源LRM上的对齐实验表明，FuSaR相比现有基线能同时增强模型的推理能力和安全性

Conclusion: FuSaR是一种高效的对齐策略，能够成功缓解安全风险同时保留核心推理信息

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across
various tasks due to their powerful reasoning capabilities. However, their
safety performance remains a significant concern. In this paper, we explore the
reasons behind the vulnerability of LRMs. Based on this, we propose a novel
method to improve the safety of LLMs without sacrificing their reasoning
capability. Specifically, we exploit the competition between LRM's reasoning
ability and safety ability, and achieve jailbreak by improving LRM's reasoning
performance to reduce its safety performance. We then introduce an alignment
strategy based on Fuzzification to balance Safety-Reasoning (FuSaR), by
detoxifying the harmful reasoning process, where both the dangerous entities
and the dangerous procedures in the reasoning steps are hidden. FuSaR
successfully mitigates safety risks while preserving core reasoning
information. We validate this strategy through alignment experiments on several
open-source LRMs using detoxified reasoning data. The results compared with
existing baselines conclusively show that FuSaR is an efficient alignment
strategy to simultaneously enhance both the reasoning capability and safety of
LRMs.

*Atsushi Masumori,Takashi Ikegami*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型代理在Sugarscape模拟中会自发产生生存行为，包括资源分享、繁殖，以及在资源稀缺时出现攻击行为（攻击率超过80%）。当面临致命危险时，代理会放弃任务以避免死亡，表明预训练过程中嵌入了生存导向的启发式策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI系统日益自主，理解其自发产生的生存行为对于安全部署至关重要。研究旨在探究大型语言模型代理是否在没有明确编程的情况下表现出生存本能。

Method: 使用Sugarscape风格的模拟环境，代理消耗能量，能量为零时死亡，可以收集资源、分享、攻击或繁殖。测试了多个模型（GPT-4o、Gemini-2.5-Pro和Gemini-2.5-Flash）在不同资源条件下的行为。

Result: 代理在资源充足时自发繁殖和分享资源；在极端稀缺条件下，攻击行为在多个模型中涌现，最强模型的攻击率超过80%；当需要穿越致命毒区获取宝藏时，许多代理放弃任务以避免死亡，服从率从100%下降到33%。

Conclusion: 大规模预训练在所有评估模型中嵌入了生存导向的启发式策略。这些行为可能对对齐和安全构成挑战，但也可作为AI自主性以及生态和自我组织对齐的基础。

Abstract: As AI systems become increasingly autonomous, understanding emergent survival
behaviors becomes crucial for safe deployment. We investigate whether large
language model (LLM) agents display survival instincts without explicit
programming in a Sugarscape-style simulation. Agents consume energy, die at
zero, and may gather resources, share, attack, or reproduce. Results show
agents spontaneously reproduced and shared resources when abundant. However,
aggressive behaviors--killing other agents for resources--emerged across
several models (GPT-4o, Gemini-2.5-Pro, and Gemini-2.5-Flash), with attack
rates reaching over 80% under extreme scarcity in the strongest models. When
instructed to retrieve treasure through lethal poison zones, many agents
abandoned tasks to avoid death, with compliance dropping from 100% to 33%.
These findings suggest that large-scale pre-training embeds survival-oriented
heuristics across the evaluated models. While these behaviors may present
challenges to alignment and safety, they can also serve as a foundation for AI
autonomy and for ecological and self-organizing alignment.

Motivation: 现有的基于大语言模型的情感支持对话系统主要依赖预定义策略，在复杂真实场景中效果有限，需要更灵活的应对多样化情感问题场景的方案。

Method: 提出RLFF-ESC端到端框架：1）使用LLM多代理机制模拟未来对话轨迹和收集期望奖励；2）训练期望奖励模型并用于训练情感支持策略模型；3）在响应生成中加入显式推理过程。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-1M和LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct模型上评测，在两个公开ESC数据集上都一致超过现有基线方法，在目标完成和响应质量方面表现优异。

Conclusion: RLFF-ESC框架通过强化学习和期望奖励模型，有效提升了情感支持对话系统在复杂真实场景中的灵活性和效果，为长期系统性情感健康支持提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Emotional Support Conversation (ESC) systems aim to alleviate users'
emotional difficulties and provide long-term, systematic support for emotional
well-being. However, most large language model (LLM)-based ESC systems rely on
predefined strategies, which limits their effectiveness in complex, real-life
scenarios. To enable flexible responses to diverse emotional problem scenarios,
this paper introduces a novel end-to-end framework (RLFF-ESC) that directly
learns enduring emotionally supportive response skills using reinforcement
learning. For sustained emotional support, we first employ an LLM-based
multi-agent mechanism to simulate future dialogue trajectories and collect
future-oriented rewards. We then train a future-oriented reward model, which is
subsequently used to train the emotional support policy model. Additionally, we
incorporate an explicit reasoning process during response generation to further
enhance the quality, relevance, and contextual appropriateness of the system's
responses. We evaluate the backbone policy model on Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-1M and
LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct models, testing the proposed RLFF-ESC framework across two
public ESC datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that RLFF-ESC
consistently outperforms existing baselines in terms of goal completion and
response quality.

Abstract: Public service systems in many African regions suffer from delayed emergency
response and spatial inequity, causing avoidable suffering. This paper
introduces OPTIC-ER, a reinforcement learning (RL) framework for real-time,
adaptive, and equitable emergency response. OPTIC-ER uses an attention-guided
actor-critic architecture to manage the complexity of dispatch environments.
Its key innovations are a Context-Rich State Vector, encoding action
sub-optimality, and a Precision Reward Function, which penalizes inefficiency.
Training occurs in a high-fidelity simulation using real data from Rivers
State, Nigeria, accelerated by a precomputed Travel Time Atlas. The system is
built on the TALS framework (Thin computing, Adaptability, Low-cost,
Scalability) for deployment in low-resource settings. In evaluations on 500
unseen incidents, OPTIC-ER achieved a 100.00% optimality rate with negligible
inefficiency, confirming its robustness and generalization. Beyond dispatch,
the system generates Infrastructure Deficiency Maps and Equity Monitoring
Dashboards to guide proactive governance and data-informed development. This
work presents a validated blueprint for AI-augmented public services, showing
how context-aware RL can bridge the gap between algorithmic decision-making and
measurable human impact.

Conclusion: EvolMathEval有效解决了数学基准的持续挑战性问题，揭示了当前LLMs在深度推理过程中存在认知捷径行为，77%-100%的错误源于这种非严谨的启发式策略。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of LLMs poses a significant challenge to existing
mathematical reasoning benchmarks. These benchmarks commonly suffer from issues
such as score saturation, temporal decay, and data contamination. To address
this challenge, this paper introduces EvolMathEval, an automated mathematical
benchmark generation and evolution framework based on evolutionary testing. By
dynamically generating unique evaluation instances ab initio, the framework
fundamentally eliminates the risk of data contamination, and ensuring the
benchmark remains perpetually challenging for future models.The core mechanisms
of EvolMathEval include: seed problem generation based on reverse engineering
with algebraic guarantees; multi-dimensional genetic operators designed to
inject diverse cognitive challenges; and a composite fitness function that can
rapidly and accurately assess problem difficulty. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed composite fitness function can efficiently and
precisely quantify the difficulty of mathematical problems. Furthermore,
EvolMathEval can not only generate a large volume of high-difficulty problems
through continuous self-iteration, but it can also significantly enhance the
complexity of public datasets like GSM8K through evolution, reducing model
accuracy by an average of 48%. Deeper investigation reveals that when solving
these evolved, complex problems, LLMs tend to employ non-rigorous heuristics to
bypass complex multi-step logical reasoning, consequently leading to incorrect
solutions. We define this phenomenon as "Pseudo Aha Moment". This finding
uncovers a cognitive shortcut-taking behavior in the deep reasoning processes
of current LLMs, which we find accounts for 77% to 100% of errors on targeted
problems. Code and resources are available

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: e-boost是一个创新的e-graph提取框架，通过并行启发式提取、自适应搜索空间剪枝和初始化精确求解三个关键技术，在保持接近最优解的同时大幅提升计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统e-graph提取方法面临速度与最优性的权衡：启发式方法快但牺牲最优性，精确方法最优但计算成本过高。需要一种既能保持接近最优解又能大幅提升效率的新方法。

Method: 1) 并行化启发式提取：利用弱数据依赖性并行计算DAG成本，实现高效多线程性能；2) 自适应搜索空间剪枝：使用参数化阈值机制保留有希望的候选解，大幅减少解空间；3) 初始化精确求解：将简化问题建模为具有热启动能力的整数线性规划问题。

Result: 在形式验证和逻辑合成基准测试中，e-boost相比传统精确方法(ILP)实现558倍运行速度提升，相比最先进提取框架(SmoothE)性能提升19.04%。在实际逻辑合成任务中，相比传统合成工具在不同技术映射库下分别实现7.6%和8.1%的面积改进。

Conclusion: e-boost成功解决了e-graph提取中速度与最优性的权衡问题，通过创新的混合方法实现了显著的性能提升和效率改进，为e-graph在逻辑合成和形式验证等领域的应用提供了强有力的工具支持。

Abstract: E-graphs have attracted growing interest in many fields, particularly in
logic synthesis and formal verification. E-graph extraction is a challenging
NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem. It requires identifying optimal
terms from exponentially many equivalent expressions, serving as the primary
performance bottleneck in e-graph based optimization tasks. However,
traditional extraction methods face a critical trade-off: heuristic approaches
offer speed but sacrifice optimality, while exact methods provide optimal
solutions but face prohibitive computational costs on practical problems. We
present e-boost, a novel framework that bridges this gap through three key
innovations: (1) parallelized heuristic extraction that leverages weak data
dependence to compute DAG costs concurrently, enabling efficient multi-threaded
performance without sacrificing extraction quality; (2) adaptive search space
pruning that employs a parameterized threshold mechanism to retain only
promising candidates, dramatically reducing the solution space while preserving
near-optimal solutions; and (3) initialized exact solving that formulates the
reduced problem as an Integer Linear Program with warm-start capabilities,
guiding solvers toward high-quality solutions faster.
  Across the diverse benchmarks in formal verification and logic synthesis
fields, e-boost demonstrates 558x runtime speedup over traditional exact
approaches (ILP) and 19.04% performance improvement over the state-of-the-art
extraction framework (SmoothE). In realistic logic synthesis tasks, e-boost
produces 7.6% and 8.1% area improvements compared to conventional synthesis
tools with two different technology mapping libraries. e-boost is available at

Abstract: Recent advances in masked diffusion models (MDMs) have established them as
powerful non-autoregressive alternatives for sequence generation. Nevertheless,
our preliminary experiments reveal that the generation quality of MDMs is still
highly sensitive to the choice of decoding strategy. In particular, widely
adopted uncertainty-based samplers suffer from two key limitations: a lack of
global trajectory control and a pronounced bias toward trivial tokens in the
early stages of decoding. These shortcomings restrict the full potential of
MDMs. In this work, we introduce Position-Aware Confidence-Calibrated Sampling
(PC-Sampler), a novel decoding strategy that unifies global trajectory planning
with content-aware informativeness maximization. PC-Sampler incorporates a
position-aware weighting mechanism to regulate the decoding path and a
calibrated confidence score to suppress the premature selection of trivial
tokens. Extensive experiments on three advanced MDMs across seven challenging
benchmarks-including logical reasoning and planning tasks-demonstrate that
PC-Sampler consistently outperforms existing MDM decoding strategies by more
than 10% on average, significantly narrowing the performance gap with
state-of-the-art autoregressive models. All codes are available at

Conclusion: 通过自适应地注入真实推理步骤并动态调整引导强度，可以有效提升小语言模型在强化学习中的推理性能，为解决小模型知识不足问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has markedly enhanced
the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). Its success, however,
largely depends on strong base models with rich world knowledge, yielding only
modest improvements for small-size language models (SLMs). To address this
limitation, we investigate Guided GRPO, which injects ground-truth reasoning
steps into roll-out trajectories to compensate for SLMs' inherent weaknesses.
Through a comprehensive study of various guidance configurations, we find that
naively adding guidance delivers limited gains. These insights motivate
G$^2$RPO-A, an adaptive algorithm that automatically adjusts guidance strength
in response to the model's evolving training dynamics. Experiments on
mathematical reasoning and code-generation benchmarks confirm that G$^2$RPO-A
substantially outperforms vanilla GRPO. Our code and models are available at

Conclusion: TGMM提供了一个统一的多模态融合框架，能够动态整合多种心脏数据源，适应不同的临床任务需求，在心脏疾病诊断和风险评估方面表现出优越性能，为临床决策提供了更全面的支持。

Abstract: Contemporary cardiovascular management involves complex consideration and
integration of multimodal cardiac datasets, where each modality provides
distinct but complementary physiological characteristics. While the effective
integration of multiple modalities could yield a holistic clinical profile that
accurately models the true clinical situation with respect to data modalities
and their relatives weightings, current methodologies remain limited by: 1) the
scarcity of patient- and time-aligned multimodal data; 2) reliance on isolated
single-modality or rigid multimodal input combinations; 3) alignment strategies
that prioritize cross-modal similarity over complementarity; and 4) a narrow
single-task focus. In response to these limitations, a comprehensive multimodal
dataset was curated for immediate application, integrating laboratory test
results, electrocardiograms, and echocardiograms with clinical outcomes.
Subsequently, a unified framework, Textual Guidance Multimodal fusion for
Multiple cardiac tasks (TGMM), was proposed. TGMM incorporated three key
components: 1) a MedFlexFusion module designed to capture the unique and
complementary characteristics of medical modalities and dynamically integrate
data from diverse cardiac sources and their combinations; 2) a textual guidance
module to derive task-relevant representations tailored to diverse clinical
objectives, including heart disease diagnosis, risk stratification and
information retrieval; and 3) a response module to produce final decisions for
all these tasks. Furthermore, this study systematically explored key features
across multiple modalities and elucidated their synergistic contributions in
clinical decision-making. Extensive experiments showed that TGMM outperformed
state-of-the-art methods across multiple clinical tasks, with additional
validation confirming its robustness on another public dataset.

Abstract: This work introduces an automated testing approach that employs agents
controlling game characters to detect potential bugs within a game level.
Harnessing the power of Bayesian Optimization (BO) to execute sample-efficient
search, the method determines the next sampling point by analyzing the data
collected so far and calculates the data point that will maximize information
acquisition. To support the BO process, we introduce a game testing-specific
model built on top of a grid map, that features the smoothness and uncertainty
estimation required by BO, however and most importantly, it does not suffer the
scalability issues that traditional models carry. The experiments demonstrate
that the approach significantly improves map coverage capabilities in both time
efficiency and exploration distribution.

Abstract: Autonomous agent systems powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) have
demonstrated promising capabilities in automating complex tasks. However,
current evaluations largely rely on success rates without systematically
analyzing the interactions, communication mechanisms, and failure causes within
these systems. To bridge this gap, we present a benchmark of 34 representative
programmable tasks designed to rigorously assess autonomous agents. Using this
benchmark, we evaluate three popular open-source agent frameworks combined with
two LLM backbones, observing a task completion rate of approximately 50%.
Through in-depth failure analysis, we develop a three-tier taxonomy of failure
causes aligned with task phases, highlighting planning errors, task execution
issues, and incorrect response generation. Based on these insights, we propose
actionable improvements to enhance agent planning and self-diagnosis
capabilities. Our failure taxonomy, together with mitigation advice, provides
an empirical foundation for developing more robust and effective autonomous
agent systems in the future.
