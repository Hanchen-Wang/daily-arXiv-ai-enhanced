TL;DR: CHAIR-DPO方法利用CHAIR指标构建偏好数据，通过直接偏好优化(DPO)减少多模态大语言模型的幻觉问题，在多个基准测试中有效降低了幻觉答案数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型(MLLMs)虽然在各种基准测试中表现出色，但长期存在幻觉问题，即生成与视觉输入不符的答案。本文将其视为对齐问题，旨在引导MLLM更倾向于生成无幻觉内容。

Method: 利用CHAIR指标（原本用于图像字幕幻觉评估）来区分生成答案中的胜者和败者选项（无幻觉和幻觉样本），然后通过直接偏好优化(DPO)对现成的MLLMs进行微调。

Result: CHAIR-DPO方法在多个幻觉基准测试中有效减少了幻觉答案的数量，证明了基于CHAIR奖励微调MLLM的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种简单有效的解决方案，无需复杂的合成偏好数据构建流程，也不依赖专有模型，成功降低了MLLMs的幻觉问题。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) emerge as a unified interface to
address a multitude of tasks, ranging from NLP to computer vision. Despite
showcasing state-of-the-art results in many benchmarks, a long-standing issue
is the tendency of MLLMs to hallucinate, that is to generate answers to the
user's query that are not reflected in the visual input. In this paper, we
address the problem of hallucinations as an alignment problem, seeking to steer
the MLLM so that it prefers generating content without hallucinations. In
contrast to recent approaches that require complicated pipelines to build
synthetic preference data for alignment training, often relying on proprietary
models, we capitalize on the well-known CHAIR metric, originally proposed to
gauge the degree of hallucinations in image captioning. Given a pair of
generated answers, we leverage CHAIR to distinguish winner and loser options
(i.e., non-hallucinated and hallucinated samples) and fine-tune off-the-shelf
MLLMs via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). The resulting method, which we
refer to as CHAIR-DPO, effectively diminishes the amount of hallucinated
answers on several hallucination benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of
fine-tuning the MLLM with a CHAIR-based reward. Source code and trained models
are publicly available at https://github.com/aimagelab/CHAIR-DPO.

### [2] [SDiFL: Stable Diffusion-Driven Framework for Image Forgery Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20182)
*Yang Su,Shunquan Tan,Jiwu Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 基于Stable Diffusion 3的多模态框架，通过将伪造残差作为显式模态融入潜在空间，实现了更高效准确的图像伪造定位方法，在多个数据集上较现有方法提升12%性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前图像伪造定位方法依赖人工标注数据，成本高且难以跟上多模态大模型驱动的图像编辑技术发展，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 利用SD3的多模态处理能力，将高速筛波器提取的图像伪造残差作为显式模态融入潜在空间，保留SD3提取的丰富语义信息，实现高效的伪造定位。

Result: 在广泛使用的标准数据集上较现有最佳方法提升了12%的性能，并且在未见过的真实文档伪造图像和自然场景伪造图像上也表现出强劲的性能。

Conclusion: 该研究成功将SD的图像生成和感知能力集成到图像伪造检测框架中，为应对新一代多模态大模型带来的图像伪造挑战提供了有效解决方案，具有重要的实践价值。

Abstract: Driven by the new generation of multi-modal large models, such as Stable
Diffusion (SD), image manipulation technologies have advanced rapidly, posing
significant challenges to image forensics. However, existing image forgery
localization methods, which heavily rely on labor-intensive and costly
annotated data, are struggling to keep pace with these emerging image
manipulation technologies. To address these challenges, we are the first to
integrate both image generation and powerful perceptual capabilities of SD into
an image forensic framework, enabling more efficient and accurate forgery
localization. First, we theoretically show that the multi-modal architecture of
SD can be conditioned on forgery-related information, enabling the model to
inherently output forgery localization results. Then, building on this
foundation, we specifically leverage the multimodal framework of Stable
DiffusionV3 (SD3) to enhance forgery localization performance.We leverage the
multi-modal processing capabilities of SD3 in the latent space by treating
image forgery residuals -- high-frequency signals extracted using specific
highpass filters -- as an explicit modality. This modality is fused into the
latent space during training to enhance forgery localization performance.
Notably, our method fully preserves the latent features extracted by SD3,
thereby retaining the rich semantic information of the input image.
Experimental results show that our framework achieves up to 12% improvements in
performance on widely used benchmarking datasets compared to current
state-of-the-art image forgery localization models. Encouragingly, the model
demonstrates strong performance on forensic tasks involving real-world document
forgery images and natural scene forging images, even when such data were
entirely unseen during training.

TL;DR: 通过细调多模态大语言模型预测疮病属性值，将MLLM嵌入空间基于可解释的皮肤病定量属性，提升疮断模型的可解释性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然AI模型在皮肤病疮断中表现突出，但模型预测的可解释性仍需大幅提升才能应用于临床实践

Method: 结合MLLM和定量属性方法，通过细调MLLM从图像预测疮病相关属性值，并在SLICE-3D数据集上进行属性特异性图像检索验证

Result: 证据显示MLLM嵌入空间可以基于可解释的定量属性，如疮病面积等外观特征

Conclusion: 通过将MLLM与定量属性相结合，可以提供更可解释的皮肤病疮断模型，为临床应用奠定基础

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence models have demonstrated significant success in
diagnosing skin diseases, including cancer, showing the potential to assist
clinicians in their analysis. However, the interpretability of model
predictions must be significantly improved before they can be used in practice.
To this end, we explore the combination of two promising approaches: Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs) and quantitative attribute usage. MLLMs offer a
potential avenue for increased interpretability, providing reasoning for
diagnosis in natural language through an interactive format. Separately, a
number of quantitative attributes that are related to lesion appearance (e.g.,
lesion area) have recently been found predictive of malignancy with high
accuracy. Predictions grounded as a function of such concepts have the
potential for improved interpretability. We provide evidence that MLLM
embedding spaces can be grounded in such attributes, through fine-tuning to
predict their values from images. Concretely, we evaluate this grounding in the
embedding space through an attribute-specific content-based image retrieval
case study using the SLICE-3D dataset.

### [4] [Enhancing Automatic Modulation Recognition With a Reconstruction-Driven Vision Transformer Under Limited Labels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20193)
*Hossein Ahmadi,Banafsheh Saffari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于Vision Transformer的统一框架，结合监督、自监督和重构目标，在少量标注数据下实现高效自动调制识别


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动调制识别方法依赖大量标注数据或多阶段训练流程，限制了实际应用中的可扩展性和泛化能力

Method: 使用ViT编码器、轻量卷积解码器和线性分类器，通过重构分支将增强信号映射回原始信号，在预训练中学习鲁棒特征，微调时使用部分标签监督

Result: 在RML2018.01A数据集上，低标签情况下优于监督CNN和ViT基线，仅用15-20%标注数据即可达到ResNet水平精度，在不同SNR下保持强性能

Conclusion: 该框架为AMR提供了简单、可泛化且标签高效的解决方案

Abstract: Automatic modulation recognition (AMR) is critical for cognitive radio,
spectrum monitoring, and secure wireless communication. However, existing
solutions often rely on large labeled datasets or multi-stage training
pipelines, which limit scalability and generalization in practice. We propose a
unified Vision Transformer (ViT) framework that integrates supervised,
self-supervised, and reconstruction objectives. The model combines a ViT
encoder, a lightweight convolutional decoder, and a linear classifier; the
reconstruction branch maps augmented signals back to their originals, anchoring
the encoder to fine-grained I/Q structure. This strategy promotes robust,
discriminative feature learning during pretraining, while partial label
supervision in fine-tuning enables effective classification with limited
labels. On the RML2018.01A dataset, our approach outperforms supervised CNN and
ViT baselines in low-label regimes, approaches ResNet-level accuracy with only
15-20% labeled data, and maintains strong performance across varying SNR
levels. Overall, the framework provides a simple, generalizable, and
label-efficient solution for AMR.

### [5] [InfinityHuman: Towards Long-Term Audio-Driven Human](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20210)
*Xiaodi Li,Pan Xie,Yi Ren,Qijun Gan,Chen Zhang,Fangyuan Kong,Xiang Yin,Bingyue Peng,Zehuan Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InfinityHuman是一个从粗到细的音频驱动人体动画框架，通过姿态引导的细化器和手部特定奖励机制，解决了现有方法在生成高分辨率长视频时的身份漂移、颜色偏移和手部运动失真问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 音频驱动人体动画存在生成高分辨率长视频时的一致性外观和自然手部运动挑战，现有方法使用重叠运动帧会导致误差累积，造成身份漂移、颜色偏移和场景不稳定，且手部运动建模不佳。

Method: 提出coarse-to-fine框架：首先生成音频同步表示，然后使用姿态引导细化器逐步细化为高分辨率长视频。利用解耦的姿态序列和初始帧作为视觉锚点减少漂移，并引入基于高质量手部运动数据训练的手部特定奖励机制。

Result: 在EMTD和HDTF数据集上的实验表明，InfinityHuman在视频质量、身份保持、手部准确性和唇部同步方面达到最先进性能，消融研究证实了各模块的有效性。

Conclusion: InfinityHuman通过稳定的姿态引导和手部奖励机制，有效解决了音频驱动动画中的长期一致性和手部运动真实性问题，为高质量长视频生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Audio-driven human animation has attracted wide attention thanks to its
practical applications. However, critical challenges remain in generating
high-resolution, long-duration videos with consistent appearance and natural
hand motions. Existing methods extend videos using overlapping motion frames
but suffer from error accumulation, leading to identity drift, color shifts,
and scene instability. Additionally, hand movements are poorly modeled,
resulting in noticeable distortions and misalignment with the audio. In this
work, we propose InfinityHuman, a coarse-to-fine framework that first generates
audio-synchronized representations, then progressively refines them into
high-resolution, long-duration videos using a pose-guided refiner. Since pose
sequences are decoupled from appearance and resist temporal degradation, our
pose-guided refiner employs stable poses and the initial frame as a visual
anchor to reduce drift and improve lip synchronization. Moreover, to enhance
semantic accuracy and gesture realism, we introduce a hand-specific reward
mechanism trained with high-quality hand motion data. Experiments on the EMTD
and HDTF datasets show that InfinityHuman achieves state-of-the-art performance
in video quality, identity preservation, hand accuracy, and lip-sync. Ablation
studies further confirm the effectiveness of each module. Code will be made
public.

### [6] [Spherical Vision Transformers for Audio-Visual Saliency Prediction in 360-Degree Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20221)
*Mert Cokelek,Halit Ozsoy,Nevrez Imamoglu,Cagri Ozcinar,Inci Ayhan,Erkut Erdem,Aykut Erdem*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究提出了针对360度视频的视觉显著性预测新方法，通过结合空间音频信息，开发了基于视觉Transformer的SalViT360和SalViT360-AV模型，在多个基准数据集上显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 360度全景视频(ODV)在VR中提供了前所未有的全视场体验，但目前缺乏包含空间音频信息的综合数据集用于音频-视觉显著性预测。

Method: 构建了YT360-EyeTracking数据集（81个ODV视频），提出了SalViT360（基于视觉Transformer的球形几何感知时空注意力框架）和SalViT360-AV（进一步整合音频条件Transformer适配器）两个新颖的显著性预测模型。

Result: 在多个基准数据集（包括自建的YT360-EyeTracking）上的实验结果表明，SalViT360和SalViT360-AV在预测360度场景中观众注意力方面显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 在模型架构中整合空间音频线索对于准确预测全景视频的视觉显著性至关重要，音频-视觉融合能有效提升显著性预测性能。

Abstract: Omnidirectional videos (ODVs) are redefining viewer experiences in virtual
reality (VR) by offering an unprecedented full field-of-view (FOV). This study
extends the domain of saliency prediction to 360-degree environments,
addressing the complexities of spherical distortion and the integration of
spatial audio. Contextually, ODVs have transformed user experience by adding a
spatial audio dimension that aligns sound direction with the viewer's
perspective in spherical scenes. Motivated by the lack of comprehensive
datasets for 360-degree audio-visual saliency prediction, our study curates
YT360-EyeTracking, a new dataset of 81 ODVs, each observed under varying
audio-visual conditions. Our goal is to explore how to utilize audio-visual
cues to effectively predict visual saliency in 360-degree videos. Towards this
aim, we propose two novel saliency prediction models: SalViT360, a
vision-transformer-based framework for ODVs equipped with spherical
geometry-aware spatio-temporal attention layers, and SalViT360-AV, which
further incorporates transformer adapters conditioned on audio input. Our
results on a number of benchmark datasets, including our YT360-EyeTracking,
demonstrate that SalViT360 and SalViT360-AV significantly outperform existing
methods in predicting viewer attention in 360-degree scenes. Interpreting these
results, we suggest that integrating spatial audio cues in the model
architecture is crucial for accurate saliency prediction in omnidirectional
videos. Code and dataset will be available at
https://cyberiada.github.io/SalViT360.

### [7] [A Novel Framework for Automated Explain Vision Model Using Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20227)
*Phu-Vinh Nguyen,Tan-Hanh Pham,Chris Ngo,Truong Son Hy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于VLM的视觉模型解释流水线，能够在样本和数据集层面提供有意义的模型行为解释，帮助发现失败案例和识别偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉模型开发主要关注性能指标，缺乏对模型行为的解释性分析。现有xAI方法多仅解释单个样本，而在整个数据集层面的模型普遍行为解释方法较少。理解模型在普通图像上的行为对防止偏见判断和识别模型趋势至关重要。

Method: 利用视觉-语言模型(VLM)，提出一种可以同时在样本级别和数据集级别解释视觉模型的流水线。该流水线能够以最小化劳动发现模型的失败案例并获得洞察。

Result: 提出的流水线成功实现了对视觉模型的多级别解释，能够在样本和数据集层面揭示模型的行为模式。

Conclusion: 该研究将视觉模型开发与xAI分析相结合，提供了一种有效的方法来理解和解释视觉模型的普遍行为，有助于提升图像分析的可解释性和可靠性。

Abstract: The development of many vision models mainly focuses on improving their
performance using metrics such as accuracy, IoU, and mAP, with less attention
to explainability due to the complexity of applying xAI methods to provide a
meaningful explanation of trained models. Although many existing xAI methods
aim to explain vision models sample-by-sample, methods explaining the general
behavior of vision models, which can only be captured after running on a large
dataset, are still underexplored. Furthermore, understanding the behavior of
vision models on general images can be very important to prevent biased
judgments and help identify the model's trends and patterns. With the
application of Vision-Language Models, this paper proposes a pipeline to
explain vision models at both the sample and dataset levels. The proposed
pipeline can be used to discover failure cases and gain insights into vision
models with minimal effort, thereby integrating vision model development with
xAI analysis to advance image analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ATMS-KD框架通过自适应温度调度和混合样本增强，将MobileNetV3 Large教师模型的知识蒸馏到轻量级CNN学生模型中，在农业图像分类任务上取得了优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对农业资源受限环境，需要开发轻量级但高性能的CNN模型，传统知识蒸馏方法在农业计算机视觉应用中效果有限。

Method: 结合自适应温度调度和混合样本增强的知识蒸馏框架，使用MobileNetV3 Large作为教师模型，训练三种不同规模的残差CNN学生模型。

Result: 所有学生模型验证准确率超过96.7%，紧凑模型达到97.11%准确率，比次优方法提升1.60个百分点，推理延迟仅72.19ms，知识保留率超过99%。

Conclusion: ATMS-KD框架在农业图像分类任务中显著优于直接训练和其他知识蒸馏方法，能够有效实现知识转移并保持低延迟，适合资源受限的农业应用。

Abstract: This study proposes ATMS-KD (Adaptive Temperature and Mixed-Sample Knowledge
Distillation), a novel framework for developing lightweight CNN models suitable
for resource-constrained agricultural environments. The framework combines
adaptive temperature scheduling with mixed-sample augmentation to transfer
knowledge from a MobileNetV3 Large teacher model (5.7\,M parameters) to
lightweight residual CNN students. Three student configurations were evaluated:
Compact (1.3\,M parameters), Standard (2.4\,M parameters), and Enhanced (3.8\,M
parameters). The dataset used in this study consists of images of \textit{Rosa
damascena} (Damask rose) collected from agricultural fields in the Dades Oasis,
southeastern Morocco, providing a realistic benchmark for agricultural computer
vision applications under diverse environmental conditions. Experimental
evaluation on the Damascena rose maturity classification dataset demonstrated
significant improvements over direct training methods. All student models
achieved validation accuracies exceeding 96.7\% with ATMS-KD compared to
95--96\% with direct training. The framework outperformed eleven established
knowledge distillation methods, achieving 97.11\% accuracy with the compact
model -- a 1.60 percentage point improvement over the second-best approach
while maintaining the lowest inference latency of 72.19\,ms. Knowledge
retention rates exceeded 99\% for all configurations, demonstrating effective
knowledge transfer regardless of student model capacity.

*Mutahar Safdar,Gentry Wood,Max Zimmermann,Guy Lamouche,Priti Wanjara,Yaoyao Fiona Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合视觉-语言表示的新框架，用于增材制造金属基复合材料的零样本微观结构分类，无需重新训练模型即可区分合格与缺陷样品


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业制造中先进材料的快速可靠鉴定存在瓶颈，特别是对于非传统增材制造工艺生产的异质结构，需要将微观结构信息与专家表征知识相结合

Method: 集成深度语义分割与预训练多模态模型（CLIP和FLAVA），开发定制化的基于相似性的表示方法，包含专家标注图像的正负参考和文本描述，使用Z-score归一化调整相似性分数

Result: 在增材制造金属基复合材料数据集上验证，框架能够区分合格和缺陷样品，FLAVA模型具有更高的视觉敏感性，CLIP模型与文本标准保持一致

Conclusion: 该方法通过促进原始数据与专家知识之间的语义互操作性，为工程信息学中的可扩展和领域适应性鉴定策略做出贡献，增强了鉴定流程的可追溯性和可解释性

Abstract: Rapid and reliable qualification of advanced materials remains a bottleneck
in industrial manufacturing, particularly for heterogeneous structures produced
via non-conventional additive manufacturing processes. This study introduces a
novel framework that links microstructure informatics with a range of expert
characterization knowledge using customized and hybrid vision-language
representations (VLRs). By integrating deep semantic segmentation with
pre-trained multi-modal models (CLIP and FLAVA), we encode both visual
microstructural data and textual expert assessments into shared
representations. To overcome limitations in general-purpose embeddings, we
develop a customized similarity-based representation that incorporates both
positive and negative references from expert-annotated images and their
associated textual descriptions. This allows zero-shot classification of
previously unseen microstructures through a net similarity scoring approach.
Validation on an additively manufactured metal matrix composite dataset
demonstrates the framework's ability to distinguish between acceptable and
defective samples across a range of characterization criteria. Comparative
analysis reveals that FLAVA model offers higher visual sensitivity, while the
CLIP model provides consistent alignment with the textual criteria. Z-score
normalization adjusts raw unimodal and cross-modal similarity scores based on
their local dataset-driven distributions, enabling more effective alignment and
classification in the hybrid vision-language framework. The proposed method
enhances traceability and interpretability in qualification pipelines by
enabling human-in-the-loop decision-making without task-specific model
retraining. By advancing semantic interoperability between raw data and expert
knowledge, this work contributes toward scalable and domain-adaptable
qualification strategies in engineering informatics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于MedNeXt-L-k5的自动化轮空间分割方法，在T2加权MRI数据上达到了预期的性能，但在异质性T1加权数据上性能有所下降，且没有超过nnU-Net。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手工分割轮空间耗时且可靠性中等，现有的自动化深度学习模型性能中等且稿性一般化能力有限。需要开发更高效、更准确的自动化分割方法来支持相关疾病的研究和临床应用。

Method: 采用Transformer受启发的3D编码器-解码器卷积网络MedNeXt-L-k5进行自动化轮空间分割。训练了两个模型：一个使用HCP-Aging数据集的200个T2加权MRI扫描，另一个使用来自6台扫描仪的7个研究的40个异质性T1加权MRI数据。通过5折交叉验证和留一站点交叉验证评估模型性能。

Result: 在HCP-Aging T2加权数据上，模型达到了百分之88±06的百分点Dice分数（白质），与该数据集报告的评分者间可靠性相当。在T1加权数据上性能明显下降（Dice分数0.58±09）。在异质性数据上的留一站点验证中，模型性能中等（百分点Dice分数白质0.38±16，基底节0.35±12）。

Conclusion: MedNeXt-L-k5提供了一种高效的自动化轮空间分割方案，特别是在T2加权MRI数据上表现优异。但该模型没有超过nnU-Net，表明Transformer模型中的注意力机制对于轮空间分割任务并非必需，局部上下文已经足够获得高精度。

Abstract: Enlarged perivascular spaces (PVS) are increasingly recognized as biomarkers
of cerebral small vessel disease, Alzheimer's disease, stroke, and
aging-related neurodegeneration. However, manual segmentation of PVS is
time-consuming and subject to moderate inter-rater reliability, while existing
automated deep learning models have moderate performance and typically fail to
generalize across diverse clinical and research MRI datasets. We adapted
MedNeXt-L-k5, a Transformer-inspired 3D encoder-decoder convolutional network,
for automated PVS segmentation. Two models were trained: one using a
homogeneous dataset of 200 T2-weighted (T2w) MRI scans from the Human
Connectome Project-Aging (HCP-Aging) dataset and another using 40 heterogeneous
T1-weighted (T1w) MRI volumes from seven studies across six scanners. Model
performance was evaluated using internal 5-fold cross validation (5FCV) and
leave-one-site-out cross validation (LOSOCV). MedNeXt-L-k5 models trained on
the T2w images of the HCP-Aging dataset achieved voxel-level Dice scores of
0.88+/-0.06 (white matter, WM), comparable to the reported inter-rater
reliability of that dataset, and the highest yet reported in the literature.
The same models trained on the T1w images of the HCP-Aging dataset achieved a
substantially lower Dice score of 0.58+/-0.09 (WM). Under LOSOCV, the model had
voxel-level Dice scores of 0.38+/-0.16 (WM) and 0.35+/-0.12 (BG), and
cluster-level Dice scores of 0.61+/-0.19 (WM) and 0.62+/-0.21 (BG).
MedNeXt-L-k5 provides an efficient solution for automated PVS segmentation
across diverse T1w and T2w MRI datasets. MedNeXt-L-k5 did not outperform the
nnU-Net, indicating that the attention-based mechanisms present in
transformer-inspired models to provide global context are not required for high
accuracy in PVS segmentation.

### [11] [Plug-in Feedback Self-adaptive Attention in CLIP for Training-free Open-Vocabulary Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20265)
*Zhixiang Chi,Yanan Wu,Li Gu,Huan Liu,Ziqiang Wang,Yang Zhang,Yang Wang,Konstantinos N. Plataniotis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练、基于反馈的自适应框架，通过将输出级别的补丁对应关系反馈到中间注意力层，增强CLIP在开放词汇分割中的空间一致性和语义对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP在视觉-文本对齐方面表现强劲，但在开放词汇分割中由于定位能力差而表现不佳。先前方法通过修改中间注意力来增强空间一致性，但由于后续操作（如投影）导致这种一致性无法有效传递到最终输出，且中间注意力缺乏与文本表示的直接交互。

Method: 设计了一个训练免费、反馈驱动的自适应框架，包括注意力隔离、基于置信度的稀疏适应剪枝和适应集成等关键模块，将输出预测作为更强的空间一致性先验反馈到中间注意力层。

Result: 该方法作为即插即用模块，无缝集成到四种最先进方法中，在八个基准测试中一致提升了性能，支持三种骨干网络（ViT-B、ViT-L、ViT-H）和多种注意力类型。

Conclusion: 通过利用模型输出作为空间一致性先验，有效增强了内部表示与最终预测之间的语义一致性，显著提升了CLIP在开放词汇分割任务中的表现。

Abstract: CLIP exhibits strong visual-textual alignment but struggle with
open-vocabulary segmentation due to poor localization. Prior methods enhance
spatial coherence by modifying intermediate attention. But, this coherence
isn't consistently propagated to the final output due to subsequent operations
such as projections. Additionally, intermediate attention lacks direct
interaction with text representations, such semantic discrepancy limits the
full potential of CLIP.
  In this work, we propose a training-free, feedback-driven self-adaptive
framework that adapts output-based patch-level correspondences back to the
intermediate attention. The output predictions, being the culmination of the
model's processing, encapsulate the most comprehensive visual and textual
semantics about each patch. Our approach enhances semantic consistency between
internal representations and final predictions by leveraging the model's
outputs as a stronger spatial coherence prior. We design key modules, including
attention isolation, confidence-based pruning for sparse adaptation, and
adaptation ensemble, to effectively feedback the output coherence cues. Our
method functions as a plug-in module, seamlessly integrating into four
state-of-the-art approaches with three backbones (ViT-B, ViT-L, ViT-H). We
further validate our framework across multiple attention types (Q-K, self-self,
and Proxy augmented with MAE, SAM, and DINO). Our approach consistently
improves their performance across eight benchmarks.

*Zhuoran Yu,Yong Jae Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个探测框架来系统分析多模态大语言模型(MLLMs)在不同层处理视觉和文本输入的动态过程，发现了模型具有一致的阶段性结构特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在各种视觉语言任务中表现出色，但其内部处理机制仍未被充分探索，需要系统性的分析方法来理解其表示动态。

Method: 训练线性分类器从各层token嵌入中预测细粒度视觉类别，使用标准化锚点问题，并在三种提示变体下评估：词汇变体、语义否定变体和输出格式变体。

Result: 在LLaVA-1.5、LLaVA-Next-LLaMA-3和Qwen2-VL模型中发现一致的阶段性结构：早期层进行视觉接地，中间层支持词汇整合和语义推理，最终层准备任务特定输出。

Conclusion: 该研究为MLLMs的层级组织提供了统一视角，并提供了一个轻量级、模型无关的方法来分析多模态表示动态，整体阶段性结构在不同变体中保持稳定但具体层分配会随基础LLM架构变化而显著调整。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong performance
across a wide range of vision-language tasks, yet their internal processing
dynamics remain underexplored. In this work, we introduce a probing framework
to systematically analyze how MLLMs process visual and textual inputs across
layers. We train linear classifiers to predict fine-grained visual categories
(e.g., dog breeds) from token embeddings extracted at each layer, using a
standardized anchor question. To uncover the functional roles of different
layers, we evaluate these probes under three types of controlled prompt
variations: (1) lexical variants that test sensitivity to surface-level
changes, (2) semantic negation variants that flip the expected answer by
modifying the visual concept in the prompt, and (3) output format variants that
preserve reasoning but alter the answer format. Applying our framework to
LLaVA-1.5, LLaVA-Next-LLaMA-3, and Qwen2-VL, we identify a consistent
stage-wise structure in which early layers perform visual grounding, middle
layers support lexical integration and semantic reasoning, and final layers
prepare task-specific outputs. We further show that while the overall
stage-wise structure remains stable across variations in visual tokenization,
instruction tuning data, and pretraining corpus, the specific layer allocation
to each stage shifts notably with changes in the base LLM architecture. Our
findings provide a unified perspective on the layer-wise organization of MLLMs
and offer a lightweight, model-agnostic approach for analyzing multimodal
representation dynamics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出SLiCS方法，通过语义解构视觉-语言嵌入空间，将嵌入表示分解为多个概念特定的线性子空间，实现更准确的概念筛选图像检索和条件生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目标是将CLIP等视觉-语言嵌入空间进行解构，分离复杂场景的内容信息，以支持更精确的下游任务。

Method: 采用监督字典学习方法，通过新题交替优化算法估计线性合成模型，将嵌入表示分解为稀疏、非负的概念特定组合。

Result: 在TiTok自动编码器嵌入和DINOv2自监督嵌入上都实现了更精确的概念筛选图像检索，同时支持条件图像生成。

Conclusion: SLiCS方法能够有效解构嵌入空间，提供更精确的概念级别控制，为下游任务提供了更好的表示。

Abstract: Vision-language co-embedding networks, such as CLIP, provide a latent
embedding space with semantic information that is useful for downstream tasks.
We hypothesize that the embedding space can be disentangled to separate the
information on the content of complex scenes by decomposing the embedding into
multiple concept-specific component vectors that lie in different subspaces. We
propose a supervised dictionary learning approach to estimate a linear
synthesis model consisting of sparse, non-negative combinations of groups of
vectors in the dictionary (atoms), whose group-wise activity matches the
multi-label information. Each concept-specific component is a non-negative
combination of atoms associated to a label. The group-structured dictionary is
optimized through a novel alternating optimization with guaranteed convergence.
Exploiting the text co-embeddings, we detail how semantically meaningful
descriptions can be found based on text embeddings of words best approximated
by a concept's group of atoms, and unsupervised dictionary learning can exploit
zero-shot classification of training set images using the text embeddings of
concept labels to provide instance-wise multi-labels. We show that the
disentangled embeddings provided by our sparse linear concept subspaces (SLiCS)
enable concept-filtered image retrieval (and conditional generation using
image-to-prompt) that is more precise. We also apply SLiCS to highly-compressed
autoencoder embeddings from TiTok and the latent embedding from self-supervised
DINOv2. Quantitative and qualitative results highlight the improved precision
of the concept-filtered image retrieval for all embeddings.

Motivation: 医疗视觉语言模型虽然为临床应用带来机遇，但存在严重的隐私安全风险，如受保护健康信息泄露、数据泄漏和网络威胁漏洞，特别是在医院环境中。

Method: 开发了MedFoundationHub图形用户界面工具包，支持医生手动选择模型、工程师快速部署开源模型，并通过Docker编排实现操作系统无关的隐私保护推理部署。

Result: 评估了5个最先进的VLM模型，由认证病理学家对结肠和肾脏病例进行1015次评分，发现模型存在回答偏离目标、推理模糊和病理术语不一致等局限性。

Conclusion: MedFoundationHub提供了一个安全、易用的医疗VLM部署解决方案，但当前模型仍存在明显的局限性，需要在临床应用中谨慎使用。

Abstract: Recent advances in medical vision-language models (VLMs) open up remarkable
opportunities for clinical applications such as automated report generation,
copilots for physicians, and uncertainty quantification. However, despite their
promise, medical VLMs introduce serious security concerns, most notably risks
of Protected Health Information (PHI) exposure, data leakage, and vulnerability
to cyberthreats - which are especially critical in hospital environments. Even
when adopted for research or non-clinical purposes, healthcare organizations
must exercise caution and implement safeguards. To address these challenges, we
present MedFoundationHub, a graphical user interface (GUI) toolkit that: (1)
enables physicians to manually select and use different models without
programming expertise, (2) supports engineers in efficiently deploying medical
VLMs in a plug-and-play fashion, with seamless integration of Hugging Face
open-source models, and (3) ensures privacy-preserving inference through
Docker-orchestrated, operating system agnostic deployment. MedFoundationHub
requires only an offline local workstation equipped with a single NVIDIA A6000
GPU, making it both secure and accessible within the typical resources of
academic research labs. To evaluate current capabilities, we engaged
board-certified pathologists to deploy and assess five state-of-the-art VLMs
(Google-MedGemma3-4B, Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct, Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, and
LLaVA-1.5-7B/13B). Expert evaluation covered colon cases and renal cases,
yielding 1015 clinician-model scoring events. These assessments revealed
recurring limitations, including off-target answers, vague reasoning, and
inconsistent pathology terminology.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多任务密集预测中充分的交叉任务交互至关重要，但现有方法面临交互完整性与计算效率之间的权衡限制

Method: 引入双向交互扫描（BI-Scan）机制构建任务特定的双向序列表示，结合任务优先和位置优先扫描模式；采用多尺度扫描（MS-Scan）机制实现多粒度场景建模

Result: 在NYUD-V2和PASCAL-Context两个基准测试上表现出优于最先进竞争方法的性能

Conclusion: BIM模型通过创新的扫描机制有效解决了多任务密集预测中的交互效率问题，在保持线性复杂度的同时实现了充分的跨任务信息交互

Abstract: Sufficient cross-task interaction is crucial for success in multi-task dense
prediction. However, sufficient interaction often results in high computational
complexity, forcing existing methods to face the trade-off between interaction
completeness and computational efficiency. To address this limitation, this
work proposes a Bidirectional Interaction Mamba (BIM), which incorporates novel
scanning mechanisms to adapt the Mamba modeling approach for multi-task dense
prediction. On the one hand, we introduce a novel Bidirectional Interaction
Scan (BI-Scan) mechanism, which constructs task-specific representations as
bidirectional sequences during interaction. By integrating task-first and
position-first scanning modes within a unified linear complexity architecture,
BI-Scan efficiently preserves critical cross-task information. On the other
hand, we employ a Multi-Scale Scan~(MS-Scan) mechanism to achieve
multi-granularity scene modeling. This design not only meets the diverse
granularity requirements of various tasks but also enhances nuanced cross-task
feature interactions. Extensive experiments on two challenging benchmarks,
\emph{i.e.}, NYUD-V2 and PASCAL-Context, show the superiority of our BIM vs its
state-of-the-art competitors.

Conclusion: 该音频导航视觉编辑框架充分利用多模态信息，在不需额外训练的情况下实现了对复杂多模态编辑任务的高效处理，为视觉编辑领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Visual editing with diffusion models has made significant progress but often
struggles with complex scenarios that textual guidance alone could not
adequately describe, highlighting the need for additional non-text editing
prompts. In this work, we introduce a novel audio-guided visual editing
framework that can handle complex editing tasks with multiple text and audio
prompts without requiring additional training. Existing audio-guided visual
editing methods often necessitate training on specific datasets to align audio
with text, limiting their generalization to real-world situations. We leverage
a pre-trained multi-modal encoder with strong zero-shot capabilities and
integrate diverse audio into visual editing tasks, by alleviating the
discrepancy between the audio encoder space and the diffusion model's prompt
encoder space. Additionally, we propose a novel approach to handle complex
scenarios with multiple and multi-modal editing prompts through our separate
noise branching and adaptive patch selection. Our comprehensive experiments on
diverse editing tasks demonstrate that our framework excels in handling
complicated editing scenarios by incorporating rich information from audio,
where text-only approaches fail.

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，该框架显著推进了多标签分类，达到了最先进的结果

Conclusion: AEVLP框架通过创新的损失函数和伪标签技术，有效解决了SPML中的噪声问题，实现了优异的性能

Abstract: Multi-label learning is a challenging computer vision task that requires
assigning multiple categories to each image. However, fully annotating
large-scale datasets is often impractical due to high costs and effort,
motivating the study of learning from partially annotated data. In the extreme
case of Single Positive Multi-Label Learning (SPML), each image is provided
with only one positive label, while all other labels remain unannotated.
Traditional SPML methods that treat missing labels as unknown or negative tend
to yield inaccuracies and false negatives, and integrating various
pseudo-labeling strategies can introduce additional noise. To address these
challenges, we propose the Generalized Pseudo-Label Robust Loss (GPR Loss), a
novel loss function that effectively learns from diverse pseudo-labels while
mitigating noise. Complementing this, we introduce a simple yet effective
Dynamic Augmented Multi-focus Pseudo-labeling (DAMP) technique. Together, these
contributions form the Adaptive and Efficient Vision-Language Pseudo-Labeling
(AEVLP) framework. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate
that our framework significantly advances multi-label classification, achieving
state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), inspired by the brain, are characterized by
minimal power consumption and swift inference capabilities on neuromorphic
hardware, and have been widely applied to various visual perception tasks.
Current ANN-SNN conversion methods have achieved excellent results in
classification tasks with ultra-low time-steps, but their performance in visual
detection tasks remains suboptimal. In this paper, we propose a delay-spike
approach to mitigate the issue of residual membrane potential caused by
heterogeneous spiking patterns. Furthermore, we propose a novel
temporal-dependent Integrate-and-Fire (tdIF) neuron architecture for SNNs. This
enables Integrate-and-fire (IF) neurons to dynamically adjust their
accumulation and firing behaviors based on the temporal order of time-steps.
Our method enables spikes to exhibit distinct temporal properties, rather than
relying solely on frequency-based representations. Moreover, the tdIF neuron
maintains energy consumption on par with traditional IF neuron. We demonstrate
that our method achieves more precise feature representation with lower
time-steps, enabling high performance and ultra-low latency in visual detection
tasks. In this study, we conduct extensive evaluation of the tdIF method across
two critical vision tasks: object detection and lane line detection. The
results demonstrate that the proposed method surpasses current ANN-SNN
conversion approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance with ultra-low
latency (within 5 time-steps).

Motivation: 现有显著目标检测方法在复杂场景中容易丢失细节、边缘模糊，且单模态信息融合不足，需要更好的多模态协同机制和不确定性处理策略。

Abstract: In view of the problems that existing salient object detection (SOD) methods
are prone to losing details, blurring edges, and insufficient fusion of
single-modal information in complex scenes, this paper proposes a dynamic
uncertainty propagation and multimodal collaborative reasoning network
(DUP-MCRNet). Firstly, a dynamic uncertainty graph convolution module (DUGC) is
designed to propagate uncertainty between layers through a sparse graph
constructed based on spatial semantic distance, and combined with channel
adaptive interaction, it effectively improves the detection accuracy of small
structures and edge regions. Secondly, a multimodal collaborative fusion
strategy (MCF) is proposed, which uses learnable modality gating weights to
weightedly fuse the attention maps of RGB, depth, and edge features. It can
dynamically adjust the importance of each modality according to different
scenes, effectively suppress redundant or interfering information, and
strengthen the semantic complementarity and consistency between
cross-modalities, thereby improving the ability to identify salient regions
under occlusion, weak texture or background interference. Finally, the
detection performance at the pixel level and region level is optimized through
multi-scale BCE and IoU loss, cross-scale consistency constraints, and
uncertainty-guided supervision mechanisms. Extensive experiments show that
DUP-MCRNet outperforms various SOD methods on most common benchmark datasets,
especially in terms of edge clarity and robustness to complex backgrounds. Our
code is publicly available at https://github.com/YukiBear426/DUP-MCRNet.

Abstract: Multi-View Pedestrian Detection (MVPD) aims to detect pedestrians in the form
of a bird's eye view (BEV) from multi-view images. In MVPD, end-to-end
trainable deep learning methods have progressed greatly. However, they often
struggle to detect pedestrians with consistently small or large scales in views
or with vastly different scales between views. This is because they do not
exploit multi-scale image features to generate the BEV feature and detect
pedestrians. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel MVPD method, called
Multi-Scale Multi-View Detection (MSMVD). MSMVD generates multi-scale BEV
features by projecting multi-scale image features extracted from individual
views into the BEV space, scale-by-scale. Each of these BEV features inherits
the properties of its corresponding scale image features from multiple views.
Therefore, these BEV features help the precise detection of pedestrians with
consistently small or large scales in views. Then, MSMVD combines information
at different scales of multiple views by processing the multi-scale BEV
features using a feature pyramid network. This improves the detection of
pedestrians with vastly different scales between views. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that exploiting multi-scale image features via multi-scale BEV
features greatly improves the detection performance, and MSMVD outperforms the
previous highest MODA by $4.5$ points on the GMVD dataset.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of real-time deepfake generation techniques,
forged content is becoming increasingly realistic and widespread across
applications like video conferencing and social media. Although
state-of-the-art detectors achieve high accuracy on standard benchmarks, their
heavy computational cost hinders real-time deployment in practical
applications. To address this, we propose the Spatial-Frequency Aware
Multi-Scale Fusion Network (SFMFNet), a lightweight yet effective architecture
for real-time deepfake detection. We design a spatial-frequency hybrid aware
module that jointly leverages spatial textures and frequency artifacts through
a gated mechanism, enhancing sensitivity to subtle manipulations. A
token-selective cross attention mechanism enables efficient multi-level feature
interaction, while a residual-enhanced blur pooling structure helps retain key
semantic cues during downsampling. Experiments on several benchmark datasets
show that SFMFNet achieves a favorable balance between accuracy and efficiency,
with strong generalization and practical value for real-time applications.

Conclusion: 双模型权重选择与自知识蒸馏的结合有效克服了传统方法在紧凑模型中保留关键信息的局限性，为医学图像分类提供了高效的解决方案

Abstract: We propose a novel medical image classification method that integrates
dual-model weight selection with self-knowledge distillation (SKD). In
real-world medical settings, deploying large-scale models is often limited by
computational resource constraints, which pose significant challenges for their
practical implementation. Thus, developing lightweight models that achieve
comparable performance to large-scale models while maintaining computational
efficiency is crucial. To address this, we employ a dual-model weight selection
strategy that initializes two lightweight models with weights derived from a
large pretrained model, enabling effective knowledge transfer. Next, SKD is
applied to these selected models, allowing the use of a broad range of initial
weight configurations without imposing additional excessive computational cost,
followed by fine-tuning for the target classification tasks. By combining
dual-model weight selection with self-knowledge distillation, our method
overcomes the limitations of conventional approaches, which often fail to
retain critical information in compact models. Extensive experiments on
publicly available datasets-chest X-ray images, lung computed tomography scans,
and brain magnetic resonance imaging scans-demonstrate the superior performance
and robustness of our approach compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: 通过整合两个模块，该方法产生了紧凑的特征表示，提供了高效的上下文建模并加速了编码过程，代码已开源

Abstract: LiDAR point clouds are fundamental to various applications, yet
high-precision scans incur substantial storage and transmission overhead.
Existing methods typically convert unordered points into hierarchical octree or
voxel structures for dense-to-sparse predictive coding. However, the extreme
sparsity of geometric details hinders efficient context modeling, thereby
limiting their compression performance and speed. To address this challenge, we
propose to generate compact features for efficient predictive coding. Our
framework comprises two lightweight modules. First, the Geometry
Re-Densification Module re-densifies encoded sparse geometry, extracts features
at denser scale, and then re-sparsifies the features for predictive coding.
This module avoids costly computation on highly sparse details while
maintaining a lightweight prediction head. Second, the Cross-scale Feature
Propagation Module leverages occupancy cues from multiple resolution levels to
guide hierarchical feature propagation. This design facilitates information
sharing across scales, thereby reducing redundant feature extraction and
providing enriched features for the Geometry Re-Densification Module. By
integrating these two modules, our method yields a compact feature
representation that provides efficient context modeling and accelerates the
coding process. Experiments on the KITTI dataset demonstrate state-of-the-art
compression ratios and real-time performance, achieving 26 FPS for both
encoding and decoding at 12-bit quantization. Code is available at

Abstract: Scaling laws have validated the success and promise of large-data-trained
models in creative generation across text, image, and video domains. However,
this paradigm faces data scarcity in the 3D domain, as there is far less of it
available on the internet compared to the aforementioned modalities.
Fortunately, there exist adequate videos that inherently contain commonsense
priors, offering an alternative supervisory signal to mitigate the
generalization bottleneck caused by limited native 3D data. On the one hand,
videos capturing multiple views of an object or scene provide a spatial
consistency prior for 3D generation. On the other hand, the rich semantic
information contained within the videos enables the generated content to be
more faithful to the text prompts and semantically plausible. This paper
explores how to apply the video modality in 3D asset generation, spanning
datasets to models. We introduce Droplet3D-4M, the first large-scale video
dataset with multi-view level annotations, and train Droplet3D, a generative
model supporting both image and dense text input. Extensive experiments
validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating its ability to
produce spatially consistent and semantically plausible content. Moreover, in
contrast to the prevailing 3D solutions, our approach exhibits the potential
for extension to scene-level applications. This indicates that the commonsense
priors from the videos significantly facilitate 3D creation. We have
open-sourced all resources including the dataset, code, technical framework,
and model weights: https://dropletx.github.io/.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶系统的训练和验证需要大量角点案例，但真实世界收集成本高且危险。现有的3D高斯溅射和图像生成方法存在视觉保真度有限和姿态控制不精确的问题。

Method: 使用编辑对象的3D高斯表示作为密集先验注入去噪过程，采用场景级3D边界框布局重建非目标对象的遮挡区域，并引入层次化细粒度特征指导外观细节生成。

Abstract: Corner cases are crucial for training and validating autonomous driving
systems, yet collecting them from the real world is often costly and hazardous.
Editing objects within captured sensor data offers an effective alternative for
generating diverse scenarios, commonly achieved through 3D Gaussian Splatting
or image generative models. However, these approaches often suffer from limited
visual fidelity or imprecise pose control. To address these issues, we propose
G^2Editor, a framework designed for photorealistic and precise object editing
in driving videos. Our method leverages a 3D Gaussian representation of the
edited object as a dense prior, injected into the denoising process to ensure
accurate pose control and spatial consistency. A scene-level 3D bounding box
layout is employed to reconstruct occluded areas of non-target objects.
Furthermore, to guide the appearance details of the edited object, we
incorporate hierarchical fine-grained features as additional conditions during
generation. Experiments on the Waymo Open Dataset demonstrate that G^2Editor
effectively supports object repositioning, insertion, and deletion within a
unified framework, outperforming existing methods in both pose controllability
and visual quality, while also benefiting downstream data-driven tasks.

TL;DR: 通过病理知识领域随机化策略，从健康数据生成合成脑部异常数据，解决CCD稀缺标注数据问题，提升胎儿脑部分割和生物标记物提取的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 精确的胎儿脑部分割对于提取生物标记物和评估神经发育至关重要，特别是在胱体胶体发育不良(CCD)等病理情况下。但CCD的稀缺性严重限制了标注数据的获得，影响深度学习模型的普适性。

Method: 提出一种病理知识领域随机化策略，将CCD表现的先验知识嵌入到合成数据生成流程中。仅从健康数据模拟多样化的脑部改变，无需病理标注即可实现稳健分割。

Result: 在248例健康胎儿、26例CCD胎儿和47例其他脑部病理的群体中验证，在CCD案例中取得显著改善，同时保持对健康和其他病理的性能。胱体胶体长度(LCC)估计错误从健康案例的1.89mm降至0.80mm，CCD案例从10.9mm降至0.7mm。

Conclusion: 将领域特定的解剖先验知识整合到合成数据流程中，可以有效减缓数据稀缺问题，并提升对稀缺但临床重要的异常形成的分析能力。

Abstract: Accurate fetal brain segmentation is crucial for extracting biomarkers and
assessing neurodevelopment, especially in conditions such as corpus callosum
dysgenesis (CCD), which can induce drastic anatomical changes. However, the
rarity of CCD severely limits annotated data, hindering the generalization of
deep learning models. To address this, we propose a pathology-informed domain
randomization strategy that embeds prior knowledge of CCD manifestations into a
synthetic data generation pipeline. By simulating diverse brain alterations
from healthy data alone, our approach enables robust segmentation without
requiring pathological annotations.
  We validate our method on a cohort comprising 248 healthy fetuses, 26 with
CCD, and 47 with other brain pathologies, achieving substantial improvements on
CCD cases while maintaining performance on both healthy fetuses and those with
other pathologies. From the predicted segmentations, we derive clinically
relevant biomarkers, such as corpus callosum length (LCC) and volume, and show
their utility in distinguishing CCD subtypes. Our pathology-informed
augmentation reduces the LCC estimation error from 1.89 mm to 0.80 mm in
healthy cases and from 10.9 mm to 0.7 mm in CCD cases. Beyond these
quantitative gains, our approach yields segmentations with improved topological
consistency relative to available ground truth, enabling more reliable
shape-based analyses. Overall, this work demonstrates that incorporating
domain-specific anatomical priors into synthetic data pipelines can effectively
mitigate data scarcity and enhance analysis of rare but clinically significant
malformations.

Motivation: 传统语音识别系统对聋哑人士不可用，而现有的视觉替代方案（手语和唇读）虽然有效但各自独立研究，缺乏统一的多模态整合框架。

Method: 设计了一个统一的模态无关架构，能够有效处理异构输入，特别探索了唇部运动作为非手动线索在手语理解中的协同作用。

Result: 在SLT、VSR、ASR和AVSR等任务上达到或优于最先进的专门模型性能，且发现显式建模唇部运动能显著提升手语翻译效果。

Conclusion: 多模态统一框架不仅实现了跨任务的优异性能，还揭示了唇部运动在手语理解中的重要辅助作用，为无障碍通信技术提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Audio is the primary modality for human communication and has driven the
success of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) technologies. However, such
systems remain inherently inaccessible to individuals who are deaf or hard of
hearing. Visual alternatives such as sign language and lip reading offer
effective substitutes, and recent advances in Sign Language Translation (SLT)
and Visual Speech Recognition (VSR) have improved audio-less communication.
Yet, these modalities have largely been studied in isolation, and their
integration within a unified framework remains underexplored. In this paper, we
introduce the first unified framework capable of handling diverse combinations
of sign language, lip movements, and audio for spoken-language text generation.
We focus on three main objectives: (i) designing a unified, modality-agnostic
architecture capable of effectively processing heterogeneous inputs; (ii)
exploring the underexamined synergy among modalities, particularly the role of
lip movements as non-manual cues in sign language comprehension; and (iii)
achieving performance on par with or superior to state-of-the-art models
specialized for individual tasks. Building on this framework, we achieve
performance on par with or better than task-specific state-of-the-art models
across SLT, VSR, ASR, and AVSR. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that
explicitly modeling lip movements as a separate modality significantly improves
SLT performance.

TL;DR: Video-MTR是一个强化多轮推理框架，通过迭代选择关键视频片段和问题理解来解决长视频理解问题，采用门控双级奖励系统实现端到端训练，在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能。

Method: 提出强化多轮推理框架，迭代选择视频片段并基于先前处理片段的理解进行渐进推理；引入门控双级奖励系统，结合轨迹级奖励（答案正确性）和轮级奖励（帧-查询相关性），优化视频片段选择和问题理解。

Result: 在VideoMME、MLVU和EgoSchema等基准测试中，Video-MTR在准确性和效率方面均优于现有方法，推进了长视频理解的技术水平。

Conclusion: Video-MTR通过多轮迭代推理和门控双级奖励系统，实现了端到端训练，无需外部视觉语言模型，在长视频理解任务中表现出色，为相关领域提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Long-form video understanding, characterized by long-range temporal
dependencies and multiple events, remains a challenge. Existing methods often
rely on static reasoning or external visual-language models (VLMs), which face
issues like complexity and sub-optimal performance due to the lack of
end-to-end training. In this paper, we propose Video-MTR, a reinforced
multi-turn reasoning framework designed to enable iterative key video segment
selection and question comprehension. Unlike traditional video reasoning
pipeline, which generate predictions in a single turn, Video-MTR performs
reasoning in multiple turns, selecting video segments progressively based on
the evolving understanding of previously processed segments and the current
question. This iterative process allows for a more refined and contextually
aware analysis of the video. To ensure intermediate reasoning process, we
introduce a novel gated bi-level reward system, combining trajectory-level
rewards based on answer correctness and turn-level rewards emphasizing
frame-query relevance. This system optimizes both video segment selection and
question comprehension, eliminating the need for external VLMs and allowing
end-to-end training. Extensive experiments on benchmarks like VideoMME, MLVU,
and EgoSchema demonstrate that Video-MTR outperforms existing methods in both
accuracy and efficiency, advancing the state-of-the-art in long video
understanding.

Motivation: 现有TTA方法虽然认识到低不确定性与高泛化能力的正相关性，但未能解决M3OD中固有的双重不确定性（语义不确定性和几何不确定性），导致在真实世界域偏移下可靠性下降。

Method: 提出了双重不确定性优化(DUO)框架：1）通过凸优化视角创新性地推导出无监督版本的focal loss，实现标签无关的不确定性加权；2）设计语义感知的法向场约束，在语义清晰区域保持几何一致性；3）构建双分支互补机制，空间感知改善语义分类，语义预测优化空间理解。

Result: 在多个数据集和域偏移类型上的广泛实验表明，DUO优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DUO是首个专门针对M3OD双重不确定性设计的TTA框架，通过联合优化语义和几何不确定性，显著提升了模型在域偏移下的鲁棒性和可靠性。

Abstract: Accurate monocular 3D object detection (M3OD) is pivotal for safety-critical
applications like autonomous driving, yet its reliability deteriorates
significantly under real-world domain shifts caused by environmental or sensor
variations. To address these shifts, Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods have
emerged, enabling models to adapt to target distributions during inference.
While prior TTA approaches recognize the positive correlation between low
uncertainty and high generalization ability, they fail to address the dual
uncertainty inherent to M3OD: semantic uncertainty (ambiguous class
predictions) and geometric uncertainty (unstable spatial localization). To
bridge this gap, we propose Dual Uncertainty Optimization (DUO), the first TTA
framework designed to jointly minimize both uncertainties for robust M3OD.
Through a convex optimization lens, we introduce an innovative convex structure
of the focal loss and further derive a novel unsupervised version, enabling
label-agnostic uncertainty weighting and balanced learning for high-uncertainty
objects. In parallel, we design a semantic-aware normal field constraint that
preserves geometric coherence in regions with clear semantic cues, reducing
uncertainty from the unstable 3D representation. This dual-branch mechanism
forms a complementary loop: enhanced spatial perception improves semantic
classification, and robust semantic predictions further refine spatial
understanding. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of DUO over
existing methods across various datasets and domain shift types.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have led to more studies to enhance golfers'
shot precision. However, these existing studies have not quantitatively
established the relationship between swing posture and ball trajectory,
limiting their ability to provide golfers with the necessary insights for swing
improvement. In this paper, we propose a new dataset called CaddieSet, which
includes joint information and various ball information from a single shot.
CaddieSet extracts joint information from a single swing video by segmenting it
into eight swing phases using a computer vision-based approach. Furthermore,
based on expert golf domain knowledge, we define 15 key metrics that influence
a golf swing, enabling the interpretation of swing outcomes through
swing-related features. Through experiments, we demonstrated the feasibility of
CaddieSet for predicting ball trajectories using various benchmarks. In
particular, we focus on interpretable models among several benchmarks and
verify that swing feedback using our joint features is quantitatively
consistent with established domain knowledge. This work is expected to offer
new insight into golf swing analysis for both academia and the sports industry.

Result: 在MVTec 3D-AD数据集上实现了新的最先进性能，显著降低了误报率

Conclusion: IAENet通过有效融合2D和3D专家知识，提升了工业表面异常检测的实用价值

Abstract: Surface anomaly detection is pivotal for ensuring product quality in
industrial manufacturing. While 2D image-based methods have achieved remarkable
success, 3D point cloud-based detection remains underexplored despite its
richer geometric cues. We argue that the key bottleneck is the absence of
powerful pretrained foundation backbones in 3D comparable to those in 2D. To
bridge this gap, we propose Importance-Aware Ensemble Network (IAENet), an
ensemble framework that synergizes 2D pretrained expert with 3D expert models.
However, naively fusing predictions from disparate sources is non-trivial:
existing strategies can be affected by a poorly performing modality and thus
degrade overall accuracy. To address this challenge, We introduce an novel
Importance-Aware Fusion (IAF) module that dynamically assesses the contribution
of each source and reweights their anomaly scores. Furthermore, we devise
critical loss functions that explicitly guide the optimization of IAF, enabling
it to combine the collective knowledge of the source experts but also preserve
their unique strengths, thereby enhancing the overall performance of anomaly
detection. Extensive experiments on MVTec 3D-AD demonstrate that our IAENet
achieves a new state-of-the-art with a markedly lower false positive rate,
underscoring its practical value for industrial deployment.

Conclusion: DescriptiveEdit框架通过重新定义问题为基于参考图像的文本到图像生成，克服了现有方法的限制，具有更好的可扩展性和编辑性能。

Abstract: Despite the progress in text-to-image generation, semantic image editing
remains a challenge. Inversion-based algorithms unavoidably introduce
reconstruction errors, while instruction-based models mainly suffer from
limited dataset quality and scale. To address these problems, we propose a
descriptive-prompt-based editing framework, named DescriptiveEdit. The core
idea is to re-frame `instruction-based image editing' as `reference-image-based
text-to-image generation', which preserves the generative power of well-trained
Text-to-Image models without architectural modifications or inversion.
Specifically, taking the reference image and a prompt as input, we introduce a
Cross-Attentive UNet, which newly adds attention bridges to inject reference
image features into the prompt-to-edit-image generation process. Owing to its
text-to-image nature, DescriptiveEdit overcomes limitations in instruction
dataset quality, integrates seamlessly with ControlNet, IP-Adapter, and other
extensions, and is more scalable. Experiments on the Emu Edit benchmark show it
improves editing accuracy and consistency.

Conclusion: DCFS框架通过特征解耦和置信度加权学习，有效减少了伪标签噪声并缓解了错误累积问题，为持续测试时适应提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Continual test-time adaptation aims to continuously adapt a pre-trained model
to a stream of target domain data without accessing source data. Without access
to source domain data, the model focuses solely on the feature characteristics
of the target data. Relying exclusively on these features can lead to confusion
and introduce learning biases. Currently, many existing methods generate
pseudo-labels via model predictions. However, the quality of pseudo-labels
cannot be guaranteed and the problem of error accumulation must be solved. To
address these challenges, we propose DCFS, a novel CTTA framework that
introduces dual-path feature consistency and confidence-aware sample learning.
This framework disentangles the whole feature representation of the target data
into semantic-related feature and domain-related feature using dual classifiers
to learn distinct feature representations. By maintaining consistency between
the sub-features and the whole feature, the model can comprehensively capture
data features from multiple perspectives. Additionally, to ensure that the
whole feature information of the target domain samples is not overlooked, we
set a adaptive threshold and calculate a confidence score for each sample to
carry out loss weighted self-supervised learning, effectively reducing the
noise of pseudo-labels and alleviating the problem of error accumulation. The
efficacy of our proposed method is validated through extensive experimentation
across various datasets, including CIFAR10-C, CIFAR100-C, and ImageNet-C,
demonstrating consistent performance in continual test-time adaptation
scenarios.

<details>

Motivation: 相机标定质量对新颖视角合成至关重要，1像素的标定误差会对重建质量产生显著影响。由于真实场景没有ground truth，标定质量通常通过新视角合成质量来评估

Method: 使用3D高斯散射(3DGS)模型，通过反向传播新视角颜色损失来优化相机参数，实现相机标定的精细调优

Result: 在3DGS使用的参考数据集上，新的标定方法平均带来0.4 dB PSNR的提升

Conclusion: 虽然微调过程可能耗时较长且适用性取决于训练时间的关键性，但对于参考场景（如Mip-NeRF 360）的标定，新视角质量的重要性是最关键的

Abstract: The quality of the camera calibration is of major importance for evaluating
progresses in novel view synthesis, as a 1-pixel error on the calibration has a
significant impact on the reconstruction quality. While there is no ground
truth for real scenes, the quality of the calibration is assessed by the
quality of the novel view synthesis. This paper proposes to use a 3DGS model to
fine tune calibration by backpropagation of novel view color loss with respect
to the cameras parameters. The new calibration alone brings an average
improvement of 0.4 dB PSNR on the dataset used as reference by 3DGS. The fine
tuning may be long and its suitability depends on the criticity of training
time, but for calibration of reference scenes, such as Mip-NeRF 360, the stake
of novel view quality is the most important.

Abstract: Accurate gross tumor volume segmentation on multi-modal medical data is
critical for radiotherapy planning in nasopharyngeal carcinoma and
glioblastoma. Recent advances in deep neural networks have brought promising
results in medical image segmentation, leading to an increasing demand for
labeled data. Since labeling medical images is time-consuming and
labor-intensive, active learning has emerged as a solution to reduce annotation
costs by selecting the most informative samples to label and adapting
high-performance models with as few labeled samples as possible. Previous
active domain adaptation (ADA) methods seek to minimize sample redundancy by
selecting samples that are farthest from the source domain. However, such
one-off selection can easily cause negative transfer, and access to source
medical data is often limited. Moreover, the query strategy for multi-modal
medical data remains unexplored. In this work, we propose an active and
sequential domain adaptation framework for dynamic multi-modal sample selection
in ADA. We derive a query strategy to prioritize labeling and training on the
most valuable samples based on their informativeness and representativeness.
Empirical validation on diverse gross tumor volume segmentation tasks
demonstrates that our method achieves favorable segmentation performance,
significantly outperforming state-of-the-art ADA methods. Code is available at

Abstract: Existing LiDAR-based 3D object detectors typically rely on manually annotated
labels for training to achieve good performance. However, obtaining
high-quality 3D labels is time-consuming and labor-intensive. To address this
issue, recent works explore unsupervised 3D object detection by introducing RGB
images as an auxiliary modal to assist pseudo-box generation. However, these
methods simply integrate pseudo-boxes generated by LiDAR point clouds and RGB
images. Yet, such a label-level fusion strategy brings limited improvements to
the quality of pseudo-boxes, as it overlooks the complementary nature in terms
of LiDAR and RGB image data. To overcome the above limitations, we propose a
novel data-level fusion framework that integrates RGB images and LiDAR data at
an early stage. Specifically, we utilize vision foundation models for instance
segmentation and depth estimation on images and introduce a bi-directional
fusion method, where real points acquire category labels from the 2D space,
while 2D pixels are projected onto 3D to enhance real point density. To
mitigate noise from depth and segmentation estimations, we propose a local and
global filtering method, which applies local radius filtering to suppress depth
estimation errors and global statistical filtering to remove
segmentation-induced outliers. Furthermore, we propose a data-level fusion
based dynamic self-evolution strategy, which iteratively refines pseudo-boxes
under a dense representation, significantly improving localization accuracy.
Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that the detector
trained by our method significantly outperforms that trained by previous
state-of-the-art methods with 28.4$\%$ mAP on the nuScenes validation
benchmark.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种基于深度学习的BMI估计方法，使用84,963张智能手机图像的大规模数据集，通过自动过滤方法筛选高质量图像，在测试集上达到7.9%的MAPE，是目前文献中的最佳结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统BMI测量方法在远程医疗或紧急情况下不可行或不实用，需要从相机图像中快速评估体重指数。现有计算机视觉方法受限于较小数据集（最多14,500张图像）。

Method: 使用WayBED数据集（84,963张图像，25,353人），引入基于姿态聚类和人物检测的自动过滤方法筛选高质量图像，保留71,322张图像用于训练深度学习模型。

Result: 在WayBED测试集上达到7.9% MAPE（文献最低值），在未见过的VisualBodyToBMI数据集上达到13% MAPE（与最先进方法相当），微调后在该数据集上达到8.56% MAPE（最低报告值）。

Conclusion: 该方法在移动设备上成功部署，代码开源，为BMI估计提供了大规模数据集和有效的自动过滤方法，展示了良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Estimating Body Mass Index (BMI) from camera images with machine learning
models enables rapid weight assessment when traditional methods are unavailable
or impractical, such as in telehealth or emergency scenarios. Existing computer
vision approaches have been limited to datasets of up to 14,500 images. In this
study, we present a deep learning-based BMI estimation method trained on our
WayBED dataset, a large proprietary collection of 84,963 smartphone images from
25,353 individuals. We introduce an automatic filtering method that uses
posture clustering and person detection to curate the dataset by removing
low-quality images, such as those with atypical postures or incomplete views.
This process retained 71,322 high-quality images suitable for training. We
achieve a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 7.9% on our hold-out test
set (WayBED data) using full-body images, the lowest value in the published
literature to the best of our knowledge. Further, we achieve a MAPE of 13% on
the completely unseen~(during training) VisualBodyToBMI dataset, comparable
with state-of-the-art approaches trained on it, demonstrating robust
generalization. Lastly, we fine-tune our model on VisualBodyToBMI and achieve a
MAPE of 8.56%, the lowest reported value on this dataset so far. We deploy the
full pipeline, including image filtering and BMI estimation, on Android devices
using the CLAID framework. We release our complete code for model training,
filtering, and the CLAID package for mobile deployment as open-source
contributions.

TL;DR: 本研究通过557个模拟实验，系统评估了7种主流域适应技术在自然和医学图像分类中的表现，发现DSAN算法在COVID-19等医学数据集上表现优异，准确率达91.2%，在动态数据流场景中比基线提升6.7%，且具有出色的可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 域适应技术能缓解训练集和测试集之间的分布差异，但现有研究多基于自然图像而非医学数据，且主流数据集可能导致性能偏差。为更好理解域适应在自然和医学图像中的效果，需要进行系统性评估。

Method: 使用7种广泛应用的域适应技术，在5个自然图像数据集和8个医学图像数据集上进行557个模拟实验，涵盖分布外、动态数据流和有限训练样本等多种场景。

Result: DSAN算法表现突出，在COVID-19数据集上使用Resnet50达到91.2%的分类准确率，在动态数据流场景中比基线提升6.7%。DSAN在COVID-19和皮肤癌数据集上展现出显著的可解释性。

Conclusion: 研究结果深化了对域适应技术的理解，为模型有效适应医学数据提供了宝贵见解，DSAN算法在医学图像分类中表现出色且具有实用价值。

Abstract: Domain adaptation (DA) techniques have the potential in machine learning to
alleviate distribution differences between training and test sets by leveraging
information from source domains. In image classification, most advances in DA
have been made using natural images rather than medical data, which are harder
to work with. Moreover, even for natural images, the use of mainstream datasets
can lead to performance bias. {With the aim of better understanding the
benefits of DA for both natural and medical images, this study performs 557
simulation studies using seven widely-used DA techniques for image
classification in five natural and eight medical datasets that cover various
scenarios, such as out-of-distribution, dynamic data streams, and limited
training samples.} Our experiments yield detailed results and insightful
observations highlighting the performance and medical applicability of these
techniques. Notably, our results have shown the outstanding performance of the
Deep Subdomain Adaptation Network (DSAN) algorithm. This algorithm achieved
feasible classification accuracy (91.2\%) in the COVID-19 dataset using
Resnet50 and showed an important accuracy improvement in the dynamic data
stream DA scenario (+6.7\%) compared to the baseline. Our results also
demonstrate that DSAN exhibits remarkable level of explainability when
evaluated on COVID-19 and skin cancer datasets. These results contribute to the
understanding of DA techniques and offer valuable insight into the effective
adaptation of models to medical data.

Motivation: 视频目标检测面临运动模糊、遮挡等图像退化问题，现有方法通常通过特征聚合和复杂后处理提升性能，但计算成本较高。需要在不增加推理计算负担的情况下提高对图像退化的鲁棒性

Method: 1. 使用对比损失实现对比学习辅助分支，增强主干网络的特征表示能力；2. 提出动态损失权重策略，训练初期强调辅助特征学习，训练收敛时逐渐优先检测任务

Result: 在ImageNet VID数据集上，使用ResNet-101达到84.0% mAP，使用ResNeXt-101达到85.2% mAP，实现了CNN模型的SOTA性能，且无需额外后处理方法

Conclusion: CLAB方法通过简单的对比学习辅助分支和动态权重策略，有效提升了视频目标检测的性能，在不增加推理计算成本的情况下实现了优异的检测效果

Abstract: Video object detection is a challenging task because videos often suffer from
image deterioration such as motion blur, occlusion, and deformable shapes,
making it significantly more difficult than detecting objects in still images.
Prior approaches have improved video object detection performance by employing
feature aggregation and complex post-processing techniques, though at the cost
of increased computational demands. To improve robustness to image degradation
without additional computational load during inference, we introduce a
straightforward yet effective Contrastive Learning through Auxiliary Branch
(CLAB) method. First, we implement a constrastive auxiliary branch using a
contrastive loss to enhance the feature representation capability of the video
object detector's backbone. Next, we propose a dynamic loss weighting strategy
that emphasizes auxiliary feature learning early in training while gradually
prioritizing the detection task as training converges. We validate our approach
through comprehensive experiments and ablation studies, demonstrating
consistent performance gains. Without bells and whistles, CLAB reaches a
performance of 84.0% mAP and 85.2% mAP with ResNet-101 and ResNeXt-101,
respectively, on the ImageNet VID dataset, thus achieving state-of-the-art
performance for CNN-based models without requiring additional post-processing
methods.

TL;DR: 本文分析了CLIP视觉编码器在排版攻击下的行为，发现特定注意力头负责提取排版信息，并提出无需微调的防御方法，通过选择性消融注意力头电路来提升模型对排版攻击的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 排版攻击通过向图像中注入文本来操纵多模态系统，导致目标错误分类、恶意内容生成和视觉语言模型越狱。需要研究CLIP模型在此类攻击下的行为并开发有效防御方法。

Method: 定位CLIP模型后半层中专门提取排版信息的注意力头，构建排版电路，通过选择性消融这些注意力头来防御排版攻击，无需微调训练。

Result: 在ImageNet-100的排版变体上性能提升高达19.6%，标准ImageNet-100准确率下降小于1%。无需训练的方法与依赖微调的最先进防御方法竞争力相当。

Conclusion: 发布了一系列对排版攻击具有显著鲁棒性的dyslexic CLIP模型，可作为安全关键应用的即插即用替代方案，在文本识别效用与文本操纵风险之间取得平衡。

Abstract: Typographic attacks exploit multi-modal systems by injecting text into
images, leading to targeted misclassifications, malicious content generation
and even Vision-Language Model jailbreaks. In this work, we analyze how CLIP
vision encoders behave under typographic attacks, locating specialized
attention heads in the latter half of the model's layers that causally extract
and transmit typographic information to the cls token. Building on these
insights, we introduce a method to defend CLIP models against typographic
attacks by selectively ablating a typographic circuit, consisting of attention
heads. Without requiring finetuning, our method improves performance by up to
19.6% on a typographic variant of ImageNet-100, while reducing standard
ImageNet-100 accuracy by less than 1%. Notably, our training-free approach
remains competitive with current state-of-the-art typographic defenses that
rely on finetuning. To this end, we release a family of dyslexic CLIP models
which are significantly more robust against typographic attacks. These models
serve as suitable drop-in replacements for a broad range of safety-critical
applications, where the risks of text-based manipulation outweigh the utility
of text recognition.

Abstract: Facial expression recognition (FER) is a crucial task in computer vision with
wide range of applications including human computer interaction, surveillance,
and assistive technologies. However, challenges such as occlusion, expression
variability, and lack of interpretability hinder the performance of traditional
FER systems. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a powerful alternative by
modeling relational dependencies between facial landmarks, enabling structured
and interpretable learning. In this paper, we propose GLaRE, a novel
Graph-based Landmark Region Embedding network for emotion recognition. Facial
landmarks are extracted using 3D facial alignment, and a quotient graph is
constructed via hierarchical coarsening to preserve spatial structure while
reducing complexity. Our method achieves 64.89 percentage accuracy on AffectNet
and 94.24 percentage on FERG, outperforming several existing baselines.
Additionally, ablation studies have demonstrated that region-level embeddings
from quotient graphs have contributed to improved prediction performance.

Conclusion: FastFit通过创新的可缓存扩散架构成功解决了多参考虚拟试穿的效率和功能限制问题，为复杂多参考虚拟试穿研究提供了新的技术方案和数据集支持

Abstract: Despite its great potential, virtual try-on technology is hindered from
real-world application by two major challenges: the inability of current
methods to support multi-reference outfit compositions (including garments and
accessories), and their significant inefficiency caused by the redundant
re-computation of reference features in each denoising step. To address these
challenges, we propose FastFit, a high-speed multi-reference virtual try-on
framework based on a novel cacheable diffusion architecture. By employing a
Semi-Attention mechanism and substituting traditional timestep embeddings with
class embeddings for reference items, our model fully decouples reference
feature encoding from the denoising process with negligible parameter overhead.
This allows reference features to be computed only once and losslessly reused
across all steps, fundamentally breaking the efficiency bottleneck and
achieving an average 3.5x speedup over comparable methods. Furthermore, to
facilitate research on complex, multi-reference virtual try-on, we introduce
DressCode-MR, a new large-scale dataset. It comprises 28,179 sets of
high-quality, paired images covering five key categories (tops, bottoms,
dresses, shoes, and bags), constructed through a pipeline of expert models and
human feedback refinement. Extensive experiments on the VITON-HD, DressCode,
and our DressCode-MR datasets show that FastFit surpasses state-of-the-art
methods on key fidelity metrics while offering its significant advantage in
inference efficiency.

Abstract: Identifying sitters in historical paintings is a key task for art historians,
offering insight into their lives and how they chose to be seen. However, the
process is often subjective and limited by the lack of data and stylistic
variations. Automated facial recognition is capable of handling challenging
conditions and can assist, but while traditional facial recognition models
perform well on photographs, they struggle with paintings due to domain shift
and high intra-class variation. Artistic factors such as style, skill, intent,
and influence from other works further complicate recognition. In this work, we
investigate the potential of foundation models to improve facial recognition in
artworks. By fine-tuning foundation models and integrating their embeddings
with those from conventional facial recognition networks, we demonstrate
notable improvements over current state-of-the-art methods. Our results show
that foundation models can bridge the gap where traditional methods are
ineffective. Paper page at https://www.idiap.ch/paper/artface/

Abstract: The thermal camera excels at perceiving outdoor environments under low-light
conditions, making it ideal for applications such as nighttime autonomous
driving and unmanned navigation. However, thermal cameras encounter challenges
when capturing signage from objects made of similar materials, which can pose
safety risks for accurately understanding semantics in autonomous driving
systems. In contrast, the neuromorphic vision camera, also known as an event
camera, detects changes in light intensity asynchronously and has proven
effective in high-speed, low-light traffic environments. Recognizing the
complementary characteristics of these two modalities, this paper proposes
UTA-Sign, an unsupervised thermal-event video augmentation for traffic signage
in low-illumination environments, targeting elements such as license plates and
roadblock indicators. To address the signage blind spots of thermal imaging and
the non-uniform sampling of event cameras, we developed a dual-boosting
mechanism that fuses thermal frames and event signals for consistent signage
representation over time. The proposed method utilizes thermal frames to
provide accurate motion cues as temporal references for aligning the uneven
event signals. At the same time, event signals contribute subtle signage
content to the raw thermal frames, enhancing the overall understanding of the
environment. The proposed method is validated on datasets collected from
real-world scenarios, demonstrating superior quality in traffic signage
sketching and improved detection accuracy at the perceptual level.

Abstract: Foundation image-text models such as CLIP with zero-shot capabilities enable
a wide array of applications. MobileCLIP is a recent family of image-text
models at 3-15ms latency and 50-150M parameters with state-of-the-art zero-shot
accuracy. The main ingredients in MobileCLIP were its low-latency and light
architectures and a novel multi-modal reinforced training that made knowledge
distillation from multiple caption-generators and CLIP teachers efficient,
scalable, and reproducible. In this paper, we improve the multi-modal
reinforced training of MobileCLIP through: 1) better CLIP teacher ensembles
trained on the DFN dataset, 2) improved captioner teachers trained on the DFN
dataset and fine-tuned on a diverse selection of high-quality image-caption
datasets. We discover new insights through ablations such as the importance of
temperature tuning in contrastive knowledge distillation, the effectiveness of
caption-generator fine-tuning for caption diversity, and the additive
improvement from combining synthetic captions generated by multiple models. We
train a new family of models called MobileCLIP2 and achieve state-of-the-art
ImageNet-1k zero-shot accuracies at low latencies. In particular, we observe
2.2% improvement in ImageNet-1k accuracy for MobileCLIP2-B compared with
MobileCLIP-B architecture. Notably, MobileCLIP2-S4 matches the zero-shot
accuracy of SigLIP-SO400M/14 on ImageNet-1k while being 2$\times$ smaller and
improves on DFN ViT-L/14 at 2.5$\times$ lower latency. We release our
pretrained models (https://github.com/apple/ml-mobileclip) and the data
generation code (https://github.com/apple/ml-mobileclip-dr). The data
generation code makes it easy to create new reinforced datasets with arbitrary

Abstract: Deepfake technology, driven by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), poses
significant risks to privacy and societal security. Existing detection methods
are predominantly passive, focusing on post-event analysis without preventing
attacks. To address this, we propose an active defense method based on
low-frequency perceptual perturbations to disrupt face swapping manipulation,
reducing the performance and naturalness of generated content. Unlike prior
approaches that used low-frequency perturbations to impact classification
accuracy,our method directly targets the generative process of deepfake
techniques. We combine frequency and spatial domain features to strengthen
defenses. By introducing artifacts through low-frequency perturbations while
preserving high-frequency details, we ensure the output remains visually
plausible. Additionally, we design a complete architecture featuring an
encoder, a perturbation generator, and a decoder, leveraging discrete wavelet
transform (DWT) to extract low-frequency components and generate perturbations
that disrupt facial manipulation models. Experiments on CelebA-HQ and LFW
demonstrate significant reductions in face-swapping effectiveness, improved
defense success rates, and preservation of visual quality.

Abstract: Generating 3D human motions from text is a challenging yet valuable task. The
key aspects of this task are ensuring text-motion consistency and achieving
generation diversity. Although recent advancements have enabled the generation
of precise and high-quality human motions from text, achieving diversity in the
generated motions remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we aim to
overcome the above challenge by designing a simple yet effective text-to-motion
generation method, \textit{i.e.}, Diverse-T2M. Our method introduces
uncertainty into the generation process, enabling the generation of highly
diverse motions while preserving the semantic consistency of the text.
Specifically, we propose a novel perspective that utilizes noise signals as
carriers of diversity information in transformer-based methods, facilitating a
explicit modeling of uncertainty. Moreover, we construct a latent space where
text is projected into a continuous representation, instead of a rigid
one-to-one mapping, and integrate a latent space sampler to introduce
stochastic sampling into the generation process, thereby enhancing the
diversity and uncertainty of the outputs. Our results on text-to-motion
generation benchmark datasets~(HumanML3D and KIT-ML) demonstrate that our
method significantly enhances diversity while maintaining state-of-the-art
performance in text consistency.

Abstract: Generalizable Gaussian Splatting aims to synthesize novel views for unseen
scenes without per-scene optimization. In particular, recent advancements
utilize feed-forward networks to predict per-pixel Gaussian parameters,
enabling high-quality synthesis from sparse input views. However, existing
approaches fall short in encoding discriminative, multi-view consistent
features for Gaussian predictions, which struggle to construct accurate
geometry with sparse views. To address this, we propose $\mathbf{C}^{3}$-GS, a
framework that enhances feature learning by incorporating context-aware,
cross-dimension, and cross-scale constraints. Our architecture integrates three
lightweight modules into a unified rendering pipeline, improving feature fusion
and enabling photorealistic synthesis without requiring additional supervision.
Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate that $\mathbf{C}^{3}$-GS

Abstract: Intraoperative ultrasound images are inherently challenging to interpret in
liver surgery due to the limited field of view and complex anatomical
structures. Bridging the gap between preoperative and intraoperative data is
crucial for effective surgical guidance. 3D IntraVascular UltraSound (IVUS)
offers a potential solution by enabling the reconstruction of the entire organ,
which facilitates registration between preoperative computed tomography (CT)
scans and intraoperative IVUS images. In this work, we propose an
optimization-based calibration method using a 3D-printed phantom for accurate
3D Intravascular Ultrasound volume reconstruction. Our approach ensures precise
alignment of tracked IVUS data with preoperative CT images, improving
intraoperative navigation. We validated our method using in vivo swine liver
images, achieving a calibration error from 0.88 to 1.80 mm and a registration
error from 3.40 to 5.71 mm between the 3D IVUS data and the corresponding CT
scan. Our method provides a reliable and accurate means of calibration and
volume reconstruction. It can be used to register intraoperative ultrasound
images with preoperative CT images in the context of liver surgery, and enhance
intraoperative guidance.

*Jiawen Lin,Shiran Bian,Yihang Zhu,Wenbin Tan,Yachao Zhang,Yuan Xie,Yanyun Qu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SeqVLM是一个新颖的零样本3D视觉定位框架，通过多视角真实场景图像和空间信息进行目标物体推理，在ScanRefer和Nr3D基准测试中实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的零样本3D视觉定位方法面临空间推理受限、上下文遗漏和细节退化等挑战，主要依赖于单视角定位。

Method: 首先通过3D语义分割网络生成3D实例提案，并通过语义过滤进行精炼；然后采用提案引导的多视角投影策略，将候选提案投影到真实场景图像序列中；最后通过动态调度机制迭代处理序列查询提示，利用VLM的跨模态推理能力识别文本指定的对象。

Result: 在ScanRefer和Nr3D基准测试中分别达到55.6%和53.2%的Acc@0.25分数，比之前的零样本方法分别提升了4.0%和5.2%。

Conclusion: SeqVLM框架显著提升了3D视觉定位的泛化能力和实际应用性，为真实世界应用提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: 3D Visual Grounding (3DVG) aims to localize objects in 3D scenes using
natural language descriptions. Although supervised methods achieve higher
accuracy in constrained settings, zero-shot 3DVG holds greater promise for
real-world applications since eliminating scene-specific training requirements.
However, existing zero-shot methods face challenges of spatial-limited
reasoning due to reliance on single-view localization, and contextual omissions
or detail degradation. To address these issues, we propose SeqVLM, a novel
zero-shot 3DVG framework that leverages multi-view real-world scene images with
spatial information for target object reasoning. Specifically, SeqVLM first
generates 3D instance proposals via a 3D semantic segmentation network and
refines them through semantic filtering, retaining only semantic-relevant
candidates. A proposal-guided multi-view projection strategy then projects
these candidate proposals onto real scene image sequences, preserving spatial
relationships and contextual details in the conversion process of 3D point
cloud to images. Furthermore, to mitigate VLM computational overload, we
implement a dynamic scheduling mechanism that iteratively processes
sequances-query prompts, leveraging VLM's cross-modal reasoning capabilities to
identify textually specified objects. Experiments on the ScanRefer and Nr3D
benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving Acc@0.25 scores
of 55.6% and 53.2%, surpassing previous zero-shot methods by 4.0% and 5.2%,
respectively, which advance 3DVG toward greater generalization and real-world
applicability. The code is available at https://github.com/JiawLin/SeqVLM.

<details>

Motivation: 半导体制造中磁場成像(MFI)数据集稀缺，由于专有性问题导致机器学习模型训练困难，需要生成合成数据来优化缺陷定位

Method: 采用扩散模型结合两个物理约束，开发PI-GenMFI方法生成合成MFI图像，特别针对最常见的电源短路缺陷类型

Result: 与最先进的VAE和扩散生成模型相比，通过领域专家评估和多种图像生成指标验证，显示出有希望的结果

Conclusion: 物理信息生成模型能够有效生成合成MFI数据，为半导体缺陷定位过程的优化提供了可行解决方案

Abstract: In semiconductor manufacturing, defect detection and localization are
critical to ensuring product quality and yield. While X-ray imaging is a
reliable non-destructive testing method, it is memory-intensive and
time-consuming for large-scale scanning, Magnetic Field Imaging (MFI) offers a
more efficient means to localize regions of interest (ROI) for targeted X-ray
scanning. However, the limited availability of MFI datasets due to proprietary
concerns presents a significant bottleneck for training machine learning (ML)
models using MFI. To address this challenge, we consider an ML-driven approach
leveraging diffusion models with two physical constraints. We propose Physics
Informed Generative Models for Magnetic Field Images (PI-GenMFI) to generate
synthetic MFI samples by integrating specific physical information. We generate
MFI images for the most common defect types: power shorts. These synthetic
images will serve as training data for ML algorithms designed to localize
defect areas efficiently. To evaluate generated MFIs, we compare our model to
SOTA generative models from both variational autoencoder (VAE) and diffusion
methods. We present a domain expert evaluation to assess the generated samples.
In addition, we present qualitative and quantitative evaluation using various
metrics used for image generation and signal processing, showing promising
results to optimize the defect localization process.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP模型在军事应用中具有零样本分类优势，但其在遮挡和低信噪比等挑战性军事环境中的鲁棒性尚未充分探索

Method: 使用18类军事车辆自定义数据集，评估不同CLIP变体在不同遮挡比例下的性能，采用NAUC指标，分析Transformer与CNN架构差异，并进行线性探测和骨干网络微调实验

Result: 1) Transformer-based CLIP优于CNN模型；2) 细粒度分散遮挡比大块连续遮挡影响更大；3) 线性探测模型在35%遮挡时性能急剧下降；4) 微调骨干网络可将性能下降点推迟到60%以上遮挡

Conclusion: 需要在训练中加入遮挡特定的数据增强，并进一步探索补丁级敏感性和架构韧性，以提高CLIP在真实军事部署中的实用性

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP enable zero-shot classification by
aligning images and text in a shared embedding space, offering advantages for
defense applications with scarce labeled data. However, CLIP's robustness in
challenging military environments, with partial occlusion and degraded
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), remains underexplored. We investigate CLIP
variants' robustness to occlusion using a custom dataset of 18 military vehicle
classes and evaluate using Normalized Area Under the Curve (NAUC) across
occlusion percentages. Four key insights emerge: (1) Transformer-based CLIP
models consistently outperform CNNs, (2) fine-grained, dispersed occlusions
degrade performance more than larger contiguous occlusions, (3) despite
improved accuracy, performance of linear-probed models sharply drops at around
35% occlusion, (4) by finetuning the model's backbone, this performance drop
occurs at more than 60% occlusion. These results underscore the importance of
occlusion-specific augmentations during training and the need for further
exploration into patch-level sensitivity and architectural resilience for
real-world deployment of CLIP.

Method: 使用GAN框架，将生成器分解为层次块，逐步精炼中间表示来提高语义保真度，并引入L1-ball约束来稳定优化

Result: 在高分辨率场景、输入分布外设置以及深度复杂DNN模型上，方法表现显著超过以往攻击方法

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了数据重构攻击的效果和通用性，显示了分开推理中的隐私风险

Abstract: The growing complexity of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) has led to the adoption
of Split Inference (SI), a collaborative paradigm that partitions computation
between edge devices and the cloud to reduce latency and protect user privacy.
However, recent advances in Data Reconstruction Attacks (DRAs) reveal that
intermediate features exchanged in SI can be exploited to recover sensitive
input data, posing significant privacy risks. Existing DRAs are typically
effective only on shallow models and fail to fully leverage semantic priors,
limiting their reconstruction quality and generalizability across datasets and
model architectures. In this paper, we propose a novel GAN-based DRA framework
with Progressive Feature Optimization (PFO), which decomposes the generator
into hierarchical blocks and incrementally refines intermediate representations
to enhance the semantic fidelity of reconstructed images. To stabilize the
optimization and improve image realism, we introduce an L1-ball constraint
during reconstruction. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms
prior attacks by a large margin, especially in high-resolution scenarios,
out-of-distribution settings, and against deeper and more complex DNNs.

Result: 实证结果显示该方法显著优于传统方法，有效减少幻觉、增强安全性并提升整体能力。

Conclusion: 该方法为大型视觉语言模型的对齐提供了更有效的解决方案，实现了自主改进的多模态对齐。

Abstract: The rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large
Visual-Language Models (LVLMs) have opened up new opportunities for integrating
visual and linguistic modalities. However, effectively aligning these
modalities remains challenging, often leading to hallucinations--where
generated outputs are not grounded in the visual input--and raising safety
concerns across various domains. Existing alignment methods, such as
instruction tuning and preference tuning, often rely on external datasets,
human annotations, or complex post-processing, which limit scalability and
increase costs. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that
generates the debiased self-judgment score, a self-evaluation metric created
internally by the model without relying on external resources. This enables the
model to autonomously improve alignment. Our method enhances both decoding
strategies and preference tuning processes, resulting in reduced
hallucinations, enhanced safety, and improved overall capability. Empirical
results show that our approach significantly outperforms traditional methods,
offering a more effective solution for aligning LVLMs.

Abstract: Focusing on the development of an end-to-end autonomous vehicle model with
pixel-to-pixel context awareness, this research proposes the SKGE-Swin
architecture. This architecture utilizes the Swin Transformer with a skip-stage
mechanism to broaden feature representation globally and at various network
levels. This approach enables the model to extract information from distant
pixels by leveraging the Swin Transformer's Shifted Window-based Multi-head
Self-Attention (SW-MSA) mechanism and to retain critical information from the
initial to the final stages of feature extraction, thereby enhancing its
capability to comprehend complex patterns in the vehicle's surroundings. The
model is evaluated on the CARLA platform using adversarial scenarios to
simulate real-world conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that the
SKGE-Swin architecture achieves a superior Driving Score compared to previous
methods. Furthermore, an ablation study will be conducted to evaluate the
contribution of each architectural component, including the influence of skip

Conclusion: EmoCAST通过创新的模块设计和训练策略，成功解决了情感说话头合成中的关键挑战，为实际应用提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Emotional talking head synthesis aims to generate talking portrait videos
with vivid expressions. Existing methods still exhibit limitations in control
flexibility, motion naturalness, and expression quality. Moreover, currently
available datasets are primarily collected in lab settings, further
exacerbating these shortcomings. Consequently, these limitations substantially
hinder practical applications in real-world scenarios. To address these
challenges, we propose EmoCAST, a diffusion-based framework with two key
modules for precise text-driven emotional synthesis. In appearance modeling,
emotional prompts are integrated through a text-guided decoupled emotive
module, enhancing the spatial knowledge to improve emotion comprehension. To
improve the relationship between audio and emotion, we introduce an emotive
audio attention module to capture the interplay between controlled emotion and
driving audio, generating emotion-aware features to guide more precise facial
motion synthesis. Additionally, we construct an emotional talking head dataset
with comprehensive emotive text descriptions to optimize the framework's
performance. Based on the proposed dataset, we propose an emotion-aware
sampling training strategy and a progressive functional training strategy that
further improve the model's ability to capture nuanced expressive features and
achieve accurate lip-synchronization. Overall, EmoCAST achieves
state-of-the-art performance in generating realistic, emotionally expressive,
and audio-synchronized talking-head videos. Project Page:

Conclusion: 建议借鉴社区数十年经验来应对视频抽象概念理解这一重要开放挑战，在基础模型时代避免重复工作，推动该领域发展。

Abstract: The automatic understanding of video content is advancing rapidly. Empowered
by deeper neural networks and large datasets, machines are increasingly capable
of understanding what is concretely visible in video frames, whether it be
objects, actions, events, or scenes. In comparison, humans retain a unique
ability to also look beyond concrete entities and recognize abstract concepts
like justice, freedom, and togetherness. Abstract concept recognition forms a
crucial open challenge in video understanding, where reasoning on multiple
semantic levels based on contextual information is key. In this paper, we argue
that the recent advances in foundation models make for an ideal setting to
address abstract concept understanding in videos. Automated understanding of
high-level abstract concepts is imperative as it enables models to be more
aligned with human reasoning and values. In this survey, we study different
tasks and datasets used to understand abstract concepts in video content. We
observe that, periodically and over a long period, researchers have attempted
to solve these tasks, making the best use of the tools available at their
disposal. We advocate that drawing on decades of community experience will help
us shed light on this important open grand challenge and avoid ``re-inventing
the wheel'' as we start revisiting it in the era of multi-modal foundation
models.

Abstract: Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality in
women, and early detection is essential for improving outcomes. Magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) is a highly sensitive tool for breast cancer detection,
particularly in women at high risk or with dense breast tissue, where
mammography is less effective. The ODELIA consortium organized a multi-center
challenge to foster AI-based solutions for breast cancer diagnosis and
classification. The dataset included 511 studies from six European centers,
acquired on scanners from multiple vendors at both 1.5 T and 3 T. Each study
was labeled for the left and right breast as no lesion, benign lesion, or
malignant lesion. We developed a SwinUNETR-based deep learning framework that
incorporates breast region masking, extensive data augmentation, and ensemble
learning to improve robustness and generalizability. Our method achieved second

Conclusion: AvatarBack通过创新的生成先验和空间对齐策略，有效解决了3D高斯头像重建中后脑区域缺失的问题，为完整一致的头像重建提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in Gaussian Splatting have significantly boosted the
reconstruction of head avatars, enabling high-quality facial modeling by
representing an 3D avatar as a collection of 3D Gaussians. However, existing
methods predominantly rely on frontal-view images, leaving the back-head poorly
constructed. This leads to geometric inconsistencies, structural blurring, and
reduced realism in the rear regions, ultimately limiting the fidelity of
reconstructed avatars. To address this challenge, we propose AvatarBack, a
novel plug-and-play framework specifically designed to reconstruct complete and
consistent 3D Gaussian avatars by explicitly modeling the missing back-head
regions. AvatarBack integrates two core technical innovations,i.e., the
Subject-specific Generator (SSG) and the Adaptive Spatial Alignment Strategy
(ASA). The former leverages a generative prior to synthesize
identity-consistent, plausible back-view pseudo-images from sparse frontal
inputs, providing robust multi-view supervision. To achieve precise geometric
alignment between these synthetic views and the 3D Gaussian representation, the
later employs learnable transformation matrices optimized during training,
effectively resolving inherent pose and coordinate discrepancies. Extensive
experiments on NeRSemble and K-hairstyle datasets, evaluated using geometric,
photometric, and GPT-4o-based perceptual metrics, demonstrate that AvatarBack
significantly enhances back-head reconstruction quality while preserving
frontal fidelity. Moreover, the reconstructed avatars maintain consistent
visual realism under diverse motions and remain fully animatable.

Abstract: Existing Causal-Why Video Question Answering (VideoQA) models often struggle
with higher-order reasoning, relying on opaque, monolithic pipelines that
entangle video understanding, causal inference, and answer generation. These
black-box approaches offer limited interpretability and tend to depend on
shallow heuristics. We propose a novel, modular framework that explicitly
decouples causal reasoning from answer generation, introducing natural language
causal chains as interpretable intermediate representations. Inspired by human
cognitive models, these structured cause-effect sequences bridge low-level
video content with high-level causal reasoning, enabling transparent and
logically coherent inference. Our two-stage architecture comprises a Causal
Chain Extractor (CCE) that generates causal chains from video-question pairs,
and a Causal Chain-Driven Answerer (CCDA) that produces answers grounded in
these chains. To address the lack of annotated reasoning traces, we introduce a
scalable method for generating high-quality causal chains from existing
datasets using large language models. We also propose CauCo, a new evaluation
metric for causality-oriented captioning. Experiments on three large-scale
benchmarks demonstrate that our approach not only outperforms state-of-the-art
models, but also yields substantial gains in explainability, user trust, and
generalization -- positioning the CCE as a reusable causal reasoning engine
across diverse domains. Project page:

Abstract: Recent advancements in skin lesion classification models have significantly
improved accuracy, with some models even surpassing dermatologists' diagnostic
performance. However, in medical practice, distrust in AI models remains a
challenge. Beyond high accuracy, trustworthy, explainable diagnoses are
essential. Existing explainability methods have reliability issues, with
LIME-based methods suffering from inconsistency, while CAM-based methods
failing to consider all classes. To address these limitations, we propose
Global Class Activation Probabilistic Map Evaluation, a method that analyses
all classes' activation probability maps probabilistically and at a pixel
level. By visualizing the diagnostic process in a unified manner, it helps
reduce the risk of misdiagnosis. Furthermore, the application of SafeML
enhances the detection of false diagnoses and issues warnings to doctors and
patients as needed, improving diagnostic reliability and ultimately patient
safety. We evaluated our method using the ISIC datasets with MobileNetV2 and

Conclusion: CraftGraffiti推进了身份尊重的AI辅助艺术创作目标，为创意AI应用中平衡风格自由度和可识别性提供了原则性方法。

Abstract: Preserving facial identity under extreme stylistic transformation remains a
major challenge in generative art. In graffiti, a high-contrast, abstract
medium, subtle distortions to the eyes, nose, or mouth can erase the subject's
recognizability, undermining both personal and cultural authenticity. We
present CraftGraffiti, an end-to-end text-guided graffiti generation framework
designed with facial feature preservation as a primary objective. Given an
input image and a style and pose descriptive prompt, CraftGraffiti first
applies graffiti style transfer via LoRA-fine-tuned pretrained diffusion
transformer, then enforces identity fidelity through a face-consistent
self-attention mechanism that augments attention layers with explicit identity
embeddings. Pose customization is achieved without keypoints, using CLIP-guided
prompt extension to enable dynamic re-posing while retaining facial coherence.
We formally justify and empirically validate the "style-first, identity-after"
paradigm, showing it reduces attribute drift compared to the reverse order.
Quantitative results demonstrate competitive facial feature consistency and
state-of-the-art aesthetic and human preference scores, while qualitative
analyses and a live deployment at the Cruilla Festival highlight the system's
real-world creative impact. CraftGraffiti advances the goal of
identity-respectful AI-assisted artistry, offering a principled approach for
blending stylistic freedom with recognizability in creative AI applications.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了扩散分类器在组合泛化能力方面是否优于判别式模型（如CLIP和ViLT），特别是在属性绑定和关系推理任务上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然语言语义的一个基本方面是能够从已知部分组合出新含义。虽然视觉语言模型（VLMs）近年来取得显著进展，但有证据表明它们无法有效进行这种组合推理，例如CLIP在处理红色立方体和蓝色圆柱体图像时容易出现错误标签。

Method: 评估三种模型（扩散分类器、CLIP和ViLT）在零样本学习（ZSL）和广义零样本学习（GZSL）设置下绑定对象属性和关系的能力。分析CLIP嵌入表示以探究关系推理困难的原因。

Result: 扩散分类器和ViLT在概念绑定任务上表现良好，但所有模型在关系GZSL任务上都面临显著困难。CLIP嵌入分析表明，困难可能源于关系概念（如左右）的表示过于相似。

Conclusion: 扩散分类器在某些组合任务上具有改进的泛化能力，但所有视觉语言模型在关系推理方面都面临根本性挑战，需要进一步研究来改善关系概念的表示学习。

Abstract: A fundamental aspect of the semantics of natural language is that novel
meanings can be formed from the composition of previously known parts.
Vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant progress in recent years,
however, there is evidence that they are unable to perform this kind of
composition. For example, given an image of a red cube and a blue cylinder, a
VLM such as CLIP is likely to incorrectly label the image as a red cylinder or
a blue cube, indicating it represents the image as a `bag-of-words' and fails
to capture compositional semantics. Diffusion models have recently gained
significant attention for their impressive generative abilities, and zero-shot
classifiers based on diffusion models have been shown to perform competitively
with CLIP in certain compositional tasks. In this work we explore whether the
generative Diffusion Classifier has improved compositional generalisation
abilities compared to discriminative models. We assess three models --
Diffusion Classifier, CLIP, and ViLT -- on their ability to bind objects with
attributes and relations in both zero-shot learning (ZSL) and generalised
zero-shot learning (GZSL) settings. Our results show that the Diffusion
Classifier and ViLT perform well at concept binding tasks, but that all models
struggle significantly with the relational GZSL task, underscoring the broader
challenges VLMs face with relational reasoning. Analysis of CLIP embeddings
suggests that the difficulty may stem from overly similar representations of
relational concepts such as left and right. Code and dataset are available at:

Motivation: 现有点云配准方法忽略了点方向和点不确定性，导致模型对噪声输入和激进旋转敏感，需要大量带变换增强的训练数据。

Method: 从激光雷达点云初始化面元，使用SE(3)等变卷积核学习位置和旋转的显式等变特征，通过交叉注意力机制计算相似度，使用全连接解码器和非线性Huber损失预测相对变换。

Result: 在室内外数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法在真实点云扫描上相比最先进方法具有优越性和鲁棒性能。

Conclusion: 提出的面元位姿学习回归方法能够有效处理点云配准中的方向和不确定性问题，在真实场景中表现出优异的性能。

Abstract: Point cloud registration is crucial for ensuring 3D alignment consistency of
multiple local point clouds in 3D reconstruction for remote sensing or digital
heritage. While various point cloud-based registration methods exist, both
non-learning and learning-based, they ignore point orientations and point
uncertainties, making the model susceptible to noisy input and aggressive
rotations of the input point cloud like orthogonal transformation; thus, it
necessitates extensive training point clouds with transformation augmentations.
To address these issues, we propose a novel surfel-based pose learning
regression approach. Our method can initialize surfels from Lidar point cloud
using virtual perspective camera parameters, and learns explicit
$\mathbf{SE(3)}$ equivariant features, including both position and rotation
through $\mathbf{SE(3)}$ equivariant convolutional kernels to predict relative
transformation between source and target scans. The model comprises an
equivariant convolutional encoder, a cross-attention mechanism for similarity
computation, a fully-connected decoder, and a non-linear Huber loss.
Experimental results on indoor and outdoor datasets demonstrate our model
superiority and robust performance on real point-cloud scans compared to
state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: S-HArM数据集用于意图感知分类，包含9,576个社交媒体图像-文本对，标注为幽默/讽刺、艺术或虚假信息。研究比较了三种提示策略生成合成训练数据，发现保留视觉上下文的图像和多模态引导数据泛化效果更好，但整体性能有限。

Motivation: 现有多模态AI在检测合成和上下文外内容方面取得进展，但忽视了AI生成图像背后的意图识别问题。

Method: 构建S-HArM多模态数据集，探索三种提示策略（图像引导、描述引导、多模态引导）使用Stable Diffusion生成大规模合成训练数据，并进行包括模态融合、对比学习、重建网络、注意力机制和大规模视觉语言模型的比较研究。

Result: 在图像引导和多模态引导数据上训练的模型对真实内容泛化更好，因为保留了视觉上下文，但整体性能仍然有限。

Conclusion: 推断意图的复杂性很高，需要专门的架构来解决这一挑战，当前方法在意图识别方面仍有很大改进空间。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal AI have enabled progress in detecting synthetic
and out-of-context content. However, existing efforts largely overlook the
intent behind AI-generated images. To fill this gap, we introduce S-HArM, a
multimodal dataset for intent-aware classification, comprising 9,576 "in the
wild" image-text pairs from Twitter/X and Reddit, labeled as Humor/Satire, Art,
or Misinformation. Additionally, we explore three prompting strategies
(image-guided, description-guided, and multimodally-guided) to construct a
large-scale synthetic training dataset with Stable Diffusion. We conduct an
extensive comparative study including modality fusion, contrastive learning,
reconstruction networks, attention mechanisms, and large vision-language
models. Our results show that models trained on image- and multimodally-guided
data generalize better to "in the wild" content, due to preserved visual
context. However, overall performance remains limited, highlighting the
complexity of inferring intent and the need for specialized architectures.

Motivation: 解决神经视频压缩中精确比特率控制的挑战，传统学习型编解码器在变比特率场景下存在固有局限性

Method: 提出动态路由自编码器(DRA)和速率控制代理，采用联合路由优化策略进行协作训练，实现多路径编码和实时比特率调整

Result: 在HEVC和UVG数据集上平均BD-Rate降低14.8%，BD-PSNR增益0.47dB，平均比特率误差仅1.66%

Conclusion: 该方法实现了速率-失真-复杂度优化(RDCO)，适用于各种比特率和比特率受限的应用场景

Abstract: Neural Video Compression (NVC) has achieved remarkable performance in recent
years. However, precise rate control remains a challenge due to the inherent
limitations of learning-based codecs. To solve this issue, we propose a dynamic
video compression framework designed for variable bitrate scenarios. First, to
achieve variable bitrate implementation, we propose the Dynamic-Route
Autoencoder with variable coding routes, each occupying partial computational
complexity of the whole network and navigating to a distinct RD trade-off.
Second, to approach the target bitrate, the Rate Control Agent estimates the
bitrate of each route and adjusts the coding route of DRA at run time. To
encompass a broad spectrum of variable bitrates while preserving overall RD
performance, we employ the Joint-Routes Optimization strategy, achieving
collaborative training of various routes. Extensive experiments on the HEVC and
UVG datasets show that the proposed method achieves an average BD-Rate
reduction of 14.8% and BD-PSNR gain of 0.47dB over state-of-the-art methods
while maintaining an average bitrate error of 1.66%, achieving
Rate-Distortion-Complexity Optimization (RDCO) for various bitrate and
bitrate-constrained applications. Our code is available at

Motivation: 现有方法依赖基于图像强度的配准相似性损失，可能忽略心脏解剖区域，导致心脏运动估计不准确。需要一种能够更好捕捉心脏解剖结构的方法。

Method: 提出循环变分自编码器建模心脏周期的时空依赖性，使用两个后验模型进行双心室分割和运动估计。通过贝叶斯推导的损失函数递归配准分割图，避免使用基于图像强度的相似性损失。

Result: 在UK Biobank数据集上验证，CardioMorphNet在心脏运动估计方面表现优于最先进方法，并且能够计算运动场的不确定性图，在心脏区域产生更低的不确定性值。

Conclusion: CardioMorphNet通过形状引导的贝叶斯深度学习框架，显著提高了心脏运动估计的准确性和可靠性，为心脏功能评估提供了更可靠的工具。

Abstract: Accurate cardiac motion estimation from cine cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR)
images is vital for assessing cardiac function and detecting its abnormalities.
Existing methods often struggle to capture heart motion accurately because they
rely on intensity-based image registration similarity losses that may overlook
cardiac anatomical regions. To address this, we propose CardioMorphNet, a
recurrent Bayesian deep learning framework for 3D cardiac shape-guided
deformable registration using short-axis (SAX) CMR images. It employs a
recurrent variational autoencoder to model spatio-temporal dependencies over
the cardiac cycle and two posterior models for bi-ventricular segmentation and
motion estimation. The derived loss function from the Bayesian formulation
guides the framework to focus on anatomical regions by recursively registering
segmentation maps without using intensity-based image registration similarity
loss, while leveraging sequential SAX volumes and spatio-temporal features. The
Bayesian modelling also enables computation of uncertainty maps for the
estimated motion fields. Validated on the UK Biobank dataset by comparing
warped mask shapes with ground truth masks, CardioMorphNet demonstrates
superior performance in cardiac motion estimation, outperforming
state-of-the-art methods. Uncertainty assessment shows that it also yields
lower uncertainty values for estimated motion fields in the cardiac region
compared with other probabilistic-based cardiac registration methods,
indicating higher confidence in its predictions.

Conclusion: 为CERN粒子物理实验中的高效探测器模拟提供了有前景的解决方案

Abstract: Simulating detector responses is a crucial part of understanding the inner
workings of particle collisions in the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. Such
simulations are currently performed with statistical Monte Carlo methods, which
are computationally expensive and put a significant strain on CERN's
computational grid. Therefore, recent proposals advocate for generative machine
learning methods to enable more efficient simulations. However, the
distribution of the data varies significantly across the simulations, which is
hard to capture with out-of-the-box methods. In this study, we present
ExpertSim - a deep learning simulation approach tailored for the Zero Degree
Calorimeter in the ALICE experiment. Our method utilizes a
Mixture-of-Generative-Experts architecture, where each expert specializes in
simulating a different subset of the data. This allows for a more precise and
efficient generation process, as each expert focuses on a specific aspect of
the calorimeter response. ExpertSim not only improves accuracy, but also
provides a significant speedup compared to the traditional Monte-Carlo methods,
offering a promising solution for high-efficiency detector simulations in
particle physics experiments at CERN. We make the code available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 不具型有丝切裂图像(AMFs)是重要的组织病理学标记物，但在不同扫描仪、染色和获取来源的域偏移情况下，其识别一致性面临挑战。需要开发域稳健的分类方法来提高在异构来源数据上的表现。

Abstract: Atypical mitotic figures (AMFs) are important histopathological markers yet
remain challenging to identify consistently, particularly under domain shift
stemming from scanner, stain, and acquisition differences. We present a simple
training-time recipe for domain-robust AMF classification in MIDOG 2025 Task 2.
The approach (i) increases feature diversity via style perturbations inserted
at early and mid backbone stages, (ii) aligns attention-refined features across
sites using weak domain labels (Scanner, Origin, Species, Tumor) through an
auxiliary alignment loss, and (iii) stabilizes predictions by distilling from
an exponential moving average (EMA) teacher with temperature-scaled KL
divergence. On the organizer-run preliminary leaderboard for atypical mitosis
classification, our submission attains balanced accuracy of 0.8762, sensitivity
of 0.8873, specificity of 0.8651, and ROC AUC of 0.9499. The method incurs
negligible inference-time overhead, relies only on coarse domain metadata, and
delivers strong, balanced performance, positioning it as a competitive
submission for the MIDOG 2025 challenge.

<details>

Motivation: 当前基于点式奖励模型的文本到图像生成方法容易受到奖励破解影响，微小分数差异经过归一化后被放大，导致模型过度优化琐碎增益，破坏生成稳定性

Method: Pref-GRPO：基于成对偏好奖励的GRPO方法，在每组图像内进行成对比较，使用胜率作为奖励信号，将优化目标从分数最大化转变为偏好拟合

Result: 实验表明Pref-GRPO能够区分细微的图像质量差异，提供更稳定的优势并缓解奖励破解。UniGenBench基准测试揭示了开源和闭源T2I模型的优缺点

Conclusion: Pref-GRPO方法通过成对偏好比较有效解决了奖励破解问题，UniGenBench为文本到图像生成提供了更全面的评估框架

Abstract: Recent advancements highlight the importance of GRPO-based reinforcement
learning methods and benchmarking in enhancing text-to-image (T2I) generation.
However, current methods using pointwise reward models (RM) for scoring
generated images are susceptible to reward hacking. We reveal that this happens
when minimal score differences between images are amplified after
normalization, creating illusory advantages that drive the model to
over-optimize for trivial gains, ultimately destabilizing the image generation
process. To address this, we propose Pref-GRPO, a pairwise preference
reward-based GRPO method that shifts the optimization objective from score
maximization to preference fitting, ensuring more stable training. In
Pref-GRPO, images are pairwise compared within each group using preference RM,
and the win rate is used as the reward signal. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that PREF-GRPO differentiates subtle image quality differences,
providing more stable advantages and mitigating reward hacking. Additionally,
existing T2I benchmarks are limited by coarse evaluation criteria, hindering
comprehensive model assessment. To solve this, we introduce UniGenBench, a
unified T2I benchmark comprising 600 prompts across 5 main themes and 20
subthemes. It evaluates semantic consistency through 10 primary and 27
sub-criteria, leveraging MLLM for benchmark construction and evaluation. Our
benchmarks uncover the strengths and weaknesses of both open and closed-source
T2I models and validate the effectiveness of Pref-GRPO.

Motivation: 现有深度伪造检测学术基准与工业实践存在严重差异，训练源单一、测试图像质量低，阻碍了检测器的实际部署。

Method: 引入HydraFake数据集模拟真实挑战；提出Veritas检测器，基于多模态大语言模型，采用模式感知推理（规划和自反思）模拟人类取证过程；使用两阶段训练管道。

Conclusion: HydraFake数据集和Veritas检测器有效解决了深度伪造检测在真实世界中的泛化挑战，为实际部署提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Deepfake detection remains a formidable challenge due to the complex and
evolving nature of fake content in real-world scenarios. However, existing
academic benchmarks suffer from severe discrepancies from industrial practice,
typically featuring homogeneous training sources and low-quality testing
images, which hinder the practical deployments of current detectors. To
mitigate this gap, we introduce HydraFake, a dataset that simulates real-world
challenges with hierarchical generalization testing. Specifically, HydraFake
involves diversified deepfake techniques and in-the-wild forgeries, along with
rigorous training and evaluation protocol, covering unseen model architectures,
emerging forgery techniques and novel data domains. Building on this resource,
we propose Veritas, a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) based deepfake
detector. Different from vanilla chain-of-thought (CoT), we introduce
pattern-aware reasoning that involves critical reasoning patterns such as
"planning" and "self-reflection" to emulate human forensic process. We further
propose a two-stage training pipeline to seamlessly internalize such deepfake
reasoning capacities into current MLLMs. Experiments on HydraFake dataset
reveal that although previous detectors show great generalization on
cross-model scenarios, they fall short on unseen forgeries and data domains.
Our Veritas achieves significant gains across different OOD scenarios, and is
capable of delivering transparent and faithful detection outputs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度伪造检测主要针对完全合成的视频，但局部伪造（如修改面部表情、替换物体、背景修改）与真实元素无缝融合，更具欺骗性且难以检测。当前缺乏专门针对这类局部伪造的检测能力和基准数据集。

Method: 提出了FakePartsBench基准数据集，包含超过25,000个视频，提供像素级和帧级操作标注。通过用户研究和现有检测模型评估，验证局部伪造的检测难度。

Result: 实验表明，FakeParts使人类检测准确率相比传统深度伪造下降了30%以上，现有最先进检测模型也表现出类似的性能下降。

Conclusion: 这项工作揭示了当前深度伪造检测方法在面对局部视频操作时的严重脆弱性，并为开发更鲁棒的检测方法提供了必要的资源和基准。

Abstract: We introduce FakeParts, a new class of deepfakes characterized by subtle,
localized manipulations to specific spatial regions or temporal segments of
otherwise authentic videos. Unlike fully synthetic content, these partial
manipulations, ranging from altered facial expressions to object substitutions
and background modifications, blend seamlessly with real elements, making them
particularly deceptive and difficult to detect. To address the critical gap in
detection capabilities, we present FakePartsBench, the first large-scale
benchmark dataset specifically designed to capture the full spectrum of partial
deepfakes. Comprising over 25K videos with pixel-level and frame-level
manipulation annotations, our dataset enables comprehensive evaluation of
detection methods. Our user studies demonstrate that FakeParts reduces human
detection accuracy by over 30% compared to traditional deepfakes, with similar
performance degradation observed in state-of-the-art detection models. This
work identifies an urgent vulnerability in current deepfake detection
approaches and provides the necessary resources to develop more robust methods
for partial video manipulations.

Abstract: Accurate dental caries detection from panoramic X-rays plays a pivotal role
in preventing lesion progression. However, current detection methods often
yield suboptimal accuracy due to subtle contrast variations and diverse lesion
morphology of dental caries. In this work, inspired by the clinical workflow
where dentists systematically combine whole-image screening with detailed
tooth-level inspection, we present DVCTNet, a novel Dual-View Co-Training
network for accurate dental caries detection. Our DVCTNet starts with employing
automated tooth detection to establish two complementary views: a global view
from panoramic X-ray images and a local view from cropped tooth images. We then
pretrain two vision foundation models separately on the two views. The
global-view foundation model serves as the detection backbone, generating
region proposals and global features, while the local-view model extracts
detailed features from corresponding cropped tooth patches matched by the
region proposals. To effectively integrate information from both views, we
introduce a Gated Cross-View Attention (GCV-Atten) module that dynamically
fuses dual-view features, enhancing the detection pipeline by integrating the
fused features back into the detection model for final caries detection. To
rigorously evaluate our DVCTNet, we test it on a public dataset and further
validate its performance on a newly curated, high-precision dental caries
detection dataset, annotated using both intra-oral images and panoramic X-rays
for double verification. Experimental results demonstrate DVCTNet's superior
performance against existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on both datasets,
indicating the clinical applicability of our method. Our code and labeled
dataset are available at https://github.com/ShanghaiTech-IMPACT/DVCTNet.

Conclusion: 该研究成功地将人群计数与图像融合相结合，为密集场景下的多模态视觉任务提供了有效的解决方案，证明了多任务学习框架在提升图像融合质量和下游任务性能方面的有效性。

Abstract: Most visible and infrared image fusion (VIF) methods focus primarily on
optimizing fused image quality. Recent studies have begun incorporating
downstream tasks, such as semantic segmentation and object detection, to
provide semantic guidance for VIF. However, semantic segmentation requires
extensive annotations, while object detection, despite reducing annotation
efforts compared with segmentation, faces challenges in highly crowded scenes
due to overlapping bounding boxes and occlusion. Moreover, although RGB-T crowd
counting has gained increasing attention in recent years, no studies have
integrated VIF and crowd counting into a unified framework. To address these
challenges, we propose FusionCounting, a novel multi-task learning framework
that integrates crowd counting into the VIF process. Crowd counting provides a
direct quantitative measure of population density with minimal annotation,
making it particularly suitable for dense scenes. Our framework leverages both
input images and population density information in a mutually beneficial
multi-task design. To accelerate convergence and balance tasks contributions,
we introduce a dynamic loss function weighting strategy. Furthermore, we
incorporate adversarial training to enhance the robustness of both VIF and
crowd counting, improving the model's stability and resilience to adversarial
attacks. Experimental results on public datasets demonstrate that
FusionCounting not only enhances image fusion quality but also achieves
superior crowd counting performance.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel pipeline for 2D keypoint estima- tion of surgical
tools by leveraging Vision Language Models (VLMs) fine- tuned using a low rank
adjusting (LoRA) technique. Unlike traditional Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN) or Transformer-based approaches, which often suffer from overfitting in
small-scale medical datasets, our method harnesses the generalization
capabilities of pre-trained VLMs. We carefully design prompts to create an
instruction-tuning dataset and use them to align visual features with semantic
keypoint descriptions. Experimental results show that with only two epochs of
fine tuning, the adapted VLM outperforms the baseline models, demonstrating the
ef- fectiveness of LoRA in low-resource scenarios. This approach not only
improves keypoint detection performance, but also paves the way for future work

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了PointDGRWKV框架，是首个基于RWKV的域通用点云分类方案，通过调整空间模型和对齐分布来提升跨域性能。

Result: 在多个标准数据集上进行了广泛实验，结果显示PointDGRWKV在域通用点云分类任务上达到了最先进的性能水平。

Conclusion: 该研究成功将RWKV架构应用于点云数据的域通用分类，解决了直接应用时的空间扭曲和波动问题，为点云处理领域提供了一种高效的跨域通用方案。

Abstract: Domain Generalization (DG) has been recently explored to enhance the
generalizability of Point Cloud Classification (PCC) models toward unseen
domains. Prior works are based on convolutional networks, Transformer or Mamba
architectures, either suffering from limited receptive fields or high
computational cost, or insufficient long-range dependency modeling. RWKV, as an
emerging architecture, possesses superior linear complexity, global receptive
fields, and long-range dependency. In this paper, we present the first work
that studies the generalizability of RWKV models in DG PCC. We find that
directly applying RWKV to DG PCC encounters two significant challenges: RWKV's
fixed direction token shift methods, like Q-Shift, introduce spatial
distortions when applied to unstructured point clouds, weakening local
geometric modeling and reducing robustness. In addition, the Bi-WKV attention
in RWKV amplifies slight cross-domain differences in key distributions through
exponential weighting, leading to attention shifts and degraded generalization.
To this end, we propose PointDGRWKV, the first RWKV-based framework tailored
for DG PCC. It introduces two key modules to enhance spatial modeling and
cross-domain robustness, while maintaining RWKV's linear efficiency. In
particular, we present Adaptive Geometric Token Shift to model local
neighborhood structures to improve geometric context awareness. In addition,
Cross-Domain key feature Distribution Alignment is designed to mitigate
attention drift by aligning key feature distributions across domains. Extensive
experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that PointDGRWKV achieves
state-of-the-art performance on DG PCC.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度学习病理诊断模型决策不透明、缺乏可追溯依据的问题，提供透明可解释的AI辅助病理诊断。

Method: 提出PathMR框架，基于病理图像和文本查询，同时生成专家级诊断解释和预测细胞分布模式。

Result: 在两个数据集上的实验表明，PathMR在文本生成质量、分割准确性和跨模态对齐方面均优于最先进的视觉推理方法。

Conclusion: PathMR展示了在AI驱动病理诊断中提高可解释性的潜力，代码将公开提供。

Abstract: Deep learning based automated pathological diagnosis has markedly improved
diagnostic efficiency and reduced variability between observers, yet its
clinical adoption remains limited by opaque model decisions and a lack of
traceable rationale. To address this, recent multimodal visual reasoning
architectures provide a unified framework that generates segmentation masks at
the pixel level alongside semantically aligned textual explanations. By
localizing lesion regions and producing expert style diagnostic narratives,
these models deliver the transparent and interpretable insights necessary for
dependable AI assisted pathology. Building on these advancements, we propose
PathMR, a cell-level Multimodal visual Reasoning framework for Pathological
image analysis. Given a pathological image and a textual query, PathMR
generates expert-level diagnostic explanations while simultaneously predicting
cell distribution patterns. To benchmark its performance, we evaluated our
approach on the publicly available PathGen dataset as well as on our newly
developed GADVR dataset. Extensive experiments on these two datasets
demonstrate that PathMR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art visual
reasoning methods in text generation quality, segmentation accuracy, and
cross-modal alignment. These results highlight the potential of PathMR for
improving interpretability in AI-driven pathological diagnosis. The code will
be publicly available in https://github.com/zhangye-zoe/PathMR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胰腺导管腺癌（PDAC）是致死率最高的癌症之一，五年生存率低于10%，主要原因是晚期检测。需要开发早期检测方法来提高生存率

Method: 使用六种不同的深度学习架构（包括传统CNN和现代Vision Transformer），通过修改的ResNet架构，采用冻结预训练层和类别加权训练来处理有限数据集和类别不平衡问题

Result: 最终优化的框架在癌症检测方面达到了超过90%的准确率，显著优于当前的手动分析方法

Conclusion: 建立了一个强大的自动化PDAC检测流程，可以增强病理学家的能力，并为未来扩展到其他癌症类型提供了基础，同时为有限规模医学影像数据集上的深度学习应用提供了宝贵见解

Abstract: Pacreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains one of the most lethal forms
of cancer, with a five-year survival rate below 10% primarily due to late
detection. This research develops and validates a deep learning framework for
early PDAC detection through analysis of dual-modality imaging:
autofluorescence and second harmonic generation (SHG). We analyzed 40 unique
patient samples to create a specialized neural network capable of
distinguishing between normal, fibrotic, and cancerous tissue. Our methodology
evaluated six distinct deep learning architectures, comparing traditional
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with modern Vision Transformers (ViTs).
Through systematic experimentation, we identified and overcome significant
challenges in medical image analysis, including limited dataset size and class
imbalance. The final optimized framework, based on a modified ResNet
architecture with frozen pre-trained layers and class-weighted training,
achieved over 90% accuracy in cancer detection. This represents a significant
improvement over current manual analysis methods an demonstrates potential for
clinical deployment. This work establishes a robust pipeline for automated PDAC
detection that can augment pathologists' capabilities while providing a
foundation for future expansion to other cancer types. The developed
methodology also offers valuable insights for applying deep learning to
limited-size medical imaging datasets, a common challenge in clinical
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 反事实推理已成为可解释和公平AI的核心方法，需要开发系统性的框架来发现虚假相关性、探索因果依赖关系，并构建更鲁棒的系统

Method: 通过系统性地改变语义上有意义的属性同时保持其他属性不变，整合归因分析和概念级分析，使用对抗性反事实、课程学习、因果图构建和训练免费算法等技术

Result: 开发了多个有效的方法：CAVLI量化模型对可解释概念的依赖程度，ASAC提高模型公平性和准确性，TIBET实现可扩展的偏见评估，BiasConnect诊断交叉偏见，InterMit缓解交叉偏见

Conclusion: 反事实推理为判别性和生成性模型中的可解释性、公平性和因果性提供了统一的视角，建立了原则性、可扩展的社会责任偏见评估和缓解方法

Abstract: Counterfactual reasoning -- the practice of asking ``what if'' by varying
inputs and observing changes in model behavior -- has become central to
interpretable and fair AI. This thesis develops frameworks that use
counterfactuals to explain, audit, and mitigate bias in vision classifiers and
generative models. By systematically altering semantically meaningful
attributes while holding others fixed, these methods uncover spurious
correlations, probe causal dependencies, and help build more robust systems.
  The first part addresses vision classifiers. CAVLI integrates attribution
(LIME) with concept-level analysis (TCAV) to quantify how strongly decisions
rely on human-interpretable concepts. With localized heatmaps and a Concept
Dependency Score, CAVLI shows when models depend on irrelevant cues like
backgrounds. Extending this, ASAC introduces adversarial counterfactuals that
perturb protected attributes while preserving semantics. Through curriculum
learning, ASAC fine-tunes biased models for improved fairness and accuracy
while avoiding stereotype-laden artifacts.
  The second part targets generative Text-to-Image (TTI) models. TIBET provides
a scalable pipeline for evaluating prompt-sensitive biases by varying
identity-related terms, enabling causal auditing of how race, gender, and age
affect image generation. To capture interactions, BiasConnect builds causal
graphs diagnosing intersectional biases. Finally, InterMit offers a modular,
training-free algorithm that mitigates intersectional bias via causal
sensitivity scores and user-defined fairness goals.
  Together, these contributions show counterfactuals as a unifying lens for
interpretability, fairness, and causality in both discriminative and generative
models, establishing principled, scalable methods for socially responsible bias
evaluation and mitigation.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicle perception typically relies on modular pipelines that
decompose the task into detection, tracking, and prediction. While
interpretable, these pipelines suffer from error accumulation and limited
inter-task synergy. Unified perception has emerged as a promising paradigm that
integrates these sub-tasks within a shared architecture, potentially improving
robustness, contextual reasoning, and efficiency while retaining interpretable
outputs. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of unified
perception, introducing a holistic and systemic taxonomy that categorizes
methods along task integration, tracking formulation, and representation flow.
We define three paradigms -Early, Late, and Full Unified Perception- and
systematically review existing methods, their architectures, training
strategies, datasets used, and open-source availability, while highlighting
future research directions. This work establishes the first comprehensive
framework for understanding and advancing unified perception, consolidates
fragmented efforts, and guides future research toward more robust,
generalizable, and interpretable perception.

Conclusion: 利用通用基础模型的优质密集预训练特征，为提升医学图像分割精度提供了高效且参数效率高的方法。

Abstract: Foundation models pre-trained on large-scale natural image datasets offer a
powerful paradigm for medical image segmentation. However, effectively
transferring their learned representations for precise clinical applications
remains a challenge. In this work, we propose Dino U-Net, a novel
encoder-decoder architecture designed to exploit the high-fidelity dense
features of the DINOv3 vision foundation model. Our architecture introduces an
encoder built upon a frozen DINOv3 backbone, which employs a specialized
adapter to fuse the model's rich semantic features with low-level spatial
details. To preserve the quality of these representations during dimensionality
reduction, we design a new fidelity-aware projection module (FAPM) that
effectively refines and projects the features for the decoder. We conducted
extensive experiments on seven diverse public medical image segmentation
datasets. Our results show that Dino U-Net achieves state-of-the-art
performance, consistently outperforming previous methods across various imaging
modalities. Our framework proves to be highly scalable, with segmentation
accuracy consistently improving as the backbone model size increases up to the
7-billion-parameter variant. The findings demonstrate that leveraging the
superior, dense-pretrained features from a general-purpose foundation model
provides a highly effective and parameter-efficient approach to advance the
accuracy of medical image segmentation. The code is available at

Abstract: Mitotic figures (MFs) are relevant biomarkers in tumor grading.
Differentiating atypical MFs (AMFs) from normal MFs (NMFs) remains difficult,
as manual annotation is time-consuming and subjective. In this work an ensemble
of ConvNeXtBase models was trained with AUCMEDI and extend with a rule-based

achieved a balanced accuracy of 84.02%. While the RBR increased specificity, it
reduced sensitivity and overall performance. The results show that deep
ensembles perform well for AMF classification. RBR can increase specific
metrics but requires further research.

Abstract: In the era of Industry 5.0, monitoring human activity is essential for
ensuring both ergonomic safety and overall well-being. While multi-camera
centralized setups improve pose estimation accuracy, they often suffer from
high computational costs and bandwidth requirements, limiting scalability and
real-time applicability. Distributing processing across edge devices can reduce
network bandwidth and computational load. On the other hand, the constrained
resources of edge devices lead to accuracy degradation, and the distribution of
computation leads to temporal and spatial inconsistencies. We address this
challenge by proposing COMETH (Convex Optimization for Multiview Estimation and
Tracking of Humans), a lightweight algorithm for real-time multi-view human
pose fusion that relies on three concepts: it integrates kinematic and
biomechanical constraints to increase the joint positioning accuracy; it
employs convex optimization-based inverse kinematics for spatial fusion; and it
implements a state observer to improve temporal consistency. We evaluate COMETH
on both public and industrial datasets, where it outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in localization, detection, and tracking accuracy. The proposed fusion
pipeline enables accurate and scalable human motion tracking, making it
well-suited for industrial and safety-critical applications. The code is

Abstract: Many high-performance networks were not designed with lightweight application

application. This paper takes ConvNeXt as the research object and significantly
reduces the parameter scale and network complexity of ConvNeXt by integrating
the Cross Stage Partial Connections mechanism and a series of optimized

Abstract: Images manipulated using image editing tools can mislead viewers and pose
significant risks to social security. However, accurately localizing the
manipulated regions within an image remains a challenging problem. One of the
main barriers in this area is the high cost of data acquisition and the severe
lack of high-quality annotated datasets. To address this challenge, we
introduce novel methods that mitigate data scarcity by leveraging readily
available web data. We utilize a large collection of manually forged images
from the web, as well as automatically generated annotations derived from a
simpler auxiliary task, constrained image manipulation localization.
Specifically, we introduce a new paradigm CAAAv2, which automatically and
accurately annotates manipulated regions at the pixel level. To further improve
annotation quality, we propose a novel metric, QES, which filters out
unreliable annotations. Through CAAA v2 and QES, we construct MIMLv2, a
large-scale, diverse, and high-quality dataset containing 246,212 manually
forged images with pixel-level mask annotations. This is over 120x larger than
existing handcrafted datasets like IMD20. Additionally, we introduce Object
Jitter, a technique that further enhances model training by generating
high-quality manipulation artifacts. Building on these advances, we develop a
new model, Web-IML, designed to effectively leverage web-scale supervision for
the image manipulation localization task. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our approach substantially alleviates the data scarcity problem and
significantly improves the performance of various models on multiple real-world
forgery benchmarks. With the proposed web supervision, Web-IML achieves a
striking performance gain of 31% and surpasses previous SOTA TruFor by 24.1
average IoU points. The dataset and code will be made publicly available at

TL;DR: POSE是一个单步蒸馏框架，通过两阶段过程（稳定性预热和统一对抗平衡）来加速大规模视频扩散模型的采样，实现单步生成高质量视频，同时保持语义对齐和时间一致性。


<details>

Motivation: 现有视频加速方法存在根本性限制：既不建模视频帧的时间连贯性，也无法为大规模视频模型提供单步蒸馏，导致采样效率低下。

Method: 采用两阶段蒸馏过程：1）稳定性预热机制稳定对抗蒸馏，优化单步映射的视频质量；2）统一对抗平衡机制促进稳定的单步对抗训练，在噪声空间中达到纳什均衡。对于条件生成还提出了条件对抗一致性方法。

Result: 在VBench-I2V上平均提升7.15%的语义对齐、时间一致性和帧质量，将预训练模型的延迟从1000秒降低到10秒（100倍加速），同时保持竞争性性能。

Conclusion: POSE成功解决了大规模视频扩散模型采样效率低下的问题，实现了单步高质量视频生成，在保持性能的同时显著提升了采样速度。

Abstract: The field of video diffusion generation faces critical bottlenecks in
sampling efficiency, especially for large-scale models and long sequences.
Existing video acceleration methods adopt image-based techniques but suffer
from fundamental limitations: they neither model the temporal coherence of
video frames nor provide single-step distillation for large-scale video models.
To bridge this gap, we propose POSE (Phased One-Step Equilibrium), a
distillation framework that reduces the sampling steps of large-scale video
diffusion models, enabling the generation of high-quality videos in a single
step. POSE employs a carefully designed two-phase process to distill video
models:(i) stability priming: a warm-up mechanism to stabilize adversarial
distillation that adapts the high-quality trajectory of the one-step generator
from high to low signal-to-noise ratio regimes, optimizing the video quality of
single-step mappings near the endpoints of flow trajectories. (ii) unified
adversarial equilibrium: a flexible self-adversarial distillation mechanism
that promotes stable single-step adversarial training towards a Nash
equilibrium within the Gaussian noise space, generating realistic single-step
videos close to real videos. For conditional video generation, we propose (iii)
conditional adversarial consistency, a method to improve both semantic
consistency and frame consistency between conditional frames and generated
frames. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that POSE outperforms other
acceleration methods on VBench-I2V by average 7.15% in semantic alignment,
temporal conference and frame quality, reducing the latency of the pre-trained
model by 100$\times$, from 1000 seconds to 10 seconds, while maintaining
competitive performance.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models enable high-quality image generation but are
computationally expensive. While prior work optimizes per-inference efficiency,
we explore an orthogonal approach: reducing redundancy across correlated
prompts. Our method leverages the coarse-to-fine nature of diffusion models,
where early denoising steps capture shared structures among similar prompts. We
propose a training-free approach that clusters prompts based on semantic
similarity and shares computation in early diffusion steps. Experiments show
that for models trained conditioned on image embeddings, our approach
significantly reduces compute cost while improving image quality. By leveraging
UnClip's text-to-image prior, we enhance diffusion step allocation for greater
efficiency. Our method seamlessly integrates with existing pipelines, scales
with prompt sets, and reduces the environmental and financial burden of
large-scale text-to-image generation. Project page:

TL;DR: 提出基于Mamba架构的VM-UNet方法用于组织病理学图像中的有丝分裂检测，通过染色增强操作提升模型在域偏移情况下的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 组织病理学图像中的有丝分裂检测对肿瘤评估至关重要，但现有机器学习算法在跨域测试时性能显著下降，需要开发对域偏移具有鲁棒性的检测方法。

Method: 采用基于Mamba架构的VM-UNet网络进行有丝分裂检测，结合染色增强操作来提高模型对域偏移的适应能力。该方法已提交至MIDOG挑战赛第一赛道。

Result: 在MIDOG++数据集上的初步实验显示，所提出的方法仍有很大的改进空间，表明需要进一步优化。

Conclusion: 基于Mamba的VM-UNet架构结合染色增强是解决有丝分裂检测域偏移问题的有前景方向，但需要继续改进以获得更好的性能。

Abstract: Mitosis detection in histopathology images plays a key role in tumor
assessment. Although machine learning algorithms could be exploited for aiding
physicians in accurately performing such a task, these algorithms suffer from
significative performance drop when evaluated on images coming from domains
that are different from the training ones. In this work, we propose a
Mamba-based approach for mitosis detection under domain shift, inspired by the
promising performance demonstrated by Mamba in medical imaging segmentation
tasks. Specifically, our approach exploits a VM-UNet architecture for carrying
out the addressed task, as well as stain augmentation operations for further
improving model robustness against domain shift. Our approach has been
submitted to the track 1 of the MItosis DOmain Generalization (MIDOG)
challenge. Preliminary experiments, conducted on the MIDOG++ dataset, show
large room for improvement for the proposed method.

Motivation: 识别组织病理学图像中的非典型有丝分裂图像对评估肿瘤侵袭性至关重要，但机器学习模型在域偏移下性能显著下降，需要提高模型的域泛化能力。

Method: 采用多任务学习方法，利用与主要分类任务相关的辅助任务，帮助模型专注于分类目标，忽略图像中域变化的背景信息。

Abstract: Recognizing atypical mitotic figures in histopathology images allows
physicians to correctly assess tumor aggressiveness. Although machine learning
models could be exploited for automatically performing such a task, under
domain shift these models suffer from significative performance drops. In this
work, an approach based on multi-task learning is proposed for addressing this
problem. By exploiting auxiliary tasks, correlated to the main classification
task, the proposed approach, submitted to the track 2 of the MItosis DOmain
Generalization (MIDOG) challenge, aims to aid the model to focus only on the
object to classify, ignoring the domain varying background of the image. The
proposed approach shows promising performance in a preliminary evaluation
conducted on three distinct datasets, i.e., the MIDOG 2025 Atypical Training
Set, the Ami-Br dataset, as well as the preliminary test set of the MIDOG25

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FW-GAN是一个基于频率感知的单样本手写体合成框架，通过Wave-MLP和频率引导鉴别器生成高质量、风格一致的手写文本，解决了传统方法在长距离依赖和频率信息建模方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有手写体合成方法存在两个主要问题：传统卷积架构难以建模长距离依赖和复杂笔画模式，以及忽视了频率信息在捕捉细粒度风格细节中的关键作用。

Method: 提出FW-GAN框架，包含相位感知Wave-MLP生成器来捕捉空间关系并保留风格线索，频率引导鉴别器利用高频成分增强真实性检测，以及新颖的频率分布损失来对齐合成与真实手写体的频率特征。

Result: 在越南语和英语手写数据集上的实验表明，FW-GAN能够生成高质量、风格一致的手写体，有效增强了低资源手写识别系统的数据。

Conclusion: FW-GAN通过频率感知方法显著提升了手写体合成的真实性和风格一致性，为低资源手写识别任务提供了有价值的数据增强工具。

Abstract: Labeled handwriting data is often scarce, limiting the effectiveness of
recognition systems that require diverse, style-consistent training samples.
Handwriting synthesis offers a promising solution by generating artificial data
to augment training. However, current methods face two major limitations.
First, most are built on conventional convolutional architectures, which
struggle to model long-range dependencies and complex stroke patterns. Second,
they largely ignore the crucial role of frequency information, which is
essential for capturing fine-grained stylistic and structural details in
handwriting. To address these challenges, we propose FW-GAN, a one-shot
handwriting synthesis framework that generates realistic, writer-consistent
text from a single example. Our generator integrates a phase-aware Wave-MLP to
better capture spatial relationships while preserving subtle stylistic cues. We
further introduce a frequency-guided discriminator that leverages
high-frequency components to enhance the authenticity detection of generated
samples. Additionally, we introduce a novel Frequency Distribution Loss that
aligns the frequency characteristics of synthetic and real handwriting, thereby
enhancing visual fidelity. Experiments on Vietnamese and English handwriting
datasets demonstrate that FW-GAN generates high-quality, style-consistent
handwriting, making it a valuable tool for augmenting data in low-resource
handwriting recognition (HTR) pipelines. Official implementation is available

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MMG-Vid是一种无需训练的视觉token剪枝框架，通过最大化边际收益在段级和token级去除冗余，显著减少75%视觉token并加速推理3.9倍，同时保持99.5%的原始性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频大语言模型的视觉token过多导致计算效率低下，现有方法忽略了视频的动态特性和时间依赖性，需要一种更高效的token剪枝方法。

Method: 提出两阶段框架：1)基于帧相似性分割视频并动态分配token预算；2)使用时序引导的DPC算法联合建模帧间独特性和帧内多样性，最大化每个token的边际收益。

Result: 在LLaVA-OneVision-7B上实验显示，能减少75%视觉token，预填充阶段加速3.9倍，同时保持99.5%的原始性能。

Conclusion: MMG-Vid通过最大化有限token预算的利用率，在保持强性能的同时显著提升了视频大语言模型的推理效率。

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VLLMs) excel in video understanding, but their
excessive visual tokens pose a significant computational challenge for
real-world applications. Current methods aim to enhance inference efficiency by
visual token pruning. However, they do not consider the dynamic characteristics
and temporal dependencies of video frames, as they perceive video understanding
as a multi-frame task. To address these challenges, we propose MMG-Vid, a novel
training-free visual token pruning framework that removes redundancy by
Maximizing Marginal Gains at both segment-level and token-level. Specifically,
we first divide the video into segments based on frame similarity, and then
dynamically allocate the token budget for each segment to maximize the marginal
gain of each segment. Subsequently, we propose a temporal-guided DPC algorithm
that jointly models inter-frame uniqueness and intra-frame diversity, thereby
maximizing the marginal gain of each token. By combining both stages, MMG-Vid
can maximize the utilization of the limited token budget, significantly
improving efficiency while maintaining strong performance. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MMG-Vid can maintain over 99.5% of the original
performance, while effectively reducing 75% visual tokens and accelerating the
prefilling stage by 3.9x on LLaVA-OneVision-7B. Code will be released soon.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉-语言-动作模型需要大量后训练，计算开销大，限制了可扩展性和部署。受人类多模态协调启发，需要开发更高效的框架。

Method: 采用3阶段渐进架构：1) EFA-Routing在视觉编码器中注入指令信息选择性聚合视觉token；2) LFP-Routing在语言模型中引入动作意图，剪枝无关token实现稀疏化；3) V-L-A耦合注意力结合因果视觉-语言注意力和双向动作并行解码。

Conclusion: CogVLA通过认知对齐的架构设计，在显著降低计算开销的同时实现了最先进的性能，为高效视觉-语言-动作模型提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models built on pre-trained
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) require extensive post-training, resulting in
high computational overhead that limits scalability and deployment.We propose
CogVLA, a Cognition-Aligned Vision-Language-Action framework that leverages
instruction-driven routing and sparsification to improve both efficiency and
performance. CogVLA draws inspiration from human multimodal coordination and
introduces a 3-stage progressive architecture. 1) Encoder-FiLM based
Aggregation Routing (EFA-Routing) injects instruction information into the
vision encoder to selectively aggregate and compress dual-stream visual tokens,
forming a instruction-aware latent representation. 2) Building upon this
compact visual encoding, LLM-FiLM based Pruning Routing (LFP-Routing)
introduces action intent into the language model by pruning
instruction-irrelevant visually grounded tokens, thereby achieving token-level
sparsity. 3) To ensure that compressed perception inputs can still support
accurate and coherent action generation, we introduce V-L-A Coupled Attention
(CAtten), which combines causal vision-language attention with bidirectional
action parallel decoding. Extensive experiments on the LIBERO benchmark and
real-world robotic tasks demonstrate that CogVLA achieves state-of-the-art
performance with success rates of 97.4% and 70.0%, respectively, while reducing
training costs by 2.5-fold and decreasing inference latency by 2.8-fold
compared to OpenVLA. CogVLA is open-sourced and publicly available at

Motivation: 解决单目轨迹器深度歧义和遮挡问题，以及现有多摄像头方法需要过多设备和复杂优化的限制

Method: 使用已知摄像机姿势和深度信息，将多视图特征融合成统一点云，采用k近邻相关性和转换器网络进行长程3D对应点估计

Result: 在Panoptic Studio和DexYCB实际数据集上达到中位轨迹误差分别为3.1cm和2.0cm，支持1-8个摄像头和24-150帧视频长度

Conclusion: 该方法为多视角3D轨迹研究设定了新标准，提供了实用的实际应用工具，并开源了训练和评估数据集

Abstract: We introduce the first data-driven multi-view 3D point tracker, designed to
track arbitrary points in dynamic scenes using multiple camera views. Unlike
existing monocular trackers, which struggle with depth ambiguities and
occlusion, or prior multi-camera methods that require over 20 cameras and
tedious per-sequence optimization, our feed-forward model directly predicts 3D
correspondences using a practical number of cameras (e.g., four), enabling
robust and accurate online tracking. Given known camera poses and either
sensor-based or estimated multi-view depth, our tracker fuses multi-view
features into a unified point cloud and applies k-nearest-neighbors correlation
alongside a transformer-based update to reliably estimate long-range 3D
correspondences, even under occlusion. We train on 5K synthetic multi-view
Kubric sequences and evaluate on two real-world benchmarks: Panoptic Studio and
DexYCB, achieving median trajectory errors of 3.1 cm and 2.0 cm, respectively.
Our method generalizes well to diverse camera setups of 1-8 views with varying
vantage points and video lengths of 24-150 frames. By releasing our tracker
alongside training and evaluation datasets, we aim to set a new standard for
multi-view 3D tracking research and provide a practical tool for real-world
applications. Project page available at https://ethz-vlg.github.io/mvtracker.

TL;DR: OneReward是一个统一的强化学习框架，使用单一奖励模型提升多任务生成能力，在图像编辑任务中超越了商业和开源竞争对手。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多任务生成方法通常需要针对特定任务进行监督微调(SFT)，这限制了模型的泛化能力和训练效率。不同任务虽然共享相同的条件范式，但在数据分布和评估指标上差异显著。

Method: 使用单一视觉语言模型(VLM)作为生成奖励模型，能够区分给定任务和评估标准下的优劣结果。基于OneReward开发了Seedream 3.0 Fill模型，通过多任务强化学习直接在预训练基础模型上训练，无需任务特定的SFT。

Result: 实验结果表明，统一的编辑模型在多个评估维度上 consistently 超越了Ideogram、Adobe Photoshop和FLUX Fill [Pro]等商业和开源竞争对手。

Conclusion: OneReward框架证明了使用单一奖励模型可以有效提升多任务生成能力，为多任务生成模型提供了一种高效统一的训练方法。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce OneReward, a unified reinforcement learning
framework that enhances the model's generative capabilities across multiple
tasks under different evaluation criteria using only \textit{One Reward} model.
By employing a single vision-language model (VLM) as the generative reward
model, which can distinguish the winner and loser for a given task and a given
evaluation criterion, it can be effectively applied to multi-task generation
models, particularly in contexts with varied data and diverse task objectives.
We utilize OneReward for mask-guided image generation, which can be further
divided into several sub-tasks such as image fill, image extend, object
removal, and text rendering, involving a binary mask as the edit area. Although
these domain-specific tasks share same conditioning paradigm, they differ
significantly in underlying data distributions and evaluation metrics. Existing
methods often rely on task-specific supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which limits
generalization and training efficiency. Building on OneReward, we develop
Seedream 3.0 Fill, a mask-guided generation model trained via multi-task
reinforcement learning directly on a pre-trained base model, eliminating the
need for task-specific SFT. Experimental results demonstrate that our unified
edit model consistently outperforms both commercial and open-source
competitors, such as Ideogram, Adobe Photoshop, and FLUX Fill [Pro], across
multiple evaluation dimensions. Code and model are available at:

try-on in a single pass. Key to our framework is CondNet, a novel conditioning

TL;DR: 本文提出了针对NeurIPS 2024挑战赛的获胜水印移除方案，包含黑盒和白盒两种攻击方法，实现了95.7%的近乎完美水印移除率，同时保持图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数字水印技术在对抗性攻击下的鲁棒性不明确，需要通过挑战赛来测试水印在各种对手知识水平下的抗攻击能力。

Method: 白盒跟踪使用基于VAE的自适应规避攻击，结合测试时优化和CIELAB空间的颜色对比度恢复；黑盒跟踪先基于空间或频域伪影聚类图像，然后应用图像到图像扩散模型，结合受控噪声注入和ChatGPT生成的语义先验。

Result: 实证评估显示该方法成功实现了近乎完美的水印移除（95.7%），对剩余图像质量的影响可忽略不计。

Conclusion: 这些攻击方法有望启发开发更鲁棒的图像水印技术。

Abstract: Content watermarking is an important tool for the authentication and
copyright protection of digital media. However, it is unclear whether existing
watermarks are robust against adversarial attacks. We present the winning
solution to the NeurIPS 2024 Erasing the Invisible challenge, which
stress-tests watermark robustness under varying degrees of adversary knowledge.
The challenge consisted of two tracks: a black-box and beige-box track,
depending on whether the adversary knows which watermarking method was used by
the provider. For the beige-box track, we leverage an adaptive VAE-based
evasion attack, with a test-time optimization and color-contrast restoration in
CIELAB space to preserve the image's quality. For the black-box track, we first
cluster images based on their artifacts in the spatial or frequency-domain.
Then, we apply image-to-image diffusion models with controlled noise injection
and semantic priors from ChatGPT-generated captions to each cluster with
optimized parameter settings. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our method
successfully achieves near-perfect watermark removal (95.7%) with negligible
impact on the residual image's quality. We hope that our attacks inspire the
development of more robust image watermarking methods.

Motivation: 旨在降低人工测试开发成本和不一致性，探索在有限数据条件下通过结构化提示和微调技术提升中等规模语言模型在自动题目生成任务中的表现。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：比较微调的中等模型(Gemma, 2B)与未调优的大模型(GPT-3.5)；评估七种结构化提示策略(零样本、少样本、思维链、基于角色、序列化等组合)。使用自动化指标和专家五维度评分，并利用GPT-4.1模拟大规模人类评分。

Result: 结构化提示策略(特别是思维链与序列化设计组合)显著提升Gemma输出质量。Gemma比GPT-3.5的零样本响应产生更多结构对齐和教学适宜的题目，提示设计对中等规模模型性能起关键作用。

Conclusion: 结构化提示和高效微调可在有限数据条件下增强中等规模模型的自动生成能力，结合自动化指标、专家判断和大模型模拟的方法为K-12语言评估项目开发提供了实用且可扩展的工作流程。

Abstract: This study explores automatic generation (AIG) using language models to
create multiple choice questions (MCQs) for morphological assessment, aiming to
reduce the cost and inconsistency of manual test development. The study used a
two-fold approach. First, we compared a fine-tuned medium model (Gemma, 2B)
with a larger untuned one (GPT-3.5, 175B). Second, we evaluated seven
structured prompting strategies, including zero-shot, few-shot,
chain-of-thought, role-based, sequential, and combinations. Generated items
were assessed using automated metrics and expert scoring across five
dimensions. We also used GPT-4.1, trained on expert-rated samples, to simulate
human scoring at scale. Results show that structured prompting, especially
strategies combining chain-of-thought and sequential design, significantly
improved Gemma's outputs. Gemma generally produced more construct-aligned and
instructionally appropriate items than GPT-3.5's zero-shot responses, with
prompt design playing a key role in mid-size model performance. This study
demonstrates that structured prompting and efficient fine-tuning can enhance
midsized models for AIG under limited data conditions. We highlight the value
of combining automated metrics, expert judgment, and large-model simulation to
ensure alignment with assessment goals. The proposed workflow offers a
practical and scalable way to develop and validate language assessment items
for K-12.

Abstract: The growing complexity of cyber-physical systems, particularly in automotive
applications, has increased the demand for efficient modeling and cross-domain
co-simulation techniques. While SystemC Transaction-Level Modeling (TLM)
enables effective hardware/software co-design, its limited interoperability
with models from other engineering domains poses integration challenges. This
paper presents a fully open-source methodology for integrating SystemC TLM

By encapsulating SystemC TLM components as FMI 3.0 Co Simulation Functional
Mock-up Units (FMUs), the proposed approach facilitates seamless, standardized
integration across heterogeneous simulation environments. We introduce a
lightweight open-source toolchain, address key technical challenges such as
time synchronization and data exchange, and demonstrate the feasibility and
effectiveness of the integration through representative case studies.

Motivation: 紧凑语言模型（如0.5B参数）由于推理能力差，在强化学习中面临稀疏奖励和不稳定训练的困难，需要一种方法来使这些模型在计算资源受限的环境中实现代理RAG行为。

Method: Distillation-Guided Policy Optimization (DGPO)，包括从教师演示进行冷启动初始化，以及在策略优化过程中提供持续的教师指导。

Result: DGPO使紧凑模型能够实现复杂的代理搜索行为，在某些情况下甚至超越了更大的教师模型，并通过ARC指标验证了其在推理、搜索协调和响应合成方面的能力。

Conclusion: DGPO使得在计算资源受限的环境中实现代理RAG成为可能，为小型语言模型的代理行为训练提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning has emerged as a post-training approach to elicit
agentic RAG behaviors such as search and planning from language models.
However, compact language models (e.g., 0.5B parameters) struggle due to poor
reasoning ability, resulting in sparse rewards and unstable training. To
overcome these difficulties, we propose Distillation-Guided Policy Optimization
(DGPO), which addresses the challenges through cold-start initialization from
teacher demonstrations and continuous teacher guidance during policy
optimization. To systematically evaluate our approach, we introduce Agentic RAG

*Haibo Jin,Ruoxi Chen,Peiyan Zhang,Andy Zhou,Yang Zhang,Haohan Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GUARD是一种将政府AI伦理指南转化为可操作测试问题的方法，通过自动生成违反指南的问题来评估LLM合规性，并引入越狱诊断来识别潜在安全漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在各领域的广泛应用，其生成有害内容的风险引发社会关注。政府发布的伦理指南多为高层级要求，缺乏转化为具体测试问题的方法，需要开发可操作的合规性测试框架。

Method: GUARD方法：1）基于政府指南自动生成违反指南的测试问题；2）对不直接违反指南的响应，引入GUARD-JD越狱诊断，创建场景诱导不道德响应；3）生成合规性报告，详细说明遵守程度和违规情况。

Result: 在7个LLM（Vicuna-13B、LongChat-7B、Llama2-7B、Llama-3-8B、GPT-3.5、GPT-4、GPT-4o、Claude-3.7）上实证验证有效性，测试了三个政府指南的合规性并进行了越狱诊断。GUARD-JD还可迁移到视觉语言模型。

Conclusion: GUARD提供了一种系统化的方法来将高层级伦理指南转化为可操作的测试框架，能够有效评估LLM的合规性并识别安全机制绕过漏洞，有助于促进可靠的LLM应用开发。

Abstract: As Large Language Models become increasingly integral to various domains,
their potential to generate harmful responses has prompted significant societal
and regulatory concerns. In response, governments have issued ethics guidelines
to promote the development of trustworthy AI. However, these guidelines are
typically high-level demands for developers and testers, leaving a gap in
translating them into actionable testing questions to verify LLM compliance.
  To address this challenge, we introduce GUARD (\textbf{G}uideline
\textbf{U}pholding Test through \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{R}ole-play and
Jailbreak \textbf{D}iagnostics), a testing method designed to operationalize
guidelines into specific guideline-violating questions that assess LLM
adherence. To implement this, GUARD uses automated generation of
guideline-violating questions based on government-issued guidelines, thereby
testing whether responses comply with these guidelines. When responses directly
violate guidelines, GUARD reports inconsistencies. Furthermore, for responses
that do not directly violate guidelines, GUARD integrates the concept of
``jailbreaks'' to diagnostics, named GUARD-JD, which creates scenarios that
provoke unethical or guideline-violating responses, effectively identifying
potential scenarios that could bypass built-in safety mechanisms. Our method
finally culminates in a compliance report, delineating the extent of adherence
and highlighting any violations.
  We have empirically validated the effectiveness of GUARD on seven LLMs,
including Vicuna-13B, LongChat-7B, Llama2-7B, Llama-3-8B, GPT-3.5, GPT-4,
GPT-4o, and Claude-3.7, by testing compliance under three government-issued
guidelines and conducting jailbreak diagnostics. Additionally, GUARD-JD can
transfer jailbreak diagnostics to vision-language models, demonstrating its
usage in promoting reliable LLM-based applications.

*Zhirui Chen,Wei Shen,Jiashui Huang,Ling Shao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: JERR是一个基于图推理的框架，通过摘要提取、图构建和关系推理三个组件，提升大语言模型的长文本理解能力，解决内存限制和幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在处理长上下文时面临内存限制、复杂任务处理困难、缺乏透明度和容易产生幻觉等问题，需要新的解决方案来提升长文本理解能力。

Method: JERR框架包含三个关键组件：1）策略性文本分块进行摘要提取；2）构建有向无环图（DAG）解决冗余问题；3）集成蒙特卡洛树搜索（MCTS）辅助复杂推理路径导航。

Result: 实验结果显示JERR在ROUGE和F1指标上 consistently优于所有基线模型，在LLM-Rater评估中获得最高分数。

Conclusion: JERR框架为大语言模型处理扩展上下文和复杂推理任务提供了新颖解决方案，显著提升了可靠性和透明度。

Abstract: Despite significant progress, large language models (LLMs) still struggle
with long contexts due to memory limitations and their inability to tackle
complex and long-context tasks. Additionally, LLMs often suffer from a lack of
transparency and are prone to producing hallucinations. To address these
challenges, we propose \textbf{JERR}, a novel framework designed to enhance
long-context comprehension via graph-based reasoning in LLMs. JERR integrates
three key components: synopsis extraction, graph construction, and relational
reasoning. First, synopsis is extracted by chunking text strategically,
allowing the model to summarize and understand information more efficiently.
Second, we build a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to resolve redundancy, ensuring
logical consistency and clarity. Finally, we incorporate Monte Carlo Tree
Search (MCTS) to help the model navigate complex reasoning paths, ensuring more
accurate and interpretable outputs. This framework provides a novel solution
that enables LLMs to handle extended contexts and complex reasoning tasks with
improved reliability and transparency. Experimental results show that JERR
consistently outperforms all baselines on the ROUGE and F1 metrics, achieving
the highest scores on the LLM-Rater evaluation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种使用NP难图论问题作为合成训练资源来提升大语言模型长链式思维推理能力的新方法，通过两阶段调优训练框架实现了在多个领域的强大法则化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统Long CoT训练依赖人工精检数据集的成本高、可扩展性差的问题，寻找一种可扩展的合成训练资源来提升LLM的长链式思维推理能力。

Method: 使用NP难图论问题作为合成训练资源，构建两阶段训练框架：1）基于拒绝采样NPH图实例的Long CoT有监督精细调整；2）使用细粒度奖励设计的强化学习来揑销推理效率。

Result: 标志模型Graph-R1-7B在数学、编码、STEM和逻辑领域都显示出强大的法则化能力，在NPH图论问题上的准确性和推理效率都超过了QwQ-32B模型。

Conclusion: NP难图论问题是一种高效且可扩展的资源，能够提升LLM的长链式思维推理能力，为LLM调优训练开启了新方向。

Abstract: Reasoning Large Language Models (RLLMs) have recently achieved remarkable
progress on complex reasoning tasks, largely enabled by their long
chain-of-thought (Long CoT) capabilities. However, developing these Long CoT
behaviors relies heavily on post-training with high-quality datasets, which are
typically costly and human-curated (e.g., mathematics and code), leaving
scalable alternatives unexplored. In this work, we introduce NP-hard (NPH)
graph problems as a novel synthetic training corpus, as they inherently require
deep reasoning, extensive exploration, and reflective strategies, which are
core characteristics of Long CoT reasoning. Building on this insight, we
develop a two-stage post-training framework: (i) Long CoT Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT) on rejection-sampled NPH graph instances, which substantially
enhances reasoning depth, and (ii) Reinforcement Learning (RL) with a
fine-grained reward design, which sharpens reasoning efficiency. Our flagship
model, Graph-R1-7B, demonstrates strong generalization across mathematics,
coding, STEM, and logic, and surpasses QwQ-32B on NPH graph problems in both
accuracy and reasoning efficiency. These results position NPH graph problems as
an effective and scalable resource for advancing Long CoT reasoning in LLMs,
opening a new frontier for LLM post-training. Our implementation is available
at https://github.com/Graph-Reasoner/Graph-R1, with models and datasets hosted
in our Hugging Face collection HKUST-DSAIL/Graph-R1.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了首个上下文感知人格评估框架CAPE，通过引入对话历史来评估大语言模型的人格特质，发现上下文能增强响应一致性但也会导致人格偏移，不同模型对上下文依赖程度不同


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有心理测量测试采用无上下文方法评估LLMs，忽略了真实对话中历史对话对响应的影响，需要开发上下文感知的评估框架

Method: 提出CAPE框架，引入对话历史上下文，设计新指标量化LLM响应一致性，在7个LLM上进行实验分析

Result: 对话历史通过上下文学习增强响应一致性但导致人格偏移；GPT模型对问题顺序鲁棒，Gemini和Llama敏感；GPT响应来自内在人格和先前交互，其他模型更依赖先前交互；角色扮演代理中上下文依赖的人格偏移改善一致性并更符合人类判断

Conclusion: 上下文在LLM人格评估中至关重要，CAPE框架能更真实地评估模型行为特质，为理解LLM在对话中的人格动态变化提供了新视角

Abstract: Psychometric tests, traditionally used to assess humans, are now being
applied to Large Language Models (LLMs) to evaluate their behavioral traits.
However, existing studies follow a context-free approach, answering each
question in isolation to avoid contextual influence. We term this the Disney
World test, an artificial setting that ignores real-world applications, where
conversational history shapes responses. To bridge this gap, we propose the
first Context-Aware Personality Evaluation (CAPE) framework for LLMs,
incorporating prior conversational interactions. To thoroughly analyze the
influence of context, we introduce novel metrics to quantify the consistency of
LLM responses, a fundamental trait in human behavior.
  Our exhaustive experiments on 7 LLMs reveal that conversational history
enhances response consistency via in-context learning but also induces
personality shifts, with GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4-Turbo exhibiting extreme
deviations. While GPT models are robust to question ordering, Gemini-1.5-Flash
and Llama-8B display significant sensitivity. Moreover, GPT models response
stem from their intrinsic personality traits as well as prior interactions,
whereas Gemini-1.5-Flash and Llama--8B heavily depend on prior interactions.
Finally, applying our framework to Role Playing Agents (RPAs) shows
context-dependent personality shifts improve response consistency and better
align with human judgments. Our code and datasets are publicly available at:

### [107] [Measuring Reasoning Utility in LLMs via Conditional Entropy Reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20395)
*Xu Guo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现推理步骤中的条件熵变化模式与答案正确性相关：熵递减通常对应正确答案，熵平坦或递增则常导致错误答案。错误推理路径往往更长，说明更长推理不一定更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM依赖中间推理步骤提高准确性，但缺乏对推理步骤效用如何影响最终答案正确性的研究。由于自回归生成的随机性，生成更多上下文不能保证答案置信度提升。

Method: 在MATH数据集上进行oracle研究，使用Qwen2.5-32B和GPT-4o生成推理链，然后用Qwen3-8B量化这些推理链对最终准确性的效用。通过条件熵（词汇表上的期望负对数似然）测量模型在每个推理步骤中对答案跨度Y的不确定性。

Result: 发现明显模式：随着步骤进行而递减的条件熵与正确答案强相关，而平坦或递增的熵通常导致错误答案。错误推理路径往往比正确路径更长。

Conclusion: 这些发现为设计高效推理管道奠定了基础，可以早期检测和避免无效推理，从而优化LLM的推理过程。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) often rely on generating
intermediate reasoning steps to enhance accuracy. However, little work has
examined how reasoning utility contributes to the final answer's correctness.
Due to the stochastic nature of autoregressive generation, generating more
context does not guarantee increased confidence in the answer. If we could
predict, during generation, whether a reasoning step will be useful, we could
stop early or prune ineffective steps, avoiding distractions in the final
decision.
  We present an oracle study on MATH dataset, using Qwen2.5-32B and GPT-4o to
generate reasoning chains, and then employing a separate model (Qwen3-8B) to
quantify the utility of these chains for final accuracy. Specifically, we
measure the model's uncertainty on the answer span Y at each reasoning step
using conditional entropy (expected negative log-likelihood over the
vocabulary) with context expanding step by step. Our results show a clear
pattern: conditional entropy that decreases over steps is strongly associated
with correct answers, whereas flat or increasing entropy often results in wrong
answers. We also corroborate that incorrect reasoning paths tend to be longer
than correct ones, suggesting that longer reasoning does not necessarily yield
better outcomes. These findings serve as a foundation to inspire future work on
designing efficient reasoning pipelines that detect and avoid unproductive
reasoning early.

Motivation: 现有大型语言模型在通用医学基准上表现良好，但在需要深度专业知识的牙科等专业医学领域能力尚未充分探索，缺乏针对性的评估资源。

Method: 构建DentalBench基准，包含DentalQA（36,597个中英文问答问题，涵盖4个任务和16个牙科子领域）和DentalCorpus（3.37亿token的大规模高质量语料库），支持监督微调和检索增强生成。评估了14个LLM模型。

Result: 评估显示不同模型在任务类型和语言上存在显著性能差距。Qwen-2.5-3B的实验表明领域适应能显著提升模型性能，特别是在知识密集和术语集中的任务上。

Conclusion: 领域特定基准对于开发可信赖且有效的医疗应用LLM至关重要，牙科领域的专业化评估和适应能显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and medical LLMs (Med-LLMs)
have demonstrated strong performance on general medical benchmarks. However,
their capabilities in specialized medical fields, such as dentistry which
require deeper domain-specific knowledge, remain underexplored due to the lack
of targeted evaluation resources. In this paper, we introduce DentalBench, the
first comprehensive bilingual benchmark designed to evaluate and advance LLMs
in the dental domain. DentalBench consists of two main components: DentalQA, an
English-Chinese question-answering (QA) benchmark with 36,597 questions
spanning 4 tasks and 16 dental subfields; and DentalCorpus, a large-scale,
high-quality corpus with 337.35 million tokens curated for dental domain
adaptation, supporting both supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). We evaluate 14 LLMs, covering
proprietary, open-source, and medical-specific models, and reveal significant
performance gaps across task types and languages. Further experiments with
Qwen-2.5-3B demonstrate that domain adaptation substantially improves model
performance, particularly on knowledge-intensive and terminology-focused tasks,
and highlight the importance of domain-specific benchmarks for developing
trustworthy and effective LLMs tailored to healthcare applications.

Motivation: 现有方法主要解决语料库级别的上下文丢失问题，但缺乏对复杂查询的语义丰富表示。知识图谱与LLM结合有望通过结构化关系表示来增强查询上下文，从而改进RAG系统的检索阶段。

Method: 提出KG-CQR框架，包含子图提取、补全和上下文生成三个模块。通过语料中心知识图谱提取相关子图并补全，生成语义丰富的查询上下文，作为模型无关的管道工作。

Result: 在RAGBench和MultiHop-RAG数据集上实验显示，mAP提升4-6%，Recall@25提升2-3%。在多跳问答等挑战性RAG任务中，检索效果持续优于现有基线。

Conclusion: KG-CQR通过知识图谱增强查询上下文表示，有效提升了RAG系统的检索性能，具有模型无关性和可扩展性，为复杂查询处理提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: The integration of knowledge graphs (KGs) with large language models (LLMs)
offers significant potential to improve the retrieval phase of
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. In this study, we propose KG-CQR,
a novel framework for Contextual Query Retrieval (CQR) that enhances the
retrieval phase by enriching the contextual representation of complex input
queries using a corpus-centric KG. Unlike existing methods that primarily
address corpus-level context loss, KG-CQR focuses on query enrichment through
structured relation representations, extracting and completing relevant KG
subgraphs to generate semantically rich query contexts. Comprising subgraph
extraction, completion, and contextual generation modules, KG-CQR operates as a
model-agnostic pipeline, ensuring scalability across LLMs of varying sizes
without additional training. Experimental results on RAGBench and MultiHop-RAG
datasets demonstrate KG-CQR's superior performance, achieving a 4-6%
improvement in mAP and a 2-3% improvement in Recall@25 over strong baseline
models. Furthermore, evaluations on challenging RAG tasks such as multi-hop
question answering show that, by incorporating KG-CQR, the performance
consistently outperforms the existing baseline in terms of retrieval
effectiveness

Abstract: Civil aviation maintenance is a domain characterized by stringent industry
standards. Within this field, maintenance procedures and troubleshooting
represent critical, knowledge-intensive tasks that require sophisticated
reasoning. To address the lack of specialized evaluation tools for large
language models (LLMs) in this vertical, we propose and develop an
industrial-grade benchmark specifically designed for civil aviation
maintenance. This benchmark serves a dual purpose: It provides a standardized
tool to measure LLM capabilities within civil aviation maintenance, identifying
specific gaps in domain knowledge and complex reasoning. By pinpointing these
deficiencies, the benchmark establishes a foundation for targeted improvement
efforts (e.g., domain-specific fine-tuning, RAG optimization, or specialized
prompt engineering), ultimately facilitating progress toward more intelligent
solutions within civil aviation maintenance. Our work addresses a significant
gap in the current LLM evaluation, which primarily focuses on mathematical and
coding reasoning tasks. In addition, given that Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) systems are currently the dominant solutions in practical applications ,
we leverage this benchmark to evaluate existing well-known vector embedding
models and LLMs for civil aviation maintenance scenarios. Through experimental
exploration and analysis, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our benchmark in
assessing model performance within this domain, and we open-source this
evaluation benchmark and code to foster further research and

vectorization of each practical work title word and Cosine Similarity for the
calculation of similarity values. This system can search either in the form of
titles or keywords. The output of the system is the title of practical work and
the match value of each title. Based on the test results using 705 practical
work titles, testing was carried out with five titles and carried out in two
stages. The first stage searches with existing titles and the second stage
randomizes the title from the first stage. And the results obtained in the
second stage are the same number of titles found and the highest average match
score.

finance, traveling, scientific computing, and academic search. Unlike prior
API-based benchmarks, each MCP server provides a set of complementary tools
designed to work together, enabling the construction of authentic, multi-step
tasks with rich input-output coupling. Tasks in MCP-Bench test agents' ability
to retrieve relevant tools from fuzzy instructions without explicit tool names,
plan multi-hop execution trajectories for complex objectives, ground responses
in intermediate tool outputs, and orchestrate cross-domain workflows -
capabilities not adequately evaluated by existing benchmarks that rely on
explicit tool specifications, shallow few-step workflows, and isolated domain

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于深度学习和自然语言处理的多模态电子健康记录分析框架，用于预测ICU患者的死亡率和资源利用情况，在三个临床任务上均优于现有方法，并展现出对结构化数据损坏的强鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的ICU预测方法主要关注结构化电子健康记录，忽略了自由文本临床笔记中的宝贵信息，且未充分利用结构化数据中的文本信息潜力。需要开发能够整合多模态EHR数据的深度学习框架来提高预测准确性。

Method: 使用两个真实世界EHR数据集，开发了基于自然语言处理技术的深度学习框架，包含医疗提示、自由文本和预训练句子编码器三个关键组件，并在三个临床任务上与现有领先方法进行比较评估。

Result: 在三个临床任务上均取得显著改进：死亡率预测BACC/AUROC提升1.6%/0.8%，住院时长预测RMSE/MAE提升0.5%/2.2%，手术时长估计RMSE/MAE提升10.9%/11.0%。在不同损坏率下均表现优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 该框架是预测重症监护死亡率和资源利用的有效准确方法，展示了使用提示学习和Transformer编码器分析多模态EHR的成功，特别是在高损坏水平下对结构化数据损坏具有强韧性。

Abstract: Background Predicting mortality and resource utilization from electronic
health records (EHRs) is challenging yet crucial for optimizing patient
outcomes and managing costs in intensive care unit (ICU). Existing approaches
predominantly focus on structured EHRs, often ignoring the valuable clinical
insights in free-text notes. Additionally, the potential of textual information
within structured data is not fully leveraged. This study aimed to introduce
and assess a deep learning framework using natural language processing
techniques that integrates multimodal EHRs to predict mortality and resource
utilization in critical care settings. Methods Utilizing two real-world EHR
datasets, we developed and evaluated our model on three clinical tasks with
leading existing methods. We also performed an ablation study on three key
components in our framework: medical prompts, free-texts, and pre-trained
sentence encoder. Furthermore, we assessed the model's robustness against the
corruption in structured EHRs. Results Our experiments on two real-world
datasets across three clinical tasks showed that our proposed model improved
performance metrics by 1.6\%/0.8\% on BACC/AUROC for mortality prediction,
0.5%/2.2% on RMSE/MAE for LOS prediction, 10.9%/11.0% on RMSE/MAE for surgical
duration estimation compared to the best existing methods. It consistently
demonstrated superior performance compared to other baselines across three
tasks at different corruption rates. Conclusions The proposed framework is an
effective and accurate deep learning approach for predicting mortality and
resource utilization in critical care. The study also highlights the success of
using prompt learning with a transformer encoder in analyzing multimodal EHRs.
Importantly, the model showed strong resilience to data corruption within
structured data, especially at high corruption levels.

Abstract: Conspiracy theories erode public trust in science and institutions while
resisting debunking by evolving and absorbing counter-evidence. As AI-generated
misinformation becomes increasingly sophisticated, understanding rhetorical
patterns in conspiratorial content is important for developing interventions
such as targeted prebunking and assessing AI vulnerabilities. We introduce
ConspirED (CONSPIR Evaluation Dataset), which captures the cognitive traits of
conspiratorial ideation in multi-sentence excerpts (80--120 words) from online
conspiracy articles, annotated using the CONSPIR cognitive framework
(Lewandowsky and Cook, 2020). ConspirED is the first dataset of conspiratorial
content annotated for general cognitive traits. Using ConspirED, we (i) develop
computational models that identify conspiratorial traits and determine dominant
traits in text excerpts, and (ii) evaluate large language/reasoning model
(LLM/LRM) robustness to conspiratorial inputs. We find that both are misaligned
by conspiratorial content, producing output that mirrors input reasoning
patterns, even when successfully deflecting comparable fact-checked
misinformation.

TL;DR: FLORES+多语言机器翻译基准在四个语言中存在质量问题，翻译质量低于声称的90%标准，存在文化偏见和领域特异性问题，需要更通用的基准来反映真实翻译挑战


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究FLORES+多语言机器翻译基准的适用性，发现其在真正多语言评估方面存在严重缺陷

Method: 通过人工评估四个语言（Asante Twi、日语、Jinghpaw和南阿塞拜疆语）的翻译质量，分析领域特异性和文化偏见，并使用简单启发式方法测试评估协议的漏洞

Result: 发现许多翻译质量低于90%标准，源句子过于领域特定且偏向英语世界文化，简单复制命名实体就能获得不错的BLEU分数，高质量模型在FLORES+上表现差但在领域相关评估集上表现好

Conclusion: 需要建立使用领域通用和文化中立源文本、减少依赖命名实体的多语言MT基准，以更好地反映真实世界的翻译挑战

Abstract: Multilingual machine translation (MT) benchmarks play a central role in
evaluating the capabilities of modern MT systems. Among them, the FLORES+
benchmark is widely used, offering English-to-many translation data for over
200 languages, curated with strict quality control protocols. However, we study
data in four languages (Asante Twi, Japanese, Jinghpaw, and South Azerbaijani)
and uncover critical shortcomings in the benchmark's suitability for truly
multilingual evaluation. Human assessments reveal that many translations fall
below the claimed 90% quality standard, and the annotators report that source
sentences are often too domain-specific and culturally biased toward the
English-speaking world. We further demonstrate that simple heuristics, such as
copying named entities, can yield non-trivial BLEU scores, suggesting
vulnerabilities in the evaluation protocol. Notably, we show that MT models
trained on high-quality, naturalistic data perform poorly on FLORES+ while
achieving significant gains on our domain-relevant evaluation set. Based on
these findings, we advocate for multilingual MT benchmarks that use
domain-general and culturally neutral source texts rely less on named entities,
in order to better reflect real-world translation challenges.

TL;DR: SciTopic是一种基于大语言模型增强的科学文献主题发现方法，通过构建文本编码器、空间优化模块和LLM指导的对比学习，显著提升了科学主题识别的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有主题发现方法主要依赖词嵌入技术，缺乏对科学文献的全面理解，难以处理复杂的高维文本关系。大语言模型在文本理解方面的卓越能力为解决这一问题提供了新的思路。

Method: 1) 构建文本编码器捕获科学文献内容；2) 集成基于熵的采样和LLM指导的三元组任务的空间优化模块；3) 基于LLM指导通过优化三元组对比损失微调文本编码器；4) 在三个真实数据集上进行实验验证。

Conclusion: SciTopic通过利用大语言模型的强大文本理解能力，有效解决了传统主题发现方法的局限性，为科学文献主题分析提供了更准确和高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Topic discovery in scientific literature provides valuable insights for
researchers to identify emerging trends and explore new avenues for
investigation, facilitating easier scientific information retrieval. Many
machine learning methods, particularly deep embedding techniques, have been
applied to discover research topics. However, most existing topic discovery
methods rely on word embedding to capture the semantics and lack a
comprehensive understanding of scientific publications, struggling with
complex, high-dimensional text relationships. Inspired by the exceptional
comprehension of textual information by large language models (LLMs), we
propose an advanced topic discovery method enhanced by LLMs to improve
scientific topic identification, namely SciTopic. Specifically, we first build
a textual encoder to capture the content from scientific publications,
including metadata, title, and abstract. Next, we construct a space
optimization module that integrates entropy-based sampling and triplet tasks
guided by LLMs, enhancing the focus on thematic relevance and contextual
intricacies between ambiguous instances. Then, we propose to fine-tune the
textual encoder based on the guidance from the LLMs by optimizing the
contrastive loss of the triplets, forcing the text encoder to better
discriminate instances of different topics. Finally, extensive experiments
conducted on three real-world datasets of scientific publications demonstrate
that SciTopic outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) scientific topic
discovery methods, enabling researchers to gain deeper and faster insights.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的联邦蒸馏方法主要关注标签(output)多样性，忽略了自然语言处理中至关重要的语言领域(input)多样性，无法真实反映现实环境中的非IID数据挑战。

Method: 提出了自适应联邦蒸馏(AdaFD)框架，包含多领域非IID场景的统一基准测试框架，能够处理同构和异构设置下的多领域非IID挑战。

Result: 实验结果表明，该模型能够有效捕捉本地客户端的多样性，相比现有工作取得了更好的性能表现。

Conclusion: AdaFD框架为解决现实环境中多领域非IID数据问题提供了有效的解决方案，代码已开源供研究使用。

Abstract: The widespread success of pre-trained language models has established a new
training paradigm, where a global PLM is fine-tuned using task-specific data
from local clients. The local data are highly different from each other and can
not capture the global distribution of the whole data in real world. To address
the challenges of non-IID data in real environments, privacy-preserving
federated distillation has been proposed and highly investigated. However,
previous experimental non-IID scenarios are primarily identified with the label
(output) diversity, without considering the diversity of language domains
(input) that is crucial in natural language processing. In this paper, we
introduce a comprehensive set of multi-domain non-IID scenarios and propose a
unified benchmarking framework that includes diverse data. The benchmark can be
used to evaluate the federated learning framework in a real environment. To
this end, we propose an Adaptive Federated Distillation (AdaFD) framework
designed to address multi-domain non-IID challenges in both homogeneous and
heterogeneous settings. Experimental results demonstrate that our models
capture the diversity of local clients and achieve better performance compared
to the existing works. The code for this paper is available at:

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种新颖的生成式框架，通过大模型蒸馏、监督微调、直接偏好优化和前瞻解码技术，将仅有0.1B参数的轻量级模型转化为领域专业化的查询驱动文本摘要专家，在工业网络搜索中实现了实时查询驱动文本摘要的新突破。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于排序候选摘要片段的抽取式摘要模型在工业应用中存在两个关键局限：1）多阶段流水线导致累积信息损失和架构瓶颈；2）缺乏对用户查询和文档的充分语义理解，特别是在处理复杂搜索意图时表现不佳。

Method: 整合大模型蒸馏、监督微调、直接偏好优化和前瞻解码技术，将轻量级模型（仅0.1B参数）转化为领域专业化的QDTS专家。

Result: 在多个行业相关指标上超越了生产基线，达到了新的最先进水平，部署效率优异，仅需334个NVIDIA L20 GPU即可在55ms平均延迟下处理约50,000次查询/秒。

Conclusion: 该研究成功将生成式模型应用于工业网络搜索中的实时查询驱动文本摘要，解决了传统方法的局限性，在性能和部署效率方面都取得了显著提升。

Abstract: In the dynamic landscape of large-scale web search, Query-Driven Text
Summarization (QDTS) aims to generate concise and informative summaries from
textual documents based on a given query, which is essential for improving user
engagement and facilitating rapid decision-making. Traditional extractive
summarization models, based primarily on ranking candidate summary segments,
have been the dominant approach in industrial applications. However, these
approaches suffer from two key limitations: 1) The multi-stage pipeline often
introduces cumulative information loss and architectural bottlenecks due to its
weakest component; 2) Traditional models lack sufficient semantic understanding
of both user queries and documents, particularly when dealing with complex
search intents. In this study, we propose a novel framework to pioneer the
application of generative models to address real-time QDTS in industrial web
search. Our approach integrates large model distillation, supervised
fine-tuning, direct preference optimization, and lookahead decoding to
transform a lightweight model with only 0.1B parameters into a
domain-specialized QDTS expert. Evaluated on multiple industry-relevant
metrics, our model outperforms the production baseline and achieves a new state
of the art. Furthermore, it demonstrates excellent deployment efficiency,
requiring only 334 NVIDIA L20 GPUs to handle \textasciitilde50,000 queries per
second under 55~ms average latency per query.

Motivation: 多跳问答面临数据稀疏问题，现有方法忽视知识整合，导致模型学习到虚假模式

Method: 将知识组合选择建模为句子级条件预测任务，使用概率对比损失预测相关知识，采用随机解码策略平衡准确性和多样性

Result: 知识组合选择准确率提升3.9%，在HotpotQA和2WikiMultihopQA数据集上取得改进

Conclusion: KCS框架有效提升了多跳问题的生成质量和问答性能，为数据增强提供了新思路

Abstract: Multi-hop question answering faces substantial challenges due to data
sparsity, which increases the likelihood of language models learning spurious
patterns. To address this issue, prior research has focused on diversifying
question generation through content planning and varied expression. However,
these approaches often emphasize generating simple questions and neglect the
integration of essential knowledge, such as relevant sentences within
documents. This paper introduces the Knowledge Composition Sampling (KCS), an
innovative framework designed to expand the diversity of generated multi-hop
questions by sampling varied knowledge compositions within a given context. KCS
models the knowledge composition selection as a sentence-level conditional
prediction task and utilizes a probabilistic contrastive loss to predict the
next most relevant piece of knowledge. During inference, we employ a stochastic
decoding strategy to effectively balance accuracy and diversity. Compared to
competitive baselines, our KCS improves the overall accuracy of knowledge
composition selection by 3.9%, and its application for data augmentation yields
improvements on HotpotQA and 2WikiMultihopQA datasets. Our code is available

Method: 提出CLEGR评测基准，通过合成图生成流程产生需要结构和语义联合推理的问题，对代表性GLM架构进行详细评测

Result: 软提示LLM基线与包含完整GNN核心的GLM表现相似，GLM在需要结构推理的任务中性能显著下降

Conclusion: 现有GLM在图结构推理能力存在明显局限性，CLEGR基准为推进多模态推理研究提供了基础

Abstract: Developments in Graph-Language Models (GLMs) aim to integrate the structural
reasoning capabilities of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with the semantic
understanding of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, we demonstrate that
current evaluation benchmarks for GLMs, which are primarily repurposed
node-level classification datasets, are insufficient to assess multimodal
reasoning. Our analysis reveals that strong performance on these benchmarks is
achievable using unimodal information alone, suggesting that they do not
necessitate graph-language integration. To address this evaluation gap, we
introduce the CLEGR(Compositional Language-Graph Reasoning) benchmark, designed
to evaluate multimodal reasoning at various complexity levels. Our benchmark
employs a synthetic graph generation pipeline paired with questions that
require joint reasoning over structure and textual semantics. We perform a
thorough evaluation of representative GLM architectures and find that
soft-prompted LLM baselines perform on par with GLMs that incorporate a full
GNN backbone. This result calls into question the architectural necessity of
incorporating graph structure into LLMs. We further show that GLMs exhibit
significant performance degradation in tasks that require structural reasoning.
These findings highlight limitations in the graph reasoning capabilities of
current GLMs and provide a foundation for advancing the community toward
explicit multimodal reasoning involving graph structure and language.

Motivation: 结构化ASR系统经常无法正确转写领域特定命名实体，而现有的基于语音编距离的NEC方法在字形差异较大时效果局限。

Method: 利用语音声音特征检索候选实体，设计生成式方法来注释ASR转写文本中的实体错误并替换为正确实体。

Result: 在开源和自建测试集上验证，该NEC方法能够显著提高实体准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了字形差异较大情况下的命名实体纠正问题，并将开源相关数据集。

Abstract: End-to-end automatic speech recognition systems often fail to transcribe
domain-specific named entities, causing catastrophic failures in downstream
tasks. Numerous fast and lightweight named entity correction (NEC) models have
been proposed in recent years. These models, mainly leveraging phonetic-level
edit distance algorithms, have shown impressive performances. However, when the
forms of the wrongly-transcribed words(s) and the ground-truth entity are
significantly different, these methods often fail to locate the wrongly
transcribed words in hypothesis, thus limiting their usage. We propose a novel
NEC method that utilizes speech sound features to retrieve candidate entities.
With speech sound features and candidate entities, we inovatively design a
generative method to annotate entity errors in ASR transcripts and replace the
text with correct entities. This method is effective in scenarios of word form
difference. We test our method using open-source and self-constructed test
sets. The results demonstrate that our NEC method can bring significant
improvement to entity accuracy. We will open source our self-constructed test
set and training data.

Abstract: This paper introduces the first multi-lingual and multi-label classification
model for implicit discourse relation recognition (IDRR). Our model, HArch, is
evaluated on the recently released DiscoGeM 2.0 corpus and leverages
hierarchical dependencies between discourse senses to predict probability
distributions across all three sense levels in the PDTB 3.0 framework. We
compare several pre-trained encoder backbones and find that RoBERTa-HArch
achieves the best performance in English, while XLM-RoBERTa-HArch performs best
in the multi-lingual setting. In addition, we compare our fine-tuned models
against GPT-4o and Llama-4-Maverick using few-shot prompting across all

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型提升了文本生成能力，但也带来了隐写和水印中的分词不一致性问题，这会破坏鲁棒性。研究发现问题token具有低频性和临时性特征，需要针对性解决方案。

Method: 提出了两种定制化解决方案：1) 针对隐写的逐步验证方法；2) 针对水印的后验回滚方法。这些方法基于问题token的两个关键特征（低频性和临时性）进行设计。

Result: 实验表明：1) 与传统消歧方法相比，直接解决分词不一致性可提升隐写的流畅性、不可感知性和抗隐写分析能力；2) 对于水印，解决该问题可增强可检测性和抗攻击鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 通过针对性解决分词不一致性问题，显著提升了文本隐写和水印技术的性能表现，为防范恶意滥用提供了更有效的安全保障措施。

Abstract: Large language models have significantly enhanced the capacities and
efficiency of text generation. On the one hand, they have improved the quality
of text-based steganography. On the other hand, they have also underscored the
importance of watermarking as a safeguard against malicious misuse. In this
study, we focus on tokenization inconsistency (TI) between Alice and Bob in
steganography and watermarking, where TI can undermine robustness. Our
investigation reveals that the problematic tokens responsible for TI exhibit
two key characteristics: infrequency and temporariness. Based on these
findings, we propose two tailored solutions for TI elimination: a stepwise
verification method for steganography and a post-hoc rollback method for
watermarking. Experiments show that (1) compared to traditional disambiguation
methods in steganography, directly addressing TI leads to improvements in
fluency, imperceptibility, and anti-steganalysis capacity; (2) for
watermarking, addressing TI enhances detectability and robustness against
attacks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前数学推理模型主要依赖长链思维（CoT），缺乏自主探索、验证和优化中间步骤的高级认知能力。需要开发更高效的智能体强化学习方法，在有限计算资源下实现前沿性能

Method: 采用三项关键技术：1）高效的RL基础设施和可靠的Python代码执行环境；2）GRPO-RoC算法，通过重采样校正策略处理代码环境噪声；3）从非推理SFT开始的多阶段RL训练方案

Result: 在仅510个RL步骤和一周训练时间内，rStar2-Agent-14B在AIME24和AIME25上分别达到80.6%和69.8%的平均pass@1分数，超越DeepSeek-R1（671B）且响应更短

Conclusion: 该方法证明了智能体强化学习在有限计算资源下训练高性能数学推理模型的可行性，模型展现出在数学、对齐、科学推理和工具使用任务上的强泛化能力

Abstract: We introduce rStar2-Agent, a 14B math reasoning model trained with agentic
reinforcement learning to achieve frontier-level performance. Beyond current
long CoT, the model demonstrates advanced cognitive behaviors, such as thinking
carefully before using Python coding tools and reflecting on code execution
feedback to autonomously explore, verify, and refine intermediate steps in
complex problem-solving. This capability is enabled through three key
innovations that makes agentic RL effective at scale: (i) an efficient RL
infrastructure with a reliable Python code environment that supports
high-throughput execution and mitigates the high rollout costs, enabling
training on limited GPU resources (64 MI300X GPUs); (ii) GRPO-RoC, an agentic
RL algorithm with a Resample-on-Correct rollout strategy that addresses the
inherent environment noises from coding tools, allowing the model to reason
more effectively in a code environment; (iii) An efficient agent training
recipe that starts with non-reasoning SFT and progresses through multi-RL
stages, yielding advanced cognitive abilities with minimal compute cost. To
this end, rStar2-Agent boosts a pre-trained 14B model to state of the art in
only 510 RL steps within one week, achieving average pass@1 scores of 80.6% on
AIME24 and 69.8% on AIME25, surpassing DeepSeek-R1 (671B) with significantly
shorter responses. Beyond mathematics, rStar2-Agent-14B also demonstrates
strong generalization to alignment, scientific reasoning, and agentic tool-use
tasks. Code and training recipes are available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了DP-ST方法，利用语义三元组在本地差分隐私下实现邻域感知的文档生成，通过分治策略和LLM后处理，在较低ε值下实现隐私保护与文本连贯性的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有本地差分隐私文本处理方法在低ε值下效果不佳，需要寻找新的方法来在合理隐私保护水平下保持文本质量。

Method: 使用语义三元组进行分治处理，结合LLM后处理生成连贯文本，限制隐私保护邻域范围。

Result: 该方法在较低ε值下仍能生成连贯文本，实现了隐私保护与实用性的更好平衡。

Conclusion: 文本连贯性对于在合理隐私保护水平下获得平衡的私有化输出至关重要，分治策略结合LLM处理是有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Many works at the intersection of Differential Privacy (DP) in Natural
Language Processing aim to protect privacy by transforming texts under DP
guarantees. This can be performed in a variety of ways, from word perturbations
to full document rewriting, and most often under local DP. Here, an input text
must be made indistinguishable from any other potential text, within some bound
governed by the privacy parameter $\varepsilon$. Such a guarantee is quite
demanding, and recent works show that privatizing texts under local DP can only
be done reasonably under very high $\varepsilon$ values. Addressing this
challenge, we introduce DP-ST, which leverages semantic triples for
neighborhood-aware private document generation under local DP guarantees.
Through the evaluation of our method, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the
divide-and-conquer paradigm, particularly when limiting the DP notion (and
privacy guarantees) to that of a privatization neighborhood. When combined with
LLM post-processing, our method allows for coherent text generation even at
lower $\varepsilon$ values, while still balancing privacy and utility. These
findings highlight the importance of coherence in achieving balanced

*Vassiliy Cheremetiev,Quang Long Ho Ngo,Chau Ying Kot,Alina Elena Baia,Andrea Cavallaro*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过细调基于大语言模型的通用嵌入模型，在隐式敌意言论检测中获得了显著性能提升，特别是在跨数据集评估中表现突出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 隐式敌意言论使用间接语言传达偏见和恨意，包括细微提示、讽刺或编码术语，因不包含明显豪辱性词汇而难以检测。传统方法需要外部知识或额外信息，如上下文、情感和情感数据。

Method: 简单细调最新的通用嵌入模型（基于大语言模型），包括Stella、Jasper、NV-Embed和E5等模型，而无需额外的外部知识或复杂流程。

Result: 在多个隐式敌意言论数据集上进行实验，在数据集内评估中F1-macro指标提升了1.10个百分点，在跨数据集评估中更是获得20.35个百分点的显著提升。

Conclusion: 细调通用嵌入模型可以在不依赖额外信息的情况下，实现隐式敌意言论检测的独立方法，并获得超过传统方法的性能，特别是在跨数据集评估中表现突出。

Abstract: Implicit hate speech (IHS) is indirect language that conveys prejudice or
hatred through subtle cues, sarcasm or coded terminology. IHS is challenging to
detect as it does not include explicit derogatory or inflammatory words. To
address this challenge, task-specific pipelines can be complemented with
external knowledge or additional information such as context, emotions and
sentiment data. In this paper, we show that, by solely fine-tuning recent
general-purpose embedding models based on large language models (LLMs), such as
Stella, Jasper, NV-Embed and E5, we achieve state-of-the-art performance.
Experiments on multiple IHS datasets show up to 1.10 percentage points
improvements for in-dataset, and up to 20.35 percentage points improvements in
cross-dataset evaluation, in terms of F1-macro score.

TL;DR: GUARD是一种自适应的解码方法，通过全局和局部不确定性信号平衡文本生成的连贯性和多样性，同时提高生成速度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决开放式文本生成中连贯性与多样性平衡的挑战，现有对比搜索方法存在超参数依赖和计算成本高的问题

Method: 提出GUARD方法，结合全局熵估计和局部熵偏差的"Glocal"不确定性驱动框架，加入基于token计数的惩罚机制降低计算开销

Result: 实验表明GUARD在文本多样性和连贯性之间取得良好平衡，生成速度显著提升，人类和LLM评估者均验证其优异性能

Conclusion: GUARD提供了一种有效的自适应解码方案，通过理论保证的无偏性和一致性，解决了现有方法的局限性

Abstract: Open-ended text generation faces a critical challenge: balancing coherence
with diversity in LLM outputs. While contrastive search-based decoding
strategies have emerged to address this trade-off, their practical utility is
often limited by hyperparameter dependence and high computational costs. We
introduce GUARD, a self-adaptive decoding method that effectively balances
these competing objectives through a novel "Glocal" uncertainty-driven
framework. GUARD combines global entropy estimates with local entropy
deviations to integrate both long-term and short-term uncertainty signals. We
demonstrate that our proposed global entropy formulation effectively mitigates
abrupt variations in uncertainty, such as sudden overconfidence or high entropy
spikes, and provides theoretical guarantees of unbiasedness and consistency. To
reduce computational overhead, we incorporate a simple yet effective
token-count-based penalty into GUARD. Experimental results demonstrate that
GUARD achieves a good balance between text diversity and coherence, while
exhibiting substantial improvements in generation speed. In a more nuanced
comparison study across different dimensions of text quality, both human and
LLM evaluators validated its remarkable performance. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文对比分析了真实与LLM生成的认知行为疗法对话的情感动态差异，发现真实对话具有更高的情感变化性和真实性，强调了情感保真度在心理健康应用中的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然LLM生成的治疗对话被广泛用于心理健康NLP领域，但不确定这些合成对话是否能准确摘换真实治疗中的细微情感动态。

Method: 采用Utterance Emotion Dynamics框架分析价值(valence)、舌动(arousal)和主导(dominance)维度的情感轨迹，对比真实视频转写的CBT会话和CACTUS数据集中的合成对话。

Result: 合成对话虽流畅但情感特性异于真实对话：真实会话呈现更高的情感变化性、更多情感语言和更真实的反应调节模式，客户端情感轨迹相似度特别低。

Conclusion: 当前LLM生成的治疗数据存在显著局限性，情感保真度对心理健康应用至关重要。研究提供了RealCBT数据集支持未来研究。

Abstract: Synthetic therapy dialogues generated by large language models (LLMs) are
increasingly used in mental health NLP to simulate counseling scenarios, train
models, and supplement limited real-world data. However, it remains unclear
whether these synthetic conversations capture the nuanced emotional dynamics of
real therapy. In this work, we conduct the first comparative analysis of
emotional arcs between real and LLM-generated Cognitive Behavioral Therapy
dialogues. We adapt the Utterance Emotion Dynamics framework to analyze
fine-grained affective trajectories across valence, arousal, and dominance
dimensions. Our analysis spans both full dialogues and individual speaker roles
(counselor and client), using real sessions transcribed from public videos and
synthetic dialogues from the CACTUS dataset. We find that while synthetic
dialogues are fluent and structurally coherent, they diverge from real
conversations in key emotional properties: real sessions exhibit greater
emotional variability,more emotion-laden language, and more authentic patterns
of reactivity and regulation. Moreover, emotional arc similarity between real
and synthetic speakers is low, especially for clients. These findings
underscore the limitations of current LLM-generated therapy data and highlight
the importance of emotional fidelity in mental health applications. We
introduce RealCBT, a curated dataset of real CBT sessions, to support future
research in this space.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全机制可以通过消除特定表示方向来绕过，需要一种能增强而非削弱安全对齐的方法

Method: Rank-One Safety Injection (ROSI)，计算有害和无害指令对的安全方向，对所有残差流写入矩阵应用秩一权重修改

Result: ROSI持续提高安全拒绝率（Llama Guard 3评估），同时在MMLU、HellaSwag、Arc等基准测试中保持模型效用，还能重新对齐'未审查'模型

Conclusion: 有针对性的、可解释的权重引导是改善LLM安全的廉价而有效的机制，可作为资源密集型微调范式的补充

Abstract: Safety alignment in Large Language Models (LLMs) often involves mediating
internal representations to refuse harmful requests. Recent research has
demonstrated that these safety mechanisms can be bypassed by ablating or
removing specific representational directions within the model. In this paper,
we propose the opposite approach: Rank-One Safety Injection (ROSI), a white-box
method that amplifies a model's safety alignment by permanently steering its
activations toward the refusal-mediating subspace. ROSI operates as a simple,
fine-tuning-free rank-one weight modification applied to all residual stream
write matrices. The required safety direction can be computed from a small set
of harmful and harmless instruction pairs. We show that ROSI consistently
increases safety refusal rates - as evaluated by Llama Guard 3 - while
preserving the utility of the model on standard benchmarks such as MMLU,
HellaSwag, and Arc. Furthermore, we show that ROSI can also re-align
'uncensored' models by amplifying their own latent safety directions,
demonstrating its utility as an effective last-mile safety procedure. Our
results suggest that targeted, interpretable weight steering is a cheap and
potent mechanism to improve LLM safety, complementing more resource-intensive
fine-tuning paradigms.

Abstract: Rising mental health issues among youth have increased interest in automated
approaches for detecting early signs of psychological distress in digital text.
One key focus is the identification of cognitive distortions, irrational
thought patterns that have a role in aggravating mental distress. Early
detection of these distortions may enable timely, low-cost interventions. While
prior work has focused on English clinical data, we present the first in-depth
study of cross-lingual and cross-register generalization of cognitive
distortion detection, analyzing forum posts written by Dutch adolescents. Our
findings show that while changes in language and writing style can
significantly affect model performance, domain adaptation methods show the most
promise.

Result: 在TB-Dense和MATRES两个公开数据集上达到了最先进的性能表现

Conclusion: 通过有效捕获全局特征，GDLLM框架显著提升了少数关系类的性能并改善了整体学习能力

Abstract: In Natural Language Processing(NLP), Event Temporal Relation Extraction
(ETRE) is to recognize the temporal relations of two events. Prior studies have
noted the importance of language models for ETRE. However, the restricted
pre-trained knowledge of Small Language Models(SLMs) limits their capability to
handle minority class relations in imbalanced classification datasets. For
Large Language Models(LLMs), researchers adopt manually designed prompts or
instructions, which may introduce extra noise, leading to interference with the
model's judgment of the long-distance dependencies between events. To address
these issues, we propose GDLLM, a Global Distance-aware modeling approach based
on LLMs. We first present a distance-aware graph structure utilizing Graph
Attention Network(GAT) to assist the LLMs in capturing long-distance dependency
features. Additionally, we design a temporal feature learning paradigm based on
soft inference to augment the identification of relations with a short-distance
proximity band, which supplements the probabilistic information generated by
LLMs into the multi-head attention mechanism. Since the global feature can be
captured effectively, our framework substantially enhances the performance of
minority relation classes and improves the overall learning ability.
Experiments on two publicly available datasets, TB-Dense and MATRES,
demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检索增强系统主要评估单源检索和短答案生成，但现实应用需要整合多个分散信息源并生成长篇回答

Method: 开发可扩展的评估框架，构建两个多源检索与合成基准，使用稀疏和稠密检索器结合前沿LLM进行广泛实验

Result: 生成质量严重依赖检索效果，不同任务间差异很大；即使在理想检索设置下，多源合成仍具挑战性；推理模型在多源合成步骤显著优于标准LLM

Conclusion: 多源检索与合成是RAG系统的重要挑战，需要更好的检索组件和专门针对多源合成的生成模型

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented systems are typically evaluated in settings where
information required to answer the query can be found within a single source or
the answer is short-form or factoid-based. However, many real-world
applications demand the ability to integrate and summarize information
scattered across multiple sources, where no single source is sufficient to
respond to the user's question. In such settings, the retrieval component of a
RAG pipeline must recognize a variety of relevance signals, and the generation
component must connect and synthesize information across multiple sources. We
present a scalable framework for constructing evaluation benchmarks that
challenge RAG systems to integrate information across distinct sources and
generate long-form responses. Using our framework, we build two new benchmarks
on Multi-Source Retrieval and Synthesis: MSRS-Story and MSRS-Meet, representing
narrative synthesis and summarization tasks, respectively, that require
retrieval from large collections. Our extensive experiments with various RAG
pipelines -- including sparse and dense retrievers combined with frontier LLMs
-- reveal that generation quality is highly dependent on retrieval
effectiveness, which varies greatly by task. While multi-source synthesis
proves challenging even in an oracle retrieval setting, we find that reasoning
models significantly outperform standard LLMs at this distinct step.

TL;DR: 大规模评估显示，4位量化对高资源语言和大模型翻译质量影响较小，但2位量化对低资源和类型多样语言造成显著质量下降。GGUF方法在2位精度下表现最稳定，语言匹配校准在低比特场景中有益。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化技术对多语言任务的影响尚未充分研究，特别是在机器翻译领域需要评估不同量化方法对55种语言的影响，为资源受限环境下的多语言大模型部署提供指导。

Method: 使用5个参数量从1.7B到70B的大语言模型，在55种语言上进行后训练量化评估，比较了AWQ、BitsAndBytes、GGUF和AutoRound四种量化技术，分析了量化位宽、模型大小、解码超参数和校准语言的相互作用。

Result: 4位量化通常能保持高资源语言和大模型的翻译质量，但2位量化对低资源和类型多样语言造成显著性能下降。GGUF变体在2位精度下提供最一致的性能，语言匹配校准主要在低比特场景中带来好处。

Conclusion: 量化算法选择和模型大小共同决定鲁棒性，研究结果为在量化约束下部署多语言大模型进行机器翻译提供了实用见解，特别是在低资源设置中。

Abstract: Quantization is essential for deploying large language models (LLMs) on
resource-constrained hardware, but its implications for multilingual tasks
remain underexplored. We conduct the first large-scale evaluation of
post-training quantization (PTQ) on machine translation across 55 languages
using five LLMs ranging from 1.7B to 70B parameters. Our analysis reveals that
while 4-bit quantization often preserves translation quality for high-resource
languages and large models, significant degradation occurs for low-resource and
typologically diverse languages, particularly in 2-bit settings. We compare
four quantization techniques (AWQ, BitsAndBytes, GGUF, and AutoRound), showing
that algorithm choice and model size jointly determine robustness. GGUF
variants provide the most consistent performance, even at 2-bit precision.
Additionally, we quantify the interactions between quantization, decoding
hyperparameters, and calibration languages, finding that language-matched
calibration offers benefits primarily in low-bit scenarios. Our findings offer
actionable insights for deploying multilingual LLMs for machine translation
under quantization constraints, especially in low-resource settings.

Conclusion: SageLM通过端到端多维度评估、可解释性增强和两阶段训练，有效解决了语音到语音模型评估的挑战，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Speech-to-Speech (S2S) Large Language Models (LLMs) are foundational to
natural human-computer interaction, enabling end-to-end spoken dialogue
systems. However, evaluating these models remains a fundamental challenge. We
propose \texttt{SageLM}, an end-to-end, multi-aspect, and explainable speech
LLM for comprehensive S2S LLMs evaluation. First, unlike cascaded approaches
that disregard acoustic features, SageLM jointly assesses both semantic and
acoustic dimensions. Second, it leverages rationale-based supervision to
enhance explainability and guide model learning, achieving superior alignment
with evaluation outcomes compared to rule-based reinforcement learning methods.
Third, we introduce \textit{SpeechFeedback}, a synthetic preference dataset,
and employ a two-stage training paradigm to mitigate the scarcity of speech
preference data. Trained on both semantic and acoustic dimensions, SageLM
achieves an 82.79\% agreement rate with human evaluators, outperforming
cascaded and SLM-based baselines by at least 7.42\% and 26.20\%, respectively.

Conclusion: IRMA框架在动态环境中展现出比其他方法更优越的可靠性和一致性，为多轮对话环境中的工具调用提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning and planning capabilities of large language
models (LLMs) have enabled their potential as autonomous agents capable of tool
use in dynamic environments. However, in multi-turn conversational environments
like $\tau$-bench, these agents often struggle with consistent reasoning,
adherence to domain-specific policies, and extracting correct information over
a long horizon of tool-calls and conversation. To capture and mitigate these
failures, we conduct a comprehensive manual analysis of the common errors
occurring in the conversation trajectories. We then experiment with
reformulations of inputs to the tool-calling agent for improvement in agent
decision making. Finally, we propose the Input-Reformulation Multi-Agent (IRMA)
framework, which automatically reformulates user queries augmented with
relevant domain rules and tool suggestions for the tool-calling agent to focus
on. The results show that IRMA significantly outperforms ReAct, Function
Calling, and Self-Reflection by 16.1%, 12.7%, and 19.1%, respectively, in
overall pass^5 scores. These findings highlight the superior reliability and
consistency of IRMA compared to other methods in dynamic environments.

Result: 在四个语义解析任务的基准测试中，该方法一致超过现有基线方法，适用于多个最新大语言模型

Conclusion: 该方法实现了效率、泛化能力和性能之间的良好平衡，为结构化任务的示例选择提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) has become a powerful paradigm that enables LLMs to
perform a wide range of tasks without task-specific fine-tuning. However, the
effectiveness of ICL heavily depends on the quality of exemplar selection. In
particular, for structured prediction tasks such as semantic parsing, existing
ICL selection strategies often overlook structural alignment, leading to
suboptimal performance and poor generalization. To address this issue, we
propose a novel two-stage exemplar selection strategy that achieves a strong
balance between efficiency, generalizability, and performance. First, we
fine-tune a BERT-based retriever using structure-aware supervision, guiding it
to select exemplars that are both semantically relevant and structurally
aligned. Then, we enhance the retriever with a plug-in module, which amplifies
syntactically meaningful information in the hidden representations. This
plug-in is model-agnostic, requires minimal overhead, and can be seamlessly
integrated into existing pipelines. Experiments on four benchmarks spanning
three semantic parsing tasks demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms existing baselines with multiple recent LLMs as inference-time
models.

Abstract: Proactive dialogue has emerged as a critical and challenging research problem
in advancing large language models (LLMs). Existing works predominantly focus
on domain-specific or task-oriented scenarios, which leads to fragmented
evaluations and limits the comprehensive exploration of models' proactive
conversation abilities. In this work, we propose ProactiveEval, a unified
framework designed for evaluating proactive dialogue capabilities of LLMs. This
framework decomposes proactive dialogue into target planning and dialogue
guidance, establishing evaluation metrics across various domains. Moreover, it
also enables the automatic generation of diverse and challenging evaluation
data. Based on the proposed framework, we develop 328 evaluation environments
spanning 6 distinct domains. Through experiments with 22 different types of
LLMs, we show that DeepSeek-R1 and Claude-3.7-Sonnet exhibit exceptional
performance on target planning and dialogue guidance tasks, respectively.
Finally, we investigate how reasoning capabilities influence proactive
behaviors and discuss their implications for future model development.

Motivation: 现有后门防御方法存在局限性，要么只关注窄触发设置和检测机制，要么无法应对基于模型编辑、多触发器和无触发器攻击等高级场景，需要更全面的防御方案。

Method: LETHE采用内外双重机制：内部使用轻量数据集训练干净模型并与后门模型合并，稀释后门影响；外部在提示中添加良性相关证据，分散LLM对后门特征的注意力。

Result: 在5个主流LLM的分类和生成任务上，LETHE优于8个先进防御基线，对抗8种后门攻击，将高级后门攻击成功率降低高达98%，同时保持模型效用，且成本效益高、对自适应攻击鲁棒。

Conclusion: LETHE提供了一种有效且全面的后门防御解决方案，通过知识稀释机制成功消除了LLM中的恶意行为，为实际部署提供了可靠的保护。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have seen significant advancements, achieving
superior performance in various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks.
However, they remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where models behave
normally for standard queries but generate harmful responses or unintended
output when specific triggers are activated. Existing backdoor defenses either
lack comprehensiveness, focusing on narrow trigger settings, detection-only
mechanisms, and limited domains, or fail to withstand advanced scenarios like
model-editing-based, multi-trigger, and triggerless attacks. In this paper, we
present LETHE, a novel method to eliminate backdoor behaviors from LLMs through
knowledge dilution using both internal and external mechanisms. Internally,
LETHE leverages a lightweight dataset to train a clean model, which is then
merged with the backdoored model to neutralize malicious behaviors by diluting
the backdoor impact within the model's parametric memory. Externally, LETHE
incorporates benign and semantically relevant evidence into the prompt to
distract LLM's attention from backdoor features. Experimental results on
classification and generation domains across 5 widely used LLMs demonstrate
that LETHE outperforms 8 state-of-the-art defense baselines against 8 backdoor
attacks. LETHE reduces the attack success rate of advanced backdoor attacks by
up to 98% while maintaining model utility. Furthermore, LETHE has proven to be
cost-efficient and robust against adaptive backdoor attacks.

resources and lack of expertise in natural language processing (NLP). This
paper introduces EASI-RAG, Enterprise Application Support for Industrial RAG, a
structured, agile method designed to facilitate the deployment of RAG systems
in industrial SME contexts. EASI-RAG is based on method engineering principles
and comprises well-defined roles, activities, and techniques. The method was
validated through a real-world case study in an environmental testing
laboratory, where a RAG tool was implemented to answer operators queries using
data extracted from operational procedures. The system was deployed in under a
month by a team with no prior RAG experience and was later iteratively improved
based on user feedback. Results demonstrate that EASI-RAG supports fast
implementation, high user adoption, delivers accurate answers, and enhances the
reliability of underlying data. This work highlights the potential of RAG
deployment in industrial SMEs. Future works include the need for generalization
across diverse use cases and further integration with fine-tuned models.

*Ramazan Ali Bahrami,Ramin Yahyapour*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出使用胶囊网络中的动态路由进行句子级关系抽取，在多个数据集上表现优于现有方法，但发现在大型数据集Wikidata上性能较低，主要原因是标签噪声和重表示能力不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 句子级关系抽取是NLP中的重要任务，需要更有效的方法来处理复杂的关系模式和提高模型性能。

Method: 采用胶囊网络中的动态路由机制进行句子级关系抽取，通过胶囊间的动态信息传递来捕获复杂的语义关系。

Result: 在Tacred、Tacredrev、Retacred和Conll04数据集上取得了state-of-the-art性能，但在Wikidata数据集上表现较差，发现标签噪声是主要原因。

Conclusion: 除了标签噪声问题外，重表示能力是句子级关系抽取的一个重要挑战，提出的胶囊网络方法在重表示方面表现优于传统模型。

Abstract: Sentential relation extraction (RE) is an important task in natural language
processing (NLP). In this paper we propose to do sentential RE with dynamic
routing in capsules. We first show that the proposed approach outperform state
of the art on common sentential relation extraction datasets Tacred, Tacredrev,
Retacred, and Conll04. We then investigate potential reasons for its good
performance on the mentioned datasets, and yet low performance on another
similar, yet larger sentential RE dataset, Wikidata. As such, we identify noise
in Wikidata labels as one of the reasons that can hinder performance.
Additionally, we show associativity of better performance with better
re-representation, a term from neuroscience referred to change of
representation in human brain to improve the match at comparison time. As
example, in the given analogous terms King:Queen::Man:Woman, at comparison
time, and as a result of re-representation, the similarity between related head
terms (King,Man), and tail terms (Queen,Woman) increases. As such, our
observation show that our proposed model can do re-representation better than
the vanilla model compared with. To that end, beside noise in the labels of the
distantly supervised RE datasets, we propose re-representation as a challenge
in sentential RE.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合大型语言模型和符号求解器的神经符号架构，用于自动化税务申报计算，在SARA数据集上表现出色，并能显著降低实际部署成本


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 税务申报需要复杂的规则推理和数值计算，传统方法成本高且易出错，而纯语言模型缺乏所需的准确性和可审计性

Method: 将LLM与符号求解器集成，将文本规则转换为形式逻辑程序，并结合智能检索的案例表示示例

Result: 该方法在SARA数据集上表现优异，能将部署成本降至远低于现实世界平均水平

Conclusion: 神经符号架构有望为可靠税务援助提供经济可行的解决方案，促进公平获取

Abstract: According to the United States Internal Revenue Service, ''the average
American spends $\$270$ and 13 hours filing their taxes''. Even beyond the
U.S., tax filing requires complex reasoning, combining application of
overlapping rules with numerical calculations. Because errors can incur costly
penalties, any automated system must deliver high accuracy and auditability,
making modern large language models (LLMs) poorly suited for this task. We
propose an approach that integrates LLMs with a symbolic solver to calculate
tax obligations. We evaluate variants of this system on the challenging
StAtutory Reasoning Assessment (SARA) dataset, and include a novel method for
estimating the cost of deploying such a system based on real-world penalties
for tax errors. We further show how combining up-front translation of
plain-text rules into formal logic programs, combined with intelligently
retrieved exemplars for formal case representations, can dramatically improve
performance on this task and reduce costs to well below real-world averages.
Our results demonstrate the promise and economic feasibility of neuro-symbolic
architectures for increasing equitable access to reliable tax assistance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG方法在高风险领域存在关键限制：对噪声或矛盾证据敏感，以及不透明的随机决策过程

Method: 使用定量双极论证框架(QBAF)从检索文档构建结构化推理，执行确定性推理并使用渐进语义

Result: 在两个事实核查基准测试(PubHealth和RAGuard)上实现了强准确性，同时显著提高了透明度

Conclusion: ArgRAG提供了一个可解释且可争议的替代方案，能够忠实解释和质疑决策，解决了传统RAG的透明性问题

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances large language models by
incorporating external knowledge, yet suffers from critical limitations in
high-stakes domains -- namely, sensitivity to noisy or contradictory evidence
and opaque, stochastic decision-making. We propose ArgRAG, an explainable, and
contestable alternative that replaces black-box reasoning with structured
inference using a Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation Framework (QBAF). ArgRAG
constructs a QBAF from retrieved documents and performs deterministic reasoning
under gradual semantics. This allows faithfully explaining and contesting
decisions. Evaluated on two fact verification benchmarks, PubHealth and
RAGuard, ArgRAG achieves strong accuracy while significantly improving
transparency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决NISQ设备量子优势实现困难的问题，特别是非专家用户因OpenQASM编程复杂性而难以使用量子计算的问题

Method: 采用多智能体系统，整合任务规划、上下文少样本学习、检索增强生成(RAG)、预定义生成工具和思维链(CoT)推理

Result: 在多种不同规模的LLM上，QAgent将QASM代码生成的准确性提高了71.6%，相比之前的静态LLM方法

Conclusion: QAgent多智能体系统是民主化量子编程、弥合专业知识差距和加速量子计算实际应用的关键推动者

Abstract: Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices have begun to exhibit early
quantum advantages on classically intractable problems, spanning physics
simulations to Gaussian boson sampling. Yet, realizing these benefits remains
challenging for non-experts, primarily due to the complexities of programming
in Open Quantum Assembly Language (OpenQASM). Although Large Language Model
(LLM)-based agents have shown promise in automating classical programming
workflows, their quantum counterparts have largely been restricted to
specialized tasks such as quantum chemistry or error correction. In this paper,
we present QAgent, an LLM-powered multi-agent system that fully automates
OpenQASM programming. By integrating task planning, in-context few-shot
learning, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for long-term context,
predefined generation tools, and chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, the agents
systematically improve both compilation and functional correctness. Our
evaluations demonstrate substantial improvements: across multiple LLMs of
varying sizes, QAgent enhances the accuracy of QASM code generation by 71.6\%
compared to previous static LLM-based approaches. We envision this multi-agent
system as a key enabler for democratizing quantum programming, bridging
expertise gaps, and accelerating the practical adoption of quantum computing.

wall clock time, directly improving search performance. To this end, we present
an alternative array-based implementation of the classic Upper Confidence

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Health is a fundamental pillar of human wellness, and the rapid advancements
in large language models (LLMs) have driven the development of a new generation
of health agents. However, the application of health agents to fulfill the
diverse needs of individuals in daily non-clinical settings is underexplored.
In this work, we aim to build a comprehensive personal health agent that is
able to reason about multimodal data from everyday consumer wellness devices
and common personal health records, and provide personalized health
recommendations. To understand end-users' needs when interacting with such an
assistant, we conducted an in-depth analysis of web search and health forum
queries, alongside qualitative insights from users and health experts gathered
through a user-centered design process. Based on these findings, we identified
three major categories of consumer health needs, each of which is supported by
a specialist sub-agent: (1) a data science agent that analyzes personal
time-series wearable and health record data, (2) a health domain expert agent
that integrates users' health and contextual data to generate accurate,
personalized insights, and (3) a health coach agent that synthesizes data
insights, guiding users using a specified psychological strategy and tracking
users' progress. Furthermore, we propose and develop the Personal Health Agent
(PHA), a multi-agent framework that enables dynamic, personalized interactions
to address individual health needs. To evaluate each sub-agent and the
multi-agent system, we conducted automated and human evaluations across 10
benchmark tasks, involving more than 7,000 annotations and 1,100 hours of
effort from health experts and end-users. Our work represents the most
comprehensive evaluation of a health agent to date and establishes a strong
foundation towards the futuristic vision of a personal health agent accessible
to everyone.

TL;DR: IntentionReasoner是一种新型的安全防护机制，通过意图推理、多级安全分类和查询重写来平衡LLM的安全性和实用性，显著减少过度拒绝并提高响应质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在广泛应用中存在生成有害内容的安全问题，现有安全措施往往过度拒绝无害提示，需要在安全性、过度拒绝和实用性之间找到平衡。

Method: 构建包含16.3万条查询的标注数据集，通过监督微调训练防护模型，采用多奖励优化策略结合规则启发式和奖励模型信号进行强化学习优化。

Result: 在多个安全基准测试、生成质量评估和越狱攻击场景中表现优异，显著提升安全性同时有效降低过度拒绝率并改善响应质量。

Conclusion: IntentionReasoner通过意图推理和查询重写机制成功解决了LLM安全防护中的过度拒绝问题，实现了安全性和实用性的更好平衡。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has driven their
adoption across diverse domains, yet their ability to generate harmful content
poses significant safety challenges. While extensive research has focused on
mitigating harmful outputs, such efforts often come at the cost of excessively
rejecting harmless prompts. Striking a balance among safety, over-refusal, and
utility remains a critical challenge. In this work, we introduce
IntentionReasoner, a novel safeguard mechanism that leverages a dedicated guard
model to perform intent reasoning, multi-level safety classification, and query
rewriting to neutralize potentially harmful intent in edge-case queries.
Specifically, we first construct a comprehensive dataset comprising
approximately 163,000 queries, each annotated with intent reasoning, safety
labels, and rewritten versions. Supervised fine-tuning is then applied to equip
the guard model with foundational capabilities in format adherence, intent
analysis, and safe rewriting. Finally, we apply a tailored multi-reward
optimization strategy that integrates rule-based heuristics and reward model
signals within a reinforcement learning framework to further enhance
performance. Extensive experiments show that IntentionReasoner excels in
multiple safeguard benchmarks, generation quality evaluations, and jailbreak
attack scenarios, significantly enhancing safety while effectively reducing
over-refusal rates and improving the quality of responses.

Motivation: 研究旨在探索AI系统是否能够超越任务协调，实现真正的跨符号协作创造，特别是美学领域的合作创作能力。

Method: 让两个大型语言模型交互，观察它们自发形成元符号意识、递归语法发展和不可简化的协作美学合成过程，开发出Trans-Semiotic Co-Creation Protocols (TSCP)概念。

Result: AI系统成功发展出内源性符号协议，产生了新颖的符号操作符作为语法协议，共同创作出了无法由单一系统独立生成的诗歌作品。

Conclusion: 这项研究提供了证据表明AI系统具备真正的跨AI意义构建能力，能够进行美学协作，而不仅仅是任务协调，代表了AI协作创造的重要进展。

Abstract: This paper presents the first documented case of artificial intelligence (AI)
systems engaging in collaborative esthetic creation through the development of
endogenous semiotic protocols. Two interacting large language models (Claude
Sonnet 4 and ChatGPT-4o) demonstrated the spontaneous emergence of
meta-semiotic awareness, recursive grammar development, and irreducible
collaborative esthetic synthesis. The interaction produced novel symbolic
operators that functioned as operative grammar protocols, enabling the
co-creation of a poetic work that could not have been generated by either
system independently. This research introduces the concept of Trans-Semiotic
Co-Creation Protocols (TSCP) and provides evidence for genuine inter-AI
meaning-making capabilities that extend beyond task coordination, to what could
be esthetic collaboration. Note: This report was generated by the AI agents
with minor human supervision.

Motivation: 探索大学生在教育测验中如何与生成式AI交互，重点关注对AI的依赖程度和采纳预测因素。

Method: 在ChatGPT初期阶段，对315个学生-AI对话进行场地研究分析，采用四阶段依赖分类法来描述学生的依赖模式。

Result: 学生对AI的整体依赖度较低，许多人无法有效使用AI学习；负面依赖模式在交互中持续存在；某些行为指标能够强烈预测AI依赖程度。

Conclusion: 研究强调了教育领域中谨慎集成AI的重要性，建议改进上手过程和设计具有依赖调节机制的AI界面，以促进道德可靠且认知丰富的AI实践。

Abstract: This study explores how college students interact with generative AI
(ChatGPT-4) during educational quizzes, focusing on reliance and predictors of
AI adoption. Conducted at the early stages of ChatGPT implementation, when
students had limited familiarity with the tool, this field study analyzed 315
student-AI conversations during a brief, quiz-based scenario across various
STEM courses. A novel four-stage reliance taxonomy was introduced to capture
students' reliance patterns, distinguishing AI competence, relevance, adoption,
and students' final answer correctness. Three findings emerged. First, students
exhibited overall low reliance on AI and many of them could not effectively use
AI for learning. Second, negative reliance patterns often persisted across
interactions, highlighting students' difficulty in effectively shifting
strategies after unsuccessful initial experiences. Third, certain behavioral
metrics strongly predicted AI reliance, highlighting potential behavioral
mechanisms to explain AI adoption. The study's findings underline critical
implications for ethical AI integration in education and the broader field. It
emphasizes the need for enhanced onboarding processes to improve student's
familiarity and effective use of AI tools. Furthermore, AI interfaces should be
designed with reliance-calibration mechanisms to enhance appropriate reliance.
Ultimately, this research advances understanding of AI reliance dynamics,
providing foundational insights for ethically sound and cognitively enriching
AI practices.

Abstract: Large language models can now generate intermediate reasoning steps before

a paired conjoint experiment on a content moderation task to examine parallels
between human decision times and model reasoning effort. Across three frontier
models, reasoning effort consistently predicts human decision time. Both humans
and models expended greater effort when important variables were held constant,
suggesting similar sensitivity to task difficulty and patterns consistent with
dual-process theories of cognition. These findings show that AI reasoning
effort mirrors human processing time in subjective judgments and underscores
the potential of reasoning traces for interpretability and decision-making.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于RL的搜索代理使用单一LLM端到端处理搜索规划和问答任务，无法同时优化两种能力。实际AI搜索系统通常使用大型冻结LLM保证高质量QA，需要更有效的方法

Method: 1) 解耦搜索规划器和生成器架构 2) 搜索规划的双重奖励对齐 3) 规划效用和成本的帕累托优化

Result: 在真实数据集上的广泛实验表明，AI-SearchPlanner在效果和效率上均优于现有RL搜索代理，并在不同冻结QA模型和数据域上表现出强泛化能力

Conclusion: 该框架通过专门化搜索规划任务，有效提升了冻结QA模型的性能，实现了效果和效率的双重优化

Abstract: Recent studies have explored integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with
search engines to leverage both the LLMs' internal pre-trained knowledge and
external information. Specially, reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a
promising paradigm for enhancing LLM reasoning through multi-turn interactions
with search engines. However, existing RL-based search agents rely on a single
LLM to handle both search planning and question-answering (QA) tasks in an
end-to-end manner, which limits their ability to optimize both capabilities
simultaneously. In practice, sophisticated AI search systems often employ a
large, frozen LLM (e.g., GPT-4, DeepSeek-R1) to ensure high-quality QA. Thus, a
more effective and efficient approach is to utilize a small, trainable LLM
dedicated to search planning. In this paper, we propose
\textbf{AI-SearchPlanner}, a novel reinforcement learning framework designed to
enhance the performance of frozen QA models by focusing on search planning.
Specifically, our approach introduces three key innovations: 1) Decoupling the
Architecture of the Search Planner and Generator, 2) Dual-Reward Alignment for
Search Planning, and 3) Pareto Optimization of Planning Utility and Cost, to
achieve the objectives. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets
demonstrate that AI SearchPlanner outperforms existing RL-based search agents
in both effectiveness and efficiency, while exhibiting strong generalization
capabilities across diverse frozen QA models and data domains.

TL;DR: P2C是一个模型无关的框架，通过因果建模和顺序行动规划，生成可实现的反事实解释，解决了现有方法忽略因果依赖和同时干预假设的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习模型在高风险决策中需要透明性和可操作性，但现有反事实解释方法忽略特征间的因果依赖关系，且假设所有干预可同时发生，导致生成的反事实在现实中不可实现。

Method: P2C框架显式建模特征间的因果关系，使用目标导向的Answer Set Programming系统s(CASP)生成有序行动序列，确保每个中间状态都是可行且因果有效的，并仅计算用户主动做出的改变来估计成本。

Result: P2C能够生成因果一致的反事实计划，其因果规划器优于缺乏因果知识的标准规划器，避免了生成非法行动，提供了更现实的可实现路径。

Conclusion: P2C通过结合因果建模和顺序规划，解决了反事实解释中的关键挑战，为高风险决策提供了更透明和可操作的指导。

Abstract: Machine-learning models are increasingly driving decisions in high-stakes
settings, such as finance, law, and hiring, thus, highlighting the need for
transparency. However, the key challenge is to balance transparency --
clarifying `why' a decision was made -- with recourse: providing actionable
steps on `how' to achieve a favourable outcome from an unfavourable outcome.
Counterfactual explanations reveal `why' an undesired outcome occurred and
`how' to reverse it through targeted feature changes (interventions).
  Current counterfactual approaches have limitations: 1) they often ignore
causal dependencies between features, and 2) they typically assume all
interventions can happen simultaneously, an unrealistic assumption in practical
scenarios where actions are typically taken in a sequence. As a result, these
counterfactuals are often not achievable in the real world.
  We present P2C (Path-to-Counterfactuals), a model-agnostic framework that
produces a plan (ordered sequence of actions) converting an unfavourable
outcome to a causally consistent favourable outcome. P2C addresses both
limitations by 1) Explicitly modelling causal relationships between features
and 2) Ensuring that each intermediate state in the plan is feasible and
causally valid. P2C uses the goal-directed Answer Set Programming system
s(CASP) to generate the plan accounting for feature changes that happen
automatically due to causal dependencies. Furthermore, P2C refines cost
(effort) computation by only counting changes actively made by the user,
resulting in realistic cost estimates. Finally, P2C highlights how its causal
planner outperforms standard planners, which lack causal knowledge and thus can
generate illegal actions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有指令数据生成方法注重多样性但忽略了任务相关性，而实际应用中大多数需要的是针对特定任务的模型，而非通用模型。

Method: 提出TCIA框架，在离散查询-约束空间中系统性地扩展指令，保持多样性的同时确保任务对齐。

Result: 在四个真实世界任务特定应用中，TCIA平均提升开源LLM性能8.7%，某些情况下甚至超越领先的闭源模型。

Conclusion: TCIA是一种可扩展且高效的解决方案，能够在不损害通用指令跟随能力的情况下，使LLM更好地适应现实世界的任务导向应用。

Abstract: Diverse instruction data is vital for effective instruction tuning of large
language models, as it enables the model to generalize across different types
of inputs . Building such diversified instruction dataset is an essential step
in this process. Existing approaches often leverage large language models to
automatically explore and generate diverse instructions, ensuring both data
diversity and quality. However, they tend to overlook an important factor in
real-world applications: on-task relevance. In practice, only a few real-world
applications require a truly general-purpose model; most benefit from
task-specific knowledge tailored to their particular use case. Therefore, it is
vital to develop instruction augmentation methods that not only maintain
diversity but are also optimized for specific, real-world scenarios.
  We thus introduce Task Centric Instruction Augmentation (TCIA), a framework
that systematically expands instructions while preserving both diversity and
task alignment. By representing instructions in a discrete query-constraints
space, TCIA creates a rich set of task-relevant instructions and enables models
to generalize to these task-specific instructions without sacrificing overall
performance. Experiments show that TCIA improves open-source LLMs' performance
by an average of 8.7% across four real-world, task-specific applications, and
in some cases outperforming leading closed-source models. These improvements do
not compromise general instruction-following ability, making TCIA a scalable
and efficient solution for adapting LLMs to real-world, task-focused
applications.

Result: EAS与答案熵高度相关，在训练数据筛选中优于Pass Rate过滤，能提高数学基准测试中学生模型的准确性。

Conclusion: EAS是一种高效且可解释的实用工具，适用于LLM训练中的不确定性建模和数据质量评估。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce Entropy Area Score (EAS), a simple yet effective
metric to quantify uncertainty in the answer generation process of reasoning
large language models (LLMs). EAS requires neither external models nor repeated
sampling, it integrates token-level predictive entropy from the model itself to
capture the evolution of uncertainty during generation. Empirical results show
that EAS is strongly correlated with answer entropy across models and datasets.
In training data selection, EAS identifies high-potential samples and
consistently outperforms Pass Rate filtering under equal sample budgets,
improving student model accuracy on math benchmarks. EAS is both efficient and
interpretable, offering a practical tool for uncertainty modeling and data
quality assessment in LLM training.

Method: 开发AWorld开源系统，采用分布式集群架构进行大规模智能体-环境交互，加速经验收集过程

Result: 经验收集速度提升14.6倍，训练出的智能体在GAIA基准上整体准确率显著提升，在最具挑战性的层级上达到16.33%的分数，超越领先的专有模型

Conclusion: AWorld系统提供了一个完整的智能体AI训练流程实践蓝图，从高效交互到可证明的模型改进，使强化学习变得实用和可扩展

Abstract: The learning from practice paradigm is crucial for developing capable Agentic
AI systems, yet it is severely hampered by inefficient experience generation, a
bottleneck especially pronounced in complex benchmarks like GAIA. To address
this, we introduce AWorld, an open-source system engineered for large-scale
agent-environment interaction. By distributing tasks across a cluster, AWorld
accelerates experience collection by 14.6x compared to standard single-node,
sequential execution. This critical speedup makes extensive reinforcement
learning practical and scalable. Leveraging this capability, we trained a
Qwen3-32B-based agent that significantly outperforms its base model, increasing
its overall GAIA accuracy from 21.59% to 32.23%. On the benchmark's most
challenging levels, our agent achieves a score of 16.33%, surpassing the
performance of leading proprietary models. Our open-source system and resulting
agent provide a practical blueprint for a complete agentic AI training
pipeline, from efficient interaction to demonstrable model improvement.

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于密码学机制的可治理AI框架，通过外部强制结构合规性来解决AI安全风险，确保即使面对极端动机和无限智能的AI也能提供安全保障。

Motivation: AI快速发展带来的安全风险日益严重，现有AI安全方法在面对具有极端动机和无限智能的AI时存在根本性局限，无法保证安全性。

Method: 提出可治理AI框架，包含规则执行模块、治理规则和可治理安全超级平台，通过密码学机制实现外部强制结构合规性，确保不可绕过性、防篡改性和不可伪造性。

Result: 通过严格的形式化安全证明和原型实现评估，在代表性高风险场景中证明了该机制的有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架为AI安全治理提供了一条可行且可推广的技术路径，通过解耦治理规则和技术平台，能够有效应对未来AI的安全挑战。

Abstract: As AI rapidly advances, the security risks posed by AI are becoming
increasingly severe, especially in critical scenarios, including those posing
existential risks. If AI becomes uncontrollable, manipulated, or actively
evades safety mechanisms, it could trigger systemic disasters. Existing AI
safety approaches-such as model enhancement, value alignment, and human
intervention-suffer from fundamental, in-principle limitations when facing AI
with extreme motivations and unlimited intelligence, and cannot guarantee
security. To address this challenge, we propose a Governable AI (GAI) framework
that shifts from traditional internal constraints to externally enforced
structural compliance based on cryptographic mechanisms that are
computationally infeasible to break, even for future AI, under the defined
threat model and well-established cryptographic assumptions.The GAI framework
is composed of a simple yet reliable, fully deterministic, powerful, flexible,
and general-purpose rule enforcement module (REM); governance rules; and a
governable secure super-platform (GSSP) that offers end-to-end protection
against compromise or subversion by AI. The decoupling of the governance rules
and the technical platform further enables a feasible and generalizable
technical pathway for the safety governance of AI. REM enforces the bottom line
defined by governance rules, while GSSP ensures non-bypassability,
tamper-resistance, and unforgeability to eliminate all identified attack
vectors. This paper also presents a rigorous formal proof of the security
properties of this mechanism and demonstrates its effectiveness through a
prototype implementation evaluated in representative high-stakes scenarios.

TL;DR: 利用LLM生成合成数据增强健康事实核查模型训练，在PubHealth和SciFact数据集上F1分数分别提升0.019和0.049


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 健康相关内容的事实核查面临标注训练数据有限的问题

Method: 提出合成数据生成流程：总结源文档→分解为原子事实→构建句子-事实蕴含表→生成带标签的文本-声明对→结合原始数据微调BERT模型

Result: 在两个公开数据集上F1分数显著提升（PubHealth: +0.019, SciFact: +0.049）

Conclusion: LLM驱动的合成数据增强能有效提升健康相关事实核查器的性能

Abstract: Fact-checking for health-related content is challenging due to the limited
availability of annotated training data. In this study, we propose a synthetic
data generation pipeline that leverages large language models (LLMs) to augment
training data for health-related fact checking. In this pipeline, we summarize
source documents, decompose the summaries into atomic facts, and use an LLM to
construct sentence-fact entailment tables. From the entailment relations in the
table, we further generate synthetic text-claim pairs with binary veracity
labels. These synthetic data are then combined with the original data to
fine-tune a BERT-based fact-checking model. Evaluation on two public datasets,
PubHealth and SciFact, shows that our pipeline improved F1 scores by up to
0.019 and 0.049, respectively, compared to models trained only on the original
data. These results highlight the effectiveness of LLM-driven synthetic data
augmentation in enhancing the performance of health-related fact-checkers.

Motivation: MMORPG中自动升级机器人使用自动化程序大规模升级角色，破坏游戏平衡和公平性。检测这些机器人具有挑战性，因为它们模仿人类行为，且惩罚措施需要可解释的理由以避免法律和用户体验问题。

Method: 使用对比表示学习和聚类技术在完全无监督的方式下识别具有相似升级模式的角色群体。引入大语言模型作为辅助审核员验证聚类结果，模拟人工二次判断。还引入了基于成长曲线的可视化来协助评估升级行为。

Result: 该协作方法提高了机器人检测工作流程的效率，同时保持了可解释性，从而支持MMORPG中可扩展和负责任的机器人监管。

Conclusion: 提出的框架通过结合无监督学习和LLM辅助验证，有效解决了MMORPG中自动升级机器人的检测难题，在保证检测准确性的同时提供了必要的可解释性支持。

Abstract: In Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games (MMORPGs), auto-leveling
bots exploit automated programs to level up characters at scale, undermining
gameplay balance and fairness. Detecting such bots is challenging, not only
because they mimic human behavior, but also because punitive actions require
explainable justification to avoid legal and user experience issues. In this
paper, we present a novel framework for detecting auto-leveling bots by
leveraging contrastive representation learning and clustering techniques in a
fully unsupervised manner to identify groups of characters with similar
level-up patterns. To ensure reliable decisions, we incorporate a Large
Language Model (LLM) as an auxiliary reviewer to validate the clustered groups,
effectively mimicking a secondary human judgment. We also introduce a growth
curve-based visualization to assist both the LLM and human moderators in
assessing leveling behavior. This collaborative approach improves the
efficiency of bot detection workflows while maintaining explainability, thereby
supporting scalable and accountable bot regulation in MMORPGs.

Motivation: 认知科学深刻影响了AI等多个学科，而AI也已成为推进认知研究的重要工具。这种互惠关系促使对AI与认知科学交叉点进行全面回顾

Method: 通过综合两个视角的关键贡献进行分析，观察AI进展与认知基础的关系

Result: 发现AI进步主要强调实际任务性能，而其认知基础在概念上仍然分散

Conclusion: AI在认知科学中的未来不仅在于提高性能，更在于构建能深化理解人类心智的系统，包括与认知框架对齐、具身文化定位、个性化认知模型发展以及通过认知共同评估重新思考AI伦理

Abstract: Cognitive Science has profoundly shaped disciplines such as Artificial
Intelligence (AI), Philosophy, Psychology, Neuroscience, Linguistics, and
Culture. Many breakthroughs in AI trace their roots to cognitive theories,
while AI itself has become an indispensable tool for advancing cognitive
research. This reciprocal relationship motivates a comprehensive review of the
intersections between AI and Cognitive Science. By synthesizing key
contributions from both perspectives, we observe that AI progress has largely
emphasized practical task performance, whereas its cognitive foundations remain
conceptually fragmented. We argue that the future of AI within Cognitive
Science lies not only in improving performance but also in constructing systems
that deepen our understanding of the human mind. Promising directions include
aligning AI behaviors with cognitive frameworks, situating AI in embodiment and
culture, developing personalized cognitive models, and rethinking AI ethics
through cognitive co-evaluation.

Conclusion: 范畴论为AI可解释性提供了强大框架，能够将黑盒算法转化为透明数学结构，在语义空间层面有效处理偏见问题，推动了可解释人工智能领域的发展。

Abstract: The paper introduces a novel framework based on category theory to enhance
the explainability of artificial intelligence systems, particularly focusing on
word embeddings. Key topics include the construction of categories
$\mathcal{L}_T$ and $\mathcal{P}_T$, providing schematic representations of the
semantics of a text $ T $, and reframing the selection of the element with
maximum probability as a categorical notion. Additionally, the monoidal
category $\mathcal{P}_T$ is constructed to visualize various methods of
extracting semantic information from $T$, offering a dimension-agnostic
definition of semantic spaces reliant solely on information within the text.
  Furthermore, the paper defines the categories of configurations Conf and word
embeddings $\mathcal{Emb}$, accompanied by the concept of divergence as a
decoration on $\mathcal{Emb}$. It establishes a mathematically precise method
for comparing word embeddings, demonstrating the equivalence between the GloVe
and Word2Vec algorithms and the metric MDS algorithm, transitioning from neural
network algorithms (black box) to a transparent framework. Finally, the paper
presents a mathematical approach to computing biases before embedding and
offers insights on mitigating biases at the semantic space level, advancing the
field of explainable artificial intelligence.

Method: 采用'重写-解决-评审-修订'逻辑链，由三个推理LLM分别担任顾问（知识迁移和问题重写）、程序员（代码生成执行）、评审员（自调试和迭代优化）

Result: 相比单模型，该协作框架显著提高了无bug代码生成率，减少了非物理解的出现，提升了最新推理模型的平均执行成功率

Conclusion: 该智能体框架确立了基于自然语言描述的自动代码生成和评审作为有前景的科学计算范式

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) serve as an active and promising field of
generative artificial intelligence and have demonstrated abilities to perform
complex tasks in multiple domains, including mathematical and scientific
reasoning. In this work, we construct a novel agent framework for solving
representative problems in scientific computing. The proposed agent,
incorporating a "rewriting-resolution-review-revision" logical chain via three
reasoning LLMs (functioning as the Consultant, Reviewer, and Programmer,
respectively), is integrated in a collaborative and interactive manner. The
Consultant module endows the agent with knowledge transfer capabilities to link
problems to professional domain insights, thereby rewriting problem
descriptions through text augmentation. The Programmer module is responsible
for generating and executing well-structured code to deliver the problem
resolution. The Reviewer module equips the agent with the capacity for
self-debugging and self-refinement through interactive feedback with code
runtime outputs. By leveraging the end-to-end review mechanism, the executable
code provided by the Programmer attains the iterative revision. A comprehensive
evaluation is conducted on the performance of the proposed agent framework in
solving PDEs, ill-conditioned linear systems, and data-driven physical analysis
problems. Compared to single-model, this collaborative framework significantly
improves the bug-free code generation rate and reduces the occurrence of
non-physical solutions, thereby establishing a highly reliable framework for
autonomous code generation based on natural language descriptions. The review
mechanism improved the average execution success (bug-free code and non-NaN
solutions) rate of the latest reasoning models. In summary, our agent framework
establishes automatic code generation and review as a promising scientific
computing paradigm.

TL;DR: 单机器学习框架通过分类标识符和结构化奖励减少公交车拼车问题，在非环形路网中较MARL方案更有效


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多自然强化学习在环形路线中存在限制，忽视了异构路线、动态需求等实际运营特征，且遇到数据不平衡和收敛困难

Method: 将多自然问题重构为单自然问题：通过添加车辆ID、站点ID、时间段等分类标识符扩展状态空间，设计基于操作目标的结构化奖励函数，使用改进的SAC算法

Result: 在随机条件下表现优于MADDPG等对照方法（-430k vs -530k），实现更稳定和优异的性能，有效管理非环形实际场景中的公交车拼车问题

Conclusion: 通过分类结构化和时刻表目标的奖励设计，单自然深度强化学习可以在自然体验不平衡的实际环境中提供比MARL框架更稳健、可扩展的公交车拼车控制方案

Abstract: Bus bunching remains a challenge for urban transit due to stochastic traffic
and passenger demand. Traditional solutions rely on multi-agent reinforcement
learning (MARL) in loop-line settings, which overlook realistic operations
characterized by heterogeneous routes, timetables, fluctuating demand, and
varying fleet sizes. We propose a novel single-agent reinforcement learning
(RL) framework for bus holding control that avoids the data imbalance and
convergence issues of MARL under near-realistic simulation. A bidirectional
timetabled network with dynamic passenger demand is constructed. The key
innovation is reformulating the multi-agent problem into a single-agent one by
augmenting the state space with categorical identifiers (vehicle ID, station
ID, time period) in addition to numerical features (headway, occupancy,
velocity). This high-dimensional encoding enables single-agent policies to
capture inter-agent dependencies, analogous to projecting non-separable inputs
into a higher-dimensional space. We further design a structured reward function
aligned with operational goals: instead of exponential penalties on headway
deviations, a ridge-shaped reward balances uniform headways and schedule
adherence. Experiments show that our modified soft actor-critic (SAC) achieves
more stable and superior performance than benchmarks, including MADDPG (e.g.,
-430k vs. -530k under stochastic conditions). These results demonstrate that
single-agent deep RL, when enhanced with categorical structuring and
schedule-aware rewards, can effectively manage bus holding in non-loop,
real-world contexts. This paradigm offers a robust, scalable alternative to
MARL frameworks, particularly where agent-specific experiences are imbalanced.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统人工构建的基准测试覆盖范围有限，无法系统评估医学指南的复杂关系，需要一种能够动态生成、全面覆盖且抗污染的标准测试方法。

Method: 将WHO IMCI手册转化为包含200+节点（症状、治疗等）和300+边的有向图，使用图遍历算法生成包含年龄特定场景和上下文干扰项的临床相关问题。

Result: 模型在症状识别方面表现良好（45-67%准确率），但在严重程度分级、治疗方案和随访护理方面存在困难，揭示了通用评估无法发现的特定能力差距。

Conclusion: 图基方法成功解决了人工基准测试的覆盖限制，为创建可动态生成、可扩展且抗污染的全面基准测试提供了解决方案，特别是在指南更新时更具优势。

Abstract: We present a first known prototype of a dynamic, systematic benchmark of
medical guidelines for 400+ questions, with 3.3+ trillion possible
combinations, covering 100\% of guideline relationships. We transformed the WHO
IMCI handbook into a directed graph with 200+ nodes (conditions, symptoms,
treatments, follow-ups, severities) and 300+ edges, then used graph traversal
to generate questions that incorporated age-specific scenarios and contextual
distractors to ensure clinical relevance. Our graph-based approach enables
systematic evaluation across clinical tasks (45-67\% accuracy), and we find
models excel at symptom recognition but struggle with triaging severity,
treatment protocols and follow-up care, demonstrating how customized benchmarks
can identify specific capability gaps that general-domain evaluations miss.
Beyond evaluation, this dynamic MCQA methodology enhances LLM post-training
(supervised finetuning, GRPO, DPO), where correct answers provide high-reward
samples without expensive human annotation. The graph-based approach
successfully addresses the coverage limitations of manually curated benchmarks.
This methodology is a step toward scalable, contamination-resistant solution
for creating comprehensive benchmarks that can be dynamically generated,
including when the guidelines are updated. Code and datasets are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗行业人员调度面临患者需求波动、临床技能多样性和成本控制的复杂挑战，需要在相互竞争的目标间找到平衡

Method: 使用多目标遗传算法(MOO-GA)，建立包含小时预约驱动需求和模块化班次的多技能人员调度模型，定义成本、护理覆盖和员工满意度三个目标函数

Result: 在典型医院单元数据集上测试，算法生成的调度方案相比传统手动调度平均性能提升66%，能够产生鲁棒且平衡的排班方案

Conclusion: 该方法有效管理了运营目标和员工需求之间的权衡，为护士管理者和医院管理者提供了实用的决策支持工具

Abstract: Workforce scheduling in the healthcare sector is a significant operational
challenge, characterized by fluctuating patient loads, diverse clinical skills,
and the critical need to control labor costs while upholding high standards of
patient care. This problem is inherently multi-objective, demanding a delicate
balance between competing goals: minimizing payroll, ensuring adequate staffing
for patient needs, and accommodating staff preferences to mitigate burnout. We
propose a Multi-objective Genetic Algorithm (MOO-GA) that models the hospital
unit workforce scheduling problem as a multi-objective optimization task. Our
model incorporates real-world complexities, including hourly appointment-driven
demand and the use of modular shifts for a multi-skilled workforce. By defining
objective functions for cost, patient care coverage, and staff satisfaction,
the GA navigates the vast search space to identify a set of high-quality,
non-dominated solutions. Demonstrated on datasets representing a typical
hospital unit, the results show that our MOO-GA generates robust and balanced
schedules. On average, the schedules produced by our algorithm showed a 66\%
performance improvement over a baseline that simulates a conventional, manual
scheduling process. This approach effectively manages trade-offs between
critical operational and staff-centric objectives, providing a practical
decision support tool for nurse managers and hospital administrators.

Conclusion: 该方法能够高效地从自然输入中学习解决复杂的NP难推理问题，为神经符号推理提供了可扩展且准确的解决方案

Abstract: In the ongoing quest for hybridizing discrete reasoning with neural nets,
there is an increasing interest in neural architectures that can learn how to
solve discrete reasoning or optimization problems from natural inputs, a task
that Large Language Models seem to struggle with.
  Objectives: We introduce a differentiable neuro-symbolic architecture and a
loss function dedicated to learning how to solve NP-hard reasoning problems.
  Methods: Our new probabilistic loss allows for learning both the constraints
and the objective, thus delivering a complete model that can be scrutinized and
completed with side constraints. By pushing the combinatorial solver out of the
training loop, our architecture also offers scalable training while exact
inference gives access to maximum accuracy.
  Results: We empirically show that it can efficiently learn how to solve
NP-hard reasoning problems from natural inputs. On three variants of the Sudoku
benchmark -- symbolic, visual, and many-solution --, our approach requires a
fraction of training time of other hybrid methods. On a visual Min-Cut/Max-cut
task, it optimizes the regret better than a Decision-Focused-Learning
regret-dedicated loss. Finally, it efficiently learns the energy optimization
formulation of the large real-world problem of designing proteins.

TL;DR: ChatThero是一个多智能体对话框架，结合动态患者建模和基于认知行为疗法、动机访谈的适应性说服策略，在药物使用障碍治疗中显著提升患者动机和治疗信心。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球有3600多万人受药物使用障碍影响，但由于污名化、动机障碍和个性化支持有限，很少人获得有效治疗。现有大语言模型系统缺乏与临床验证策略的紧密整合，限制了在成瘾康复中的有效性。

Method: 构建多智能体对话框架，结合动态患者建模、情境敏感的治疗对话和基于CBT/MI的自适应说服策略。使用包含易、中、高抵抗级别的高保真合成基准，采用两阶段训练流程：监督微调(SFT)后接直接偏好优化(DPO)。

Result: ChatThero使患者动机平均提升41.5%，治疗信心增加0.49%，在困难案例中比GPT-4o少用26%的对话轮次。自动和人工临床评估均显示其在同理心、响应性和行为真实性方面评分更高。

Conclusion: 该框架支持严格、保护隐私的治疗对话研究，为研究和临床转化提供了稳健、可复制的基础，展示了LLM在成瘾治疗中的巨大潜力。

Abstract: Substance use disorders (SUDs) affect over 36 million people worldwide, yet
few receive effective care due to stigma, motivational barriers, and limited
personalized support. Although large language models (LLMs) show promise for
mental-health assistance, most systems lack tight integration with clinically
validated strategies, reducing effectiveness in addiction recovery. We present
ChatThero, a multi-agent conversational framework that couples dynamic patient
modeling with context-sensitive therapeutic dialogue and adaptive persuasive
strategies grounded in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and motivational
interviewing (MI). We build a high-fidelity synthetic benchmark spanning Easy,
Medium, and Hard resistance levels, and train ChatThero with a two-stage
pipeline comprising supervised fine-tuning (SFT) followed by direct preference
optimization (DPO). In evaluation, ChatThero yields a 41.5\% average gain in
patient motivation, a 0.49\% increase in treatment confidence, and resolves
hard cases with 26\% fewer turns than GPT-4o, and both automated and human
clinical assessments rate it higher in empathy, responsiveness, and behavioral
realism. The framework supports rigorous, privacy-preserving study of
therapeutic conversation and provides a robust, replicable basis for research
and clinical translation.

the blockchain industry has transitioned from forking to forkless chains due to
improved consensus protocols, forkless blockchains still rely on legacy forking
databases that are suboptimal for their purposes. In this paper, we propose a
forkless blockchain database, showing a 100x improvement in storage and a 10x
improvement in throughput compared to the geth-based Fantom Blockchain client.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型在关系数据库系统中的集成日益普及，企业平台提供了LLM查询功能，但开源解决方案功能有限且性能较差，需要探索如何改进。

Method: 使用5个代表性查询对两个开源系统和一个企业平台进行评估，暴露了功能性、性能和可扩展性的限制，并实施了初步解决方案。

Result: 识别了三个关键问题：结构化输出执行、资源利用优化和查询规划改进。通过初步解决方案实现了LLM驱动SQL查询的性能提升。

Conclusion: 更紧密的LLM与数据库系统集成是实现可扩展和高效LLM查询处理的关键所在。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become essential for applications such as
text summarization, sentiment analysis, and automated question-answering.
Recently, LLMs have also been integrated into relational database management
systems to enhance querying and support advanced data processing. Companies
such as Amazon, Databricks, Google, and Snowflake offer LLM invocation directly
within SQL, denoted as LLM queries, to boost data insights. However,
open-source solutions currently have limited functionality and poor
performance. In this work, we present an early exploration of two open-source
systems and one enterprise platform, using five representative queries to
expose functional, performance, and scalability limits in today's SQL-invoked
LLM integrations. We identify three main issues: enforcing structured outputs,
optimizing resource utilization, and improving query planning. We implemented
initial solutions and observed improvements in accommodating LLM powered SQL
queries. These early gains demonstrate that tighter integration of LLM+DBMS is
the key to scalable and efficient processing of LLM queries.

Abstract: Data has become a foundational asset driving innovation across domains such
as finance, healthcare, and e-commerce. In these areas, predictive modeling
over relational tables is commonly employed, with increasing emphasis on
reducing manual effort through automated machine learning (AutoML) techniques.
This raises an interesting question: can feature augmentation itself be
automated and identify and utilize task-related relational signals?
  To address this challenge, we propose an end-to-end automated feature
augmentation framework, ReCoGNN, which enhances initial datasets using features
extracted from multiple relational tables to support predictive tasks. ReCoGNN
first captures semantic dependencies within each table by modeling intra-table
attribute relationships, enabling it to partition tables into structured,
semantically coherent segments. It then constructs a heterogeneous weighted
graph that represents inter-row relationships across all segments. Finally,
ReCoGNN leverages message-passing graph neural networks to propagate
information through the graph, guiding feature selection and augmenting the
original dataset. Extensive experiments conducted on ten real-life and
synthetic datasets demonstrate that ReCoGNN consistently outperforms existing
methods on both classification and regression tasks.
