### [1] [CellPainTR: Generalizable Representation Learning for Cross-Dataset Cell Painting Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06986)
*Cedric Caruzzo,Jong Chul Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CellPainTR是基于Transformer的架构，用于学习对批次效应鲁棒的细胞形态学基础表征，无需微调即可泛化到未见数据集，在JUMP数据集上优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模生物发现需要整合海量异构数据集，但技术批次效应和缺乏可泛化模型是关键障碍。

Method: 提出CellPainTR Transformer架构，采用源特定上下文标记设计，实现无需微调的分布外泛化。

Result: 在JUMP数据集上优于ComBat和Harmony等传统方法，在未见Bray数据集上保持高性能，具有显著域和特征偏移鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 这项工作为创建真正的图像分析基础模型迈出重要一步，实现了更可靠和可扩展的跨研究生物分析。

Abstract: Large-scale biological discovery requires integrating massive, heterogeneous
datasets like those from the JUMP Cell Painting consortium, but technical batch
effects and a lack of generalizable models remain critical roadblocks. To
address this, we introduce CellPainTR, a Transformer-based architecture
designed to learn foundational representations of cellular morphology that are
robust to batch effects. Unlike traditional methods that require retraining on
new data, CellPainTR's design, featuring source-specific context tokens, allows
for effective out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization to entirely unseen
datasets without fine-tuning. We validate CellPainTR on the large-scale JUMP
dataset, where it outperforms established methods like ComBat and Harmony in
both batch integration and biological signal preservation. Critically, we
demonstrate its robustness through a challenging OOD task on the unseen Bray et
al. dataset, where it maintains high performance despite significant domain and
feature shifts. Our work represents a significant step towards creating truly
foundational models for image-based profiling, enabling more reliable and
scalable cross-study biological analysis.

### [2] [FusWay: Multimodal hybrid fusion approach. Application to Railway Defect Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06987)
*Alexey Zhukov,Jenny Benois-Pineau,Amira Youssef,Akka Zemmari,Mohamed Mosbah,Virginie Taillandier*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于域规则的多模态融合架构，结合YOLOv8n和Vision Transformer，通过融合视觉和音频信息来提高铁路缺陷检测的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单一视觉模态的缺陷检测方法存在过检测问题，当正常结构元件外观类似缺陷时会导致错误检测。需要通过多模态融合来提高检测精度。

Method: 构建了YOLOv8n和Vision Transformer的融合架构，从多个层（7、16、19）提取特征图，并与合成的音频表征进行融合，重点检测铁路断裂和表面缺陷两类缺陷。

Result: 在真实铁路数据集上的实验评估显示，多模态融合方法比单纯视觉方法提高了精度和总体准确性0.2个百分点，并通过学生t检验确认了统计显著性。

Conclusion: 通过视觉与音频多模态融合可以有效提升铁路缺陷检测的性能，减少过检测现象，为工业检测应用提供了更加准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal fusion is a multimedia technique that has become popular in the
wide range of tasks where image information is accompanied by a signal/audio.
The latter may not convey highly semantic information, such as speech or music,
but some measures such as audio signal recorded by mics in the goal to detect
rail structure elements or defects. While classical detection approaches such
as You Only Look Once (YOLO) family detectors can be efficiently deployed for
defect detection on the image modality, the single modality approaches remain
limited. They yield an overdetection in case of the appearance similar to
normal structural elements. The paper proposes a new multimodal fusion
architecture built on the basis of domain rules with YOLO and Vision
transformer backbones. It integrates YOLOv8n for rapid object detection with a
Vision Transformer (ViT) to combine feature maps extracted from multiple layers
(7, 16, and 19) and synthesised audio representations for two defect classes:
rail Rupture and Surface defect. Fusion is performed between audio and image.
Experimental evaluation on a real-world railway dataset demonstrates that our
multimodal fusion improves precision and overall accuracy by 0.2 points
compared to the vision-only approach. Student's unpaired t-test also confirms
statistical significance of differences in the mean accuracy.

### [3] [Frustratingly Easy Feature Reconstruction for Out-of-Distribution Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06988)
*Yingsheng Wang,Shuo Lu,Jian Liang,Aihua Zheng,Ran He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练数据的后处理OOD检测方法ClaFR，通过分类器权重的正交分解构建类已知子空间，计算特征重构误差来实现OOD检测，在多个基准测试中达到领先性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于特征的后处理方法需要访问训练数据，这在数据隐私保护场景下不适用。需要开发不依赖训练数据的OOD检测方法。

Method: ClaFR方法：1）对分类器权重进行正交分解提取类已知子空间；2）将原始特征映射到该子空间获得新表示；3）计算子空间内的特征重构误差作为OOD分数。

Result: 在多个OOD基准测试中取得了领先性能，且不需要访问训练数据。

Conclusion: ClaFR是一种简单有效的后处理OOD检测方法，通过子空间投影和特征重构误差计算，在不依赖训练数据的情况下实现了优异的检测性能。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection helps models identify data outside the
training categories, crucial for security applications. While feature-based
post-hoc methods address this by evaluating data differences in the feature
space without changing network parameters, they often require access to
training data, which may not be suitable for some data privacy scenarios. This
may not be suitable in scenarios where data privacy protection is a concern. In
this paper, we propose a simple yet effective post-hoc method, termed
Classifier-based Feature Reconstruction (ClaFR), from the perspective of
subspace projection. It first performs an orthogonal decomposition of the
classifier's weights to extract the class-known subspace, then maps the
original data features into this subspace to obtain new data representations.
Subsequently, the OOD score is determined by calculating the feature
reconstruction error of the data within the subspace. Compared to existing OOD
detection algorithms, our method does not require access to training data while
achieving leading performance on multiple OOD benchmarks. Our code is released
at https://github.com/Aie0923/ClaFR.

### [4] [DIET-CP: Lightweight and Data Efficient Self Supervised Continued Pretraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06990)
*Bryan Rodas,Natalie Montesino,Jakob Ambsdorf,David Klindt,Randall Balestriero*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DIET-CP是一种简单的持续预训练策略，能够在小型专业领域数据集上有效调整基础模型，无需标签和额外超参数，仅用1000张图像就能显著提升DINOv3等先进模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决专业领域中数据集规模小、SSL方法不适用、预训练模型缺乏重要信息等问题，使基础模型能够适应新的数据分布。

Method: 采用简单的目标函数，无需标签，不引入比监督微调更多的超参数，通过持续预训练将基础模型引导到目标数据分布。

Result: DIET-CP在不同数据模态和骨干网络选择中表现稳定，仅使用1000张图像就能显著提升DINOv3等最先进模型的性能。

Conclusion: DIET-CP提供了一种简单有效的持续预训练解决方案，能够在小规模专业领域数据集上成功调整基础模型，填补了现有方法的空白。

Abstract: Continued pretraining offers a promising solution for adapting foundation
models to a new target domain. However, in specialized domains, available
datasets are often very small, limiting the applicability of SSL methods
developed for large-scale pretraining and making hyperparameter search
infeasible. In addition, pretrained models are usually released as
backbone-weights only, lacking important information to continue pretraining.
We propose to bridge this gap with DIET-CP, a simple continued pretraining
strategy, where any strong foundation model can be steered towards the new data
distribution of interest. DIET-CP relies on a very simple objective, requires
no labels, and introduces no more hyperparameters than supervised finetuning.
It is stable across data modalities and backbone choices, while providing a
significant performance boost for state-of-the-art models such as DINOv3 using
only 1000 images.

### [5] [FedAPT: Federated Adversarial Prompt Tuning for Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06992)
*Kun Zhai,Siheng Chen,Xingjun Ma,Yu-Gang Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FedAPT是一种新的联邦对抗提示调优方法，通过在非IID设置下解决类别信息差距问题，使用类别感知提示生成器和跨层生成器共享策略，显著提升了视觉语言模型的对抗鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦提示调优(FPT)方法虽然高效，但训练出的模型容易受到对抗攻击，导致下游任务错误分类。特别是在非独立同分布(non-IID)设置下存在类别信息差距问题。

Method: 提出FedAPT方法：1) 类别感知提示生成器，利用全局标签嵌入作为引导生成视觉提示；2) 跨层生成器共享策略，增强不同层间提示的耦合性。

Result: 在多个图像分类数据集上的实验表明，FedAPT在提升对抗鲁棒性方面显著优于现有方法，并在跨域和跨数据集场景中展现出优异的泛化能力。

Conclusion: FedAPT有效解决了联邦提示调优中的对抗鲁棒性问题，特别是在非IID设置下的类别信息差距问题，具有很好的实际应用价值。

Abstract: Federated Prompt Tuning (FPT) is an efficient method for cross-client
collaborative fine-tuning of large Vision-Language Models (VLMs). However,
models tuned using FPT are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, leading to
misclassification in downstream tasks. In this work, we introduce Federated
Adversarial Prompt Tuning (\textbf{FedAPT}), a novel method designed to enhance
the adversarial robustness of FPT. We identify a key issue in FedAPT under
non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) settings: a \textit{class
information gap} between clients and the global model. Clients rely solely on
limited local label information to generate adversarial samples for training,
while the global model must defend against adversarial attacks from global
labels. To address this issue, we propose a \textbf{class-aware prompt
generator} that generates visual prompts from text prompts. This generator is
guided by a \emph{Global Label Embedding} (serving as a ``beacon") which
encodes cross-client label information to create more globally-aligned visual
prompts. Additionally, we propose a \textbf{cross-layer generator sharing}
strategy to enhance prompt coupling across different layers of the model,
further boosting adversarial robustness. Extensive experiments on multiple
image classification datasets demonstrate the superiority of FedAPT in
improving adversarial robustness, outperforming existing methods by a large
margin. FedAPT also exhibits exceptional generalization in cross-domain and
cross-dataset scenarios, indicating its effectiveness in real-world
applications.

### [7] [VLMs-in-the-Wild: Bridging the Gap Between Academic Benchmarks and Enterprise Reality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06994)
*Srihari Bandraupalli,Anupam Purwar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViLD框架填补了学术评估与企业部署需求之间的差距，通过10个商业关键任务和创新的BlockWeaver算法，在真实企业数据上评估开源视觉语言模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前学术基准主要依赖选择题和合成数据，无法反映真实企业应用场景的复杂性，需要建立更贴近实际部署需求的评估框架。

Method: 提出ViLD框架，定义10个商业关键任务，开发BlockWeaver算法处理无序OCR输出比较问题，构建包含7500个真实样本的基准数据集，结合语义匹配、传统指标和新颖方法进行评估。

Result: 在Qwen、MIMO和InternVL等领先开源VLM上进行了行业基础的、任务驱动的能力评估，为企业在实际环境中部署VLM提供了可操作的见解。

Conclusion: ViLD框架成功弥合了学术研究与企业需求之间的鸿沟，为开源视觉语言模型在企业环境中的实际部署提供了有效的评估标准和实用指导。

Abstract: Open-source Vision-Language Models show immense promise for enterprise
applications, yet a critical disconnect exists between academic evaluation and
enterprise deployment requirements. Current benchmarks rely heavily on
multiple-choice questions and synthetic data, failing to capture the complexity
of real-world business applications like social media content analysis. This
paper introduces VLM-in-the-Wild (ViLD), a comprehensive framework to bridge
this gap by evaluating VLMs on operational enterprise requirements. We define
ten business-critical tasks: logo detection, OCR, object detection, human
presence and demographic analysis, human activity and appearance analysis,
scene detection, camera perspective and media quality assessment, dominant
colors, comprehensive description, and NSFW detection. To this framework, we
bring an innovative BlockWeaver Algorithm that solves the challenging problem
of comparing unordered, variably-grouped OCR outputs from VLMs without relying
on embeddings or LLMs, achieving remarkable speed and reliability. To
demonstrate efficacy of ViLD, we constructed a new benchmark dataset of 7,500
diverse samples, carefully stratified from a corpus of one million real-world
images and videos. ViLD provides actionable insights by combining semantic
matching (both embedding-based and LLM-as-a-judge approaches), traditional
metrics, and novel methods to measure the completeness and faithfulness of
descriptive outputs. By benchmarking leading open-source VLMs (Qwen, MIMO, and
InternVL) against a powerful proprietary baseline as per ViLD framework, we
provide one of the first industry-grounded, task-driven assessment of VLMs
capabilities, offering actionable insights for their deployment in enterprise
environments.

### [8] [The Protocol Genome A Self Supervised Learning Framework from DICOM Headers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06995)
*Jimmy Joseph*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Protocol Genome是一个自监督学习系统，通过分析DICOM头部信息来学习协议相关性，在外部验证中达到AUROC 0.901（基准为0.847）和ECE 0.036（基准为0.058），提高了跨模态和厂商的校准性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床影像通过PACS/DICOM系统处理，扫描协议选择（扫描仪型号、序列、参数等）会影响对比度、噪声和伪影，这些潜在混杂因素阻碍了仅基于图像的网络的跨站点泛化能力。

Method: 将结构化DICOM头部作为标签，通过协议-图像对比学习、掩码协议预测和协议-协议翻译三种方法，结合图像特征学习协议感知但临床鲁棒的图像表示。

Result: 在126万项研究（7个医疗系统、31台扫描仪、3个厂商；CT、MR、CR/DR）上实验显示，在肺栓塞CT分诊、脑胶质瘤MRI分级和心胸比X光检测三个任务中，Protocol Genome相比强基线方法（SimCLR、MAE和ImageNet迁移）获得更高的外部AUROC（+0.046至+0.058）和25-37%的校准改进。

Conclusion: 该方法减少了协议边界处的假阳性，适用于PACS系统，即使在10-20%标注数据情况下也能保持性能优势，并提供了模型卡片和部署指南以及去标识化和偏见审计。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the Protocol Genome, a self-supervised learning
system that learns correlations from DICOM headers and achieves AUROC 0.901 (vs
0.847 baseline) and ECE 0.036 (vs 0.058) on fully held-out external validation.
Our method also improves calibration and robustness across modalities (CT, MRI,
CXR) and vendors. Clinical imaging is funneled through PACS/DICOM, where
procedure choices (scanner make/model, sequence, kernel, kVp, TR/TE, and slice
thickness) have consequences for contrast, noise, and artifact. These latent
confounders impede the generalization of image-only networks across sites. We
consider structured DICOM headers as a label and learn protocol-aware but
clinically robust image representations. Protocol Genome obtains tokenized
embeddings of de-identified header fields and models them along with image
features using: (1) protocol-image contrastive learning, (2) masked protocol
prediction, and (3) protocol-protocol translation. With 1.26M studies (7 health
systems, 31 scanners, 3 vendors; CT, MR, CR/DR), we experiment on: (A) chest CT
triage for PE, (B) brain MRI glioma grading, and (C) chest radiograph
cardiomegaly detection. Relative to strong SSL baselines (SimCLR, MAE) as well
as ImageNet transfer, Protocol Genome (+0.046: PE, +0.058: glioma, +0.041:
cardiomegaly) is associated with higher external AUROC; 25-37% calibration
improvements are obtained (p < 0.01, DeLong tests). While the gains may be
task-dependent, they are preserved with 10-20% of labeled data. From a clinical
point of view, the technique reduces false positives at protocol borders and is
applicable in a PACS (DICOM C-FIND/C-MOVE, DICOMweb QIDO/WADO). We publish a
model card and deployment guide, complete with both de-identification and bias
audits.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究发现先进视觉语言模型在处理破碎、融合或部分遮挡的文字时表现不佳，与人类阅读韧性形成鲜明对比，揭示了模型在符号分割、组合和绑定方面的结构局限性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究人类在文字识别方面展现出的惊人韧性（即使字符破碎、融合或部分遮挡仍能识别），探索先进视觉语言模型是否具备类似的文字识别鲁棒性

Method: 构建两个受心理物理学启发的基准测试（中文象形文字和英文字母单词），通过拼接、重组和叠加字形来创建对人类可读但对模型"可见但不可读"的刺激材料

Result: 尽管在清晰文本上表现强劲，但当代视觉语言模型在这些扰动下表现严重下降，经常产生无关或不连贯的输出，表明模型过度依赖通用视觉不变性而忽视了组合先验

Conclusion: 研究结果呼吁开发能够编码符号分割、组合和跨脚本绑定的架构和训练策略，并为多模态系统在教育、无障碍、文化遗产和安全等领域的部署指明了具体挑战

Abstract: Writing is a universal cultural technology that reuses vision for symbolic
communication. Humans display striking resilience: we readily recognize words
even when characters are fragmented, fused, or partially occluded. This paper
investigates whether advanced vision language models (VLMs) share this
resilience. We construct two psychophysics inspired benchmarks across distinct
writing systems, Chinese logographs and English alphabetic words, by splicing,
recombining, and overlaying glyphs to yield ''visible but unreadable'' stimuli
for models while remaining legible to humans. Despite strong performance on
clean text, contemporary VLMs show a severe drop under these perturbations,
frequently producing unrelated or incoherent outputs. The pattern suggests a
structural limitation: models heavily leverage generic visual invariances but
under rely on compositional priors needed for robust literacy. We release
stimuli generation code, prompts, and evaluation protocols to facilitate
transparent replication and follow up work. Our findings motivate architectures
and training strategies that encode symbol segmentation, composition, and
binding across scripts, and they delineate concrete challenges for deploying
multimodal systems in education, accessibility, cultural heritage, and
security.

TL;DR: 提出一种在频域进行特征级学习的动态心脏MRI重建方法，通过时间融合策略合成k空间数据，在低数据量情况下仍能稳定生成高质量重建结果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心脏磁共振成像具有动态复杂特性，高质量k空间数据稀缺，传统图像域卷积方法在低数据量下重建效果受限

Method: 在频域进行特征级建模，利用傅里叶变换的全局表示能力，整合多时间帧k空间数据，采用多种融合策略优化生成轨迹

Result: 实验结果表明该方法在低数据量情况下具有强大的生成能力

Conclusion: 该方法能有效缓解动态MRI重建中的数据稀缺问题，具有实际应用潜力

Abstract: Owing to the inherently dynamic and complex characteristics of cardiac
magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging, high-quality and diverse k-space data are
rarely available in practice, which in turn hampers robust reconstruction of
dynamic cardiac MRI. To address this challenge, we perform feature-level
learning directly in the frequency domain and employ a temporal-fusion strategy
as the generative guidance to synthesize k-space data. Specifically, leveraging
the global representation capacity of the Fourier transform, the frequency
domain can be considered a natural global feature space. Therefore, unlike
traditional methods that use pixel-level convolution for feature learning and
modeling in the image domain, this letter focuses on feature-level modeling in
the frequency domain, enabling stable and rich generation even with ultra
low-data regimes. Moreover, leveraging the advantages of feature-level modeling
in the frequency domain, we integrate k-space data across time frames with
multiple fusion strategies to steer and further optimize the generative
trajectory. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method possesses
strong generative ability in low-data regimes, indicating practical potential
to alleviate data scarcity in dynamic MRI reconstruction.

*Liviu Nicolae Fircă,Antonio Bărbălau,Dan Oneata,Elena Burceanu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文首次明确评估模型在语义和感知差异较大的类别间进行属性预测的稳健性，发现性能随着训练集和测试集相关性的降低而冲击性下降


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估模型是否能够将属性知识汇总应用到语义和感知差异较大的类别中，比如识别"有四条腿"这个属性同时属于"狗"和"椅子"

Method: 通过LLM驱动语义分组、嵌入相似度阈值、嵌入聚类和超类分区等四种方法逐渐减少训练集和测试集的相关性

Result: 随着训练测试集相关性的降低，模型性能冲击性下降，聚类方法在减少隐藏相关性和保持可学习性方面表现最佳

Conclusion: 当前表征在属性推理任务中存在显著局限性，需要更好的基准测试构建方法来评估模型的真正汇总能力

Abstract: Can models generalize attribute knowledge across semantically and
perceptually dissimilar categories? While prior work has addressed attribute
prediction within narrow taxonomic or visually similar domains, it remains
unclear whether current models can abstract attributes and apply them to
conceptually distant categories. This work presents the first explicit
evaluation for the robustness of the attribute prediction task under such
conditions, testing whether models can correctly infer shared attributes
between unrelated object types: e.g., identifying that the attribute "has four
legs" is common to both "dogs" and "chairs". To enable this evaluation, we
introduce train-test split strategies that progressively reduce correlation
between training and test sets, based on: LLM-driven semantic grouping,
embedding similarity thresholding, embedding-based clustering, and
supercategory-based partitioning using ground-truth labels. Results show a
sharp drop in performance as the correlation between training and test
categories decreases, indicating strong sensitivity to split design. Among the
evaluated methods, clustering yields the most effective trade-off, reducing
hidden correlations while preserving learnability. These findings offer new
insights into the limitations of current representations and inform future
benchmark construction for attribute reasoning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于人在循环的量化评估框架，用于评估大语言模型生成的3D形状的几何和结构保真度，通过综合性指标体系实现更快的收敛效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大语言模型能够解释多模态输入生成复杂3D形状，但评估其几何和结构保真度的稳健方法仍不充分，需要开发量化评估方法来支持CAD设计民主化、逆向工程和快速原型制造等应用。

Method: 提出了一套综合的相似性和复杂性指标，包括体积准确度、表面对齐度、尺寸保真度和拓扑复杂性，以L垂直极作为案例研究，系统比较四种输入模态：2D正交视图、等质测图、几何结构树和代码基于纠正提示。

Result: 发现随着语义丰富度的提升，生成保真度有所改善，代码级提示在所有指标上实现了完美重建。量化评估方法能够显著提高向真实值的收敛速度，特别是相比传统仅依赖视觉检查和人类直觉的定性方法。

Conclusion: 这项工作不仅推进了对AI辅助形状合成的理解，还为验证和精炼各种CAD应用的生成模型提供了可扩展的方法论，为评估LLM生成3D模型的质量提供了量化标准。

Abstract: Large Language Models are increasingly capable of interpreting multimodal
inputs to generate complex 3D shapes, yet robust methods to evaluate geometric
and structural fidelity remain underdeveloped. This paper introduces a human in
the loop framework for the quantitative evaluation of LLM generated 3D models,
supporting applications such as democratization of CAD design, reverse
engineering of legacy designs, and rapid prototyping. We propose a
comprehensive suite of similarity and complexity metrics, including volumetric
accuracy, surface alignment, dimensional fidelity, and topological intricacy,
to benchmark generated models against ground truth CAD references. Using an L
bracket component as a case study, we systematically compare LLM performance
across four input modalities: 2D orthographic views, isometric sketches,
geometric structure trees, and code based correction prompts. Our findings
demonstrate improved generation fidelity with increased semantic richness, with
code level prompts achieving perfect reconstruction across all metrics. A key
contribution of this work is demonstrating that our proposed quantitative
evaluation approach enables significantly faster convergence toward the ground
truth, especially compared to traditional qualitative methods based solely on
visual inspection and human intuition. This work not only advances the
understanding of AI assisted shape synthesis but also provides a scalable
methodology to validate and refine generative models for diverse CAD
applications.

TL;DR: MEGS²是一个针对3D高斯泼溅的内存优化框架，通过联合优化基元数量和参数数量，实现50%静态显存和40%渲染显存压缩，同时保持渲染质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅技术内存消耗过高，限制了在边缘设备上的应用。现有压缩方法主要关注存储压缩，未能解决渲染内存瓶颈问题。

Method: 使用轻量级任意方向球面高斯瓣替代内存密集的球谐函数作为颜色表示；提出统一的软剪枝框架，将基元数量和瓣数量剪枝建模为单一约束优化问题。

Result: 相比现有方法，实现50%静态显存减少和40%渲染显存减少，同时保持相当的渲染质量。

Conclusion: MEGS²通过联合优化策略有效解决了3D高斯泼溅的内存瓶颈问题，为边缘设备部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a dominant novel-view synthesis
technique, but its high memory consumption severely limits its applicability on
edge devices. A growing number of 3DGS compression methods have been proposed
to make 3DGS more efficient, yet most only focus on storage compression and
fail to address the critical bottleneck of rendering memory. To address this
problem, we introduce MEGS$^{2}$, a novel memory-efficient framework that
tackles this challenge by jointly optimizing two key factors: the total
primitive number and the parameters per primitive, achieving unprecedented
memory compression. Specifically, we replace the memory-intensive spherical
harmonics with lightweight arbitrarily-oriented spherical Gaussian lobes as our
color representations. More importantly, we propose a unified soft pruning
framework that models primitive-number and lobe-number pruning as a single
constrained optimization problem. Experiments show that MEGS$^{2}$ achieves a
50% static VRAM reduction and a 40% rendering VRAM reduction compared to
existing methods, while maintaining comparable rendering quality.

facilitates a range of downstream tasks involving optimization in the latent
space of text-to-image models. We treat elements of a high-dimensional sample
as one-dimensional standard Gaussian variables and define a composite loss that
combines moment-based regularization in the spatial domain with power
spectrum-based regularization in the spectral domain. Since the expected values
of moments and power spectrum distributions are analytically known, the loss
promotes conformity to these properties. To ensure permutation invariance, the
losses are applied to randomly permuted inputs. Notably, existing
Gaussianity-based regularizations fall within our unified framework: some
correspond to moment losses of specific orders, while the previous
covariance-matching loss is equivalent to our spectral loss but incurs higher
time complexity due to its spatial-domain computation. We showcase the
application of our regularization in generative modeling for test-time reward
alignment with a text-to-image model, specifically to enhance aesthetics and
text alignment. Our regularization outperforms previous Gaussianity
regularization, effectively prevents reward hacking and accelerates
convergence.

Abstract: Image segmentation is a critical task in microscopy, essential for accurately
analyzing and interpreting complex visual data. This task can be performed
using custom models trained on domain-specific datasets, transfer learning from
pre-trained models, or foundational models that offer broad applicability.
However, foundational models often present a considerable number of
non-transparent tuning parameters that require extensive manual optimization,
limiting their usability for real-time streaming data analysis. Here, we
introduce a reward function-based optimization to fine-tune foundational models
and illustrate this approach for SAM (Segment Anything Model) framework by
Meta. The reward functions can be constructed to represent the physics of the
imaged system, including particle size distributions, geometries, and other
criteria. By integrating a reward-driven optimization framework, we enhance
SAM's adaptability and performance, leading to an optimized variant, SAM$^{*}$,
that better aligns with the requirements of diverse segmentation tasks and
particularly allows for real-time streaming data segmentation. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of this approach in microscopy imaging, where precise
segmentation is crucial for analyzing cellular structures, material interfaces,
and nanoscale features.

the application of data distillation as an innovative approach to improve the
precision of streaming image data classification. By focusing on distilling
essential features from data streams, our method aims to minimize computational
demands while preserving crucial information for accurate classification. Our
investigation com-pares this approach against traditional algorithms like
Hoeffding Trees and Adap-tive Random Forest, adapted through embeddings for

*Juan Manuel Contreras*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Aymara图像公平性评估基准，测试13个商业大模型在职业图像生成中的性别偏见，发现模型系统性放大性别刻板印象，存在默认男性偏见，且不同模型偏见程度差异显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究存在方法学限制，无法进行大规模、可比较的跨模型分析，需要开发标准化评估工具来检测多模态模型中的社会偏见。

Method: 使用75个程序生成的性别中性提示词，测试13个商业LMM模型生成 stereotypically-male、stereotypically-female和非刻板印象职业的人物图像，使用经过验证的LLM-as-a-judge系统对965张图像进行性别表征评分。

Result: 1) LMMs系统性放大职业性别刻板印象（男性刻板职业93.0%为男性，女性刻板职业仅22.5%为男性）；2) 存在强烈默认男性偏见（非刻板职业68.3%为男性）；3) 不同模型偏见程度差异显著（46.7%-73.3%）。

Conclusion: 高偏见并非必然结果而是设计选择的结果，最佳模型能够去放大性别刻板印象并接近性别平等，强调了标准化自动化评估工具对促进AI公平性的必要性。

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have revolutionized text-to-image generation,
but they risk perpetuating the harmful social biases in their training data.
Prior work has identified gender bias in these models, but methodological
limitations prevented large-scale, comparable, cross-model analysis. To address
this gap, we introduce the Aymara Image Fairness Evaluation, a benchmark for
assessing social bias in AI-generated images. We test 13 commercially available
LMMs using 75 procedurally-generated, gender-neutral prompts to generate people
in stereotypically-male, stereotypically-female, and non-stereotypical
professions. We then use a validated LLM-as-a-judge system to score the 965
resulting images for gender representation. Our results reveal (p < .001 for
all): 1) LMMs systematically not only reproduce but actually amplify
occupational gender stereotypes relative to real-world labor data, generating
men in 93.0% of images for male-stereotyped professions but only 22.5% for
female-stereotyped professions; 2) Models exhibit a strong default-male bias,
generating men in 68.3% of the time for non-stereotyped professions; and 3) The
extent of bias varies dramatically across models, with overall male
representation ranging from 46.7% to 73.3%. Notably, the top-performing model
de-amplified gender stereotypes and approached gender parity, achieving the
highest fairness scores. This variation suggests high bias is not an inevitable
outcome but a consequence of design choices. Our work provides the most
comprehensive cross-model benchmark of gender bias to date and underscores the
necessity of standardized, automated evaluation tools for promoting
accountability and fairness in AI development.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于块稀疏核的注意力机制替代方案，用于解决多视图重建中transformer模型的二次复杂度瓶颈问题，实现了4倍推理加速且保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的transformer模型如VGGT和π³在多视图重建中表现出色，但由于全局注意力层的二次复杂度，在处理大规模图像集时存在运行时瓶颈。通过分析发现注意力概率质量集中在少数跨视图几何匹配的patch交互上。

Method: 基于结构化注意力的观察和大语言模型的进展，提出了使用高度优化的块稀疏核来替代密集全局注意力操作，无需重新训练主干网络，支持VGGT和π³模型。

Result: 在多个多视图基准测试上的评估表明，该方法实现了高达4倍的推理加速，同时保持了可比较的任务性能，支持大规模图像集合。

Conclusion: 提出的块稀疏注意力机制有效解决了多视图重建中transformer模型的扩展性问题，在保持精度的同时显著提升了计算效率。

Abstract: Efficient and accurate feed-forward multi-view reconstruction has long been
an important task in computer vision. Recent transformer-based models like VGGT
and $\pi^3$ have achieved impressive results with simple architectures, yet
they face an inherent runtime bottleneck, due to the quadratic complexity of
the global attention layers, that limits the scalability to large image sets.
In this paper, we empirically analyze the global attention matrix of these
models and observe that probability mass concentrates on a small subset of
patch-patch interactions that correspond to cross-view geometric matches.
Motivated by the structured attention and inspired by recent advancement in
large language models, we propose a replacement for the dense global attention
operation based on highly optimized block-sparse kernels, yielding up to
$4\times$ faster inference with comparable task performance. Our retrofit
requires no retraining of the backbone, extends to both VGGT and $\pi^3$, and
supports large image collections. Evaluations on a comprehensive suite of
multi-view benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

TL;DR: 本文研究边缘服务器端视觉惯性里程计(VIO)面临的姿态欺骗威胁，提出了一种无监督、无标签的检测与恢复机制，通过训练攻击自由会话来学习运动时序规律，检测运行时偏差并恢复姿态一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前将VIO卸载到边缘服务器的趋势导致服务器端威胁面扩大，微小的姿态欺骗可能累积成显著漂移，同时规避启发式检查，需要有效的安全防护机制。

Method: 提出无监督、无标签的检测和恢复机制，在无攻击会话上训练模型学习运动时序规律，检测运行时偏差并启动恢复过程以恢复姿态一致性。

Result: 在ILLIXR测试平台上使用多种欺骗强度进行评估，实验结果显示在轨迹和姿态误差方面相比无防御基线有显著降低。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效检测和恢复VIO系统中的姿态欺骗攻击，显著减少轨迹和姿态误差，为边缘服务器VIO系统提供了可行的安全防护方案。

Abstract: Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) supports immersive Virtual Reality (VR) by
fusing camera and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data for real-time pose.
However, current trend of offloading VIO to edge servers can lead server-side
threat surface where subtle pose spoofing can accumulate into substantial
drift, while evading heuristic checks. In this paper, we study this threat and
present an unsupervised, label-free detection and recovery mechanism. The
proposed model is trained on attack-free sessions to learn temporal
regularities of motion to detect runtime deviations and initiate recovery to
restore pose consistency. We evaluate the approach in a realistic offloaded-VIO
environment using ILLIXR testbed across multiple spoofing intensities.
Experimental results in terms of well-known performance metrics show
substantial reductions in trajectory and pose error compared to a no-defense
baseline.

Motivation: 研究假设人脸增强技术在改善感知质量的同时，可能降低深度伪造检测器的性能，探讨这些技术是否具有反取证作用。

Method: 系统评估传统图像处理方法和基于GAN的增强技术对深度伪造检测器的影响，分析对Naïve、空间和频域检测方法的效果，并进行对抗训练实验。

Result: 实验显示基础增强滤镜可使检测准确率显著下降（ASR达64.63%），GAN-based技术进一步利用这些漏洞（ASR达75.12%）。

Conclusion: 人脸增强方法可有效作为反取证工具，强调需要开发更具弹性和适应性的取证方法。

Abstract: Face enhancement techniques are widely used to enhance facial appearance.
However, they can inadvertently distort biometric features, leading to
significant decrease in the accuracy of deepfake detectors. This study
hypothesizes that these techniques, while improving perceptual quality, can
degrade the performance of deepfake detectors. To investigate this, we
systematically evaluate whether commonly used face enhancement methods can
serve an anti-forensic role by reducing detection accuracy. We use both
traditional image processing methods and advanced GAN-based enhancements to
evaluate the robustness of deepfake detectors. We provide a comprehensive
analysis of the effectiveness of these enhancement techniques, focusing on
their impact on Na\"ive, Spatial, and Frequency-based detection methods.
Furthermore, we conduct adversarial training experiments to assess whether
exposure to face enhancement transformations improves model robustness.
Experiments conducted on the FaceForensics++, DeepFakeDetection, and CelebDF-v2
datasets indicate that even basic enhancement filters can significantly reduce
detection accuracy achieving ASR up to 64.63\%. In contrast, GAN-based
techniques further exploit these vulnerabilities, achieving ASR up to 75.12\%.
Our results demonstrate that face enhancement methods can effectively function
as anti-forensic tools, emphasizing the need for more resilient and adaptive
forensic methods.

Motivation: 在实际应用中，标注数据需要大量人工工作，而且新类别可能会不断出现。但现有研究多举中于半监督学习，需要找到全无监督的方法来解决这个问题。

Method: 使用Vision Transformers通过注意力机制生成向量嵌入，并结合流形学习技术来精炼嵌入表征，利用数据的内在几何结构来提升图像聚类性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为开放世界中的新类发现问题提供了一种有效的全无监督解决方案，显示了视觉Transformer和流形学习在这一领域的潜力。

Abstract: Working with annotated data is the cornerstone of supervised learning.
Nevertheless, providing labels to instances is a task that requires significant
human effort. Several critical real-world applications make things more
complicated because no matter how many labels may have been identified in a
task of interest, it could be the case that examples corresponding to novel
classes may appear in the future. Not unsurprisingly, prior work in this,
so-called, `open-world' context has focused a lot on semi-supervised
approaches.
  Focusing on image classification, somehow paradoxically, we propose a fully
unsupervised approach to the problem of determining the novel categories in a
particular dataset. Our approach relies on estimating the number of clusters
using Vision Transformers, which utilize attention mechanisms to generate
vector embeddings. Furthermore, we incorporate manifold learning techniques to
refine these embeddings by exploiting the intrinsic geometry of the data,
thereby enhancing the overall image clustering performance. Overall, we
establish new State-of-the-Art results on single-modal clustering and Novel
Class Discovery on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet-100, and Tiny ImageNet. We do
so, both when the number of clusters is known or unknown ahead of time. The

*Raja Mallina,Bryar Shareef*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: XBusNet是一种双提示双分支多模态模型，结合全局语义和局部边界精确性，通过自动生成的临床文本提示来提高乳腺超声分割的准确性，尤其在小痕痕和低对比度痕痕上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床上需要准确的乳腺超声分割来支持可靠测量和定量分析，但小痕痕、低对比度痕痕以及超声杂音使得分割困难。文本提示能提供临床上下文，但直接应用弱定位的文本-图像线索往往只能产生粗糕的分割结果。

Method: 提出XBusNet模型，采用双提示双分支设计：一个基于CLIP Vision Transformer的全局通路编码整体图像语义，另一个局部U-Net通路重点关注精确边界。通过自动从结构化元数据生成描述形状、边缘和BI-RADS分级的文本提示。

Result: 在BLU数据集上达到最佳性能，平均Dice系数为0.8765，IoU为0.8149，超过6个强基线模型。小痕痕分割收益最大，缺失区域和假正激活更少。分解实验证明了全局上下文、局部边界建模和提示调制的补充作用。

Conclusion: 结合全局语义与局部精确性的双提示双分支多模态设计能够产生准确的乳腺超声分割掩码，显著提高小痕痕和低对比度痕痕的分割稳健性。

Abstract: Background: Precise breast ultrasound (BUS) segmentation supports reliable
measurement, quantitative analysis, and downstream classification, yet remains
difficult for small or low-contrast lesions with fuzzy margins and speckle
noise. Text prompts can add clinical context, but directly applying weakly
localized text-image cues (e.g., CAM/CLIP-derived signals) tends to produce
coarse, blob-like responses that smear boundaries unless additional mechanisms
recover fine edges. Methods: We propose XBusNet, a novel dual-prompt,
dual-branch multimodal model that combines image features with clinically
grounded text. A global pathway based on a CLIP Vision Transformer encodes
whole-image semantics conditioned on lesion size and location, while a local
U-Net pathway emphasizes precise boundaries and is modulated by prompts that
describe shape, margin, and Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS)
terms. Prompts are assembled automatically from structured metadata, requiring
no manual clicks. We evaluate on the Breast Lesions USG (BLU) dataset using
five-fold cross-validation. Primary metrics are Dice and Intersection over
Union (IoU); we also conduct size-stratified analyses and ablations to assess
the roles of the global and local paths and the text-driven modulation.
Results: XBusNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on BLU, with mean Dice
of 0.8765 and IoU of 0.8149, outperforming six strong baselines. Small lesions
show the largest gains, with fewer missed regions and fewer spurious
activations. Ablation studies show complementary contributions of global
context, local boundary modeling, and prompt-based modulation. Conclusions: A
dual-prompt, dual-branch multimodal design that merges global semantics with
local precision yields accurate BUS segmentation masks and improves robustness
for small, low-contrast lesions.

Conclusion: 高级生成模型与可解释特征的协同作用能够构建高准确的医学诊断工具

Abstract: Data scarcity hinders deep learning for medical imaging. We propose a
framework for breast cancer classification in thermograms that addresses this
using a Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DPM) for data augmentation. Our
DPM-based augmentation is shown to be superior to both traditional methods and
a ProGAN baseline. The framework fuses deep features from a pre-trained
ResNet-50 with handcrafted nonlinear features (e.g., Fractal Dimension) derived
from U-Net segmented tumors. An XGBoost classifier trained on these fused
features achieves 98.0\% accuracy and 98.1\% sensitivity. Ablation studies and
statistical tests confirm that both the DPM augmentation and the nonlinear
feature fusion are critical, statistically significant components of this
success. This work validates the synergy between advanced generative models and
interpretable features for creating highly accurate medical diagnostic tools.

Motivation: 传统多模态模型训练依赖图像-文本对，但文本标注通常稀疏且缺乏细粒度视觉细节，导致理解和生成能力不匹配

Method: 使用视觉理解编码器嵌入作为密集文本提示，通过自监督重建损失优化模型重构输入图像，实现理解和生成的对齐

Result: 仅用27 GPU小时，在GenEval(0.73→0.90)和DPGBench(80.93→88.15)上显著提升生成性能，编辑基准也有改善(ImgEdit 3.38→3.75, GEdit 6.94→7.25)，超越更大开源模型

Conclusion: RecA是一种高效通用的后训练对齐策略，适用于各种多模态架构，能有效提升视觉生成和编辑的保真度

Abstract: Unified multimodal models (UMMs) unify visual understanding and generation
within a single architecture. However, conventional training relies on
image-text pairs (or sequences) whose captions are typically sparse and miss
fine-grained visual details--even when they use hundreds of words to describe a
simple image. We introduce Reconstruction Alignment (RecA), a
resource-efficient post-training method that leverages visual understanding
encoder embeddings as dense "text prompts," providing rich supervision without
captions. Concretely, RecA conditions a UMM on its own visual understanding
embeddings and optimizes it to reconstruct the input image with a
self-supervised reconstruction loss, thereby realigning understanding and
generation. Despite its simplicity, RecA is broadly applicable: across
autoregressive, masked-autoregressive, and diffusion-based UMMs, it
consistently improves generation and editing fidelity. With only 27 GPU-hours,
post-training with RecA substantially improves image generation performance on
GenEval (0.73$\rightarrow$0.90) and DPGBench (80.93$\rightarrow$88.15), while
also boosting editing benchmarks (ImgEdit 3.38$\rightarrow$3.75, GEdit
6.94$\rightarrow$7.25). Notably, RecA surpasses much larger open-source models
and applies broadly across diverse UMM architectures, establishing it as an
efficient and general post-training alignment strategy for UMMs

Motivation: 解决无人机多光谱目标检测面临的三个挑战：低光照图像降低多模态融合互补性、局部小目标建模受冗余信息干扰、基于Transformer的方法计算复杂度高难以在无人机平台应用

Method: 设计双域增强模块(DDE)包含跨尺度小波Mamba(CSWM)和傅里叶细节恢复块(FDR)来增强低光照图像，以及优先级引导Mamba融合模块(PGMF)通过优先级扫描增强局部目标建模

Result: 在DroneVehicle和VEDAI数据集上，DEPF在目标检测方面表现优于最先进方法

Conclusion: 基于Mamba线性复杂度的DEPF方法有效解决了无人机多光谱目标检测的关键挑战，在低光照增强和局部目标建模方面表现出色

Abstract: Multispectral remote sensing object detection is one of the important
application of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). However, it faces three
challenges. Firstly, the low-light remote sensing images reduce the
complementarity during multi-modality fusion. Secondly, the local small target
modeling is interfered with redundant information in the fusion stage easily.
Thirdly, due to the quadratic computational complexity, it is hard to apply the
transformer-based methods on the UAV platform. To address these limitations,
motivated by Mamba with linear complexity, a UAV multispectral object detector
with dual-domain enhancement and priority-guided mamba fusion (DEPF) is
proposed. Firstly, to enhance low-light remote sensing images, Dual-Domain
Enhancement Module (DDE) is designed, which contains Cross-Scale Wavelet Mamba
(CSWM) and Fourier Details Recovery block (FDR). CSWM applies cross-scale mamba
scanning for the low-frequency components to enhance the global brightness of
images, while FDR constructs spectrum recovery network to enhance the frequency
spectra features for recovering the texture-details. Secondly, to enhance local
target modeling and reduce the impact of redundant information during fusion,
Priority-Guided Mamba Fusion Module (PGMF) is designed. PGMF introduces the
concept of priority scanning, which starts from local targets features
according to the priority scores obtained from modality difference. Experiments
on DroneVehicle dataset and VEDAI dataset reports that, DEPF performs well on
object detection, comparing with state-of-the-art methods. Our code is
available in the supplementary material.

Result: 在NTU RGB+D、NTU RGB+D 120和NW-UCLA基准测试上广泛实验表明，G$^{3}$CN显著提升了动作识别性能，特别是在模糊样本上效果明显

Conclusion: G$^{3}$CN通过拓扑图精炼和门控信息传播机制，有效解决了骨架动作识别中的模糊动作区分问题，具有很好的泛化能力

Abstract: Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have proven to be highly effective for
skeleton-based action recognition, primarily due to their ability to leverage
graph topology for feature aggregation, a key factor in extracting meaningful
representations. However, despite their success, GCNs often struggle to
effectively distinguish between ambiguous actions, revealing limitations in the
representation of learned topological and spatial features. To address this
challenge, we propose a novel approach, Gaussian Topology Refinement Gated
Graph Convolution (G$^{3}$CN), to address the challenge of distinguishing
ambiguous actions in skeleton-based action recognition. G$^{3}$CN incorporates
a Gaussian filter to refine the skeleton topology graph, improving the
representation of ambiguous actions. Additionally, Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs)
are integrated into the GCN framework to enhance information propagation
between skeleton points. Our method shows strong generalization across various
GCN backbones. Extensive experiments on NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120, and NW-UCLA
benchmarks demonstrate that G$^{3}$CN effectively improves action recognition,
particularly for ambiguous samples.

Motivation: 现有解析图方法主要关注单模态建模，忽略了多模态融合的潜力。语言提供了丰富的空间关系先验，但现有的视觉-语言全局特征融合方法会削弱遮挡区域响应并导致对齐和定位失败

Method: 提出PGVL模型，包含引导模块(GM)，低层节点关注局部特征保持遮挡区域响应，高层节点整合全局特征推断遮挡部分。采用自上而下分解和自下而上组合，构建模态特定解析图，使用递归双向交叉注意力并通过GM进行净化

Result: 在主要姿态估计数据集上验证了PGVL和相应网络的有效性

Conclusion: PGVL通过创新的引导模块实现了有效的多模态信息融合，特别适用于处理遮挡场景下的人体姿态估计问题

Abstract: Parse graphs boost human pose estimation (HPE) by integrating context and
hierarchies, yet prior work mostly focuses on single modality modeling,
ignoring the potential of multimodal fusion. Notably, language offers rich HPE
priors like spatial relations for occluded scenes, but existing visual-language
fusion via global feature integration weakens occluded region responses and
causes alignment and location failures. To address this issue, we propose Parse
Graph-based Visual-Language interaction (PGVL) with a core novel Guided Module
(GM). In PGVL, low-level nodes focus on local features, maximizing the
maintenance of responses in occluded areas and high-level nodes integrate
global features to infer occluded or invisible parts. GM enables high semantic
nodes to guide the feature update of low semantic nodes that have undergone
cross attention. It ensuring effective fusion of diverse information. PGVL
includes top-down decomposition and bottom-up composition. In the first stage,
modality specific parse graphs are constructed. Next stage. recursive
bidirectional cross-attention is used, purified by GM. We also design network
based on PGVL. The PGVL and our network is validated on major pose estimation

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LGAA是一个轻量级高斯资产适配器框架，通过利用多视角扩散先验，实现了端到端的PBR材质3D资产生成，统一了几何和材质的建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3D生成方法主要关注几何建模，将纹理烘焙为简单的顶点颜色或将纹理合成留给后处理的图像扩散模型，缺乏端到端的PBR就绪3D资产生成能力。

Method: 采用模块化设计：LGAA Wrapper重用多视角扩散模型网络层；LGAA Switcher对齐多个封装不同知识的Wrapper层；LGAA Decoder预测带PBR通道的2D高斯泼溅；专用后处理程序从2DGS提取高质量可重光照网格资产。

Result: 广泛的定量和定性实验表明LGAA在文本和图像条件多视角扩散模型中表现优异，模块化设计支持灵活整合多个扩散先验，知识保留方案仅需69k多视角实例即可高效收敛。

Conclusion: LGAA框架成功实现了端到端的PBR就绪3D资产生成，统一了几何和材质建模，具有优异的性能和高效的训练收敛特性。

Abstract: The labor- and experience-intensive creation of 3D assets with physically
based rendering (PBR) materials demands an autonomous 3D asset creation
pipeline. However, most existing 3D generation methods focus on geometry
modeling, either baking textures into simple vertex colors or leaving texture
synthesis to post-processing with image diffusion models. To achieve end-to-end
PBR-ready 3D asset generation, we present Lightweight Gaussian Asset Adapter
(LGAA), a novel framework that unifies the modeling of geometry and PBR
materials by exploiting multi-view (MV) diffusion priors from a novel
perspective. The LGAA features a modular design with three components.
Specifically, the LGAA Wrapper reuses and adapts network layers from MV
diffusion models, which encapsulate knowledge acquired from billions of images,
enabling better convergence in a data-efficient manner. To incorporate multiple
diffusion priors for geometry and PBR synthesis, the LGAA Switcher aligns
multiple LGAA Wrapper layers encapsulating different knowledge. Then, a tamed
variational autoencoder (VAE), termed LGAA Decoder, is designed to predict 2D
Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) with PBR channels. Finally, we introduce a dedicated
post-processing procedure to effectively extract high-quality, relightable mesh
assets from the resulting 2DGS. Extensive quantitative and qualitative
experiments demonstrate the superior performance of LGAA with both text-and
image-conditioned MV diffusion models. Additionally, the modular design enables
flexible incorporation of multiple diffusion priors, and the
knowledge-preserving scheme leads to efficient convergence trained on merely
69k multi-view instances. Our code, pre-trained weights, and the dataset used
will be publicly available via our project page:

*Taiying Peng,Jiacheng Hua,Miao Liu,Feng Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了EgoGazeVQA基准测试，利用注视信息提升多模态大语言模型在自我中心视频问答中的表现，通过注视引导的意图提示方法显著改善了用户意图理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试忽视了注视作为用户意图指示器的重要作用，自我中心视频通过统一坐标系捕捉用户焦点、动作和上下文，为个性化AI体验提供了机会。

Method: 构建了基于注视的问答对数据集，采用注视引导的意图提示方法整合空间、时间和意图相关线索，并进行注视相关的微调实验。

Result: 现有MLLMs难以准确解释用户意图，而注视引导方法显著提升了性能，注视估计准确性影响提示效果。

Conclusion: 注视信息对于在自我中心环境中实现更个性化和有效的AI助手具有重要价值。

Abstract: The emergence of advanced multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has
significantly enhanced AI assistants' ability to process complex information
across modalities. Recently, egocentric videos, by directly capturing user
focus, actions, and context in an unified coordinate, offer an exciting
opportunity to enable proactive and personalized AI user experiences with
MLLMs. However, existing benchmarks overlook the crucial role of gaze as an
indicator of user intent. To address this gap, we introduce EgoGazeVQA, an
egocentric gaze-guided video question answering benchmark that leverages gaze
information to improve the understanding of longer daily-life videos.
EgoGazeVQA consists of gaze-based QA pairs generated by MLLMs and refined by
human annotators. Our experiments reveal that existing MLLMs struggle to
accurately interpret user intentions. In contrast, our gaze-guided intent
prompting methods significantly enhance performance by integrating spatial,
temporal, and intent-related cues. We further conduct experiments on
gaze-related fine-tuning and analyze how gaze estimation accuracy impacts
prompting effectiveness. These results underscore the value of gaze for more
personalized and effective AI assistants in egocentric settings.

Conclusion: GLEAM框架将准确的多视角匹配与可解释推理相结合，通过让模型能够解释和匹配，推动了地理定位技术的发展。

Abstract: Cross-View Geo-Localization (CVGL) focuses on identifying correspondences
between images captured from distinct perspectives of the same geographical
location. However, existing CVGL approaches are typically restricted to a
single view or modality, and their direct visual matching strategy lacks
interpretability: they merely predict whether two images correspond, without
explaining the rationale behind the match. In this paper, we present GLEAM-C, a
foundational CVGL model that unifies multiple views and modalities-including
UAV imagery, street maps, panoramic views, and ground photographs-by aligning
them exclusively with satellite imagery. Our framework enhances training
efficiency through optimized implementation while achieving accuracy comparable
to prior modality-specific CVGL models through a two-phase training strategy.
Moreover, to address the lack of interpretability in traditional CVGL methods,
we leverage the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) to propose a new task, GLEAM-X, which combines cross-view
correspondence prediction with explainable reasoning. To support this task, we
construct a bilingual benchmark using GPT-4o and Doubao-1.5-Thinking-Vision-Pro
to generate training and testing data. The test set is further refined through
detailed human revision, enabling systematic evaluation of explainable
cross-view reasoning and advancing transparency and scalability in
geo-localization. Together, GLEAM-C and GLEAM-X form a comprehensive CVGL
pipeline that integrates multi-modal, multi-view alignment with interpretable
correspondence analysis, unifying accurate cross-view matching with explainable
reasoning and advancing Geo-Localization by enabling models to better Explain
And Match. Code and datasets used in this work will be made publicly accessible

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: XOCT是一个深度学习框架，通过交叉维度监督和多尺度特征融合，实现从OCT到OCTA的层感知血管重建，显著提升视网膜血管图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统OCTA图像获取困难且成本高，现有深度学习方法忽略视网膜层间血管差异，难以重建诊断所需的精细血管细节。

Method: 提出交叉维度监督模块利用2D分层投影作为监督信号，结合多尺度特征融合模块通过通道重加权策略增强血管轮廓提取。

Result: 在OCTA-500数据集上验证，XOCT在临床评估关键的分层投影方面表现优异，显著提升血管重建质量。

Conclusion: XOCT框架提高了OCTA的可及性、可靠性和诊断价值，有望增强眼科疾病的检测和监测能力。

Abstract: Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCTA) and its derived en-face
projections provide high-resolution visualization of the retinal and choroidal
vasculature, which is critical for the rapid and accurate diagnosis of retinal
diseases. However, acquiring high-quality OCTA images is challenging due to
motion sensitivity and the high costs associated with software modifications
for conventional OCT devices. Moreover, current deep learning methods for
OCT-to-OCTA translation often overlook the vascular differences across retinal
layers and struggle to reconstruct the intricate, dense vascular details
necessary for reliable diagnosis. To overcome these limitations, we propose
XOCT, a novel deep learning framework that integrates Cross-Dimensional
Supervision (CDS) with a Multi-Scale Feature Fusion (MSFF) network for
layer-aware vascular reconstruction. Our CDS module leverages 2D layer-wise
en-face projections, generated via segmentation-weighted z-axis averaging, as
supervisory signals to compel the network to learn distinct representations for
each retinal layer through fine-grained, targeted guidance. Meanwhile, the MSFF
module enhances vessel delineation through multi-scale feature extraction
combined with a channel reweighting strategy, effectively capturing vascular
details at multiple spatial scales. Our experiments on the OCTA-500 dataset
demonstrate XOCT's improvements, especially for the en-face projections which
are significant for clinical evaluation of retinal pathologies, underscoring
its potential to enhance OCTA accessibility, reliability, and diagnostic value
for ophthalmic disease detection and monitoring. The code is available at

*Sai Siddhartha Chary Aylapuram,Veeraraju Elluru,Shivang Agarwal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于机器遗忘技术的偏置缓解方法，通过选择性移除训练数据中的偏置样本或特征表示来提升视觉模型的公平性，在多个基准数据集上取得了显著效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络容易依赖训练数据中的虚假相关性，导致在医疗和自动驾驶等安全关键领域产生有偏或不公平的预测。传统偏置缓解方法需要从头重新训练或重新设计数据管道，而机器遗忘技术提供了一种后处理的替代方案。

Method: 基于隐私保护遗忘技术，评估了多种策略包括梯度上升、LoRA和师生蒸馏方法，在CUB-200-2011（姿态偏置）、CIFAR-10（合成补丁偏置）和CelebA（微笑检测中的性别偏置）三个基准数据集上进行实证分析。

Result: 后处理遗忘方法显著减少了子群体差异，在CUB-200上人口统计公平性提升94.86%，CIFAR-10上提升30.28%，CelebA上提升97.37%，同时保持了最小的准确率损失，在效用、公平性、质量和隐私的联合评估中平均得分0.62。

Conclusion: 机器遗忘技术为增强已部署视觉系统的公平性提供了一个实用框架，无需进行完整的重新训练。

Abstract: Deep neural networks often rely on spurious correlations in training data,
leading to biased or unfair predictions in safety-critical domains such as
medicine and autonomous driving. While conventional bias mitigation typically
requires retraining from scratch or redesigning data pipelines, recent advances
in machine unlearning provide a promising alternative for post-hoc model
correction. In this work, we investigate \textit{Bias-Aware Machine
Unlearning}, a paradigm that selectively removes biased samples or feature
representations to mitigate diverse forms of bias in vision models. Building on
privacy-preserving unlearning techniques, we evaluate various strategies
including Gradient Ascent, LoRA, and Teacher-Student distillation. Through
empirical analysis on three benchmark datasets, CUB-200-2011 (pose bias),
CIFAR-10 (synthetic patch bias), and CelebA (gender bias in smile detection),
we demonstrate that post-hoc unlearning can substantially reduce subgroup
disparities, with improvements in demographic parity of up to \textbf{94.86\%}
on CUB-200, \textbf{30.28\%} on CIFAR-10, and \textbf{97.37\%} on CelebA. These
gains are achieved with minimal accuracy loss and with methods scoring an
average of 0.62 across the 3 settings on the joint evaluation of utility,
fairness, quality, and privacy. Our findings establish machine unlearning as a
practical framework for enhancing fairness in deployed vision systems without
necessitating full retraining.

China. Using the style transfer method, we introduced Swin Transformer to
extract global features through attention mechanisms, converting the carbon
stock estimation into an image translation.

Abstract: Despite the rapid advancements in video generation technology, creating
high-quality videos that precisely align with user intentions remains a
significant challenge. Existing methods often fail to achieve fine-grained
control over video details, limiting their practical applicability. We
introduce ANYPORTAL, a novel zero-shot framework for video background
replacement that leverages pre-trained diffusion models. Our framework
collaboratively integrates the temporal prior of video diffusion models with
the relighting capabilities of image diffusion models in a zero-shot setting.
To address the critical challenge of foreground consistency, we propose a
Refinement Projection Algorithm, which enables pixel-level detail manipulation
to ensure precise foreground preservation. ANYPORTAL is training-free and
overcomes the challenges of achieving foreground consistency and temporally
coherent relighting. Experimental results demonstrate that ANYPORTAL achieves
high-quality results on consumer-grade GPUs, offering a practical and efficient
solution for video content creation and editing.

Abstract: Deep neural networks excel in radiological image classification but
frequently suffer from poor interpretability, limiting clinical acceptance. We
present MedicalPatchNet, an inherently self-explainable architecture for chest
X-ray classification that transparently attributes decisions to distinct image
regions. MedicalPatchNet splits images into non-overlapping patches,
independently classifies each patch, and aggregates predictions, enabling
intuitive visualization of each patch's diagnostic contribution without
post-hoc techniques. Trained on the CheXpert dataset (223,414 images),
MedicalPatchNet matches the classification performance (AUROC 0.907 vs. 0.908)
of EfficientNet-B0, while substantially improving interpretability:
MedicalPatchNet demonstrates substantially improved interpretability with
higher pathology localization accuracy (mean hit-rate 0.485 vs. 0.376 with
Grad-CAM) on the CheXlocalize dataset. By providing explicit, reliable
explanations accessible even to non-AI experts, MedicalPatchNet mitigates risks
associated with shortcut learning, thus improving clinical trust. Our model is

Result: 实验结果验证了方法的有效性，能够生成生动自然的向量图形动画，在灵活性和动画质量方面显著改进现有技术

Conclusion: 该方法成功地给合了隐式神经表示和沉硅模型，为向量图形动画提供了一种高效的自动化解决方案

Abstract: Vector graphics, known for their scalability and user-friendliness, provide a
unique approach to visual content compared to traditional pixel-based images.
Animation of these graphics, driven by the motion of their elements, offers
enhanced comprehensibility and controllability but often requires substantial
manual effort. To automate this process, we propose a novel method that
integrates implicit neural representations with text-to-video diffusion models
for vector graphic animation. Our approach employs layered implicit neural
representations to reconstruct vector graphics, preserving their inherent
properties such as infinite resolution and precise color and shape constraints,
which effectively bridges the large domain gap between vector graphics and
diffusion models. The neural representations are then optimized using video
score distillation sampling, which leverages motion priors from pretrained
text-to-video diffusion models. Finally, the vector graphics are warped to
match the representations resulting in smooth animation. Experimental results
validate the effectiveness of our method in generating vivid and natural vector
graphic animations, demonstrating significant improvement over existing
techniques that suffer from limitations in flexibility and animation quality.

Abstract: We address vision-language-driven indoor navigation to assist visually
impaired individuals in reaching a target location using images and natural

to the lack of precise location data. Our approach integrates vision and

accessibility and independence. We fine-tune the BLIP-2 model with Low Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) on a manually annotated indoor navigation dataset. We propose
an evaluation metric that refines the BERT F1 score by emphasizing directional

Motivation: 3D高斯溅射在渲染方面效果出色，但由于表示的非结构化和缺乏显式几何监督，难以实现准确完整的表面重建

Method: 为每个高斯关联可学习的SDF值，设计几何引导的网格增长策略，在多尺度层次下自适应分布高斯

Result: 在DTU、Mip-NeRF 360和Tanks&Temples等标准基准测试中，DiGS持续提高了重建精度和完整性

Conclusion: DiGS成功地将SDF学习与3DGS结合，在保持高渲染保真度的同时显著改善了表面重建质量

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for
photorealistic view synthesis, representing scenes with spatially distributed
Gaussian primitives. While highly effective for rendering, achieving accurate
and complete surface reconstruction remains challenging due to the unstructured
nature of the representation and the absence of explicit geometric supervision.
In this work, we propose DiGS, a unified framework that embeds Signed Distance
Field (SDF) learning directly into the 3DGS pipeline, thereby enforcing strong
and interpretable surface priors. By associating each Gaussian with a learnable
SDF value, DiGS explicitly aligns primitives with underlying geometry and
improves cross-view consistency. To further ensure dense and coherent coverage,
we design a geometry-guided grid growth strategy that adaptively distributes
Gaussians along geometry-consistent regions under a multi-scale hierarchy.
Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks, including DTU, Mip-NeRF 360, and
Tanks& Temples, demonstrate that DiGS consistently improves reconstruction
accuracy and completeness while retaining high rendering fidelity.

Motivation: 深度神经网络在遥感应用中容易受到对抗攻击，现有混合策略可能破坏全局语义特征并导致梯度消失问题

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了现有对抗攻击方法的局限性，显著提升了对抗样本的迁移性和攻击效果

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, posing
significant security threats to their deployment in remote sensing
applications. Research on adversarial attacks not only reveals model
vulnerabilities but also provides critical insights for enhancing robustness.
Although current mixing-based strategies have been proposed to increase the
transferability of adversarial examples, they either perform global blending or
directly exchange a region in the images, which may destroy global semantic
features and mislead the optimization of adversarial examples. Furthermore,
their reliance on cross-entropy loss for perturbation optimization leads to
gradient diminishing during iterative updates, compromising adversarial example
quality. To address these limitations, we focus on non-targeted attacks and
propose a novel framework via local mixing and logits optimization. First, we
present a local mixing strategy to generate diverse yet semantically consistent
inputs. Different from MixUp, which globally blends two images, and MixCut,
which stitches images together, our method merely blends local regions to
preserve global semantic information. Second, we adapt the logit loss from
targeted attacks to non-targeted scenarios, mitigating the gradient vanishing
problem of cross-entropy loss. Third, a perturbation smoothing loss is applied
to suppress high-frequency noise and enhance transferability. Extensive
experiments on FGSCR-42 and MTARSI datasets demonstrate superior performance
over 12 state-of-the-art methods across 6 surrogate models. Notably, with
ResNet as the surrogate on MTARSI, our method achieves a 17.28% average
improvement in black-box attack success rate.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D数据标注成本高昂，而仅依赖2D框标注存在投影模糊性和部分可见性问题，需要开发更有效的弱监督方法

Method: 提出MVAT框架：1）跨时间聚合目标点云构建完整3D表示；2）采用师生蒸馏范式，教师网络从单视图学习但目标来自时间聚合的静态目标；3）使用多视图2D投影损失确保3D框与所有可用2D标注的一致性

Conclusion: MVAT证明了利用时序多视图信息可以有效解决弱监督3D检测中的投影模糊性问题，无需任何3D框标注即可实现接近全监督的性能

Abstract: Annotating 3D data remains a costly bottleneck for 3D object detection,
motivating the development of weakly supervised annotation methods that rely on
more accessible 2D box annotations. However, relying solely on 2D boxes
introduces projection ambiguities since a single 2D box can correspond to
multiple valid 3D poses. Furthermore, partial object visibility under a single
viewpoint setting makes accurate 3D box estimation difficult. We propose MVAT,
a novel framework that leverages temporal multi-view present in sequential data
to address these challenges. Our approach aggregates object-centric point
clouds across time to build 3D object representations as dense and complete as
possible. A Teacher-Student distillation paradigm is employed: The Teacher
network learns from single viewpoints but targets are derived from temporally
aggregated static objects. Then the Teacher generates high quality
pseudo-labels that the Student learns to predict from a single viewpoint for
both static and moving objects. The whole framework incorporates a multi-view
2D projection loss to enforce consistency between predicted 3D boxes and all
available 2D annotations. Experiments on the nuScenes and Waymo Open datasets
demonstrate that MVAT achieves state-of-the-art performance for weakly
supervised 3D object detection, significantly narrowing the gap with fully
supervised methods without requiring any 3D box annotations. % \footnote{Code

Conclusion: EHWGesture可以作为推进多模态临床手势理解的综合基准数据集。

Abstract: Hand gesture understanding is essential for several applications in
human-computer interaction, including automatic clinical assessment of hand
dexterity. While deep learning has advanced static gesture recognition, dynamic
gesture understanding remains challenging due to complex spatiotemporal
variations. Moreover, existing datasets often lack multimodal and multi-view
diversity, precise ground-truth tracking, and an action quality component
embedded within gestures. This paper introduces EHWGesture, a multimodal video
dataset for gesture understanding featuring five clinically relevant gestures.
It includes over 1,100 recordings (6 hours), captured from 25 healthy subjects
using two high-resolution RGB-Depth cameras and an event camera. A motion
capture system provides precise ground-truth hand landmark tracking, and all
devices are spatially calibrated and synchronized to ensure cross-modal
alignment. Moreover, to embed an action quality task within gesture
understanding, collected recordings are organized in classes of execution speed
that mirror clinical evaluations of hand dexterity. Baseline experiments
highlight the dataset's potential for gesture classification, gesture trigger
detection, and action quality assessment. Thus, EHWGesture can serve as a
comprehensive benchmark for advancing multimodal clinical gesture
understanding.

TL;DR: UFC是一个通用的少样本控制适配器，能够通过少量样本快速适应新的空间控制任务，在多种扩散模型架构上实现细粒度控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的控制适配器在面对与训练任务差异较大的新空间控制条件时，适应性有限且训练成本高，需要一种能够快速适应新任务的通用解决方案。

Method: 提出UFC方法，通过查询条件和支持条件之间的类比来构建任务特定的控制特征，使用匹配机制和少量任务特定参数的更新来实现泛化。

Result: 在6个新空间控制任务上，仅用30个标注样本进行微调就能实现与空间条件一致的细粒度控制，使用0.1%的全训练数据即可达到与全监督基线竞争的性能。

Conclusion: UFC是一个通用且高效的少样本控制适配器，能够快速适应各种新的空间控制任务，适用于不同的扩散模型架构，具有很好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Spatial conditioning in pretrained text-to-image diffusion models has
significantly improved fine-grained control over the structure of generated
images. However, existing control adapters exhibit limited adaptability and
incur high training costs when encountering novel spatial control conditions
that differ substantially from the training tasks. To address this limitation,
we propose Universal Few-Shot Control (UFC), a versatile few-shot control
adapter capable of generalizing to novel spatial conditions. Given a few
image-condition pairs of an unseen task and a query condition, UFC leverages
the analogy between query and support conditions to construct task-specific
control features, instantiated by a matching mechanism and an update on a small
set of task-specific parameters. Experiments on six novel spatial control tasks
show that UFC, fine-tuned with only 30 annotated examples of novel tasks,
achieves fine-grained control consistent with the spatial conditions. Notably,
when fine-tuned with 0.1% of the full training data, UFC achieves competitive
performance with the fully supervised baselines in various control tasks. We
also show that UFC is applicable agnostically to various diffusion backbones
and demonstrate its effectiveness on both UNet and DiT architectures. Code is

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于HU值的医学图像前景掩码策略，替代传统的随机掩码方法，在3D医学图像分割任务中显著提升了性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的随机掩码方法在3D医学图像建模中忽视了解剖对象的密度特征，无法有效利用医学图像中具有诊断意义的组织区域。

Method: 利用Hounsfield Unit (HU)测量值实现基于HU的前景掩码，专注于内脏器官的强度分布，排除空气和液体等非组织区域。

Result: 在五个公开3D医学影像数据集上验证，分割质量和Dice得分均有显著提升（BTCV:84.64%, Flare22:92.43%, MM-WHS:90.67%, Amos22:88.64%, BraTS:78.55%）。

Conclusion: 基于领域特性的掩码图像建模对医学图像表示学习具有重要意义，为医学图像分割提供了有前景的研究方向。

Abstract: While Masked Image Modeling (MIM) has revolutionized fields of computer
vision, its adoption in 3D medical image computing has been limited by the use
of random masking, which overlooks the density of anatomical objects. To
address this limitation, we enhance the pretext task with a simple yet
effective masking strategy. Leveraging Hounsfield Unit (HU) measurements, we
implement an HU-based Foreground Masking, which focuses on the intensity
distribution of visceral organs and excludes non-tissue regions, such as air
and fluid, that lack diagnostically meaningful features. Extensive experiments
on five public 3D medical imaging datasets demonstrate that our masking
consistently improves performance, both in quality of segmentation and Dice
score (BTCV:~84.64\%, Flare22:~92.43\%, MM-WHS:~90.67\%, Amos22:~88.64\%,
BraTS:~78.55\%). These results underscore the importance of domain-centric MIM
and suggest a promising direction for representation learning in medical image
segmentation. Implementation is available at github.com/AISeedHub/SubFore/.

Abstract: Document images encapsulate a wealth of knowledge, while the portability of
spoken queries enables broader and flexible application scenarios. Yet, no
prior work has explored knowledge base question answering over visual document
images with queries provided directly in speech. We propose TextlessRAG, the
first end-to-end framework for speech-based question answering over large-scale
document images. Unlike prior methods, TextlessRAG eliminates ASR, TTS and OCR,
directly interpreting speech, retrieving relevant visual knowledge, and
generating answers in a fully textless pipeline. To further boost performance,
we integrate a layout-aware reranking mechanism to refine retrieval.
Experiments demonstrate substantial improvements in both efficiency and
accuracy. To advance research in this direction, we also release the first
bilingual speech--document RAG dataset, featuring Chinese and English voice
queries paired with multimodal document content. Both the dataset and our
pipeline will be made available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决以往方法依赖耗时的GAN逆向和测试时优化问题，并缓解缺乏大规模3D头部数据集的挑战

Method: 使用大规模合成数据集训练，采用由粗到细的高斯头部生成流水线，通过双分支框架聚合结构化球面三平面特征和非结构化点基特征

Result: 实验结果显示该框架在效率和效果方面都超过现有方法

Conclusion: 该前向传播框架能够高效地从单张无姿态图片重建高质量的高斯全头部模型，为快速3D头部重建提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: We present a feed-forward framework for Gaussian full-head synthesis from a
single unposed image. Unlike previous work that relies on time-consuming GAN
inversion and test-time optimization, our framework can reconstruct the
Gaussian full-head model given a single unposed image in a single forward pass.
This enables fast reconstruction and rendering during inference. To mitigate
the lack of large-scale 3D head assets, we propose a large-scale synthetic
dataset from trained 3D GANs and train our framework using only synthetic data.
For efficient high-fidelity generation, we introduce a coarse-to-fine Gaussian
head generation pipeline, where sparse points from the FLAME model interact
with the image features by transformer blocks for feature extraction and coarse
shape reconstruction, which are then densified for high-fidelity
reconstruction. To fully leverage the prior knowledge residing in pretrained 3D
GANs for effective reconstruction, we propose a dual-branch framework that
effectively aggregates the structured spherical triplane feature and
unstructured point-based features for more effective Gaussian head
reconstruction. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our framework
towards existing work.

Motivation: 深度学习模型的黑盒特性很难在高风险应用中得到采纳，需要可解释性来增强信任和可负责性。

Method: 设计了Class Node Graph Attention Network (CGAT)架构，使用图注意卷积和注意机制，通过attention rollout可视化决策过程，并测试了不同节点特征和模型深度。

Result: 结合局部平均曲率咈到质心距离的节点特征获得0.76的加权F1分数，产生更直观的注意图和更好的分类性能。

Conclusion: CGAT能够生成人类可理解的注意图，提高了模型的可信质性，虽然基于牙科数据开发，但通用于各种图基分类和回归任务。

Abstract: Deep learning offers a promising avenue for automating many recognition tasks
in fields such as medicine and forensics. However, the black-box nature of
these models hinders their adoption in high-stakes applications where trust and
accountability are required. For 3D shape recognition tasks in particular, this
paper introduces the Class Node Graph Attention Network (CGAT) architecture to
address this need. Applied to 3D meshes of third molars derived from CBCT
images, for Demirjian stage allocation, CGAT utilizes graph attention
convolutions and an inherent attention mechanism, visualized via attention
rollout, to explain its decision-making process. We evaluated the local mean
curvature and distance to centroid node features, both individually and in
combination, as well as model depth, finding that models incorporating directed
edges to a global CLS node produced more intuitive attention maps, while also
yielding desirable classification performance. We analyzed the attention-based
explanations of the models, and their predictive performances to propose
optimal settings for the CGAT. The combination of local mean curvature and
distance to centroid as node features yielded a slight performance increase
with 0.76 weighted F1 score, and more comprehensive attention visualizations.
The CGAT architecture's ability to generate human-understandable attention maps
can enhance trust and facilitate expert validation of model decisions. While
demonstrated on dental data, CGAT is broadly applicable to graph-based
classification and regression tasks, promoting wider adoption of transparent
and competitive deep learning models in high-stakes environments.

Abstract: Visual reasoning over structured data such as tables is a critical capability
for modern vision-language models (VLMs), yet current benchmarks remain limited
in scale, diversity, or reasoning depth, especially when it comes to rendered
table images. Addressing this gap, we introduce Visual-TableQA, a large-scale,
open-domain multimodal dataset specifically designed to evaluate and enhance
visual reasoning over complex tabular data. Our generation pipeline is modular,
scalable, and fully autonomous, involving multiple reasoning LLMs collaborating
across distinct roles: generation, validation, and inspiration. Visual-TableQA
comprises 2.5k richly structured LaTeX-rendered tables and 6k
reasoning-intensive QA pairs, all produced at a cost of under USD 100. To
promote diversity and creativity, our pipeline performs multi-model
collaborative data generation via cross-model prompting ('inspiration') and
LLM-jury filtering. Stronger models seed layouts and topics that weaker models
elaborate, collectively distilling diverse reasoning patterns and visual
structures into the dataset. Empirical results show that models fine-tuned on
Visual-TableQA generalize robustly to external benchmarks, outperforming
several proprietary models despite the dataset's synthetic nature. The full
pipeline and resources are publicly available at

Abstract: Temporal image forensics is the science of estimating the age of a digital
image. Usually, time-dependent traces (age traces) introduced by the image
acquisition pipeline are exploited for this purpose. In this review, a
comprehensive overview of the field of temporal image forensics based on
time-dependent traces from the image acquisition pipeline is given. This
includes a detailed insight into the properties of known age traces (i.e.,
in-field sensor defects and sensor dust) and temporal image forensics
techniques. Another key aspect of this work is to highlight the problem of
content bias and to illustrate how important eXplainable Artificial
Intelligence methods are to verify the reliability of temporal image forensics
techniques. Apart from reviewing material presented in previous works, in this
review: (i) a new (probably more realistic) forensic setting is proposed; (ii)
the main properties (growth rate and spatial distribution) of in-field sensor
defects are verified; (iii) it is shown that a method proposed to utilize
in-field sensor defects for image age approximation actually exploits other
traces (most likely content bias); (iv) the features learned by a neural
network dating palmprint images are further investigated; (v) it is shown how
easily a neural network can be distracted from learning age traces. For this
purpose, previous work is analyzed, re-implemented if required and experiments
are conducted.

Motivation: 现有开源多模态模型推理模式单调且交互轮次有限，无法处理需要试错探索的困难视觉任务。

Method: 构建Visual Probe数据集、开发迭代数据收集管道获取多样化推理轨迹、提出超轮次掩码策略平衡训练效率和推理可扩展性。

Result: 模型在仅6轮交互训练的情况下，推理时可自然扩展到数十轮，准确率随轮次增加而提升，能有效解决困难视觉搜索问题。

Conclusion: Mini-o3通过规模化工具交互和深度多轮推理，实现了丰富的推理模式和深度思考路径，为复杂视觉问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in large multimodal models have leveraged image-based tools
with reinforcement learning to tackle visual problems. However, existing
open-source approaches often exhibit monotonous reasoning patterns and allow
only a limited number of interaction turns, making them inadequate for
difficult tasks that require trial-and-error exploration. In this work, we
address this limitation by scaling up tool-based interactions and introduce
Mini-o3, a system that executes deep, multi-turn reasoning -- spanning tens of
steps -- and achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging visual search
tasks. Our recipe for reproducing OpenAI o3-style behaviors comprises three key
components. First, we construct the Visual Probe Dataset, a collection of
thousands of challenging visual search problems designed for exploratory
reasoning. Second, we develop an iterative data collection pipeline to obtain
cold-start trajectories that exhibit diverse reasoning patterns, including
depth-first search, trial-and-error, and goal maintenance. Third, we propose an
over-turn masking strategy that prevents penalization of over-turn responses
(those that hit the maximum number of turns) during reinforcement learning,
thereby balancing training-time efficiency with test-time scalability. Despite
training with an upper bound of only six interaction turns, our model generates
trajectories that naturally scale to tens of turns at inference time, with
accuracy improving as the number of turns increases. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Mini-o3 produces rich reasoning patterns and deep thinking
paths, effectively solving challenging visual search problems.

TL;DR: 研究发现当前视觉语言模型的性别偏见评估容易受到非性别特征（如物体和背景）的干扰，即使微小扰动也会显著改变偏见分数，建议在报告偏见指标时同时报告特征敏感性测量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的性别偏见评估基准往往包含性别与非性别特征之间的虚假相关性，这可能导致评估结果失真，需要研究这些虚假特征如何影响性别偏见评估的可靠性。

Method: 系统性地扰动四个广泛使用的基准（COCO-gender、FACET、MIAP、PHASE）中的非性别特征，并量化它们对各种视觉语言模型偏见评估的影响。

Result: 即使最小扰动（如仅遮蔽10%物体或轻微模糊背景）也能显著改变偏见分数，生成式VLMs的指标变化高达175%，CLIP变体变化达43%，表明当前评估更多反映模型对虚假特征的反应而非真实性别偏见。

Conclusion: 由于创建无虚假特征的基准具有根本性挑战，建议在报告偏见指标时同时报告特征敏感性测量，以实现更可靠的偏见评估。

Abstract: Gender bias in vision-language foundation models (VLMs) raises concerns about
their safe deployment and is typically evaluated using benchmarks with gender
annotations on real-world images. However, as these benchmarks often contain
spurious correlations between gender and non-gender features, such as objects
and backgrounds, we identify a critical oversight in gender bias evaluation: Do
spurious features distort gender bias evaluation? To address this question, we
systematically perturb non-gender features across four widely used benchmarks
(COCO-gender, FACET, MIAP, and PHASE) and various VLMs to quantify their impact
on bias evaluation. Our findings reveal that even minimal perturbations, such
as masking just 10% of objects or weakly blurring backgrounds, can dramatically
alter bias scores, shifting metrics by up to 175% in generative VLMs and 43% in
CLIP variants. This suggests that current bias evaluations often reflect model
responses to spurious features rather than gender bias, undermining their
reliability. Since creating spurious feature-free benchmarks is fundamentally
challenging, we recommend reporting bias metrics alongside feature-sensitivity
measurements to enable a more reliable bias assessment.

Conclusion: 该方法能够以数据高效的方式适配3D医学视觉-语言模型，为阿尔茫海默病诊断提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Medical vision-language models (Med-VLMs) have shown impressive results in
tasks such as report generation and visual question answering, but they still
face several limitations. Most notably, they underutilize patient metadata and
lack integration of clinical diagnostic knowledge. Moreover, most existing
models are typically trained from scratch or fine-tuned on large-scale 2D
image-text pairs, requiring extensive computational resources, and their
effectiveness on 3D medical imaging is often limited due to the absence of
structural information. To address these gaps, we propose a data-efficient
fine-tuning pipeline to adapt 3D CT-based Med-VLMs for 3D MRI and demonstrate
its application in Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis. Our system introduces
two key innovations. First, we convert structured metadata into synthetic
reports, enriching textual input for improved image-text alignment. Second, we
add an auxiliary token trained to predict the mini-mental state examination
(MMSE) score, a widely used clinical measure of cognitive function that
correlates with AD severity. This provides additional supervision for
fine-tuning. Applying lightweight prompt tuning to both image and text
modalities, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on two AD
datasets using 1,500 training images, outperforming existing methods fine-tuned
on 10,000 images. Code will be released upon publication.

Method: 提出自监督跨编码器框架，利用纵向MRI扫描的时间连续性进行监督，将表征解耦为静态表征（通过对比学习约束）和动态表征（通过输入梯度正则化指导）。

Result: 在ADNI数据集上实验显示了更高的分类准确性和改善的可解释性，并在OASIS数据集上展现出强大的零样本通用性，在PPMI数据集上展现出跨任务通用性。

Conclusion: 该方法有效地解决了标签数据依赖和可解释性问题，为神经退行性疾病诊断提供了一种新的自监督学习方案。

Abstract: Deep learning has shown significant potential in diagnosing neurodegenerative
diseases from MRI data. However, most existing methods rely heavily on large
volumes of labeled data and often yield representations that lack
interpretability. To address both challenges, we propose a novel
self-supervised cross-encoder framework that leverages the temporal continuity
in longitudinal MRI scans for supervision. This framework disentangles learned
representations into two components: a static representation, constrained by
contrastive learning, which captures stable anatomical features; and a dynamic
representation, guided by input-gradient regularization, which reflects
temporal changes and can be effectively fine-tuned for downstream
classification tasks. Experimental results on the Alzheimer's Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset demonstrate that our method achieves
superior classification accuracy and improved interpretability. Furthermore,
the learned representations exhibit strong zero-shot generalization on the Open
Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) dataset and cross-task generalization
on the Parkinson Progression Marker Initiative (PPMI) dataset. The code for the
proposed method will be made publicly available.

Motivation: 现有语义水印技术虽然能抵抗再生攻击，但由于频率完整性损失导致检测性能下降，且容易受到裁剪攻击的影响。

Method: 提出Hermitian对称傅里叶水印(SFW)方法，通过强制Hermitian对称性保持频率完整性；引入中心感知嵌入策略减少裁剪攻击的脆弱性；改进现有语义水印方案的频域结构。

Result: 在各种攻击场景下实现了最先进的验证和识别性能，检测准确率最高同时保持优异的图像保真度(FID和CLIP分数)。

Conclusion: SFW是一个有效平衡鲁棒性和图像保真度的框架，解决了语义水印中固有的权衡问题。

Abstract: Semantic watermarking techniques for latent diffusion models (LDMs) are
robust against regeneration attacks, but often suffer from detection
performance degradation due to the loss of frequency integrity. To tackle this
problem, we propose a novel embedding method called Hermitian Symmetric Fourier
Watermarking (SFW), which maintains frequency integrity by enforcing Hermitian
symmetry. Additionally, we introduce a center-aware embedding strategy that
reduces the vulnerability of semantic watermarking due to cropping attacks by
ensuring robust information retention. To validate our approach, we apply these
techniques to existing semantic watermarking schemes, enhancing their
frequency-domain structures for better robustness and retrieval accuracy.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our methods achieve state-of-the-art
verification and identification performance, surpassing previous approaches
across various attack scenarios. Ablation studies confirm the impact of SFW on
detection capabilities, the effectiveness of the center-aware embedding against
cropping, and how message capacity influences identification accuracy. Notably,
our method achieves the highest detection accuracy while maintaining superior
image fidelity, as evidenced by FID and CLIP scores. Conclusively, our proposed
SFW is shown to be an effective framework for balancing robustness and image
fidelity, addressing the inherent trade-offs in semantic watermarking. Code

Abstract: Small moving target detection is crucial for many defense applications but
remains highly challenging due to low signal-to-noise ratios, ambiguous visual
cues, and cluttered backgrounds. In this work, we propose a novel deep learning
framework that differs fundamentally from existing approaches, which often rely
on target-specific features or motion cues and tend to lack robustness in
complex environments. Our key insight is that small target detection and
background discrimination are inherently coupled, even cluttered video
backgrounds often exhibit strong low-rank structures that can serve as stable
priors for detection. We reformulate the task as a tensor-based low-rank and
sparse decomposition problem and conduct a theoretical analysis of the
background, target, and noise components to guide model design. Building on
these insights, we introduce TenRPCANet, a deep neural network that requires
minimal assumptions about target characteristics. Specifically, we propose a
tokenization strategy that implicitly enforces multi-order tensor low-rank
priors through a self-attention mechanism. This mechanism captures both local
and non-local self-similarity to model the low-rank background without relying
on explicit iterative optimization. In addition, inspired by the sparse
component update in tensor RPCA, we design a feature refinement module to
enhance target saliency. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art
performance on two highly distinct and challenging tasks: multi-frame infrared
small target detection and space object detection. These results demonstrate

TL;DR: 提出EDFFDNet网络，使用指数衰减基函数的自由形变，结合自适应稀疏运动聚合器和渐进式相关细化策略，在深度差异场景中实现高效准确的图像配准


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有深度图像配准方法（单应性、多网格单应性、薄板样条）在包含深度差异的真实场景中的局限性

Method: 1. 指数衰减自由形变网络（EDFFDNet）使用指数衰减基函数；2. 自适应稀疏运动聚合器（ASMA）替代MLP聚合器；3. 渐进式相关细化策略利用全局-局部相关模式进行粗到细运动估计

Result: 参数减少70.5%，内存减少32.6%，总运行时间减少33.7%，PSNR提升0.5dB；EDFFDNet-2进一步提升PSNR 1.06dB，同时保持较低计算成本

Conclusion: 该方法在深度差异场景中表现优异，具有强泛化能力，在多个数据集上优于之前的深度学习方法

Abstract: Previous deep image registration methods that employ single homography,
multi-grid homography, or thin-plate spline often struggle with real scenes
containing depth disparities due to their inherent limitations. To address
this, we propose an Exponential-Decay Free-Form Deformation Network (EDFFDNet),
which employs free-form deformation with an exponential-decay basis function.
This design achieves higher efficiency and performs well in scenes with depth
disparities, benefiting from its inherent locality. We also introduce an
Adaptive Sparse Motion Aggregator (ASMA), which replaces the MLP motion
aggregator used in previous methods. By transforming dense interactions into
sparse ones, ASMA reduces parameters and improves accuracy. Additionally, we
propose a progressive correlation refinement strategy that leverages
global-local correlation patterns for coarse-to-fine motion estimation, further
enhancing efficiency and accuracy. Experiments demonstrate that EDFFDNet
reduces parameters, memory, and total runtime by 70.5%, 32.6%, and 33.7%,
respectively, while achieving a 0.5 dB PSNR gain over the state-of-the-art
method. With an additional local refinement stage,EDFFDNet-2 further improves
PSNR by 1.06 dB while maintaining lower computational costs. Our method also
demonstrates strong generalization ability across datasets, outperforming
previous deep learning methods.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Deep neural networks have exhibited impressive performance in image
classification tasks but remain vulnerable to adversarial examples. Standard
adversarial training enhances robustness but typically fails to explicitly
address inter-class feature overlap, a significant contributor to adversarial
susceptibility. In this work, we introduce a novel adversarial training
framework that actively mitigates inter-class proximity by projecting out
inter-class dependencies from adversarial and clean samples in the feature
space. Specifically, our approach first identifies the nearest inter-class
neighbors for each adversarial sample and subsequently removes projections onto
these neighbors to enforce stronger feature separability. Theoretically, we
demonstrate that our proposed logits correction reduces the Lipschitz constant
of neural networks, thereby lowering the Rademacher complexity, which directly
contributes to improved generalization and robustness. Extensive experiments
across standard benchmarks including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN show that
our method demonstrates strong performance that is competitive with leading
adversarial training techniques, highlighting significant achievements in both
robust and clean accuracy. Our findings reveal the importance of addressing
inter-class feature proximity explicitly to bolster adversarial robustness in
DNNs.

Motivation: 现有视频理解模型在短片段感知任务上表现良好，但在需要复杂推理的长视频任务中性能下降，需要利用现有感知能力进行更复杂的视频推理。

Method: 开发了一个大语言模型代理，可以访问视频模块作为子代理或工具，根据每个模块调用的结果动态决定后续步骤，并引入批评器来区分成功和不成功的推理序列。

Result: 所提出的代理和批评器组合在LVBench、Neptune和ActivityNet-RTL等数据集上取得了强劲的性能表现。

Conclusion: 通过大语言模型代理与视频模块的协同工作，结合批评器机制，可以有效提升复杂视频推理任务的性能。

Abstract: Video understanding has seen significant progress in recent years, with
models' performance on perception from short clips continuing to rise. Yet,
multiple recent benchmarks, such as LVBench, Neptune, and ActivityNet-RTL, show
performance wanes for tasks requiring complex reasoning on videos as queries
grow more complex and videos grow longer. In this work, we ask: can existing
perception capabilities be leveraged to successfully perform more complex video
reasoning? In particular, we develop a large language model agent given access
to video modules as subagents or tools. Rather than following a fixed procedure
to solve queries as in previous work such as Visual Programming, ViperGPT, and
MoReVQA, the agent uses the results of each call to a module to determine
subsequent steps. Inspired by work in the textual reasoning domain, we
introduce a critic to distinguish between instances of successful and
unsuccessful sequences from the agent. We show that the combination of our
agent and critic achieve strong performance on the previously-mentioned
datasets.

TL;DR: SEEC提出了一种基于语义分割的多熵模型无损图像压缩方法，通过为不同语义区域分配专用熵模型来提升压缩性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统学习方法使用单一熵模型估计整个图像的概率分布，无法有效捕捉不同语义区域的多样化统计特征

Method: 利用语义分割识别不同区域，为每个区域分配专用熵模型，采用多通道离散逻辑混合似然建模像素值分布

Result: 在基准数据集上实现了最先进的压缩比，仅引入最小编码解码延迟，支持基于分割掩码的感兴趣区域编码

Conclusion: SEEC框架通过语义分割指导的多熵模型选择，显著提升了无损图像压缩性能，同时保持了高效性

Abstract: Recently, learned image compression has attracted considerable attention due
to its superior performance over traditional methods. However, most existing
approaches employ a single entropy model to estimate the probability
distribution of pixel values across the entire image, which limits their
ability to capture the diverse statistical characteristics of different
semantic regions. To overcome this limitation, we propose Segmentation-Assisted
Multi-Entropy Models for Lossless Image Compression (SEEC). Our framework
utilizes semantic segmentation to guide the selection and adaptation of
multiple entropy models, enabling more accurate probability distribution
estimation for distinct semantic regions. Specifically, SEEC first extracts
image features and then applies semantic segmentation to identify different
regions, each assigned a specialized entropy model to better capture its unique
statistical properties. Finally, a multi-channel discrete logistic mixture
likelihood is employed to model the pixel value distributions effectively.
Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SEEC achieves
state-of-the-art compression ratios while introducing only minimal encoding and
decoding latency. With superior performance, the proposed model also supports
Regions of Interest (ROIs) coding condition on the provided segmentation mask.

Motivation: 脑梗病复发率高且死亡率极高（40%），通过早期识别高风险患者可以提前进行适当治疗规划

Method: 收集3D脑内CTA图像数据、心脏疾病、年龄、性别等临床数据，训练单模态和多模态深度学习模型，进行二元分类（任务1）和生存分析分类（任务2）

Result: 单模态表格数据在二元分类任务中达到AUC 0.84，多模态模型在生存分析任务中达到c-index 0.68和AUC 0.71，发现心脏疾病和颈动脉图像对复发预测有重要作用

Conclusion: 多模态深度学习模型能够有效预测脑梗病复发风险，心脏疾病和颈动脉图像是关键预测因子，需要继续收集数据以提升模型性能

Abstract: Stroke is the second most frequent cause of death world wide with an annual
mortality of around 5.5 million. Recurrence rates of stroke are between 5 and
25% in the first year. As mortality rates for relapses are extraordinarily high
(40%) it is of utmost importance to reduce the recurrence rates. We address
this issue by detecting patients at risk of stroke recurrence at an early stage
in order to enable appropriate therapy planning. To this end we collected 3D
intracranial CTA image data and recorded concomitant heart diseases, the age
and the gender of stroke patients between 2010 and 2024. We trained single- and
multimodal deep learning based neural networks for binary relapse detection
(Task 1) and for relapse free survival (RFS) time prediction together with a
subsequent classification (Task 2). The separation of relapse from non-relapse
patients (Task 1) could be solved with tabular data (AUC on test dataset:
0.84). However, for the main task, the regression (Task 2), our multimodal
XSRD-net processed the modalities vision:tabular with 0.68:0.32 according to
modality contribution measures. The c-index with respect to relapses for the
multimodal model reached 0.68, and the AUC is 0.71 for the test dataset. Final,
deeper interpretability analysis results could highlight a link between both
heart diseases (tabular) and carotid arteries (vision) for the detection of
relapses and the prediction of the RFS time. This is a central outcome that we
strive to strengthen with ongoing data collection and model retraining.

Motivation: 虚拟现实和数字人建模应用中对头发重建的需求日益增长，现有方法往往忽视发丝的连通性和拓扑结构，需要更精确的重建方法。

Method: 多阶段流水线：首先使用可微分高斯光栅化器重建详细头发几何，然后通过新颖的合并方案将高斯段合并为连贯发丝，最后在光度监督下优化和生长发丝。

Conclusion: 该方法成功扩展了3DGS框架，实现了发丝级头发重建，并提出了评估拓扑准确性的新指标，为头发重建领域提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Human hair reconstruction is a challenging problem in computer vision, with
growing importance for applications in virtual reality and digital human
modeling. Recent advances in 3D Gaussians Splatting (3DGS) provide efficient
and explicit scene representations that naturally align with the structure of
hair strands. In this work, we extend the 3DGS framework to enable strand-level
hair geometry reconstruction from multi-view images. Our multi-stage pipeline
first reconstructs detailed hair geometry using a differentiable Gaussian
rasterizer, then merges individual Gaussian segments into coherent strands
through a novel merging scheme, and finally refines and grows the strands under
photometric supervision.
  While existing methods typically evaluate reconstruction quality at the
geometric level, they often neglect the connectivity and topology of hair
strands. To address this, we propose a new evaluation metric that serves as a
proxy for assessing topological accuracy in strand reconstruction. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our
method robustly handles a wide range of hairstyles and achieves efficient
reconstruction, typically completing within one hour.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RayGauss虽然在新视角合成方面达到了最先进的渲染质量，但其计算成本过高，无法在真实场景中实现实时渲染

Method: 1. 引入体积渲染加速策略（空空间跳过和自适应采样） 2. 增强光线连贯性 3. 尺度正则化减少假阳性交点 4. 新的致密化准则改善远距离区域密度分布

Conclusion: RayGaussX成功解决了RayGauss的计算效率问题，在保持高质量渲染的同时实现了显著的性能提升，适用于更大场景的实时渲染应用

Abstract: RayGauss has achieved state-of-the-art rendering quality for novel-view
synthesis on synthetic and indoor scenes by representing radiance and density
fields with irregularly distributed elliptical basis functions, rendered via
volume ray casting using a Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH). However, its
computational cost prevents real-time rendering on real-world scenes. Our
approach, RayGaussX, builds on RayGauss by introducing key contributions that
accelerate both training and inference. Specifically, we incorporate volumetric
rendering acceleration strategies such as empty-space skipping and adaptive
sampling, enhance ray coherence, and introduce scale regularization to reduce
false-positive intersections. Additionally, we propose a new densification
criterion that improves density distribution in distant regions, leading to
enhanced graphical quality on larger scenes. As a result, RayGaussX achieves 5x
to 12x faster training and 50x to 80x higher rendering speeds (FPS) on
real-world datasets while improving visual quality by up to +0.56 dB in PSNR.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种自监督的多视角神经网络方法，用于融合两个正交各异性低分辨率碱性扬射成像图像，以重建统一的高分辨率解析细节。该方法无需高分辨率数据训练，并通过病人无关的离线和病人特异的在线阶段实现了较快的重建速度。

Abstract: Acquiring images in high resolution is often a challenging task. Especially
in the medical sector, image quality has to be balanced with acquisition time
and patient comfort. To strike a compromise between scan time and quality for
Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging, two anisotropic scans with different
low-resolution (LR) orientations can be acquired. Typically, LR scans are
analyzed individually by radiologists, which is time consuming and can lead to
inaccurate interpretation. To tackle this, we propose a novel approach for
fusing two orthogonal anisotropic LR MR images to reconstruct anatomical
details in a unified representation. Our multi-view neural network is trained
in a self-supervised manner, without requiring corresponding high-resolution
(HR) data. To optimize the model, we introduce a sparse coordinate-based loss,
enabling the integration of LR images with arbitrary scaling. We evaluate our
method on MR images from two independent cohorts. Our results demonstrate
comparable or even improved super-resolution (SR) performance compared to
state-of-the-art (SOTA) self-supervised SR methods for different upsampling
scales. By combining a patient-agnostic offline and a patient-specific online
phase, we achieve a substantial speed-up of up to ten times for
patient-specific reconstruction while achieving similar or better SR quality.

Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅技术虽然能创建逼真的3D场景表示，但在修复缺失区域（遮挡或场景编辑导致）时仍存在模糊细节、伪影和几何不一致的问题

Result: 在SPIn-NeRF数据集上的评估显示，SplatFill在视觉保真度上超越现有NeRF和3DGS修复方法，同时减少24.5%的训练时间，提供更清晰细节、更少伪影和更好的视角一致性

Conclusion: SplatFill通过深度引导和一致性优化，有效解决了3DGS场景修复中的关键挑战，实现了高质量的修复效果和显著的效率提升

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has enabled the creation of highly realistic 3D
scene representations from sets of multi-view images. However, inpainting
missing regions, whether due to occlusion or scene editing, remains a
challenging task, often leading to blurry details, artifacts, and inconsistent
geometry. In this work, we introduce SplatFill, a novel depth-guided approach
for 3DGS scene inpainting that achieves state-of-the-art perceptual quality and
improved efficiency. Our method combines two key ideas: (1) joint depth-based
and object-based supervision to ensure inpainted Gaussians are accurately
placed in 3D space and aligned with surrounding geometry, and (2) we propose a
consistency-aware refinement scheme that selectively identifies and corrects
inconsistent regions without disrupting the rest of the scene. Evaluations on
the SPIn-NeRF dataset demonstrate that SplatFill not only surpasses existing
NeRF-based and 3DGS-based inpainting methods in visual fidelity but also
reduces training time by 24.5%. Qualitative results show our method delivers
sharper details, fewer artifacts, and greater coherence across challenging
viewpoints.

Motivation: 现有基于LLM的3D对象分割方法存在表示对齐问题：LLM处理高层语义token而3D点云只有密集几何结构，导致输入输出阶段的限制和精度损失

Method: 提出Point Linguist Model (PLM)框架，包含Object-centric Discriminative Representation (OcDR)学习对象中心token，以及Geometric Reactivation Decoder (GRD)结合语义推理和密集特征进行精确分割

Result: 在ScanNetv2上提升+7.3 mIoU，在Multi3DRefer上提升+6.0 mIoU，在7个基准测试的4个不同任务中均取得一致提升

Conclusion: PLM通过全面的对象中心推理有效解决了3D表示对齐问题，实现了鲁棒的3D理解

Abstract: 3D object segmentation with Large Language Models (LLMs) has become a
prevailing paradigm due to its broad semantics, task flexibility, and strong
generalization. However, this paradigm is hindered by representation
misalignment: LLMs process high-level semantic tokens, whereas 3D point clouds
convey only dense geometric structures. In prior methods, misalignment limits
both input and output. At the input stage, dense point patches require heavy
pre-alignment, weakening object-level semantics and confusing similar
distractors. At the output stage, predictions depend only on dense features
without explicit geometric cues, leading to a loss of fine-grained accuracy. To
address these limitations, we present the Point Linguist Model (PLM), a general
framework that bridges the representation gap between LLMs and dense 3D point
clouds without requiring large-scale pre-alignment between 3D-text or
3D-images. Specifically, we introduce Object-centric Discriminative
Representation (OcDR), which learns object-centric tokens that capture target
semantics and scene relations under a hard negative-aware training objective.
This mitigates the misalignment between LLM tokens and 3D points, enhances
resilience to distractors, and facilitates semantic-level reasoning within
LLMs. For accurate segmentation, we introduce the Geometric Reactivation
Decoder (GRD), which predicts masks by combining OcDR tokens carrying
LLM-inferred geometry with corresponding dense features, preserving
comprehensive dense features throughout the pipeline. Extensive experiments
show that PLM achieves significant improvements of +7.3 mIoU on ScanNetv2 and
+6.0 mIoU on Multi3DRefer for 3D referring segmentation, with consistent gains
across 7 benchmarks spanning 4 different tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness
of comprehensive object-centric reasoning for robust 3D understanding.

ecosystems with complex background, showing particular strength in detecting
partially burned vegetation and fire boundaries and its transferability and
high generalization in burned area mapping. This research contributes to the
advancement of automated fire damage assessment and provides a scalable
solution for global burn area monitoring using the AlphaEarth dataset.

Conclusion: LIAE和IAF能够有效诊断MLLM中的注意力问题，D-LEAF方法提供了任务无关的动态错误修正方案，显著减少幻觉现象

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) achieve strong performance on tasks
like image captioning and visual question answering, but remain prone to
hallucinations, where generated text conflicts with the visual input. Prior
work links this partly to insufficient visual attention, but existing
attention-based detectors and mitigation typically apply uniform adjustments
across layers and heads, obscuring where errors originate. In this paper, we
first show these methods fail to accurately localize problematic layers. Then,
we introduce two diagnostics: Layer Image Attention Entropy (LIAE) which flags
anomalous layers, and Image Attention Focus (IAF) which scores attention heads
within those layers. Analysis shows that LIAE pinpoints faulty layers and IAF
reliably ranks heads that warrant correction. Guided by these signals, we
propose Dynamic Layer-wise Entropy and Attention Fusion (D-LEAF), a
task-agnostic, attention-guided method that dynamically localizes and corrects
errors during inference with negligible overhead. Results show our D-LEAF
delivers a 53% relative improvement on standard captioning benchmarks, and on
VQA both accuracy and F1-score improve by approximately 4%, substantially
suppressing hallucinations while preserving efficiency.

Active MINT, we propose a novel multitask learning process that involves
training simultaneously two models: the original or Audited Model, and a
secondary model, referred to as the MINT Model, responsible for identifying the
data used for training the Audited Model. This novel multi-task learning
approach has been designed to incorporate the auditability of the model as an
optimization objective during the training process of neural networks. The
proposed approach incorporates intermediate activation maps as inputs to the
MINT layers, which are trained to enhance the detection of training data. We
present results using a wide range of neural networks, from lighter
architectures such as MobileNet to more complex ones such as Vision
Transformers, evaluated in 5 public benchmarks. Our proposed Active MINT
achieves over 80% accuracy in detecting if given data was used for training,
significantly outperforming previous approaches in the literature. Our aMINT

contains the hard pixel noise, \textit{i.e.}, irrelevant background objects,
that is intractable to trace and suppress, leading to the overfitting of the
background. To address the limitation of this correlation, we imitate the
biological vision process to identify novel objects in the object-level
information. Target identification in the general objects is more valid than in
the entire image, especially in the low-data regime. Inspired by this, we
design an Object-level Correlation Network (OCNet) by establishing the
object-level correlation between the support target object and query general
objects, which is mainly composed of the General Object Mining Module (GOMM)
and Correlation Construction Module (CCM). Specifically, GOMM constructs the
query general object feature by learning saliency and high-level similarity
cues, where the general objects include the irrelevant background objects and
the target foreground object. Then, CCM establishes the object-level
correlation by allocating the target prototypes to match the general object
feature. The generated object-level correlation can mine the query target
feature and suppress the hard pixel noise for the final prediction. Extensive
experiments on PASCAL-${5}^{i}$ and COCO-${20}^{i}$ show that our model
achieves the state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Joint reconstruction of human-object interaction marks a significant
milestone in comprehending the intricate interrelations between humans and
their surrounding environment. Nevertheless, previous optimization methods
often struggle to achieve physically plausible reconstruction results due to
the lack of prior knowledge about human-object interactions. In this paper, we
introduce ScoreHOI, an effective diffusion-based optimizer that introduces
diffusion priors for the precise recovery of human-object interactions. By
harnessing the controllability within score-guided sampling, the diffusion
model can reconstruct a conditional distribution of human and object pose given
the image observation and object feature. During inference, the ScoreHOI
effectively improves the reconstruction results by guiding the denoising
process with specific physical constraints. Furthermore, we propose a
contact-driven iterative refinement approach to enhance the contact
plausibility and improve the reconstruction accuracy. Extensive evaluations on
standard benchmarks demonstrate ScoreHOI's superior performance over
state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its ability to achieve a precise and
robust improvement in joint human-object interaction reconstruction.

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个多模态预训练框架ToothMCL，通过CBCT和IOS数据的对比学习实现牙齿精确分割，在内部和外部测试中DSC指标分别提升12%和8%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有牙齿分割方法缺乏严格验证，性能和临床适用性有限，需要更准确的多模态牙齿数字表示方法。

Method: 提出ToothMCL多模态对比学习框架，整合CBCT体数据和IOS表面数据，通过模态不变表示学习精细解剖特征，实现多类分割和FDI编号识别。

Result: 在3,867患者数据集上验证，内部和外部测试DSC分别提升12%和8%，在不同成像条件和临床场景下表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: ToothMCL是首个多模态预训练牙齿分割框架，显著提升分割精度和泛化性能，为数字牙科提供可靠基础。

Abstract: Digital dentistry represents a transformative shift in modern dental
practice. The foundational step in this transformation is the accurate digital
representation of the patient's dentition, which is obtained from segmented
Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) and Intraoral Scans (IOS). Despite the
growing interest in digital dental technologies, existing segmentation
methodologies frequently lack rigorous validation and demonstrate limited
performance and clinical applicability. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first work to introduce a multimodal pretraining framework for tooth
segmentation. We present ToothMCL, a Tooth Multimodal Contrastive Learning for
pretraining that integrates volumetric (CBCT) and surface-based (IOS)
modalities. By capturing modality-invariant representations through multimodal
contrastive learning, our approach effectively models fine-grained anatomical
features, enabling precise multi-class segmentation and accurate identification
of F\'ed\'eration Dentaire Internationale (FDI) tooth numbering. Along with the
framework, we curated CBCT-IOS3.8K, the largest paired CBCT and IOS dataset to
date, comprising 3,867 patients. We then evaluated ToothMCL on a comprehensive
collection of independent datasets, representing the largest and most diverse
evaluation to date. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both
internal and external testing, with an increase of 12\% for CBCT segmentation
and 8\% for IOS segmentation in the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC).
Furthermore, ToothMCL consistently surpasses existing approaches in tooth
groups and demonstrates robust generalizability across varying imaging
conditions and clinical scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现消费级硬件上目标检测器的性能瓶颈不在计算能力，而在于系统级瓶颈，需要硬件感知的推理策略来最大化吞吐量

Method: 提出两阶段自适应推理算法：先快速低分辨率检测，仅在置信度低时升级到高分辨率模型，无需架构修改

Result: 在5000张COCO图像上，相比PyTorch Early-Exit基线实现1.85倍加速，mAP损失仅为5.51%

Conclusion: 为消费级设备部署高性能实时AI提供了实用方案，将重点从纯模型优化转向硬件感知的推理策略

Abstract: As local AI grows in popularity, there is a critical gap between the
benchmark performance of object detectors and their practical viability on
consumer-grade hardware. While models like YOLOv10s promise real-time speeds,
these metrics are typically achieved on high-power, desktop-class GPUs. This
paper reveals that on resource-constrained systems, such as laptops with RTX
4060 GPUs, performance is not compute-bound but is instead dominated by
system-level bottlenecks, as illustrated by a simple bottleneck test. To
overcome this hardware-level constraint, we introduce a Two-Pass Adaptive
Inference algorithm, a model-independent approach that requires no
architectural changes. This study mainly focuses on adaptive inference
strategies and undertakes a comparative analysis of architectural early-exit
and resolution-adaptive routing, highlighting their respective trade-offs
within a unified evaluation framework. The system uses a fast, low-resolution
pass and only escalates to a high-resolution model pass when detection
confidence is low. On a 5000-image COCO dataset, our method achieves a 1.85x
speedup over a PyTorch Early-Exit baseline, with a modest mAP loss of 5.51%.
This work provides a practical and reproducible blueprint for deploying
high-performance, real-time AI on consumer-grade devices by shifting the focus
from pure model optimization to hardware-aware inference strategies that
maximize throughput.

Conclusion: 该研究为动态场景重建的进一步评估提供了基准，静态场景下的成功结果表明现有算法在重建无人卫星目标方面具有潜力。

Abstract: Characterization of uncooperative Resident Space Objects (RSO) play a crucial
role in On-Orbit Servicing (OOS) and Active Debris Removal (ADR) missions to
assess the geometry and motion properties. To address the challenges of
reconstructing tumbling uncooperative targets, this study evaluates the
performance of existing state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction algorithms for
dynamic scenes, focusing on their ability to generate geometrically accurate
models with high-fidelity. To support our evaluation, we developed a simulation
environment using Isaac Sim to generate physics-accurate 2D image sequences of
tumbling satellite under realistic orbital lighting conditions. Our preliminary
results on static scenes using Neuralangelo demonstrate promising
reconstruction quality. The generated 3D meshes closely match the original CAD
models with minimal errors and artifacts when compared using Cloud Compare
(CC). The reconstructed models were able to capture critical fine details for
mission planning. This provides a baseline for our ongoing evaluation of
dynamic scene reconstruction.

Motivation: 解决深度神经网络内部特征提取过程的黑盒问题，通过生成与特定特征匹配的图像来可视化理解DNN编码的特征信息。

Method: 使用引导扩散模型，在预训练扩散模型的反向图像生成过程中，通过最小化生成图像特征与目标特征的欧氏距离来指导生成过程。

Result: 实验针对CLIP图像编码器、ResNet-50和视觉变换器，生成图像的特征与目标特征高度相似，揭示了这些DNN特征空间的有价值见解。

Conclusion: 该方法无需额外训练即可分析不同DNN的特征空间，在单个商用GPU上运行，为理解神经网络内部表示提供了有效工具。

Abstract: One of the key issues in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) is the black-box nature
of their internal feature extraction process. Targeting vision-related domains,
this paper focuses on analysing the feature space of a DNN by proposing a
decoder that can generate images whose features are guaranteed to closely match
a user-specified feature. Owing to this guarantee that is missed in past
studies, our decoder allows us to evidence which of various attributes in an
image are encoded into a feature by the DNN, by generating images whose
features are in proximity to that feature. Our decoder is implemented as a
guided diffusion model that guides the reverse image generation of a
pre-trained diffusion model to minimise the Euclidean distance between the
feature of a clean image estimated at each step and the user-specified feature.
One practical advantage of our decoder is that it can analyse feature spaces of
different DNNs with no additional training and run on a single COTS GPU. The
experimental results targeting CLIP's image encoder, ResNet-50 and vision
transformer demonstrate that images generated by our decoder have features
remarkably similar to the user-specified ones and reveal valuable insights into
these DNNs' feature spaces.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现实世界中任意未见物体的6D姿态估计问题，克服3D模型稀缺、单视图重建缺乏度量尺度以及生成模型与真实图像之间的域差距等挑战。

Method: 采用粗到精对齐模块联合优化尺度和姿态，结合多视图特征匹配与渲染比较细化；使用文本引导生成域随机化策略多样化纹理，通过合成数据有效微调姿态估计器。

Result: 在YCBInEOAT、Toyota-Light和LM-O等具有挑战性的基准测试中实现了最先进的性能，远超先前方法，并在真实机器人手上展示了稳健的灵巧抓取能力。

Conclusion: 该方法通过高保真单视图3D生成支持可靠的单次6D姿态估计，验证了在实际操作中的实用性，为机器人处理现实世界长尾实例提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Estimating the 6D pose of arbitrary unseen objects from a single reference
image is critical for robotics operating in the long-tail of real-world
instances. However, this setting is notoriously challenging: 3D models are
rarely available, single-view reconstructions lack metric scale, and domain
gaps between generated models and real-world images undermine robustness. We
propose OnePoseViaGen, a pipeline that tackles these challenges through two key
components. First, a coarse-to-fine alignment module jointly refines scale and
pose by combining multi-view feature matching with render-and-compare
refinement. Second, a text-guided generative domain randomization strategy
diversifies textures, enabling effective fine-tuning of pose estimators with
synthetic data. Together, these steps allow high-fidelity single-view 3D
generation to support reliable one-shot 6D pose estimation. On challenging
benchmarks (YCBInEOAT, Toyota-Light, LM-O), OnePoseViaGen achieves
state-of-the-art performance far surpassing prior approaches. We further
demonstrate robust dexterous grasping with a real robot hand, validating the
practicality of our method in real-world manipulation. Project page:

TL;DR: VIRAL是一种通过视觉表示对齐来增强多模态大语言模型视觉推理能力的正则化策略，将MLLM的内部视觉表示与预训练视觉基础模型对齐，以保留关键视觉细节。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在视觉中心任务（如物体计数、空间推理）上表现有限，主要原因是文本监督范式只能提供视觉通路的间接指导，导致训练过程中丢失细粒度视觉细节。

Method: 提出VIRAL（视觉表示对齐）策略，通过正则化方法将MLLM的内部视觉表示与预训练视觉基础模型的表示进行显式对齐，从而保留输入视觉编码器的关键细节并补充额外的视觉知识。

Result: 实验表明在广泛采用的多模态基准测试中所有任务上都取得了一致的性能提升，并通过全面的消融研究验证了框架的关键设计选择。

Conclusion: 这一简单发现为在训练MLLMs中有效整合视觉信息开辟了重要方向，通过视觉表示对齐可以显著增强模型对复杂视觉输入的推理能力。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) trained with visual instruction
tuning have achieved strong performance across diverse tasks, yet they remain
limited in vision-centric tasks such as object counting or spatial reasoning.
We attribute this gap to the prevailing text-only supervision paradigm, which
provides only indirect guidance for the visual pathway and often leads MLLMs to
discard fine-grained visual details during training. In this paper, we present
VIsual Representation ALignment (VIRAL), a simple yet effective regularization
strategy that aligns the internal visual representations of MLLMs with those of
pre-trained vision foundation models (VFMs). By explicitly enforcing this
alignment, VIRAL enables the model not only to retain critical visual details
from the input vision encoder but also to complement additional visual
knowledge from VFMs, thereby enhancing its ability to reason over complex
visual inputs. Our experiments demonstrate consistent improvements across all
tasks on widely adopted multimodal benchmarks. Furthermore, we conduct
comprehensive ablation studies to validate the key design choices underlying
our framework. We believe this simple finding opens up an important direction
for the effective integration of visual information in training MLLMs.

Conclusion: 该框架支持开发可扩展的细粒度评估工具，用于维护动态数据集中的主题相关性，所有代码和数据均已开源。

Abstract: This study presents a framework for automated evaluation of dynamically
evolving topic models using Large Language Models (LLMs). Topic modeling is
essential for organizing and retrieving scholarly content in digital library
systems, helping users navigate complex and evolving knowledge domains.
However, widely used automated metrics, such as coherence and diversity, often
capture only narrow statistical patterns and fail to explain semantic failures
in practice. We introduce a purpose-oriented evaluation framework that employs
nine LLM-based metrics spanning four key dimensions of topic quality: lexical
validity, intra-topic semantic soundness, inter-topic structural soundness, and
document-topic alignment soundness. The framework is validated through
adversarial and sampling-based protocols, and is applied across datasets
spanning news articles, scholarly publications, and social media posts, as well
as multiple topic modeling methods and open-source LLMs. Our analysis shows
that LLM-based metrics provide interpretable, robust, and task-relevant
assessments, uncovering critical weaknesses in topic models such as redundancy
and semantic drift, which are often missed by traditional metrics. These
results support the development of scalable, fine-grained evaluation tools for
maintaining topic relevance in dynamic datasets. All code and data supporting

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LLM基准主要关注诊断推理，但忽视了出院后患者教育这一关键环节，需要专门评估模型在出院沟通中的能力。

Method: 创建DischargeSim基准，模拟出院后多轮医患对话，使用18个LLM作为DoctorAgents与具有不同心理社会特征的PatientAgents进行交互，评估对话质量、个性化文档生成和患者理解。

Result: 实验显示不同LLM在出院教育能力上存在显著差距，模型大小并不总是带来更好的教育效果，不同患者特征下的表现差异很大。

Conclusion: DischargeSim为评估LLM在临床出院教育中的能力提供了首个基准，有助于促进公平、个性化的患者支持。

Abstract: Discharge communication is a critical yet underexplored component of patient
care, where the goal shifts from diagnosis to education. While recent large
language model (LLM) benchmarks emphasize in-visit diagnostic reasoning, they
fail to evaluate models' ability to support patients after the visit. We
introduce DischargeSim, a novel benchmark that evaluates LLMs on their ability
to act as personalized discharge educators. DischargeSim simulates post-visit,
multi-turn conversations between LLM-driven DoctorAgents and PatientAgents with
diverse psychosocial profiles (e.g., health literacy, education, emotion).
Interactions are structured across six clinically grounded discharge topics and
assessed along three axes: (1) dialogue quality via automatic and LLM-as-judge
evaluation, (2) personalized document generation including free-text summaries
and structured AHRQ checklists, and (3) patient comprehension through a
downstream multiple-choice exam. Experiments across 18 LLMs reveal significant
gaps in discharge education capability, with performance varying widely across
patient profiles. Notably, model size does not always yield better education
outcomes, highlighting trade-offs in strategy use and content prioritization.
DischargeSim offers a first step toward benchmarking LLMs in post-visit
clinical education and promoting equitable, personalized patient support.

Method: 基于道德心理学和美德伦理学定义规则（如预防、尊重、责任），在Prolog引擎中编码，根据不确定性水平（低、中、高）触发对应系统动作并提供理由说明

Result: 通过场景模拟测试规则覆盖率、公平性和信任校准，在临床和法律领域的应用案例显示能够提高信任和可解释性

Conclusion: 该方法为社会责任职责的自然语言生成提供了一种透明、轻量级的替代方案，比概率模型更透明且更容易解释

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in high-stakes settings,
where explaining uncertainty is both technical and ethical. Probabilistic
methods are often opaque and misaligned with expectations of transparency. We
propose a framework based on rule-based moral principles for handling
uncertainty in LLM-generated text. Using insights from moral psychology and
virtue ethics, we define rules such as precaution, deference, and
responsibility to guide responses under epistemic or aleatoric uncertainty.
These rules are encoded in a lightweight Prolog engine, where uncertainty
levels (low, medium, high) trigger aligned system actions with plain-language
rationales. Scenario-based simulations benchmark rule coverage, fairness, and
trust calibration. Use cases in clinical and legal domains illustrate how moral
reasoning can improve trust and interpretability. Our approach offers a
transparent, lightweight alternative to probabilistic models for socially
responsible natural language generation.

Motivation: 传统人工标注方法限制了大规模政治文本分析的深度和广度，需要探索LLMs在复杂政治文本标注任务中的自动化潜力

Method: 评估多种LLMs模型在标注德国议会辩论中（反）团结子类型的表现，包括模型大小、提示差异、微调效果、历史与现代数据对比，并与数千个人工参考标注进行对比

Result: 发现战后时期存在高度的移民导向团结，而2015年以来德国议会中反团结趋势明显增强，LLMs在政治文本分析中展现出良好潜力

Conclusion: LLMs为政治文本分析提供了重要工具，德国移民辩论在人口衰退、劳动力短缺和极化加剧的背景下具有重要意义

Abstract: Migration has been a core topic in German political debate, from millions of
expellees post World War II over labor migration to refugee movements in the
recent past. Studying political speech regarding such wide-ranging phenomena in
depth traditionally required extensive manual annotations, limiting the scope
of analysis to small subsets of the data. Large language models (LLMs) have the
potential to partially automate even complex annotation tasks. We provide an
extensive evaluation of a multiple LLMs in annotating (anti-)solidarity
subtypes in German parliamentary debates compared to a large set of thousands
of human reference annotations (gathered over a year). We evaluate the
influence of model size, prompting differences, fine-tuning, historical versus
contemporary data; and we investigate systematic errors. Beyond methodological
evaluation, we also interpret the resulting annotations from a social science
lense, gaining deeper insight into (anti-)solidarity trends towards migrants in
the German post-World War II period and recent past. Our data reveals a high
degree of migrant-directed solidarity in the postwar period, as well as a
strong trend towards anti-solidarity in the German parliament since 2015,
motivating further research. These findings highlight the promise of LLMs for
political text analysis and the importance of migration debates in Germany,
where demographic decline and labor shortages coexist with rising polarization.

*Zhuoqing Song,Peng Sun,Huizhuo Yuan,Quanquan Gu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CASTLE是一种改进的因果注意力机制，通过动态更新每个token的key来整合后续信息，同时保持自回归特性，在语言建模任务上表现优于标准因果注意力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准因果注意力中每个token的QKV是静态的，只能编码前文信息，限制了模型对完整上下文的利用能力。

Method: 提出CASTLE机制，持续更新每个token的key（称为lookahead keys），使早期位置的token能够整合后续位置的信息，同时保持自回归特性，并通过数学等价实现高效并行训练。

Result: 在语言建模基准测试中，CASTLE在不同规模的模型上都优于标准因果注意力，降低了验证困惑度，并在一系列下游任务上表现更好。

Conclusion: CASTLE通过动态更新key来整合后续信息的方法有效提升了语言模型的性能，为注意力机制的改进提供了新思路。

Abstract: In standard causal attention, each token's query, key, and value (QKV) are
static and encode only preceding context. We introduce CAuSal aTtention with
Lookahead kEys (CASTLE), an attention mechanism that continually updates each
token's keys as the context unfolds. We term these updated keys lookahead keys
because they belong to earlier positions yet integrate information from tokens
that appear later relative to those positions, while strictly preserving the
autoregressive property. Although the mechanism appears sequential, we derive a
mathematical equivalence that avoids explicitly materializing lookahead keys at
each position and enables efficient parallel training. On language modeling
benchmarks, CASTLE consistently outperforms standard causal attention across
model scales, reducing validation perplexity and improving performance on a
range of downstream tasks.

TL;DR: BVM方法在图像状态分类中表现最佳，但在形容词区分方面不如逻辑回归模型，但存在改进空间


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试BVM方法在判断图像状态变化方面的能力，并与现有方法进行比较

Method: 使用MIT-States数据集（53,000张图像），通过语言嵌入进行状态判断。实验一：比较BVM与余弦相似度、点积、乘积量化等方法的分类性能；实验二：比较BVM与逻辑回归模型在形容词区分方面的能力

Result: 实验一：BVM在名词状态分类方面表现最佳；实验二：BVM在形容词区分方面未能超越逻辑回归模型，但发现了改进方法的机会

Conclusion: BVM在状态分类方面有效，但在特征区分方面需要进一步优化，存在通过方法改进提升准确性的潜力

Abstract: We test a new method, which we will abbreviate using the acronym BVM (Basis
Vectors Method), in its ability to judge the state changes in images through
using language embeddings. We used the MIT-States dataset, containing about
53,000 images, to gather all of our data, which has 225 nouns and 115
adjectives, with each noun having about 9 different adjectives, forming
approximately 1000 noun-adjective pairs. For our first experiment, we test our
method's ability to determine the state of each noun class separately against
other metrics for comparison. These metrics are cosine similarity, dot product,
product quantization, binary index, Naive Bayes, and a custom neural network.
Among these metrics, we found that our proposed BVM performs the best in
classifying the states for each noun. We then perform a second experiment where
we try using BVM to determine if it can differentiate adjectives from one
another for each adjective separately. We compared the abilities of BVM to
differentiate adjectives against the proposed method the MIT-States paper
suggests: using a logistic regression model. In the end, we did not find
conclusive evidence that our BVM metric could perform better than the logistic
regression model at discerning adjectives. Yet, we were able to find evidence
for possible improvements to our method; this leads to the chance of increasing
our method's accuracy through certain changes in our methodologies.

Motivation: 为长文本生成任务建立一个任务、模型和指标无关的表现预测标准，解决多维度、细粒度质量指标的预测问题。

Method: 采用黑盒模型方式，仅依靠模型输入和输出来预测连续的评价指标得分，同时推断预测区间来量化不确定性。

Result: 在11个长文本数据集/任务上进行评估，显示仅需16个训练示例就能有效预测长文本生成任务的得分。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一个新题和有用的标准，提供了可立即实践应用的基线方法，为进一步研究推动了进步。

Abstract: We motivate and share a new benchmark for instance-level performance
prediction of long-form generation tasks having multi-faceted, fine-grained
quality metrics. Our task-, model- and metric-agnostic formulation predicts
continuous evaluation metric scores given only black-box model inputs and
outputs. Beyond predicting point estimates of metric scores, the benchmark also
requires inferring prediction intervals to quantify uncertainty around point
estimates. Evaluation spans 11 long-form datasets/tasks with multiple LLMs,
baselines, and metrics per task. We show that scores can be effectively
predicted across long-form generation tasks using as few as 16 training
examples. Overall, we introduce a novel and useful task, a valuable benchmark
to drive progress, and baselines ready for practical adoption today.

TL;DR: KAMIR是一种基于模型内部表示的数据选择方法，通过分析隐藏状态相似度来评估数据，无需提示工程即可有效选择训练数据


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于知识的数据选择方法依赖提示工程，对变化敏感且成本高，需要一种更稳定、适用范围更广的数据选择方法

Method: 通过计算每层隐藏状态与最终隐藏状态的相似度来评估数据，基于模型对输入的熟悉程度选择训练数据

Result: 实验表明，使用不太熟悉的数据进行训练可以获得更好的泛化性能，且适用于多种任务类型

Conclusion: KAMIR提供了一种有效的数据选择方法，能够提升模型性能，减少对提示工程的依赖，具有广泛的适用性

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have been driven by
pretraining, supervised fine tuning (SFT), and alignment tuning. Among these,
SFT plays a crucial role in transforming a model 's general knowledge into
structured responses tailored to specific tasks. However, there is no clearly
established methodology for effective training data selection. Simply
increasing the volume of data does not guarantee performance improvements,
while preprocessing, sampling, and validation require substantial time and
cost.
  To address this issue, a variety of data selection methods have been
proposed. Among them, knowledge based selection approaches identify suitable
training data by analyzing the model 's responses. Nevertheless, these methods
typically rely on prompt engineering, making them sensitive to variations and
incurring additional costs for prompt design.
  In this study, we propose Knowledge Analysis via Model Internal
Representations (KAMIR), a novel approach that overcomes these limitations by
analyzing data based on the model 's internal representations. KAMIR computes
similarities between the hidden states of each layer (block) and the final
hidden states for a given input to assess the data. Unlike prior methods that
were largely limited to multiple choice tasks, KAMIR can be applied to a wide
range of tasks such as machine reading comprehension and summarization.
Moreover, it selects data useful for training based on the model 's familiarity
with the input, even with a small dataset and a simple classifier architecture.
Experiments across diverse task datasets demonstrate that training with less
familiar data leads to better generalization performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Transformer自注意力机制存在的局部化问题，即注意力过度集中在少数token上，无法有效捐捕长距离依赖关系

Method: 提出Self-Attention One-step Belief Propagation (SAOBP)精炼框架，通过信忱传播过程注入多跳关系，并引入Global Token Dependency (GTD)指标来量化多跳连接的相对贡献

Result: SAOBP能够防止深层模型中的熵效回落，自适应地保持GTD在任务适宜水平，从而支持模型性能提升。小规模模型中也观察到竞争性增益

Conclusion: SAOBP框架通过信忱传播有效解决了自注意力局部化问题，特别在资源受限场景下具有强大潜力，能够在保持模型性能的同时提升推理质量

Abstract: Transformer-based self-attention mechanism serves as the core of modern
language models, yet it often suffers from localization, where attentions
collapse onto a limited subset of tokens and fail to capture long-range
dependencies. To address this issue, we propose Self-Attention One-step Belief
Propagation (SAOBP), a refinement framework that injects multi-hop
relationships through a belief propagation process. To interpret and quantify
these interactions, we introduce Global Token Dependency (GTD) that captures
the relative contribution of multihop connections within the attention graph.
Empirical results indicate that SAOBP helps prevent entropy collapse in deeper
layers and adaptively maintains GTD at task-appropriate levels, thereby
supporting improvements in model performance. Importantly, we observe
competitive gains in small-scale models, highlighting its potential for
improving inference quality in resource-constrained scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在现实对话中表现出情感感知和社交能力的局限性，无法根据不同社交和任务情境调整沟通风格和情感表达。

Method: 采用混合专家架构，结合人格适配器和动态路由网络，基于特质激活理论和Big Five人格模型实现情境化特质表达。

Result: 在多维度社交情感智能上显著优于基线模型，在下游人本应用（心理健康咨询、客服等）中表现一致提升，人类偏好评估显示与大型LLMs竞争性表现。

Conclusion: PersonaFuse为开发社交情感增强型LLMs提供了理论基础和实践方法，是迈向更人本AI系统的重要进展。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable
capabilities across various fields. These developments have led to more direct
communication between humans and LLMs in various situations, such as social
companionship and psychological support. However, LLMs often exhibit
limitations in emotional perception and social competence during real-world
conversations. These limitations partly originate from their inability to adapt
their communication style and emotional expression to different social and task
contexts. In this work, we introduce PersonaFuse, a novel LLM post-training
framework that enables LLMs to adapt and express different personalities for
varying situations. Inspired by Trait Activation Theory and the Big Five
personality model, PersonaFuse employs a Mixture-of-Expert architecture that
combines persona adapters with a dynamic routing network, enabling contextual
trait expression. Experimental results show that PersonaFuse substantially
outperforms baseline models across multiple dimensions of social-emotional
intelligence. Importantly, these gains are achieved without sacrificing general
reasoning ability or model safety, which remain common limitations of direct
prompting and supervised fine-tuning approaches. PersonaFuse also delivers
consistent improvements in downstream human-centered applications, such as
mental health counseling and review-based customer service. Finally, human
preference evaluations against leading LLMs, including GPT-4o and DeepSeek,
demonstrate that PersonaFuse achieves competitive response quality despite its
comparatively smaller model size. These findings demonstrate that
PersonaFuse~offers a theoretically grounded and practical approach for
developing social-emotional enhanced LLMs, marking a significant advancement
toward more human-centric AI systems.

Method: 提出新颖实验框架，让LLM智能体与仅懂新构造语言Tinkatongue的机器人对话，评估其语言习得能力

Result: LLM智能体在100次响应内无法建立有效对话，但采用了与人类语言学习相似的策略

Conclusion: 结果为评估基准提供了新方向，为设计能更有效从交互反馈中学习的模型开辟了途径

Abstract: Existing evaluation studies on linguistic competence of large language models
(LLM agents) have focused primarily on vocabulary learning, morphological rule
induction, syntactic generalization, pragmatic inference, and cross-linguistic
transfer. However, none assess whether LLM agents can acquire a language
through pattern recognition and interactive feedback, a central feature of
human language acquisition. We propose a novel experimental framework in which
an LLM agent is evaluated on its ability to acquire and use a newly constructed
language (Tinkatongue) in conversation with a bot that understands only
Tinkatongue. Our findings show that LLM agents fail to establish a conversation
within 100 responses, yet they adopt distinct strategies that mirror human
approaches to language learning. The results suggest a new direction for
evaluation benchmarks and open pathways to model designs that learn more
effectively from interactive feedback.

Abstract: Integrating knowledge graphs (KGs) into the reasoning processes of large
language models (LLMs) has emerged as a promising approach to mitigate
hallucination. However, existing work in this area often relies on proprietary
or extremely large models, limiting accessibility and scalability. In this
study, we investigate the capabilities of existing integration methods for
small language models (SLMs) in KG-based question answering and observe that
their performance is often constrained by their limited ability to traverse and
reason over knowledge graphs. To address this limitation, we propose leveraging
simple and efficient exploration modules to handle knowledge graph traversal in
place of the language model itself. Experiment results demonstrate that these
lightweight modules effectively improve the performance of small language
models on knowledge graph question answering tasks. Source code:

Motivation: 现有基准测试往往忽视长上下文场景下的情感智能，特别是在现实、实用的设置中，交互往往是冗长、多样且嘈杂的。需要向更现实的环境推进，评估LLMs在长上下文中的情感智能能力。

Method: 1) 构建LongEmotion基准测试，包含情感分类、检测、问答、对话、总结和表达6类任务；2) 提出两种方法：RAG（利用对话上下文和LLM自身作为检索源）和CoEM（将任务分解为5个阶段，结合检索增强和有限知识注入）；3) 在GPT系列模型上进行对比实验。

Result: 实验结果表明，RAG和CoEM方法在大多数长上下文任务中都能持续提升情感智能相关性能，推动LLMs向更实用和真实世界的情感智能应用发展。

Conclusion: LongEmotion基准测试填补了长上下文情感智能评估的空白，提出的RAG和CoEM方法有效提升了LLMs在长上下文情感任务中的表现，为实际应用提供了有力支持。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) make significant progress in Emotional
Intelligence (EI) and long-context understanding. However, existing benchmarks
tend to overlook certain aspects of EI in long-context scenarios, especially
under realistic, practical settings where interactions are lengthy, diverse,
and often noisy. To move towards such realistic settings, we present
LongEmotion, a benchmark specifically designed for long-context EI tasks. It
covers a diverse set of tasks, including Emotion Classification, Emotion
Detection, Emotion QA, Emotion Conversation, Emotion Summary, and Emotion
Expression. On average, the input length for these tasks reaches 8,777 tokens,
with long-form generation required for Emotion Expression. To enhance
performance under realistic constraints, we incorporate Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) and Collaborative Emotional Modeling (CoEM), and compare them
with standard prompt-based methods. Unlike conventional approaches, our RAG
method leverages both the conversation context and the large language model
itself as retrieval sources, avoiding reliance on external knowledge bases. The
CoEM method further improves performance by decomposing the task into five
stages, integrating both retrieval augmentation and limited knowledge
injection. Experimental results show that both RAG and CoEM consistently
enhance EI-related performance across most long-context tasks, advancing LLMs
toward more practical and real-world EI applications. Furthermore, we conducted
a comparative case study experiment on the GPT series to demonstrate the
differences among various models in terms of EI. Code is available on GitHub at

GBERT, Qwen3 Embedding, and XLM-RoBERTa. We find that a multilingual
XLM-RoBERTa-Large model trained to detect candy speech at the span level
outperforms other approaches, ranking first in both binary positive F1: 0.8906)
and categorized span-based detection (strict F1: 0.6307) subtasks at the
GermEval 2025 Shared Task on Candy Speech Detection. We speculate that
span-based training, multilingual capabilities, and emoji-aware tokenizers
improved detection performance. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of
multilingual models in identifying positive, supportive language.

Motivation: 解决医疗保健中污名化语言导致的不平等问题，目前缺乏 universally accepted 的标准化污名化语言词典来明确定义构成医疗保健中污名化语言的词汇、术语或短语。

Method: 通过系统文献检索识别现有的污名化语言词典，然后进行对比分析，考察：1）这些词典之间的相似性和差异；2）基于已建立的情感数据集，分析积极、消极或中性术语的分布情况。

Result: 检索识别出四种词典，分析结果显示它们具有中等语义相似性，大多数污名化术语与临床医生描述感知负面行为的评判性表达相关。情感分析显示负面分类术语占主导地位，但不同词典间存在差异。

Abstract: Stigmatizing language results in healthcare inequities, yet there is no
universally accepted or standardized lexicon defining which words, terms, or
phrases constitute stigmatizing language in healthcare. We conducted a
systematic search of the literature to identify existing stigmatizing language
lexicons and then analyzed them comparatively to examine: 1) similarities and
discrepancies between these lexicons, and 2) the distribution of positive,
negative, or neutral terms based on an established sentiment dataset. Our
search identified four lexicons. The analysis results revealed moderate
semantic similarity among them, and that most stigmatizing terms are related to
judgmental expressions by clinicians to describe perceived negative behaviors.
Sentiment analysis showed a predominant proportion of negatively classified
terms, though variations exist across lexicons. Our findings underscore the
need for a standardized lexicon and highlight challenges in defining
stigmatizing language in clinical texts.

Abstract: Detecting content that contradicts or is unsupported by a given source text
is a critical challenge for the safe deployment of generative language models.
We introduce HALT-RAG, a post-hoc verification system designed to identify
hallucinations in the outputs of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
pipelines. Our flexible and task-adaptable framework uses a universal feature
set derived from an ensemble of two frozen, off-the-shelf Natural Language
Inference (NLI) models and lightweight lexical signals. These features are used
to train a simple, calibrated, and task-adapted meta-classifier. Using a
rigorous 5-fold out-of-fold (OOF) training protocol to prevent data leakage and
produce unbiased estimates, we evaluate our system on the HaluEval benchmark.
By pairing our universal feature set with a lightweight, task-adapted
classifier and a precision-constrained decision policy, HALT-RAG achieves
strong OOF F1-scores of 0.7756, 0.9786, and 0.7391 on the summarization, QA,

enable a practical abstention mechanism, providing a reliable tool for

Abstract: Many contemporary data-driven research efforts in the natural sciences, such
as chemistry and materials science, require large-scale, high-performance
entity recognition from scientific datasets. Large language models (LLMs) have
increasingly been adopted to solve the entity recognition task, with the same
trend being observed on all-spectrum NLP tasks. The prevailing entity
recognition LLMs rely on fine-tuned technology, yet the fine-tuning process
often incurs significant cost. To achieve a best performance-cost trade-off, we
propose ALLabel, a three-stage framework designed to select the most
informative and representative samples in preparing the demonstrations for LLM
modeling. The annotated examples are used to construct a ground-truth retrieval
corpus for LLM in-context learning. By sequentially employing three distinct
active learning strategies, ALLabel consistently outperforms all baselines
under the same annotation budget across three specialized domain datasets.
Experimental results also demonstrate that selectively annotating only 5\%-10\%
of the dataset with ALLabel can achieve performance comparable to the method
annotating the entire dataset. Further analyses and ablation studies verify the
effectiveness and generalizability of our proposal.

TL;DR: 提出VeriOS-Agent，一个可信的操作系统代理，通过查询驱动的人机交互框架在不可信环境下主动向人类查询，提高任务执行可靠性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有操作系统代理主要针对理想化环境设计，而现实环境往往存在不可信条件，需要降低过度执行的风险

Method: 基于查询驱动的人机-GUI交互框架，采用两阶段学习范式，分离和利用元知识，在正常条件下自主执行，在不可信场景中主动查询人类

Result: 在不可信场景中平均步骤成功率比最先进方法提高20.64%，且不影响正常性能表现

Conclusion: VeriOS-Agent展现出良好的合理性、泛化性和可扩展性，为可信操作系统代理提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: With the rapid progress of multimodal large language models, operating system
(OS) agents become increasingly capable of automating tasks through on-device
graphical user interfaces (GUIs). However, most existing OS agents are designed
for idealized settings, whereas real-world environments often present
untrustworthy conditions. To mitigate risks of over-execution in such
scenarios, we propose a query-driven human-agent-GUI interaction framework that
enables OS agents to decide when to query humans for more reliable task
completion. Built upon this framework, we introduce VeriOS-Agent, a trustworthy
OS agent trained with a two-stage learning paradigm that falicitate the
decoupling and utilization of meta-knowledge. Concretely, VeriOS-Agent
autonomously executes actions in normal conditions while proactively querying
humans in untrustworthy scenarios. Experiments show that VeriOS-Agent improves
the average step-wise success rate by 20.64\% in untrustworthy scenarios over
the state-of-the-art, without compromising normal performance. Analysis
highlights VeriOS-Agent's rationality, generalizability, and scalability. The
codes, datasets and models are available at

TL;DR: 提出IRAKE方法解决检索增强知识编辑在多跳问答中的编辑跳过问题，通过引导分解和迭代检索来提升知识编辑效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型知识快速过时，重新训练成本高，现有基于检索增强的知识编辑方法在处理多跳问答时存在编辑跳过问题，无法有效利用编辑后的知识

Method: 提出迭代检索增强知识编辑方法(IRAKE)，通过单编辑事实和完整编辑案例的引导进行分解，采用迭代检索策略来缓解编辑跳过问题

Result: 实验结果表明IRAKE能够有效缓解编辑跳过导致的编辑失败，在多跳问答的知识编辑任务上优于现有最先进方法

Conclusion: IRAKE通过引导分解和迭代检索有效解决了多跳问答中的知识编辑挑战，为知识更新提供了更有效的解决方案

Abstract: In a rapidly evolving world where information updates swiftly, knowledge in
large language models (LLMs) becomes outdated quickly. Retraining LLMs is not a
cost-effective option, making knowledge editing (KE) without modifying
parameters particularly necessary. We find that although existing
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-based KE methods excel at editing simple
knowledge, they struggle with KE in multi-hop question answering due to the
issue of "edit skipping", which refers to skipping the relevant edited fact in
inference. In addition to the diversity of natural language expressions of
knowledge, edit skipping also arises from the mismatch between the granularity
of LLMs in problem-solving and the facts in the edited memory. To address this
issue, we propose a novel Iterative Retrieval-Augmented Knowledge Editing
method with guided decomposition (IRAKE) through the guidance from single
edited facts and entire edited cases. Experimental results demonstrate that
IRAKE mitigates the failure of editing caused by edit skipping and outperforms
state-of-the-art methods for KE in multi-hop question answering.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BALI是一种新颖的联合语言模型和知识图谱预训练方法，通过同时学习专用KG编码器和对齐LM与图谱表示，将外部知识增强到语言模型中，提升生物医学文本理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生物医学LLM对复杂领域特定概念结构和生物医学知识图谱中编码的事实信息理解有限，需要更好的方法来整合外部知识。

Method: 提出BALI方法，将文本中的生物医学概念链接到UMLS知识图谱，利用局部KG子图作为跨模态正样本进行表示对齐，联合训练LM和KG编码器。

Result: 在PubMedBERT和BioLinkBERT等生物医学LM上实施该方法，即使在小规模PubMed摘要数据集上进行最小预训练，也能提升语言理解任务性能和实体表示质量。

Conclusion: BALI方法有效增强了生物医学语言模型的知识理解能力，通过知识图谱对齐显著提升了模型在生物医学文本理解任务上的表现。

Abstract: In recent years, there has been substantial progress in using pretrained
Language Models (LMs) on a range of tasks aimed at improving the understanding
of biomedical texts. Nonetheless, existing biomedical LLMs show limited
comprehension of complex, domain-specific concept structures and the factual
information encoded in biomedical Knowledge Graphs (KGs). In this work, we
propose BALI (Biomedical Knowledge Graph and Language Model Alignment), a novel
joint LM and KG pre-training method that augments an LM with external knowledge
by the simultaneous learning of a dedicated KG encoder and aligning the
representations of both the LM and the graph. For a given textual sequence, we
link biomedical concept mentions to the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS)
KG and utilize local KG subgraphs as cross-modal positive samples for these
mentions. Our empirical findings indicate that implementing our method on
several leading biomedical LMs, such as PubMedBERT and BioLinkBERT, improves
their performance on a range of language understanding tasks and the quality of
entity representations, even with minimal pre-training on a small alignment
dataset sourced from PubMed scientific abstracts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于迭代自提示技术(ISP)的临床病例文档摘要方法，使用大语言模型生成任务特定提示并通过少样本学习进行优化，在MultiClinSUM共享任务中取得了良好的语义相似度表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床报告通常冗长且包含大量专业术语，使得领域专家难以高效识别文档中的重要信息，影响了医患之间的有效沟通和共享决策。

Method: 采用迭代自提示技术(ISP)在大语言模型上，通过生成任务特定提示和基于示例的少样本学习进行优化，同时使用ROUGE和BERT-score等词汇和嵌入空间指标来指导模型微调。

Result: 使用GPT-4和GPT-4o的视角感知ISP方法在3,396份临床病例报告上获得了ROUGE分数(46.53, 24.68, 30.77)和BERT分数(87.84, 83.25, 85.46)，高BERT分数表明模型生成的摘要与参考摘要语义等价。

Conclusion: 视角感知ISP技术可以有效地应用于临床报告摘要任务，支持改善医患之间的沟通效果，尽管词汇层面的重叠度较低，但语义相似度表现优异。

Abstract: Efficient communication between patients and clinicians plays an important
role in shared decision-making. However, clinical reports are often lengthy and
filled with clinical jargon, making it difficult for domain experts to identify
important aspects in the document efficiently. This paper presents the
methodology we applied in the MultiClinSUM shared task for summarising clinical
case documents. We used an Iterative Self-Prompting technique on large language
models (LLMs) by asking LLMs to generate task-specific prompts and refine them
via example-based few-shot learning. Furthermore, we used lexical and embedding
space metrics, ROUGE and BERT-score, to guide the model fine-tuning with
epochs. Our submission using perspective-aware ISP on GPT-4 and GPT-4o achieved
ROUGE scores (46.53, 24.68, 30.77) and BERTscores (87.84, 83.25, 85.46) for (P,
R, F1) from the official evaluation on 3,396 clinical case reports from various
specialties extracted from open journals. The high BERTscore indicates that the
model produced semantically equivalent output summaries compared to the
references, even though the overlap at the exact lexicon level is lower, as
reflected in the lower ROUGE scores. This work sheds some light on how
perspective-aware ISP (PA-ISP) can be deployed for clinical report
summarisation and support better communication between patients and clinicians.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MoLoRAG是一个逻辑感知的多模态多页文档检索框架，通过构建页面图捕获页面间逻辑关系，结合语义和逻辑相关性进行更准确的检索，在四个DocQA数据集上平均准确率提升9.68%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法将文档转为文本处理会丢失多模态信息（如图表），而大型视觉语言模型受限于输入长度无法处理多页文档。现有的检索增强生成方法仅依赖语义相关性，忽略了页面间的逻辑连接关系。

Method: 构建页面图捕获页面间上下文关系，使用轻量级VLM进行图遍历检索相关页面（包括逻辑相关的页面），结合语义和逻辑相关性。提供无需训练的部署方案和可微调版本两种变体。

Result: 在四个文档问答数据集上，相比LVLM直接推理平均准确率提升9.68%，相比基线方法检索精度提升7.44%。

Conclusion: MoLoRAG通过逻辑感知的检索框架有效解决了多模态多页文档理解问题，证明了结合语义和逻辑相关性的重要性，为文档理解任务提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Document Understanding is a foundational AI capability with broad
applications, and Document Question Answering (DocQA) is a key evaluation task.
Traditional methods convert the document into text for processing by Large
Language Models (LLMs), but this process strips away critical multi-modal
information like figures. While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) address
this limitation, their constrained input size makes multi-page document
comprehension infeasible. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods mitigate
this by selecting relevant pages, but they rely solely on semantic relevance,
ignoring logical connections between pages and the query, which is essential
for reasoning.
  To this end, we propose MoLoRAG, a logic-aware retrieval framework for
multi-modal, multi-page document understanding. By constructing a page graph
that captures contextual relationships between pages, a lightweight VLM
performs graph traversal to retrieve relevant pages, including those with
logical connections often overlooked. This approach combines semantic and
logical relevance to deliver more accurate retrieval. After retrieval, the
top-$K$ pages are fed into arbitrary LVLMs for question answering. To enhance
flexibility, MoLoRAG offers two variants: a training-free solution for easy
deployment and a fine-tuned version to improve logical relevance checking.
Experiments on four DocQA datasets demonstrate average improvements of 9.68% in
accuracy over LVLM direct inference and 7.44% in retrieval precision over
baselines. Codes and datasets are released at
https://github.com/WxxShirley/MoLoRAG.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 关系抽取中手动标注训练数据成本高昂，目标关系在文本中稀少且难以发现。LLMs在多分类设置下难以全面捕捉每个关系语义，而二元分类又带来计算开销问题。

Method: M-BRe框架包含三个模块：关系分组（将相似关系聚类）、关系提取（使用LLMs进行关系识别）、标签决策（确定最终关系标签），结合了多分类和二元分类的优点。

Result: 大量实验证实该框架能够从未标注文本中发现高质量的训练样本，在关系抽取任务上表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: M-BRe框架有效解决了LLMs在关系抽取中的语义捕捉不足和计算效率问题，为自动构建训练数据提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: For Relation Extraction (RE), the manual annotation of training data may be
prohibitively expensive, since the sentences that contain the target relations
in texts can be very scarce and difficult to find. It is therefore beneficial
to develop an efficient method that can automatically extract training
instances from unlabeled texts for training RE models. Recently, large language
models (LLMs) have been adopted in various natural language processing tasks,
with RE also benefiting from their advances. However, when leveraging LLMs for
RE with predefined relation categories, two key challenges arise. First, in a
multi-class classification setting, LLMs often struggle to comprehensively
capture the semantics of every relation, leading to suboptimal results. Second,
although employing binary classification for each relation individually can
mitigate this issue, it introduces significant computational overhead,
resulting in impractical time complexity for real-world applications.
Therefore, this paper proposes a framework called M-BRe to extract training
instances from unlabeled texts for RE. It utilizes three modules to combine the
advantages of both of the above classification approaches: Relation Grouping,
Relation Extraction, and Label Decision. Extensive experiments confirm its
superior capability in discovering high-quality training samples from unlabeled
texts for RE.

TL;DR: 医疗领域水印技术存在事实性风险，现有方法在低熵度环境下会弱化医学实体表达，需要领域特定的水印方案来保护医疗内容整体性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在医疗等敏感领域的应用，水印技术的可靠性成为关键安全问题，现有评测标准忽视了低熵度设置下的事实性风险。

Method: 提出了一个专门针对医疗领域的评估流程，结合评估事实准确性和连贯性，使用GPT-Judger和人工验证，并引入事实性加权分数（FWS）进行综合评测。

Result: 评估结果显示当前的水印方法在医疗领域对事实性造成了显著弊病，熵度偏移导致医学实体表达能力下降。

Conclusion: 医疗领域需要特定的水印方案，以确保医疗内容的事实性和整体性，当前的通用水印技术在医疗场景中存在显著的安全风险。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) adapted to sensitive domains such as
medicine, their fluency raises safety risks, particularly regarding provenance
and accountability. Watermarking embeds detectable patterns to mitigate these
risks, yet its reliability in medical contexts remains untested. Existing
benchmarks focus on detection-quality tradeoffs, overlooking factual risks
under low-entropy settings often exploited by watermarking's reweighting
strategy. We propose a medical-focused evaluation workflow that jointly
assesses factual accuracy and coherence. Using GPT-Judger and further human
validation, we introduce the Factuality-Weighted Score (FWS), a composite
metric prioritizing factual accuracy beyond coherence to guide watermarking
deployment in medical domains. Our evaluation shows current watermarking
methods substantially compromise medical factuality, with entropy shifts
degrading medical entity representation. These findings underscore the need for
domain-aware watermarking approaches that preserve the integrity of medical
content.

Motivation: 线上平台上假新闻、两极分化和有害内容的传播是严重问题，需要系统性地对比不同大语言模型在该任务上的表现

Method: 在10个数据集和5种语言上进行实验，测试了从参数高效细调到各种上下文学习策略（零棕、代码本、少棕、思维链）

Result: 上下文学习经常表现较细调差，小模型经过任务特定细调后能超过大模型的上下文学习表现

Conclusion: 细调在假新闻检测任务中至关重要，即使是较小模型也能通过细调获得更好的性能

Abstract: The spread of fake news, polarizing, politically biased, and harmful content
on online platforms has been a serious concern. With large language models
becoming a promising approach, however, no study has properly benchmarked their
performance across different models, usage methods, and languages. This study
presents a comprehensive overview of different Large Language Models adaptation
paradigms for the detection of hyperpartisan and fake news, harmful tweets, and
political bias. Our experiments spanned 10 datasets and 5 different languages
(English, Spanish, Portuguese, Arabic and Bulgarian), covering both binary and
multiclass classification scenarios. We tested different strategies ranging
from parameter efficient Fine-Tuning of language models to a variety of
different In-Context Learning strategies and prompts. These included zero-shot
prompts, codebooks, few-shot (with both randomly-selected and
diversely-selected examples using Determinantal Point Processes), and
Chain-of-Thought. We discovered that In-Context Learning often underperforms
when compared to Fine-Tuning a model. This main finding highlights the
importance of Fine-Tuning even smaller models on task-specific settings even
when compared to the largest models evaluated in an In-Context Learning setup -
in our case LlaMA3.1-8b-Instruct, Mistral-Nemo-Instruct-2407 and
Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct.

Abstract: Structured information extraction from scientific literature is crucial for
capturing core concepts and emerging trends in specialized fields. While
existing datasets aid model development, most focus on specific publication
sections due to domain complexity and the high cost of annotating scientific
texts. To address this limitation, we introduce SciNLP - a specialized
benchmark for full-text entity and relation extraction in the Natural Language
Processing (NLP) domain. The dataset comprises 60 manually annotated full-text
NLP publications, covering 7,072 entities and 1,826 relations. Compared to
existing research, SciNLP is the first dataset providing full-text annotations
of entities and their relationships in the NLP domain. To validate the
effectiveness of SciNLP, we conducted comparative experiments with similar
datasets and evaluated the performance of state-of-the-art supervised models on
this dataset. Results reveal varying extraction capabilities of existing models
across academic texts of different lengths. Cross-comparisons with existing
datasets show that SciNLP achieves significant performance improvements on
certain baseline models. Using models trained on SciNLP, we implemented
automatic construction of a fine-grained knowledge graph for the NLP domain.
Our KG has an average node degree of 3.2 per entity, indicating rich semantic
topological information that enhances downstream applications. The dataset is
publicly available at https://github.com/AKADDC/SciNLP.

<details>

Motivation: 现有方法存在两个局限：1）忽视非结构化评论知识；2）未充分利用大语言模型。需要充分利用双知识和LLM来提升多模态对话系统的文本响应生成

Method: 提出双知识增强的两阶段推理器DK2R：首先从外部知识库提取结构化和非结构化知识，然后使用LLM评估每种知识的效用，最后通过专用推理总结意图导向关键线索来增强LLM的响应生成

Result: 在公共数据集上的大量实验验证了DK2R的优越性

Conclusion: DK2R方法有效解决了动态知识类型选择和意图-响应解耦两个关键挑战，显著提升了多模态任务导向对话系统的文本响应生成性能

Abstract: Textual response generation is pivotal for multimodal \mbox{task-oriented}
dialog systems, which aims to generate proper textual responses based on the
multimodal context. While existing efforts have demonstrated remarkable
progress, there still exist the following limitations: 1) \textit{neglect of
unstructured review knowledge} and 2) \textit{underutilization of large
language models (LLMs)}. Inspired by this, we aim to fully utilize dual
knowledge (\textit{i.e., } structured attribute and unstructured review
knowledge) with LLMs to promote textual response generation in multimodal
task-oriented dialog systems. However, this task is non-trivial due to two key
challenges: 1) \textit{dynamic knowledge type selection} and 2)
\textit{intention-response decoupling}. To address these challenges, we propose
a novel dual knowledge-enhanced two-stage reasoner by adapting LLMs for
multimodal dialog systems (named DK2R). To be specific, DK2R first extracts
both structured attribute and unstructured review knowledge from external
knowledge base given the dialog context. Thereafter, DK2R uses an LLM to
evaluate each knowledge type's utility by analyzing LLM-generated provisional
probe responses. Moreover, DK2R separately summarizes the intention-oriented
key clues via dedicated reasoning, which are further used as auxiliary signals
to enhance LLM-based textual response generation. Extensive experiments
conducted on a public dataset verify the superiority of DK2R. We have released
the codes and parameters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决小规模开源模型在文学翻译这一复杂任务中的性能问题，为低资源语言（如罗马尼亚语）提供高质量文学数据集和高效翻译解决方案。

Method: 采用两阶段微调流程：先进行指令调优以捕捉特定体裁的叙事风格，然后使用适配器压缩进行高效部署；结合BLEU和基于LLM的五维度评估标准。

Result: 微调后的模型在流畅性和准确性方面与顶级专有大模型竞争力相当，同时具有开源、易获取和显著成本效益的优势。

Conclusion: TF2提供了一个端到端、可复现的管道，为成本效益翻译、跨语言叙事生成以及在低资源环境中广泛采用开源模型处理文化重要文学内容提供了解决方案。

Abstract: Literary translation has recently gained attention as a distinct and complex
task in machine translation research. However, the translation by small open
models remains an open problem. We contribute to this ongoing research by
introducing TINYFABULIST TRANSLATION FRAMEWORK (TF2), a unified framework for
dataset creation, fine tuning, and evaluation in English-Romanian literary
translations, centred on the creation and open release of both a compact, fine
tuned language model (TF2-12B) and large scale synthetic parallel datasets
(DS-TF2-EN-RO-3M and DS-TF2-EN-RO-15K). Building on DS-TF1-EN-3M (TF1), the
largest collection of synthetic English fables to date, we address the need for
rich, high quality literary datasets in low resource languages such as
Romanian. Our pipeline first generates 15k high quality Romanian references
from the TF1 pool using a high performing LLM. We then apply a two stage fine
tuning process to a 12B parameter open weight model: (i) instruction tuning to
capture genre specific narrative style, and (ii) adapter compression for
efficient deployment. Evaluation combines corpus level BLEU and a five
dimension LLM based rubric (accuracy, fluency, coherence, style, cultural
adaptation) to provide a nuanced assessment of translation quality. Results
show that our fine tuned model achieves fluency and adequacy competitive with
top performing large proprietary models, while being open, accessible, and
significantly more cost effective. Alongside the fine tuned model and both
datasets, we publicly release all scripts and evaluation prompts. TF2 thus
provides an end-to-end, reproducible pipeline for research on cost efficient
translation, cross lingual narrative generation, and the broad adoption of open
models for culturally significant literary content in low resource settings.

Motivation: 研究人类标注者是否也像LLM一样对指令变化敏感，以探讨LLM的提示词脆弱性是否反映了人类标注的天然方差。

Method: 通过文本分类任务，对LLM和人类标注者使用相同的提示词变体，系统比较两者对提示词修改的反应。

Result: 人类和LLM都对标签集和标签格式的变化表现出脆弱性，但人类对拼写错误和标签顺序反转的敏感性较低。

Conclusion: LLM的提示词脆弱性在一定程度上反映了人类标注的天然方差，但LLM对某些类型的提示词修改更加敏感。

Abstract: The output of large language models (LLM) is unstable, due to both
non-determinism of the decoding process as well as to prompt brittleness. While
the intrinsic non-determinism of LLM generation may mimic existing uncertainty
in human annotations through distributional shifts in outputs, it is largely
assumed, yet unexplored, that the prompt brittleness effect is unique to LLMs.
This raises the question: do human annotators show similar sensitivity to
instruction changes? If so, should prompt brittleness in LLMs be considered
problematic? One may alternatively hypothesize that prompt brittleness
correctly reflects human annotation variances. To fill this research gap, we
systematically compare the effects of prompt modifications on LLMs and
identical instruction modifications for human annotators, focusing on the
question of whether humans are similarly sensitive to prompt perturbations. To
study this, we prompt both humans and LLMs for a set of text classification
tasks conditioned on prompt variations. Our findings indicate that both humans
and LLMs exhibit increased brittleness in response to specific types of prompt
modifications, particularly those involving the substitution of alternative
label sets or label formats. However, the distribution of human judgments is
less affected by typographical errors and reversed label order than that of
LLMs.

Conclusion: 所提出的方法在中文性别偏见检测与缓解任务中取得了良好效果，证明了基于大语言模型微调和多策略集成的有效性

Abstract: This paper presents our team's solution to Shared Task 7 of NLPCC-2025, which
focuses on sentence-level gender bias detection and mitigation in Chinese. The
task aims to promote fairness and controllability in natural language
generation by automatically detecting, classifying, and mitigating gender bias.
To address this challenge, we adopt a fine-tuning approach based on large
language models (LLMs), efficiently adapt to the bias detection task via
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). In terms of data processing, we construct a more
balanced training set to alleviate class imbalance and introduce heterogeneous
samples from multiple sources to enhance model generalization. For the
detection and classification sub-tasks, we employ a majority voting strategy
that integrates outputs from multiple expert models to boost performance.
Additionally, to improve bias generation detection and mitigation, we design a
multi-temperature sampling mechanism to capture potential variations in bias
expression styles. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach in bias detection, classification, and mitigation. Our method
ultimately achieves an average score of 47.90%, ranking fourth in the shared
task.

TL;DR: Biased Tales数据集分析发现LLM生成的故事中存在显著的性别和文化刻板印象：女性主角外貌描述增加55.26%，非西方儿童故事过度强调文化遗产和家庭主题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着家长越来越多地使用大型语言模型生成睡前故事，这些叙事中存在的文化和性别刻板印象问题亟待解决

Method: 创建Biased Tales数据集，分析LLM生成故事中主角属性和故事元素如何受到偏见影响

Result: 发现明显差异：女性主角外貌相关属性增加55.26%；非西方儿童故事过度强调文化遗产、传统和家庭主题

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了社会文化偏见在使创意AI使用更加公平和多样化方面的重要作用

Abstract: Stories play a pivotal role in human communication, shaping beliefs and
morals, particularly in children. As parents increasingly rely on large
language models (LLMs) to craft bedtime stories, the presence of cultural and
gender stereotypes in these narratives raises significant concerns. To address
this issue, we present Biased Tales, a comprehensive dataset designed to
analyze how biases influence protagonists' attributes and story elements in
LLM-generated stories. Our analysis uncovers striking disparities. When the
protagonist is described as a girl (as compared to a boy), appearance-related
attributes increase by 55.26%. Stories featuring non-Western children
disproportionately emphasize cultural heritage, tradition, and family themes
far more than those for Western children. Our findings highlight the role of
sociocultural bias in making creative AI use more equitable and diverse.

*Tuo Wang,Adithya Kulkarni,Tyler Cody,Peter A. Beling,Yujun Yan,Dawei Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GENUINE是一个基于图结构的多层次不确定性估计框架，通过依赖解析树和分层图池化来改进LLM的不确定性量化，在NLP任务中比语义熵方法AUROC提升29%，校准误差降低15%以上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有不确定性估计方法往往忽略语义依赖关系，仅依赖token级别的概率度量，无法捕捉生成文本中的结构关系，这在高风险应用中影响LLM的可靠性。

Method: 提出GENUINE框架，利用依赖解析树和分层图池化技术，通过监督学习有效建模语义和结构关系，改进置信度评估。

Result: 在多个NLP任务上的广泛实验显示，GENUINE比基于语义熵的方法AUROC提升高达29%，校准误差减少超过15%。

Conclusion: 图基础的不确定性建模方法有效，GENUINE框架显著提升了LLM不确定性估计的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: Uncertainty estimation is essential for enhancing the reliability of Large
Language Models (LLMs), particularly in high-stakes applications. Existing
methods often overlook semantic dependencies, relying on token-level
probability measures that fail to capture structural relationships within the
generated text. We propose GENUINE: Graph ENhanced mUlti-level uncertaINty
Estimation for Large Language Models, a structure-aware framework that
leverages dependency parse trees and hierarchical graph pooling to refine
uncertainty quantification. By incorporating supervised learning, GENUINE
effectively models semantic and structural relationships, improving confidence
assessments. Extensive experiments across NLP tasks show that GENUINE achieves
up to 29% higher AUROC than semantic entropy-based approaches and reduces
calibration errors by over 15%, demonstrating the effectiveness of graph-based
uncertainty modeling. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Parallel-R1是一个强化学习框架，通过渐进式课程训练使大语言模型具备并行思考能力，在数学推理任务上相比顺序思考模型提升8.4%准确率，并可作为训练中的探索支架带来42.9%的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖监督微调合成数据，鼓励教师强制模仿而非探索和泛化，难以有效训练并行思考能力。

Method: 提出首个强化学习框架Parallel-R1，采用渐进式课程：先用SFT在简单任务上植入并行思考能力，然后过渡到RL在困难问题上探索和泛化该技能。

Result: 在MATH、AMC23、AIME等数学基准测试中，相比直接在挑战性任务上用RL训练的序列思考模型，准确率提升8.4%。并行思考作为训练中的探索支架，在AIME25上比基线提升42.9%。

Conclusion: Parallel-R1成功培养了并行思考能力，早期作为探索策略，后期用于多视角验证，验证了并行思考作为训练中探索支架的有效性。

Abstract: Parallel thinking has emerged as a novel approach for enhancing the reasoning
capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by exploring multiple reasoning
paths concurrently. However, activating such capabilities through training
remains challenging, as existing methods predominantly rely on supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) over synthetic data, which encourages teacher-forced
imitation rather than exploration and generalization. Different from them, we
propose \textbf{Parallel-R1}, the first reinforcement learning (RL) framework
that enables parallel thinking behaviors for complex real-world reasoning
tasks. Our framework employs a progressive curriculum that explicitly addresses
the cold-start problem in training parallel thinking with RL. We first use SFT
on prompt-generated trajectories from easier tasks to instill the parallel
thinking ability, then transition to RL to explore and generalize this skill on
harder problems. Experiments on various math benchmarks, including MATH, AMC23,
and AIME, show that Parallel-R1 successfully instills parallel thinking,
leading to 8.4% accuracy improvements over the sequential thinking model
trained directly on challenging tasks with RL. Further analysis reveals a clear
shift in the model's thinking behavior: at an early stage, it uses parallel
thinking as an exploration strategy, while in a later stage, it uses the same
capability for multi-perspective verification. Most significantly, we validate
parallel thinking as a \textbf{mid-training exploration scaffold}, where this
temporary exploratory phase unlocks a higher performance ceiling after RL,
yielding a 42.9% improvement over the baseline on AIME25. Our model, data, and
code will be open-source at https://github.com/zhengkid/Parallel-R1.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于偏差最大化方法的优化模型，结合区间值Fermatean模糊集来处理多准则决策中的不确定性和模糊性，并将其应用于可再生能源选择问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多准则决策方法在不确定、复杂和冲突情况下帮助决策者做出更好决策。模糊集理论能有效处理人类思维和感知中的不确定性，特别是Fermatean模糊环境作为模糊集的推广，能更好地处理决策判断中的模糊性。选择可再生能源是因为满足可再生能源需求、平衡碳排放和缓解全球气候变化影响是当前最关键的议题。

Method: 提出基于偏差最大化方法的优化模型来确定部分已知特征权重，该方法与区间值Fermatean模糊集相结合。将提出的方法应用于可再生能源选择问题。

Result: 研究开发了一种新的决策支持方法，能够有效处理可再生能源选择中的不确定性和模糊判断问题。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅解决了可再生能源选择这一技术问题，还讨论了其管理和政策层面的重要意义，为复杂环境下的多准则决策提供了有效的工具。

Abstract: Multi-criteria decision-making methods provide decision-makers with
appropriate tools to make better decisions in uncertain, complex, and
conflicting situations. Fuzzy set theory primarily deals with the uncertainty
inherent in human thoughts and perceptions and attempts to quantify this
uncertainty. Fuzzy logic and fuzzy set theory are utilized with multi-criteria
decision-making methods because they effectively handle uncertainty and
fuzziness in decision-makers' judgments, allowing for verbal judgments of the
problem. This study utilizes the Fermatean fuzzy environment, a generalization
of fuzzy sets. An optimization model based on the deviation maximization method
is proposed to determine partially known feature weights. This method is
combined with interval-valued Fermatean fuzzy sets. The proposed method was
applied to the problem of selecting renewable energy sources. The reason for
choosing renewable energy sources is that meeting energy needs from renewable
sources, balancing carbon emissions, and mitigating the effects of global
climate change are among the most critical issues of the recent period. Even
though selecting renewable energy sources is a technical issue, the managerial
and political implications of this issue are also important, and are discussed
in this study.

TL;DR: Spectral NSR是一个完全谱神经符号推理框架，通过图信号处理和拉普拉斯特征结构将逻辑规则嵌入为谱模板，在谱域直接进行推理，统一了符号推理的可解释性和谱学习的可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统神经符号推理方法在可扩展性和适应性方面存在局限，需要一种能够结合符号推理可解释性和神经网络学习能力的新框架。

Method: 利用图信号处理和基于拉普拉斯特征结构的频率选择性滤波器，将逻辑规则嵌入为谱模板，在知识图谱的谱域进行推理。包含动态图学习、有理滤波器、混合谱专家、证明引导训练等多种扩展。

Result: 在ProofWriter和CLUTRR等基准测试中表现出优越的准确性、更快的推理速度、更好的对抗鲁棒性和更高的可解释性，超越了transformer、消息传递神经网络等基线方法。

Conclusion: Spectral NSR为下一代推理系统提供了可扩展且原则性的基础，提供了超越传统方法的透明度、鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: We introduce Spectral NSR, a fully spectral neuro-symbolic reasoning
framework that embeds logical rules as spectral templates and performs
inference directly in the graph spectral domain. By leveraging graph signal
processing (GSP) and frequency-selective filters grounded in the Laplacian
eigenstructure of knowledge graphs, the architecture unifies the
interpretability of symbolic reasoning with the scalability and adaptability of
spectral learning. Beyond the core formulation, we incorporate a comprehensive
set of extensions, including dynamic graph and basis learning, rational and
diffusion filters for sharper spectral selectivity, mixture-of-spectral-experts
for modular specialization, proof-guided training with spectral curricula, and
uncertainty quantification for calibrated confidence. Additional enhancements
such as large language model coupling, co-spectral transfer alignment,
adversarial robustness, efficient GPU kernels, generalized Laplacians, and
causal interventions further expand the versatility of the framework.
  Empirical evaluation on state-of-the-art reasoning benchmarks such as
ProofWriter and CLUTRR demonstrates that Spectral NSR achieves superior
accuracy, faster inference, improved robustness to adversarial perturbations,
and higher interpretability compared to leading baselines including
transformers, message-passing neural networks, and neuro-symbolic logic
programming systems. Spectral attribution and proof-band agreement analyses
confirm that model decisions align closely with symbolic proof structures,
while transfer experiments validate effective domain adaptation through
co-spectral alignment. These results establish Spectral NSR as a scalable and
principled foundation for the next generation of reasoning systems, offering
transparency, robustness, and generalization beyond conventional approaches.

Motivation: 当前GUI代理在处理新颖UI元素、长时程动作和个性化轨迹的复杂任务时仍存在困难，需要更可靠的解决方案。

Method: 利用单次专家演示提取逐步指令，严格遵循用户预期轨迹执行，并配备验证器和回溯器模块来处理意外中断和提高鲁棒性。

Result: 在OSWorld的一组所有顶级代理都失败的任务上，Instruction Agent达到了60%的成功率。

Conclusion: Instruction Agent提供了一个实用且可扩展的框架，弥合了当前GUI代理与可靠真实世界GUI任务自动化之间的差距。

Abstract: Graphical user interface (GUI) agents have advanced rapidly but still
struggle with complex tasks involving novel UI elements, long-horizon actions,
and personalized trajectories. In this work, we introduce Instruction Agent, a
GUI agent that leverages expert demonstrations to solve such tasks, enabling
completion of otherwise difficult workflows. Given a single demonstration, the
agent extracts step-by-step instructions and executes them by strictly
following the trajectory intended by the user, which avoids making mistakes
during execution. The agent leverages the verifier and backtracker modules
further to improve robustness. Both modules are critical to understand the
current outcome from each action and handle unexpected interruptions(such as
pop-up windows) during execution. Our experiments show that Instruction Agent
achieves a 60% success rate on a set of tasks in OSWorld that all top-ranked
agents failed to complete. The Instruction Agent offers a practical and
extensible framework, bridging the gap between current GUI agents and reliable
real-world GUI task automation.

Abstract: Neurosymbolic (NeSy) frameworks combine neural representations and learning
with symbolic representations and reasoning. Combining the reasoning
capacities, explainability, and interpretability of symbolic processing with
the flexibility and power of neural computing allows us to solve complex
problems with more reliability while being data-efficient. However, this
recently growing topic poses a challenge to developers with its learning curve,
lack of user-friendly tools, libraries, and unifying frameworks. In this paper,
we characterize the technical facets of existing NeSy frameworks, such as the
symbolic representation language, integration with neural models, and the
underlying algorithms. A majority of the NeSy research focuses on algorithms
instead of providing generic frameworks for declarative problem specification
to leverage problem solving. To highlight the key aspects of Neurosymbolic
modeling, we showcase three generic NeSy frameworks - \textit{DeepProbLog},
\textit{Scallop}, and \textit{DomiKnowS}. We identify the challenges within
each facet that lay the foundation for identifying the expressivity of each
framework in solving a variety of problems. Building on this foundation, we aim
to spark transformative action and encourage the community to rethink this
problem in novel ways.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于一维卷积自编码器和LSTM的深度学习方法，用于从肌电噪声污染的皮肤神经活动中重建干净的信号，显著提高了信噪比和信号质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 皮肤神经活动(SKNA)是监测交感神经系统的重要非侵入性指标，但容易受到肌电(EMG)噪声污染，特别是在肌肉活动时传统滤波方法效果有限。

Method: 使用轻量级一维卷积自编码器配合LSTM瓶颈层，在留一受试者交叉验证框架下训练模型，从EMG污染的SKNA信号中重建干净信号。

Result: 方法将信噪比提高了9.65dB，与干净SKNA的相关系数从0.40提升到0.72，在严重噪声水平下对交感刺激的分类准确率达到91-98%。

Conclusion: 深度学习重建方法能够在显著EMG干扰下保留生理相关的交感神经爆发特征，为自然环境中更稳健的SKNA监测提供了可能。

Abstract: The sympathetic nervous system (SNS) plays a central role in regulating the
body's responses to stress and maintaining physiological stability. Its
dysregulation is associated with a wide range of conditions, from
cardiovascular disease to anxiety disorders. Skin nerve activity (SKNA)
extracted from high-frequency electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings provides a
noninvasive window into SNS dynamics, but its measurement is highly susceptible
to electromyographic (EMG) contamination. Traditional preprocessing based on
bandpass filtering within a fixed range (e.g., 500--1000 Hz) is susceptible to
overlapping EMG and SKNA spectral components, especially during sustained
muscle activity. We present a denoising approach using a lightweight
one-dimensional convolutional autoencoder with a long short-term memory (LSTM)
bottleneck to reconstruct clean SKNA from EMG-contaminated recordings. Using
clean ECG-derived SKNA data from cognitive stress experiments and EMG noise
from chaotic muscle stimulation recordings, we simulated contamination at
realistic noise levels (--4 dB, --8 dB signal-to-noise ratio) and trained the
model in the leave-one-subject-out cross-validation framework. The method
improved signal-to-noise ratio by up to 9.65 dB, increased cross correlation
with clean SKNA from 0.40 to 0.72, and restored burst-based SKNA features to
near-clean discriminability (AUROC $\geq$ 0.96). Classification of baseline
versus sympathetic stimulation (cognitive stress) conditions reached accuracies
of 91--98\% across severe noise levels, comparable to clean data. These results
demonstrate that deep learning--based reconstruction can preserve
physiologically relevant sympathetic bursts during substantial EMG
interference, enabling more robust SKNA monitoring in naturalistic,
movement-rich environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前Text-to-SQL方法在工业级数据库和涉及领域特定业务逻辑的复杂问题上执行准确率较低，需要改进

Method: 采用两种管道：(1) 基于上下文学习的语言强化学习框架，使用开源和闭源大语言模型作为骨干；(2) 思维链强化学习管道，使用小型骨干模型和专门设计的奖励函数进行两阶段强化学习

Result: 在Spider、Spider 2.0和BIRD基准测试中达到SOTA，Spider2.0-SQLite基准上verbal-RL管道比SOTA高7.4%，CoT管道高1.4%

Conclusion: PaVeRL-SQL在现实工业约束下提供了可靠、SOTA级别的Text-to-SQL性能，混合SQL方言的强化训练带来三倍增益

Abstract: Text-to-SQL models allow users to interact with a database more easily by
generating executable SQL statements from natural-language questions. Despite
recent successes on simpler databases and questions, current Text-to-SQL
methods still suffer from low execution accuracy on industry-scale databases
and complex questions involving domain-specific business logic. We present
\emph{PaVeRL-SQL}, a framework that combines \emph{Partial-Match Rewards} and
\emph{Verbal Reinforcement Learning} to drive self-improvement in reasoning
language models (RLMs) for Text-to-SQL. To handle practical use cases, we adopt
two pipelines: (1) a newly designed in-context learning framework with group
self-evaluation (verbal-RL), using capable open- and closed-source large
language models (LLMs) as backbones; and (2) a chain-of-thought (CoT) RL
pipeline with a small backbone model (OmniSQL-7B) trained with a specially
designed reward function and two-stage RL. These pipelines achieve
state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on popular Text-to-SQL benchmarks -- Spider,
Spider 2.0, and BIRD. For the industrial-level Spider2.0-SQLite benchmark, the
verbal-RL pipeline achieves an execution accuracy 7.4\% higher than SOTA, and
the CoT pipeline is 1.4\% higher. RL training with mixed SQL dialects yields
strong, threefold gains, particularly for dialects with limited training data.
Overall, \emph{PaVeRL-SQL} delivers reliable, SOTA Text-to-SQL under realistic
industrial constraints. The code is available at

Motivation: 每年数百万人通过法律援助热线、办公室或律师转介服务寻求法律帮助，错误分类会导致严重后果（错过截止日期、遭受虐待、失去住房或子女监护权等），需要准确的法律问题分类来确保用户连接到正确的法律帮助。

Method: 采用混合LLM/ML集成分类方法，结合自动生成后续问题来丰富初始问题叙述，使用包含419个真实查询的新数据集进行评估。

Result: 分类准确率（hits@2）达到97.37%，使用低成本模型组合超越了当前最先进的GPT-5模型的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法在显著降低法律系统用户引导成本的同时实现了高准确性，有望改善法律帮助服务的匹配效率。

Abstract: Each year millions of people seek help for their legal problems by calling a
legal aid program hotline, walking into a legal aid office, or using a lawyer
referral service. The first step to match them to the right help is to identify
the legal problem the applicant is experiencing. Misdirection has consequences.
Applicants may miss a deadline, experience physical abuse, lose housing or lose
custody of children while waiting to connect to the right legal help. We
introduce and evaluate the FETCH classifier for legal issue classification and
describe two methods for improving accuracy: a hybrid LLM/ML ensemble
classification method, and the automatic generation of follow-up questions to
enrich the initial problem narrative. We employ a novel data set of 419
real-world queries to a nonprofit lawyer referral service. Ultimately, we show
classification accuracy (hits@2) of 97.37\% using a mix of inexpensive models,
exceeding the performance of the current state-of-the-art GPT-5 model. Our
approach shows promise in significantly reducing the cost of guiding users of
the legal system to the right resource for their problem while achieving high
accuracy.

Conclusion: CNN-LSTM混合模型能够有效提升智能电网的网络安全防护能力，为应对新兴网络威胁提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: The evolution of the traditional power grid into the "smart grid" has
resulted in a fundamental shift in energy management, which allows the
integration of renewable energy sources with modern communication technology.
However, this interconnection has increased smart grids' vulnerability to
attackers, which might result in privacy breaches, operational interruptions,
and massive outages. The SCADA-based smart grid protocols are critical for
real-time data collection and control, but they are vulnerable to attacks like
unauthorized access and denial of service (DoS). This research proposes a
hybrid deep learning-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) intended to improve
the cybersecurity of smart grids. The suggested model takes advantage of
Convolutional Neural Networks' (CNN) feature extraction capabilities as well as
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks' temporal pattern recognition skills.
DNP3 and IEC104 intrusion detection datasets are employed to train and test our
CNN-LSTM model to recognize and classify the potential cyber threats. Compared
to other deep learning approaches, the results demonstrate considerable
improvements in accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, with a detection
accuracy of 99.70%.

Abstract: BlendedNet is a publicly available aerodynamic dataset of 999 blended wing
body (BWB) geometries. Each geometry is simulated across about nine flight
conditions, yielding 8830 converged RANS cases with the Spalart-Allmaras model
and 9 to 14 million cells per case. The dataset is generated by sampling
geometric design parameters and flight conditions, and includes detailed
pointwise surface quantities needed to study lift and drag. We also introduce
an end-to-end surrogate framework for pointwise aerodynamic prediction. The
pipeline first uses a permutation-invariant PointNet regressor to predict
geometric parameters from sampled surface point clouds, then conditions a
Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) network on the predicted parameters and
flight conditions to predict pointwise coefficients Cp, Cfx, and Cfz.
Experiments show low errors in surface predictions across diverse BWBs.
BlendedNet addresses data scarcity for unconventional configurations and
enables research on data-driven surrogate modeling for aerodynamic design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于大型语言模型的健康监测方案存在的隐私泄露、内存占用高和延迟大等问题

Method: 系统性评估SLMs在健康预测任务中的表现，采用零样本学习、少样本学习和指令微调方法，并在移动设备上部署最佳模型

Result: SLMs能够达到与LLMs相当的性能水平，同时在效率和隐私保护方面有显著优势，但在处理类不平衡和少样本场景中仍面临挑战

Conclusion: SLMs虽然在当前形式下不完美，但是一种有前景的解决方案，有望成为下一代隐私保护健康监测的重要技术

Abstract: Mobile and wearable healthcare monitoring play a vital role in facilitating
timely interventions, managing chronic health conditions, and ultimately
improving individuals' quality of life. Previous studies on large language
models (LLMs) have highlighted their impressive generalization abilities and
effectiveness in healthcare prediction tasks. However, most LLM-based
healthcare solutions are cloud-based, which raises significant privacy concerns
and results in increased memory usage and latency. To address these challenges,
there is growing interest in compact models, Small Language Models (SLMs),
which are lightweight and designed to run locally and efficiently on mobile and
wearable devices. Nevertheless, how well these models perform in healthcare
prediction remains largely unexplored. We systematically evaluated SLMs on
health prediction tasks using zero-shot, few-shot, and instruction fine-tuning
approaches, and deployed the best performing fine-tuned SLMs on mobile devices
to evaluate their real-world efficiency and predictive performance in practical
healthcare scenarios. Our results show that SLMs can achieve performance
comparable to LLMs while offering substantial gains in efficiency and privacy.
However, challenges remain, particularly in handling class imbalance and
few-shot scenarios. These findings highlight SLMs, though imperfect in their
current form, as a promising solution for next-generation, privacy-preserving
healthcare monitoring.

TL;DR: 这篇论文对中间令牌生成的长度是否反映问题难度进行了批判性研究，发现中间迹边长度与问题复杂性只有松散相关，而不是真正的问题适应性计算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对中间令牌生成机制的理解不清，广泛存在将长迹边视为问题适应性计算的偏见。研究者想要重点考察中间令牌序列长度是否真正反映问题难度。

Method: 使用A* 搜索算法的演绎迹边训练变换器模型，这些迹边提供了问题复杂性的精确可验证测量。在简单的自由空间问题和分布外问题上系统评估模型性能。

Result: 发现即使在最简单的任务中，模型也经常产生过长的推理迹边，中间令牌长度与真实A* 迹边长度只有松散相关。相关性仅在问题近似训练分布时出现，表明这是近似回忆而非真正的问题适应性计算。

Conclusion: 中间迹边生成并非适应问题难度，而是受分布距离影响。这些结果挑战了将长序列自动解释为"思考努力"的偏见，对中间令牌机制的理解需要更加谨慎。

Abstract: Intermediate token generation (ITG), where a model produces output before the
solution, has been proposed as a method to improve the performance of language
models on reasoning tasks. While these reasoning traces or Chain of Thoughts
(CoTs) are correlated with performance gains, the mechanisms underlying them
remain unclear. A prevailing assumption in the community has been to
anthropomorphize these tokens as "thinking", treating longer traces as evidence
of higher problem-adaptive computation. In this work, we critically examine
whether intermediate token sequence length reflects or correlates with problem
difficulty. To do so, we train transformer models from scratch on derivational
traces of the A* search algorithm, where the number of operations required to
solve a maze problem provides a precise and verifiable measure of problem
complexity. We first evaluate the models on trivial free-space problems,
finding that even for the simplest tasks, they often produce excessively long
reasoning traces and sometimes fail to generate a solution. We then
systematically evaluate the model on out-of-distribution problems and find that
the intermediate token length and ground truth A* trace length only loosely
correlate. We notice that the few cases where correlation appears are those
where the problems are closer to the training distribution, suggesting that the
effect arises from approximate recall rather than genuine problem-adaptive
computation. This suggests that the inherent computational complexity of the
problem instance is not a significant factor, but rather its distributional
distance from the training data. These results challenge the assumption that
intermediate trace generation is adaptive to problem difficulty and caution
against interpreting longer sequences in systems like R1 as automatically
indicative of "thinking effort".

TL;DR: SATLUTION是首个将LLM代码进化扩展到完整代码库规模的框架，针对SAT问题，通过LLM代理在严格正确性保证下进化求解器，在SAT竞赛中超越了人类设计的获胜者。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受到AlphaEvolve的启发，但AlphaEvolve仅限于数百行代码的孤立内核，需要扩展到包含数百个文件和数万行代码的完整代码库规模。

Method: SATLUTION框架协调LLM代理在严格正确性保证和分布式运行时反馈下直接进化求解器代码库，同时自我进化其进化策略和规则。

Result: 从SAT Competition 2024代码库开始，SATLUTION进化的求解器在SAT Competition 2025中明显优于人类设计的获胜者，并在2024基准测试中超越了2024和2025年的冠军。

Conclusion: 该工作首次证明了LLM可以在完整代码库规模上进行代码进化，并在复杂算法问题上超越人类专家表现。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently shown strong coding abilities,
enabling not only static code generation but also iterative code self-evolving
through agentic frameworks. Recently, AlphaEvolve \cite{novikov2025alphaevolve}
demonstrated that LLM-based coding agents can autonomously improve algorithms
and surpass human experts, with scopes limited to isolated kernels spanning
hundreds of lines of code. Inspired by AlphaEvolve, we present SATLUTION, the
first framework to extend LLM-based code evolution to the full repository
scale, encompassing hundreds of files and tens of thousands of lines of C/C++
code. Targeting Boolean Satisfiability (SAT), the canonical NP-complete problem
and a cornerstone of both theory and applications. SATLUTION orchestrates LLM
agents to directly evolve solver repositories under strict correctness
guarantees and distributed runtime feedback, while simultaneously self-evolving
its own evolution policies and rules. Starting from SAT Competition 2024
codebases and benchmark, SATLUTION evolved solvers that decisively outperformed
the human-designed winners of the SAT Competition 2025, and also surpassed both
2024 and 2025 champions on the 2024 benchmarks.

Motivation: 解决大语言模型进步依赖大量训练数据的基础界领瓶颈，寻找一种无需额外数据的提升方法

Method: 采用游戏论框架下的自我对战（Language Self-Play, LSP）方法，让模型在竞争性游戏中与自身对役，通过强化学习产生更强的策略

Result: 在Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct模型上的实验显示，通过自我对战单独就能显著提升在具有挑战性任务上的性能，效果超过依赖数据的基准方法

Conclusion: 语言自我对战方法为大语言模型的持续改进提供了一种新的途径，能够在不需要额外训练数据的情况下实现性能提升

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced rapidly in recent years, driven by
scale, abundant high-quality training data, and reinforcement learning. Yet
this progress faces a fundamental bottleneck: the need for ever more data from
which models can continue to learn. In this work, we propose a reinforcement
learning approach that removes this dependency by enabling models to improve
without additional data. Our method leverages a game-theoretic framework of
self-play, where a model's capabilities are cast as performance in a
competitive game and stronger policies emerge by having the model play against
itself - a process we call Language Self-Play (LSP). Experiments with
Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct on instruction-following benchmarks show that pretrained
models can not only enhance their performance on challenging tasks through
self-play alone, but can also do so more effectively than data-driven
baselines.

Motivation: 电子表格具有丰富的结构化布局，但手动设计需要大量时间和专业知识。现有自动化布局模型不适合电子表格，因为它们忽视了电子表格的离散网格结构和独特的语义关联

Method: 提出SheetDesigner框架，使用多模态大语言模型，结合规则反射和视觉反射进行组件放置和内容填充，无需训练即可工作

Result: 在3,326个电子表格数据集上，SheetDesigner比5个基线方法性能提升至少22.6%，通过视觉模态能很好处理重叠和平衡问题，但在对齐方面仍需改进

Conclusion: SheetDesigner证明了多模态大语言模型在电子表格布局生成中的有效性，但需要结合规则和视觉反射策略来弥补对齐方面的不足

Abstract: Spreadsheets are critical to data-centric tasks, with rich, structured
layouts that enable efficient information transmission. Given the time and
expertise required for manual spreadsheet layout design, there is an urgent
need for automated solutions. However, existing automated layout models are
ill-suited to spreadsheets, as they often (1) treat components as axis-aligned
rectangles with continuous coordinates, overlooking the inherently discrete,
grid-based structure of spreadsheets; and (2) neglect interrelated semantics,
such as data dependencies and contextual links, unique to spreadsheets. In this
paper, we first formalize the spreadsheet layout generation task, supported by
a seven-criterion evaluation protocol and a dataset of 3,326 spreadsheets. We
then introduce SheetDesigner, a zero-shot and training-free framework using
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) that combines rule and vision
reflection for component placement and content population. SheetDesigner
outperforms five baselines by at least 22.6\%. We further find that through
vision modality, MLLMs handle overlap and balance well but struggle with
alignment, necessitates hybrid rule and visual reflection strategies. Our codes
and data is available at Github.

Conclusion: 神经符号方法可以弥合黑盒预测模型与复杂动态环境中关键决策支持需求之间的差距，特别是在工业物联网赋能的网络物理系统中

Abstract: The integration of Deep Learning (DL) in System Dynamics (SD) modeling for
transportation logistics offers significant advantages in scalability and
predictive accuracy. However, these gains are often offset by the loss of
explainability and causal reliability $-$ key requirements in critical
decision-making systems. This paper presents a novel framework for
interpretable-by-design neural system dynamics modeling that synergizes DL with
techniques from Concept-Based Interpretability, Mechanistic Interpretability,
and Causal Machine Learning. The proposed hybrid approach enables the
construction of neural network models that operate on semantically meaningful
and actionable variables, while retaining the causal grounding and transparency
typical of traditional SD models. The framework is conceived to be applied to
real-world case-studies from the EU-funded project AutoMoTIF, focusing on
data-driven decision support, automation, and optimization of multimodal
logistic terminals. We aim at showing how neuro-symbolic methods can bridge the
gap between black-box predictive models and the need for critical decision
support in complex dynamical environments within cyber-physical systems enabled
by the industrial Internet-of-Things.

Motivation: 解决白盒/灰盒方法不实用和黑盒方法转移性差的问题，提高直接提示注入攻击的效果

Method: 使用代理模型激活值构建能量模型(EBM)评估对抗提示质量，然后通过token级MCMC采样适应性优化攻击提示

Result: 在5个主流LLM上达到49.6%攻击成功率，比人工制作提示提高34.6%，在未见任务上仍保持36.6%成功率

Conclusion: 激活值与攻击效果存在相关性，语义模式在转移性漏洞利用中起关键作用

Abstract: Direct Prompt Injection (DPI) attacks pose a critical security threat to
Large Language Models (LLMs) due to their low barrier of execution and high
potential damage. To address the impracticality of existing white-box/gray-box
methods and the poor transferability of black-box methods, we propose an
activations-guided prompt injection attack framework. We first construct an
Energy-based Model (EBM) using activations from a surrogate model to evaluate
the quality of adversarial prompts. Guided by the trained EBM, we employ the
token-level Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling to adaptively optimize
adversarial prompts, thereby enabling gradient-free black-box attacks.
Experimental results demonstrate our superior cross-model transferability,
achieving 49.6% attack success rate (ASR) across five mainstream LLMs and 34.6%
improvement over human-crafted prompts, and maintaining 36.6% ASR on unseen
task scenarios. Interpretability analysis reveals a correlation between
activations and attack effectiveness, highlighting the critical role of
semantic patterns in transferable vulnerability exploitation.

Conclusion: LLM ATLAS框架为组织LLM采用中的对齐问题提供了概念性解决方案，补充了现有研究在组织过程和信息不对称方面的空白

Abstract: Adopting Large language models (LLMs) in organizations potentially
revolutionizes our lives and work. However, they can generate off-topic,
discriminating, or harmful content. This AI alignment problem often stems from
misspecifications during the LLM adoption, unnoticed by the principal due to
the LLM's black-box nature. While various research disciplines investigated AI
alignment, they neither address the information asymmetries between
organizational adopters and black-box LLM agents nor consider organizational AI
adoption processes. Therefore, we propose LLM ATLAS (LLM Agency Theory-Led
Alignment Strategy) a conceptual framework grounded in agency (contract)
theory, to mitigate alignment problems during organizational LLM adoption. We
conduct a conceptual literature analysis using the organizational LLM adoption
phases and the agency theory as concepts. Our approach results in (1) providing
an extended literature analysis process specific to AI alignment methods during
organizational LLM adoption and (2) providing a first LLM alignment
problem-solution space.

Motivation: 现有神经符号AI框架（如DeepProbLog）采用固定的神经处理后接符号推理的流程，无法处理复杂依赖关系特别是图结构数据，限制了建模能力。

Method: 扩展ProbLog引入图神经网络谓词，将符号表示视为图结构，允许神经和符号组件以任意顺序分层处理，支持图神经网络处理符号推理。

Conclusion: DeepGraphLog通过将神经符号AI扩展到图结构领域，提供了一个更表达性和灵活的神经符号集成框架。

Abstract: Neurosymbolic AI (NeSy) aims to integrate the statistical strengths of neural
networks with the interpretability and structure of symbolic reasoning.
However, current NeSy frameworks like DeepProbLog enforce a fixed flow where
symbolic reasoning always follows neural processing. This restricts their
ability to model complex dependencies, especially in irregular data structures
such as graphs. In this work, we introduce DeepGraphLog, a novel NeSy framework
that extends ProbLog with Graph Neural Predicates. DeepGraphLog enables
multi-layer neural-symbolic reasoning, allowing neural and symbolic components
to be layered in arbitrary order. In contrast to DeepProbLog, which cannot
handle symbolic reasoning via neural methods, DeepGraphLog treats symbolic
representations as graphs, enabling them to be processed by Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs). We showcase the capabilities of DeepGraphLog on tasks in
planning, knowledge graph completion with distant supervision, and GNN
expressivity. Our results demonstrate that DeepGraphLog effectively captures
complex relational dependencies, overcoming key limitations of existing NeSy
systems. By broadening the applicability of neurosymbolic AI to
graph-structured domains, DeepGraphLog offers a more expressive and flexible
framework for neural-symbolic integration.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在推理过程中容易生成错误内容，现有自我修正方法存在两个关键局限：缺乏可靠的错误定位信号，以及受限于传统next-token解码的浅层推理深度。

Method: 提出Feedback-Triggered Regeneration (FTR)框架，结合用户反馈和增强解码动态。仅在收到负面用户反馈时激活响应再生，避免错误传播。引入Long-Term Multipath (LTM)解码，通过延迟序列评估实现多路径推理轨迹的系统探索。

Result: 在数学推理和代码生成基准测试中，该框架相比最先进的基于提示的自我修正方法取得了持续且显著的改进。

Conclusion: FTR框架通过整合用户反馈和增强解码策略，有效解决了LLM自我修正的关键挑战，为提升模型推理可靠性提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across
diverse tasks, yet their susceptibility to generating incorrect content during
inference remains a critical unsolved challenge. While self-correction methods
offer potential solutions, their effectiveness is hindered by two inherent
limitations: (1) the absence of reliable guidance signals for error
localization, and (2) the restricted reasoning depth imposed by conventional
next-token decoding paradigms. To address these issues, we propose
Feedback-Triggered Regeneration (FTR), a novel framework that synergizes user
feedback with enhanced decoding dynamics. Specifically, FTR activates response
regeneration only upon receiving negative user feedback, thereby circumventing
error propagation from faulty self-assessment while preserving originally
correct outputs. Furthermore, we introduce Long-Term Multipath (LTM) decoding,
which enables systematic exploration of multiple reasoning trajectories through
delayed sequence evaluation, effectively overcoming the myopic decision-making
characteristic of standard next-token prediction. Extensive experiments on
mathematical reasoning and code generation benchmarks demonstrate that our
framework achieves consistent and significant improvements over
state-of-the-art prompt-based self-correction methods.

Result: 对10个前沿LLM（包括GPT-4o和Gemini 2.5 Flash）的测试显示，虽然这些系统在旧基准上表现出色，但在RIMO上的性能急剧下降。

Conclusion: RIMO提供了一个具有挑战性且易于评估的测试套件，揭示了当前LLM能力与实际奥林匹克级别推理之间的显著差距，为未来研究提供了高分辨率的标准。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) reach high scores on established mathematical
benchmarks, such as GSM8K and MATH, the research community has turned to
International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) problems to push the evaluation
frontier. However, existing Olympiad-level benchmarks suffer from practical
constraints that introduce grading noise and potential bias, such as
heterogeneous answer formats requiring model-based judges and a reliance on
potentially flawed solutions. We introduce RIMO, a two-track benchmark designed
to preserve peak Olympiad difficulty while eliminating this evaluation noise.
The first track, RIMO-N, rewrites 335 IMO problems to admit a single, unique
integer answer, allowing for deterministic correctness checking. The second
track, RIMO-P, features 456 proof problems with expert-checked solutions, which
are decomposed into a sequence of sub-problems to evaluate the step-by-step
reasoning process via an automated grading system. Our benchmarking of ten
frontier LLMs, including GPT-4o and Gemini 2.5 Flash, reveals that while these
systems excel on older benchmarks, their performance drops sharply on RIMO.
These results highlight a substantial gap between current LLM capabilities and
actual Olympiad-level reasoning. By providing a challenging yet
easy-to-evaluate suite, RIMO offers a high-resolution yardstick for future
research, presenting a clear target for closing the profound reasoning gap our
findings expose.

Abstract: Background: Parkinson's disease remains a major neurodegenerative disorder
with high misdiagnosis rates, primarily due to reliance on clinical rating
scales. Recent studies have demonstrated a strong association between gut
microbiota and Parkinson's disease, suggesting that microbial composition may
serve as a promising biomarker. Although deep learning models based ongut
microbiota show potential for early prediction, most approaches rely on single
classifiers and often overlook inter-strain correlations or temporal dynamics.
Therefore, there is an urgent need for more robust feature extraction methods
tailored to microbiome data. Methods: We proposed BDPM (A Machine
Learning-Based Feature Extractor for Parkinson's Disease Classification via Gut
Microbiota Analysis). First, we collected gut microbiota profiles from 39
Parkinson's patients and their healthy spouses to identify differentially
abundant taxa. Second, we developed an innovative feature selection framework
named RFRE (Random Forest combined with Recursive Feature Elimination),
integrating ecological knowledge to enhance biological interpretability.
Finally, we designed a hybrid classification model to capture temporal and
spatial patterns in microbiome data.

Abstract: Environmental sustainability, particularly in relation to climate change, is
a key concern for consumers, producers, and policymakers. The carbon footprint,
based on greenhouse gas emissions, is a standard metric for quantifying the
contribution to climate change of activities and is often assessed using life
cycle assessment (LCA). However, conducting LCA is complex due to opaque and

### [139] [Certainty-Guided Reasoning in Large Language Models: A Dynamic Thinking Budget Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07820)
*João Paulo Nogueira,Wentao Sun,Alonso Silva,Laith Zumot*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出Certainty-Guided Reasoning (CGR)方法，通过critic模型动态评估推理置信度，在达到目标置信阈值时终止推理，平衡效率与可靠性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理语言模型(LRLMs)需要预定义推理token数量，但固定预算无法适应不同问题的推理复杂度，需要更自适应的推理终止机制

Method: 受GAN生成器/判别器框架启发，使用critic模型定期评估自身推理置信度，达到目标置信阈值时终止，否则继续推理

Result: 在AIME2024和AIME2025数据集上，CGR提高基线准确率同时减少token使用；64次多种子评估显示稳定性提升，减少方差；可节省数百万token

Conclusion: 置信度是推理充分性的有力信号，CGR使大型推理语言模型更具适应性、可信性和资源效率，为实际部署铺平道路

Abstract: The rise of large reasoning language models (LRLMs) has unlocked new
potential for solving complex tasks. These models operate with a thinking
budget, that is, a predefined number of reasoning tokens used to arrive at a
solution. We propose a novel approach, inspired by the generator/discriminator
framework in generative adversarial networks, in which a critic model
periodically probes its own reasoning to assess whether it has reached a
confident conclusion. If not, reasoning continues until a target certainty
threshold is met. This mechanism adaptively balances efficiency and reliability
by allowing early termination when confidence is high, while encouraging
further reasoning when uncertainty persists. Through experiments on the
AIME2024 and AIME2025 datasets, we show that Certainty-Guided Reasoning (CGR)
improves baseline accuracy while reducing token usage. Importantly, extended
multi-seed evaluations over 64 runs demonstrate that CGR is stable, reducing
variance across seeds and improving exam-like performance under penalty-based
grading. Additionally, our token savings analysis shows that CGR can eliminate
millions of tokens in aggregate, with tunable trade-offs between certainty
thresholds and efficiency. Together, these findings highlight certainty as a
powerful signal for reasoning sufficiency. By integrating confidence into the
reasoning process, CGR makes large reasoning language models more adaptive,
trustworthy, and resource efficient, paving the way for practical deployment in
domains where both accuracy and computational cost matter.

*Amay Jain,Liu Cui,Si Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究比较了矩阵基于检索和图基于检索两种RAG方案在教育领域的性能，发现动态分支框架可以根据查询类型选择最优检索方法，提高回答准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在教室中应用时经常提供过时或虚构信息，RAG技术可以通过外部资源基础提高可靠性，但现有研究缺乏对教育特定因素的考虑。

Method: 使用新的EduScopeQA数据集（3,176个问题）测试两种RAG方案：OpenAI Vector Search RAG（矩阵基于）和GraphRAG（图基于），评估它们在不同教育学科、问题类型和供给改变的课本上的表现。

Result: OpenAI Vector Search RAG在低成本实例检索中表现良好，GraphRAG Global在主题性查询中提供丰富教学回答，GraphRAG Local在资源整合性关键时准确性最高。动态分支框架可提升效果。

Conclusion: 根据查询类型选择适当的RAG方案可以最大化教育效果，为教育工作者提供了可行性指南。

Abstract: Large language models like ChatGPT are increasingly used in classrooms, but
they often provide outdated or fabricated information that can mislead
students. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) improves reliability of LLMs by
grounding responses in external resources. We investigate two accessible RAG
paradigms, vector-based retrieval and graph-based retrieval to identify best
practices for classroom question answering (QA). Existing comparative studies
fail to account for pedagogical factors such as educational disciplines,
question types, and practical deployment costs. Using a novel dataset,
EduScopeQA, of 3,176 questions across academic subjects, we measure performance
on various educational query types, from specific facts to broad thematic
discussions. We also evaluate system alignment with a dataset of systematically
altered textbooks that contradict the LLM's latent knowledge. We find that
OpenAI Vector Search RAG (representing vector-based RAG) performs well as a
low-cost generalist, especially for quick fact retrieval. On the other hand,
GraphRAG Global excels at providing pedagogically rich answers to thematic
queries, and GraphRAG Local achieves the highest accuracy with the dense,
altered textbooks when corpus integrity is critical. Accounting for the 10-20x
higher resource usage of GraphRAG (representing graph-based RAG), we show that
a dynamic branching framework that routes queries to the optimal retrieval
method boosts fidelity and efficiency. These insights provide actionable
guidelines for educators and system designers to integrate RAG-augmented LLMs
into learning environments effectively.

TL;DR: 通过迭代自分隔技术，使用7B小规模开源LLMs成为高质量代码指令数据合成器，减少对专有大模型的依赖和成本


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代码大语言模型依赖于从专有LLMs分隔的大规模指令数据进行微调，成本较高，需要寻找替代方案

Method: 提出迭代自分隔方法：1)多检查点采样和多方面评分策略选择初始数据；2)基于梯度的影响估计方法进行最终数据过滤，识别最具影响力的样本

Result: 基于小规模合成器构建的代码指令数据集，开发了SCoder代码生成模型家族，达到了状态前沿的代码生成能力

Conclusion: 小规模开源LLMs通过适当训练可以成为高质量代码指令数据合成器，SCoder模垅的成功证明了该方法的有效性

Abstract: Existing code large language models (LLMs) often rely on large-scale
instruction data distilled from proprietary LLMs for fine-tuning, which
typically incurs high costs. In this paper, we explore the potential of
small-scale open-source LLMs (e.g., 7B) as synthesizers for high-quality code
instruction data construction. We first observe that the data synthesis
capability of small-scale LLMs can be enhanced by training on a few superior
data synthesis samples from proprietary LLMs. Building on this, we propose a
novel iterative self-distillation approach to bootstrap small-scale LLMs,
transforming them into powerful synthesizers that reduce reliance on
proprietary LLMs and minimize costs. Concretely, in each iteration, to obtain
diverse and high-quality self-distilled data, we design multi-checkpoint
sampling and multi-aspect scoring strategies for initial data selection.
Furthermore, to identify the most influential samples, we introduce a
gradient-based influence estimation method for final data filtering. Based on
the code instruction datasets from the small-scale synthesizers, we develop
SCoder, a family of code generation models fine-tuned from DeepSeek-Coder.
SCoder models achieve state-of-the-art code generation capabilities,
demonstrating the effectiveness of our method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 约束编程建模语言复杂、全局约束众多、建模技巧要求高，阻碍了非专家用户使用CP解决组合问题，需要一种简化建模过程的方法

Method: 利用多年积累的专家编写模型库，基于用户自然语言描述从数据库中检索最接近的源代码模型，无需人工数据标注

Result: 实验显示系统在不同专业水平的用户问题描述下，能够以优秀准确率检索到正确的模型

Conclusion: CP-Model-Zoo通过利用专家验证的模型库，有效降低了非专家用户使用约束编程的门槛，实现了高质量模型的自动检索

Abstract: Constraint Programming and its high-level modeling languages have long been
recognized for their potential to achieve the holy grail of problem-solving.
However, the complexity of modeling languages, the large number of global
constraints, and the art of creating good models have often hindered
non-experts from choosing CP to solve their combinatorial problems. While
generating an expert-level model from a natural-language description of a
problem would be the dream, we are not yet there. We propose a tutoring system
called CP-Model-Zoo, exploiting expert-written models accumulated through the
years. CP-Model-Zoo retrieves the closest source code model from a database
based on a user's natural language description of a combinatorial problem. It
ensures that expert-validated models are presented to the user while
eliminating the need for human data labeling. Our experiments show excellent
accuracy in retrieving the correct model based on a user-input description of a
problem simulated with different levels of expertise.

TL;DR: HiPhO是首个专门针对高中物理奥林匹克竞赛的基准测试，提供人类对齐的评估，包含13个最新竞赛试题、专业评分标准和与人类选手的直接比较。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有物理基准测试缺乏对真实物理竞赛的系统覆盖，且无法与人类表现直接比较，需要构建一个更全面、人类对齐的评估体系。

Method: 收集2024-2025年13个国际和地区奥赛试题，采用官方评分标准进行细粒度评分，基于奖牌阈值对模型进行奖牌等级评定。

Result: 开源MLLM大多处于铜牌水平；开源LLM偶尔获得金牌；闭源推理MLLM可获得6-12枚金牌；所有模型距离满分仍有较大差距。

Conclusion: 开源模型与顶尖学生存在显著性能差距，闭源推理模型展现强大物理推理能力，物理推理仍有很大改进空间。

Abstract: Recently, the physical capabilities of (M)LLMs have garnered increasing
attention. However, existing benchmarks for physics suffer from two major gaps:
they neither provide systematic and up-to-date coverage of real-world physics
competitions such as physics Olympiads, nor enable direct performance
comparison with humans. To bridge these gaps, we present HiPhO, the first
benchmark dedicated to high school physics Olympiads with human-aligned
evaluation. Specifically, HiPhO highlights three key innovations. (1)
Comprehensive Data: It compiles 13 latest Olympiad exams from 2024-2025,
spanning both international and regional competitions, and covering mixed
modalities that encompass problems spanning text-only to diagram-based. (2)
Professional Evaluation: We adopt official marking schemes to perform
fine-grained grading at both the answer and step level, fully aligned with
human examiners to ensure high-quality and domain-specific evaluation. (3)
Comparison with Human Contestants: We assign gold, silver, and bronze medals to
models based on official medal thresholds, thereby enabling direct comparison
between (M)LLMs and human contestants. Our large-scale evaluation of 30
state-of-the-art (M)LLMs shows that: across 13 exams, open-source MLLMs mostly
remain at or below the bronze level; open-source LLMs show promising progress
with occasional golds; closed-source reasoning MLLMs can achieve 6 to 12 gold
medals; and most models still have a significant gap from full marks. These
results highlight a substantial performance gap between open-source models and
top students, the strong physical reasoning capabilities of closed-source
reasoning models, and the fact that there is still significant room for
improvement. HiPhO, as a rigorous, human-aligned, and Olympiad-focused
benchmark for advancing multimodal physical reasoning, is open-source and
available at https://github.com/SciYu/HiPhO.

Abstract: We develop new experimental paradigms for measuring welfare in language
models. We compare verbal reports of models about their preferences with
preferences expressed through behavior when navigating a virtual environment
and selecting conversation topics. We also test how costs and rewards affect
behavior and whether responses to an eudaimonic welfare scale - measuring
states such as autonomy and purpose in life - are consistent across
semantically equivalent prompts. Overall, we observed a notable degree of
mutual support between our measures. The reliable correlations observed between
stated preferences and behavior across conditions suggest that preference
satisfaction can, in principle, serve as an empirically measurable welfare
proxy in some of today's AI systems. Furthermore, our design offered an
illuminating setting for qualitative observation of model behavior. Yet, the
consistency between measures was more pronounced in some models and conditions
than others and responses were not consistent across perturbations. Due to
this, and the background uncertainty about the nature of welfare and the
cognitive states (and welfare subjecthood) of language models, we are currently
uncertain whether our methods successfully measure the welfare state of
language models. Nevertheless, these findings highlight the feasibility of
welfare measurement in language models, inviting further exploration.

Method: 基于sigma-代数概念构建隐私保护计数查询框架，通过代数结构保持查询间的逻辑关系

Result: 新方法能显著提高输出精度，在保持相同隐私水平的同时支持大规模查询，并能维持嵌套查询的总序特性

Conclusion: sigma-counting方法有效解决了传统差分隐私在计数查询中的局限性，为大规模数据应用提供了更好的隐私保护解决方案

Abstract: Many data applications involve counting queries, where a client specifies a
feasible range of variables and a database returns the corresponding item
counts. A program that produces the counts of different queries often risks
leaking sensitive individual-level information. A popular approach to enhance
data privacy is to return a noisy version of the actual count. It is typically
achieved by adding independent noise to each query and then control the total
privacy budget within a period. This approach may be limited in the number of
queries and output accuracy in practice. Also, the returned counts do not
maintain the total order for nested queries, an important feature in many
applications. This work presents the design and analysis of a new method,
sigma-counting, that addresses these challenges. Sigma-counting uses the notion
of sigma-algebra to construct privacy-preserving counting queries. We show that
the proposed concepts and methods can significantly improve output accuracy
while maintaining a desired privacy level in the presence of massive queries to
the same data. We also discuss how the technique can be applied to address
large and time-varying datasets.

Conclusion: 该研究在数据集成领域具有直接应用价值

Abstract: Traditional relational databases require users to manually specify join keys
and assume exact matches between column names and values. In practice, this
limits joinability across fragmented or inconsistently named tables. We propose
a fuzzy join framework that automatically identifies joinable column pairs and
traverses indirect (multi-hop) join paths across multiple databases. Our method
combines column name similarity with row-level fuzzy value overlap, computes
edge weights using negative log-transformed Jaccard scores, and performs join
path discovery via graph traversal. Experiments on synthetic healthcare-style
databases demonstrate the system's ability to recover valid joins despite
fuzzified column names and partial value mismatches. This research has direct
applications in data integration.

Conclusion: 该研究为FANNS领域提供了系统的分析框架和公平的评测标准，有助于理解各算法的优势区域，促进了可复现的研究进展

Abstract: For a given dataset $\mathcal{D}$ and structured label $f$, the goal of
Filtered Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (FANNS) algorithms is to find
top-$k$ points closest to a query that satisfy label constraints, while
ensuring both recall and QPS (Queries Per Second). In recent years, many FANNS
algorithms have been proposed. However, the lack of a systematic investigation
makes it difficult to understand their relative strengths and weaknesses.
Additionally, we found that: (1) FANNS algorithms have coupled,
dataset-dependent parameters, leading to biased comparisons. (2) Key impact
factors are rarely analyzed systematically, leaving unclear when each algorithm
performs well. (3) Disparate datasets, workloads, and biased experiment designs
make cross-algorithm comparisons unreliable. Thus, a comprehensive survey and
benchmark for FANNS is crucial to achieve the following goals: designing a fair
evaluation and clarifying the classification of algorithms, conducting in-depth
analysis of their performance, and establishing a unified benchmark. First, we
propose a taxonomy (dividing methods into \textit{filter-then-search},
\textit{search-then-filter}, \textit{hybrid-search}) and a systematic
evaluation framework, integrating unified parameter tuning and standardized
filtering across algorithms to reduce implementation-induced performance
variations and reflect core trade-offs. Then, we conduct a comprehensive
empirical study to analyze how query difficulty and dataset properties impact
performance, evaluating robustness under pressures like filter selectivity,
Recall@k, and scalability to clarify each method's strengths. Finally, we
establish a standardized benchmark with real-world datasets and open-source
related resources to ensure reproducible future research.
